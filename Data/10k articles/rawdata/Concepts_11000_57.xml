'''Ahmet Güneştekin''' (born December 22, 1966) is a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] visual artist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/world/middleeast/sifting-through-anatolias-dark-sins-and-bright-cultures.html&lt;/ref&gt; whose works span [[painting]], [[conceptual art]] and constructions [[sculpture]]. For Ahmet Güneştekin, a self-taught artist, art is a passion which has driven him since his childhood. He left the town of Batman for Istanbul in 1991, but had to wait several years before he found his own style at the beginning of the 2000s. He then abandoned the figurative to launch himself into a “narrative abstraction”. This kind of production is loaded with the recollection of a vernacular art, the memory of motifs such as carpets, lamps, Ottoman copperware in which geometry is the leading force.

Güneştekin uses a unique technique with an individual method and precision. After establishing a complex web of black [[acrylic paint]], he fills each of the small spaces with a layer of oil paint, ranging from the light to the dark. Then, using a sort of pen with a rubber tip, he engraves into the paint, and writes as a [[calligrapher]] would on a book. He writes on his paintings by removing material, a principle which has more in common with [[sculpture]] than [[painting]].

After the agreement he signed with the London-based [[Marlborough Gallery]] – one of the world’s top five reputable galleries – in 2013, Ahmet Güneştekin made room for himself in the international art market.  Marlborough’s first move was to open an exhibition in the same timeframe as the 55th [[Venice Biennial]]. When Massimiliano Gioni, listed Güneştekin’s ‟Momentum of Memory” exhibition among the ‟Top 10 exhibitions to see,” the media couldn’t remain indifferent. Güneştekin’s works appeared in high circulation Italian dailies such as [[Il Manifesto]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ilmanifesto.info/il-passato-oscuro/&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Repubblica]], [[La Stampa]]. Naturally, his works drew the attention of the art circle.  
         
In November 2013, [[Marlborough Gallery]] opened its doors in New York to Güneştekin. After making a flamboyant introduction for Güneştekin with a solo exhibition, “Ahmet Güneştekin: Recent Paintings” between 26 November and 4 January 2014, Marlborough Gallery prepared an intensive program for 2014. The exhibitions that began in January with Arco Madrid was followed by the New York [[Armory Show]], Art Breda, and [[Art Basel]] Hong Kong. Afterward Marlborough Monaco Gallery opened a solo exhibition by Ahmet Güneştekin from 18 September to 14 November. His works are on display at the Marlborough Galleries in Barcelona, Madrid, Monaco and New York at their permanent exhibition halls all the year round.

Güneştekin’s works can be briefly described as the interpretation of the oral narratives, [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] from [[Ancient Anatolians|Anatolian]], [[Mesopotamian]] and Greek civilizations using free technique. He creates [[optical]] and vibrant works, with the solar disc as one of his occurring motifs. The figurative way of expression is present in all his oeuvres, even though in an abstract stylized way. In all his contemporaneous works, the characters, symbols and scenes are taken out of ancient times, and these characters are symbolic, woven in symbolic tales about the essential questions of mankind.

== Style and Technique ==

Ahmet Güneştekin realizes his works by adopting diverse methods. Gradient optics, dimensional canvases, flat canvases, sun explosions and installations expose his main approach that is to stay out of conventional practices applied on canvas. His art works are composed of charming colours, intricately combined layers, and the tales of the [[ancient times]]. The Kurdish artist thinks that [[mythology]] is the source of all beginnings. Yedizim, as of a dualist religion, has first emerged in the ancient [[Mesopotamia]], rests on the belief that people make distinctions between the good and the evil. The narratives of the culture and its peculiar imitations spontaneously offer precise choices.

However, Güneştekin aims not only to convey messages, also he tries to reveal his own mythology and truths, by expressing himself painting and narrating the diversity of the culture. The characters of the myths he draw are also the ancient characters of the [[Greek mythology]]. For Güneştekin, there actually appears no difference between Shahmeran, one of the ancient mythological creatures of Mesopotamia and [[Medusa]] in Greek mythology. The effect of embroidery can be best observed in artist’s recent paintings. The drawings and the circles are combined in one geometric structure, and the uses of the colours radically effect the eye. They also provide a narrative, for the symbols and emotions put forward all these elements in the paintings. The refined and meticulously cultivated colour palettes and drawings which they have comprised in harmony are the base of Güneştekin’s works.

[[Mesopotamia]], where the artist was born, and [[Anatolia]], the [[mythological creatures]] such as Phoenix or the [[Peacock Angel]], form Güneştekin’s most important source of inspiration. The glowing sun marks his peculiar signature. His method of oil painting is a model that reveals itself in adopting embroiderer’s patient work that is to knit and adorn, and to make a drawing model out of it. The diverse uses of the light, the thickness of the lines and the colours, and their density pave the way to gross geometric forms. His oil paintings are the outcome of a hard and dense work process, and give the impression that they are magnified by sculpturing. His colossal works and his paintings resemble the historical art works that are consist of archaeological fragments and figures. However, the most enchanting form he adopts is the glitter of his genuine light globes.

== Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters ==

Ahmet Güneştekin traced and compiled ancient [[myths]], oral narratives and [[legend]]s of [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as of 1997. He took excursions to the villages and towns of Anatolia and Mesopotamia and conducted in-depth researches since 2003. He set up art exhibitions in the historical sights and public spaces together with many artists from contemporary art, sculpture and photography. The series of the exhibition titled ''Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters'' brought about his first major exhibition, ''The Colors after Darkness''.

== Documentary Films ==

Güneştekin became the art director of the news show Haberci, produced and directed by [[Coşkun Aral]] in 2005. Afterwards he produces his own documentary series titled ''Following the Traces of the Sun'' for [[TRT 1]] and the series came to be the first [[documentary films]] to focus on art in Turkey.

== Children's Art Classes ==

In his excursions to Anatolia and Mesopotamia, Ahmet Güneştekin provided painting classes to the children so that they can learn how to express themselves in [[visual arts]]. In classes, Güneştekin taught children about art concepts and techniques by exposing them to many different kinds of [[art materials]]. Güneştekin met over 5,000 children and introduced them the world of painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6257">'''Analytical quality control''', commonly shortened to '''AQC''' refers to all those processes and procedures designed to ensure that the results of [[laboratory]] [[analysis]] are consistent, comparable, [[accuracy|accurate]] and within specified limits of [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemex.co.uk/quality/aqc/program analytical quality control (AQC) program to ensure the highest level of confidence in reported data] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328092425/http://www.chemex.co.uk/quality/aqc/program |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constituents submitted to the analytical laboratory must be accurately described to avoid faulty interpretations, approximations, or incorrect results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region6/qa/qadevtools/mod4references/analytical_references/qc_handbook.pdf HANDBOOK FOR ANALYTICAL QUALITY CONTROL IN WATER AND WASTEWATER LABORATORIES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114000648/http://www.epa.gov/region6/qa/qadevtools/mod4references/analytical_references/qc_handbook.pdf |date=November 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualitative and quantitative data generated from the laboratory can then be used for decision making. In the chemical sense, quantitative analysis refers to the measurement of the amount or concentration of an element or chemical compound in a matrix that differs from the element or compound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull153/15305001719.pdf An IAEA Service: Analytical Quality Control] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001839/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull153/15305001719.pdf |date=November 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields such as industry, medicine, and law enforcement can make use of AQC.

==In the laboratory==
AQC processes are of particular importance in laboratories analysing environmental samples where the concentration of chemical species present may be extremely low and close to the detection limit of the analytical method. In well managed laboratories, AQC processes are built into the routine operations of the laboratory often by the random introduction of known standards into the sample stream or by the use of spiked samples.

Quality control begins with sample collection and ends with the reporting of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/publications/documents/guidancelaboratories.pdf TECHNICAL REPORT: GUIDANCE TO OPERATION OF WATER QUALITY LABORATORIES]&lt;/ref&gt; AQC is achieved through laboratory control of analytical performance. Initial control of the complete system can be achieved through specification of laboratory services, instrumentation, glassware, reagents, solvents, and gases. However, evaluation of daily performance must be documented to ensure continual production of valid data. A check should first be done to ensure that the data should be seen is precise and accurate. Next, systematic daily checks such as analysing blanks, calibration standards, quality control check samples, and references must be performed to establish the reproducibility of the data. The checks help certify that the methodology is measuring what is in the sample.

The quality of individual AQC efforts can be variable depending on the training, professional pride, and importance of a particular project to a particular analyst. The burden of an individual analyst originating AQC efforts can be lessened through the implementation of quality assurance programs. Through the implementation of established and routine quality assurance programs, two primary functions are fulfilled: the determination of quality, and the control of quality. By monitoring the accuracy and precision of results, the quality assurance program should increase confidence in the reliability of the reported analytical results, thereby achieving adequate AQC.

==Pharmaceutical industry==
Validation of analytical procedures is imperative in demonstrating that a drug substance is suitable for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Quality/Q2_R1/Step4/Q2_R1__Guideline.pdf VALIDATION OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES: TEXT AND METHODOLOGY]&lt;/ref&gt; Common validation characteristics include: accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range, and robustness. In cases such as changes in synthesis of the drug substance, changes in composition of the finished product, and changes in the analytical procedure, revalidation is necessary to ensure quality control.

All analytical procedures should be validated. Identification tests are conducted to ensure the identity of an analyte in a sample through comparison of the sample to a reference standard through methods such as spectrum, chromatographic behavior, and chemical reactivity.&lt;ref name=validation /&gt; Impurity testing can either be a quantitative test or a limit test. Both tests should accurately measure the purity of the sample. Quantitative tests of either the active moiety or other components of a sample can be conducted through assay procedures. Other analytical procedures such as dissolution testing or particle size determination may also need to be validated and are equally important.

==Statistics==
Because of the complex inter-relationship between analytical method, sample concentration, limits of detection and method precision, the management of Analytical Quality Control is undertaken using a statistical approach to determine whether the results obtained lie within an acceptable statistical envelope.

==Inter-laboratory calibration==
In circumstances where more than one laboratory is analysing samples and feeding data into a large programme of work such as the [[Harmonised monitoring scheme]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], AQC can also be applied to validate one laboratory against another. In such cases the work may be referred to as '''inter-laboratory calibration'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F. (1990). Critical Terms for [[Literary criticism|Literary Study]]. Chicago: [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]] press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apatrapya''' (Sanskrit, also ''apatrāpya''; Pali: ''ottappa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''khrel yod pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "decorum"  or "shame". It is defined as shunning unwholesome actions so as to not be reproached by others of good character.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 528-531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is apatrapya? It is to avoid what is objectionable in the eyes of others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

The difference between [[Hri (Buddhism)|hri]] (self-respect) and ''apatrapya'' (decorum) is that ''hri'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions due to one's own conscious, while ''apatrapya'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions to avoid being reproached by others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eric1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom of countability''' is a property of certain [[mathematical object]]s (usually in a [[Category (mathematics)|category]]) that asserts the existence of a [[countable|countable set]] with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist.

==Important examples==
Important countability axioms for [[topological space]]s include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Modern General Topology|series=North-Holland Mathematical Library|first=J.-I.|last=Nagata|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier|year=1985|isbn=9780080933795|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecvd8dCAQp0C&amp;pg=PA104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[sequential space]]: a set is open if every [[sequence]] [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] to a [[point (geometry)|point]] in the set is eventually in the set
*[[first-countable space]]: every point has a countable [[neighbourhood system|neighbourhood basis]] (local  base)
*[[second-countable space]]: the topology has a countable [[base (topology)|base]]
*[[separable space]]: there exists a countable [[dense (topology)|dense]] subset
*[[Lindelöf space]]: every [[open cover]] has a countable [[subcover]]
*[[σ-compact space]]: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

==Relationships with each other==
These axioms are related to each other in the following ways:
*Every first countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*Every [[metric space]] is first countable.
*For metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Aristotle]], whose ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' contained an early discussion of this fallacy]]
'''Begging the question''' is a [[logical fallacy]] that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of [[circular reasoning]] and an [[informal fallacy]]: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.

The phrase ''begging the question'' originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}},'' which actually translates to "assuming the initial point".&lt;ref name="Liberman"/&gt; In modern [[vernacular]] usage, "begging the question" is frequently&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/begging-the-question-again/|title=Begging the Question, Again|last=Corbett|first=Philip B.|date=1222390395|website=After Deadline Blog|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to mean "raising the question" or "[[Question dodging|dodging the question]]".&lt;ref name="Liberman"/&gt; In contexts that demand strict adherence to a technical definition of the term, many consider these usages incorrect.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/begging-the-question-again/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |title=Begging the Question, Again |first=Philip B. |last=Corbett |date=25 September 2008 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
: Africa is the largest continent because it has the largest area of any continent.
: Left-handed people are better painters because right-handed people can't paint as well.

Both these arguments are logically valid in that, assuming the initial premise is correct, the conclusion logically follows. But they are nonetheless unpersuasive because assuming the initial premise to be correct also means assuming the conclusion is correct.

== History ==
The original phrase used by [[Aristotle]] from which ''begging the question'' descends is: τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς (or sometimes ἐν ἀρχῇ) αἰτεῖν, "asking for the initial thing." Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of [[dialectic]]al argument he discusses in his ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.

In this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called "the initial thing" (τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ) and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' and in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' book II, (64b, 34–65a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18–59b, 1).

The stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the ''Topics'' included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of ''asking for the initial thing''—which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, ''[[Prior Analytics|PA]]'' II 16).

The term was translated into English from [[Latin]] in the 16th century. The Latin version, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'', "asking for the starting point", can be interpreted in different ways. ''{{lang|la|Petitio}}'' (from ''{{lang|la|peto}}''), in the [[Postclassical Era|post-classical]] context in which the phrase arose, means ''assuming'' or ''postulating'', but in the older classical sense means ''petition'', ''request'' or ''beseeching''.&lt;ref name="Liberman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title='Begging the question': we have answers|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290|work=Language Log|accessdate=12 January 2012|authorlink=Mark Liberman|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kretzmann1988"&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Kretzmann |first2=E. |last2=Stump |year=1988 |title=Logic and the Philosophy of Language |series=The Cambridge Translations of Medieval Philosophical Texts |volume=Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521280631 |lccn=87030542 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh-vE6T_WIcC&amp;pg=PA374 |page=374 |quote=One sort of ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is common, and another is dialectical; but common ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is not relevant here. A dialectical ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is an expression that insists that in the disputation some act must be performed with regard to the statable thing [at issue]. For example, "I require (''{{lang|la|peto}}'') you to respond affirmatively to 'God exists,'" and the like. And ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' obligates [the respondent] to perform an action with regard to the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'', while ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' obligates [him] only to maintain [the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'']; and in this way ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' and ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' differ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|Principii}}'', [[genitive case|genitive]] of ''{{lang|la|principium}}'', means ''beginning'', ''basis'' or ''premise'' (of an argument). Literally ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' means "assuming the premise" or "assuming the original point".

The Latin phrase comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ αἰτεῖσθαι}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|to en archei aiteisthai}}'', "asking the original point")&lt;ref name="Schreiber2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=S.G. |last=Schreiber |year=2003 |title=Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780791456590 |lccn=2002030968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AICfsOKXhJIC&amp;pg=PA106 |pages=99, 106, 214 |quote=It hardly needs pointing out that such circular arguments are logically unassailable. The importance of the ''Prior Analytics'' introduction to the fallacy is that it places the error in a thoroughly epistemic context. For Aristotle, some reasoning of the form "p because p" is acceptable, namely, in cases where p is self-justifying. In other cases the same (logical) reasoning commits the error of Begging the Question. Distinguishing self-evident from non-self-evident claims is a notorious crux in the history of philosophy. Aristotle's antidote to the subjectivism that threatens always to debilitate such decisions is his belief in a natural order of epistemic justification and the recognition that it takes special (dialectical) training to make that natural order also known to us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' II xvi 64b28–65a26:

{{quote|Begging or assuming the point at issue consists (to take the expression in its widest sense) [of] failing to demonstrate the required proposition. But there are several other ways in which this may happen; for example, if the argument has not taken syllogistic form at all, he may argue from premises which are less known or equally unknown, or he may establish the antecedent by means of its consequents; for demonstration proceeds from what is more certain and is prior. Now begging the question is none of these. [...] If, however, the relation of B to C is such that they are identical, or that they are clearly convertible, or that one applies to the other, then he is begging the point at issue.... [B]egging the question is proving what is not self-evident by means of itself...either because predicates which are identical belong to the same subject, or because the same predicate belongs to subjects which are identical.|Aristotle|Hugh Tredennick (trans.) ''Prior Analytics''}}

Aristotle's distinction between [[apodictic]] science and other forms of non-demonstrative knowledge rests on an [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]] wherein appropriate [[first principles]] become apparent to the trained dialectician:
{{quote|Aristotle's advice in ''[[Sophistical Refutations|S.E.]]'' 27 for resolving fallacies of Begging the Question is brief. If one realizes that one is being asked to concede the original point, one should refuse to do so, even if the point being asked is a reputable belief. On the other hand, if one fails to realize that one has conceded the point at issue and the questioner uses the concession to produce the apparent refutation, then one should turn the tables on the sophistical opponent by oneself pointing out the fallacy committed. In dialectical exchange it is a worse mistake to be caught asking for the original point than to have inadvertently granted such a request. The answerer in such a position has failed to detect when different utterances mean the same thing. The questioner, if he did not realize he was asking the original point, has committed the same error. But if he has knowingly asked for the original point, then he reveals himself to be ontologically confused: he has mistaken what is non-self-explanatory (known through other things) to be something self-explanatory (known through itself). In pointing this out to the false reasoner, one is not just pointing out a tactical psychological misjudgment by the questioner. It is not simply that the questioner falsely thought that the original point, if placed under the guise of a semantic equivalent, or a logical equivalent, or a covering universal, or divided up into exhaustive parts, would be more persuasive to the answerer. Rather, the questioner falsely thought that a non-self-explanatory fact about the world was an explanatory first principle. For Aristotle, that certain facts are self-explanatory while others are not is not a reflection solely of the cognitive abilities of humans. It is primarily a reflection of the structure of noncognitive reality. In short, a successful resolution of such a fallacy requires a firm grasp of the correct explanatory powers of things. Without a knowledge of which things are self-explanatory and which are not, the reasoner is liable to find a question-begging argument persuasive.&lt;ref name="Schreiber2003"/&gt;|Scott Gregory Schreiber|''Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations''}}

[[Thomas Fowler (Oxford)|Thomas Fowler]] believed that ''{{lang|la|Petitio Principii}}'' would be more properly called ''{{lang|la|Petitio Quæsiti}}'', which is literally "begging the question".&lt;ref name="Fowler145"&gt;Fowler, Thomas (1887). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WdtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 ''The Elements of Deductive Logic, Ninth Edition'']  (p. 145). Oxford, England: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
To "beg the question" is to put forward an argument whose validity requires that its own conclusion is true.

Also called ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'', the [[fallacy]] is an attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself presupposes the claim.&lt;ref name="Welton279"&gt;Welton (1905), 279., "Petitio principii is, therefore, committed when a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof."&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted.

Given the single variable C (claim), "begging the question" is an attempt to assert that {{nowrap|C → C}}. In two variables, {{nowrap|C (claim)}} and {{nowrap|P (premise)}}, it attempts to pass {{nowrap|(C → P) → C}} as the valid claim {{nowrap|P → C}}.{{cn|date=January 2018}} This is a form of circular reasoning, and may involve any number of variables.

When the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a ''[[hysteron proteron]]''&lt;ref name="Davies572"&gt;Davies (1915), 572.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welton280"&gt;Welton (1905), 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Imaginary Invalid|Le Malade imaginaire]]'', a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[Hypnotic|soporific]] power." In the original: '' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de ''Le Malade imaginaire'' in French Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;, as in the statement:

*"Opium induces sleep because it has a [[wiktionary:soporific|''soporific'']] quality."&lt;ref name="Welton281"&gt;Welton (1905), 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure and literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is "controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion":&lt;ref&gt;Kahane and Cavender (2005), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...[S]eldom is anyone going to simply place the conclusion word-for-word into the premises ... Rather, an arguer might use phraseology that conceals the fact that the conclusion is masquerading as a premise. The conclusion is rephrased to look different and is then placed in the premises.|Paul Herrick&lt;ref name="Herrick248"&gt;Herrick (2000) 248.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original.&lt;ref name="Welton281" /&gt; One could also "bring forth a proposition expressed in words of [[Saxon]] origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of [[Norman language|Norman]] origin",&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt; as here:

*"To allow every man an unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the State, for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty perfectly unlimited of expressing his sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Whately]], ''Elements of Logic'' (1826) quoted in Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it ''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}'' (''reasoning in a circle'')&lt;ref name="Davies572" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;Bradley Dowden, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#BeggingtheQuestion "Fallacies"] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; or, more commonly, ''circular reasoning''.

Begging the question is not considered a [[formal fallacy]] (an [[argument]] that is defective because it uses an incorrect [[deductive reasoning|deductive step]]). Rather, it is a type of [[informal fallacy]] that is [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Fallacy |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200836/fallacy#ref1102387 |quote=Strictly speaking, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is not a fallacy of reasoning but an ineptitude in argumentation: thus the argument from p as a premise to p as conclusion is not deductively invalid but lacks any power of conviction, since no one who questioned the conclusion could concede the premise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plausible argument in everyday conversation |publisher=SUNY Press |author=Walton, Douglas |year=1992 |pages=206–207 |isbn=9780791411575 |quote=Wellington is in New Zealand. Therefore, Wellington is in New Zealand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petitio Principii"&gt;The reason ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is considered a fallacy is not that the [[inference]] is invalid (because any statement is indeed equivalent to itself), but that the argument can be deceptive.  A statement cannot prove itself.  A premiss{{sic}} must have a different source of reason, ground or evidence for its truth  from that of the conclusion: Lander University, [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/circular.html "Petitio Principii"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related fallacies ==
{{main|Circular reasoning|Complex question|Ignoratio elenchi}}
Closely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of [[circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}''), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dowden |first=Bradley |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#CircularReasoning |title=Fallacies |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual components of a circular argument can be logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Logic |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=1998 |page=205 |isbn=9780070466494 |last1=Nolt |first1=John Eric |last2=Rohatyn |first2=Dennis |last3=Varzi |first3=Achille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begging the question is similar to the ''[[complex question]]'' (also known as ''trick question'' or ''fallacy of many questions''): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, "Which color dress is Mary wearing?" may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing a pantsuit.&lt;ref name="Meyer1988"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Meyer |year=1988 |title=Questions and Questioning |series=Foundations of Communication |publisher=W. de Gruyter |isbn=9783110106800 |lccn=lc88025603 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwo5qXTCJewC&amp;pg=PA198 |pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton1989"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.N. |last=Walton |year=1989 |title=Informal Logic: A Handbook for Critical Argument |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521379250 |lccn=88030762 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kswimguc5uYC&amp;pg=PA36 |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related fallacy is ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' or ''irrelevant conclusion'': an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law ''ought'' to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Fowler, ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''. Entry for ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
&lt;!-- Please read the discussion on the talk page before editing this section --&gt;
Many modern English speakers use ''beg the question'' to mean "bear the question", "suggest the question," "raise the question", "invite the question", "evade the question", or even "ignore the question", and follow that phrase with the question, for example: "I weigh 120&amp;nbsp;kg and have severely clogged arteries, which begs the question: why have I not started exercising?" For [[Linguistic prescription|grammatical]] reasons and because the term has a specific, different meaning in philosophy, logic, and law, some commenters note that such usage is mistaken, or at best, unclear&lt;ref name="Garner1995"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.A. |last=Garner |year=1995 |title=Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |series=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195142365 |lccn=95003863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA101 |page=101 |quote=''begging the question'' does not mean "evading the issue" or "inviting the obvious questions," as some mistakenly believe. The proper meaning of begging the question is "basing a conclusion on an assumption that is as much in need of proof or demonstration as the conclusion itself." The formal name for this logical fallacy is ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}.'' Following are two classic examples: "Reasonable men are those who think and reason intelligently." ''Patterson v. Nutter,'' 7 A. 273, 275 (Me. 1886). (This statement begs the question, "What does it mean to think and reason intelligently?")/ "Life begins at conception! [Fn.: 'Conception is defined as the beginning of life.']" ''Davis v. Davis,'' unreported opinion (Cir. Tenn. Eq. 1989). (The "proof"—or the definition—is circular.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoughtonMifflin2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2005 |title=The American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style |isbn=9780618604999 |lccn=2005016513 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb6ie6PqYhwC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56|quote=Sorting out exactly what ''beg the question'' means, however, is not always easy—especially in constructions such as ''beg the question of whether'' and ''beg the question of how,'' where the door is opened to more than one question. [...] But we can easily substitute ''evade the question'' or even ''raise the question,'' and the sentence will be perfectly clear, even though it violates the traditional usage rule.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brians, Common Errors in English Usage: Online Edition (full text of book: 2nd Edition, November, 2008, William, James &amp; Company) [http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/begs.html] (accessed 1 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Follett (1966), 228; Kilpatrick (1997); Martin (2002), 71; Safire (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; even as sources such as the Meriam Webster Dictionary and non-prescriptivist critics acknowledge the usage of the phrase as a synonym for “raises the question” as popularly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/beg-the-question|title=Beg the Question|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Berkeley school of political theory''' is a [[school of thought]] in [[political theory]] associated originally with the work of faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], some of whom formulated and popularized its ideas. The school of thought was founded by [[Sheldon Wolin]], [[Hanna Pitkin]],&lt;ref&gt;"In light of Pitkin's long association with Berkeley, it is no surprise that academic lore frequently connects her work to a 'Berkeley School' of political theory, said to have flourished in the 1960s and '70s.", Mathiowetz, 2016, p.5 of the PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Rogin]], [[John Schaar]], and [[Norman Jacobson]], among others, and has been carried on by theorists including [[Wilson Carey McWilliams]] and [[J. Peter Euben]].&lt;ref name="grimes-obit"&gt;William Grimes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/sheldon-s-wolin-theorist-who-shifted-political-science-back-to-politics-dies-at-93.html "Sheldon S.

The Berkeley school has been characterized as returning political theory back in the direction of politics and political action, and away from efforts to center "scientific" models such as economics, psychology, sociology, and the natural sciences, specifically [[behavioralism]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="mathiowetz-2016"&gt;Mathiowetz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes-obit" /&gt;

'''Boris Smirnoff''' (1903 - 2007) was a [[France|Franco]]-[[Russia]]n [[Cubism|cubist]], [[Avant-gardism|avant-gardist]] and [[analytical art]] [[Painting|painter]].

Boris Smirnoff was born  in [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. He had two brothers - Alexander and Vladimir. He was the youngest son. Vladimir was known as the artist-[[amateur]] and the [[Futurism|futurist]], big admirer of [[David Burliuk]] and [[Vasily Kamensky]].

His family escaped to France in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]]. Boris behind them, and stayed in [[Petrograd]]. He is learning as artist and works in [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]] Theatre.

In 1926 Boris has found the new idol - [[Pavel Filonov]] with new "[[Analytical art|Analytical Art]]".

In 1927 Boris Smirnoff has appeared in France. He worked as a painter in France. Over the next decade, he drew a lot of [[oil painting]]s and [[pastel]]s.

All this oils and pastels were burned by the German invaders as "[[degenerate art]]" during the [[Second World War]].

Because of this Boris Smirnoff began to draw exclusively [[watercolour]] on paper after the war. He said: "I can always put these watercolours into a suitcase and to carry away with myself!"

Boris Smirnoff refused to sell his [[Work of art|artworks]] like his teacher Pavel Filonov.

After the [[Second World War]] Boris Smirnoff had lived in [[UK|Great Britain]] and [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]].

Many years later, Boris returned to Russia and saw that it was a different country. This was not the Russia, from which he left. And, even though the country largely did not like him, he remained there until his death.

Until his death, he did not sell his watercolours. He said: "One hundred and four years - this is not a reason to change my habits".

Boris Smirnoff died in Russia in 2007 at the age of 104. After his death the Boris Smirnoff Foundation was organised to manage his collection. Today, one of the key locations the public can see his art is at the [[The Vineyard Hotel|Vineyard Hotel]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]], England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14265">{{redirect|Cassandra Complex}}
[[File:Cassandra1.jpeg|thumb|Painting of Cassandra by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

The '''Cassandra metaphor''' (variously labelled the '''Cassandra''' "'''syndrome'''", "'''complex'''", "'''phenomenon'''", "'''predicament'''", "'''dilemma'''", or "'''curse'''") occurs when valid warnings or concerns are dismissed or disbelieved.

The term originates in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Cassandra]] was a daughter of [[Priam]], the King of [[Troy]].  Struck by her beauty, [[Apollo]] provided her with the gift of [[prophecy]], but when Cassandra refused Apollo's romantic advances, he placed a curse ensuring that nobody would believe her warnings.  Cassandra was left with the knowledge of future events, but could neither alter these events nor convince others of the validity of her predictions.

The metaphor has been applied in a variety of contexts such as psychology, environmentalism, politics, science, cinema, the corporate world, and in philosophy, and has been in circulation since at least 1949 when French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] coined the term 'Cassandra Complex' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston, Le Rationalisme appliqué PUF, Paris, (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

The Cassandra metaphor is applied by some psychologists to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions, and who are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their suffering with others.

===Melanie Klein===

In 1963, [[psychologist]] [[Melanie Klein]] provided an interpretation of [[Cassandra]] as representing the human moral conscience whose main task is to issue warnings. Cassandra as moral conscience, "predicts ill to come and warns that punishment will follow and grief arise".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude- And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 293 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra's need to point out moral infringements and subsequent social consequences is driven by what Klein calls "the destructive influences of the cruel super-ego", which is represented in the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] by the god [[Apollo]], Cassandra's overlord and persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude – And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 295 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's use of the metaphor centers on the moral nature of certain predictions, which tends to evoke in others "a refusal to believe what at the same time they know to be true, and expresses the universal tendency toward denial, [with] denial being a potent defence against persecutory anxiety and guilt".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"/&gt;

===Laurie Layton Schapira===

In a 1988 study, [[Jungian]] analyst Laurie Layton Schapira, explored what she called the "[[Cassandra Complex]]" in the lives of two of her analysands.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2243156M/The_Cassandra_complex|title=The Cassandra complex: living with disbelief: a modern perspective on hysteria|last=Schapira|first=Laurie Layton|date=1988|publisher=Inner City Books|year=|isbn=091912335X|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Based on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex: 
# dysfunctional relationships with the "[[Apollo archetype]]",
# emotional or physical suffering, including [[hysteria]] ([[conversion disorder]]) or "women’s problems",
# and being disbelieved when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt;

Layton Schapira views the Cassandra [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] as resulting from a dysfunctional [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with what she calls the "[[Apollo archetype]]", an archetype which refers to any individual's or culture's pattern that is dedicated to, yet bound by, order, reason, intellect, truth and clarity that disavows itself of anything occult or irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria p.10 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual specialization of this archetype creates emotional distance and can predispose relationships to a lack of emotional reciprocity and consequent dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt; She further states that a "Cassandra woman" is very prone to hysteria because she "feels attacked not only from the outside world but also from within, especially from the body in the form of somatic, often gynaecological, complaints."&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, ''The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria'' p.65 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[metaphor]]ical application of the [[Cassandra|Greek Cassandra myth]], Layton Schapira states that:
{{blockquote|What the Cassandra woman sees is something dark and painful that may not be apparent on the surface of things or that objective facts do not corroborate. She may envision a negative or unexpected outcome; or something which would be difficult to deal with; or a truth which others, especially authority figures, would not accept. In her frightened, ego-less state, the Cassandra woman may blurt out what she sees, perhaps with the unconscious hope that others might be able to make some sense of it. But to them her words sound meaningless, disconnected and blown out of all proportion.&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"/&gt;}}

===Jean Shinoda Bolen===

In 1989, [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of California]], published an essay on the god Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she detailed a psychological profile of the "Cassandra woman" whom she suggested referred to someone suffering—as happened in the mythological relationship between Cassandra and Apollo—a dysfunctional relationship with an "Apollo man". Bolen added that the Cassandra woman may exhibit "hysterical" overtones, and may be disbelieved when attempting to share what she knows.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves pp. 130–160 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific. She states that "women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all&amp;nbsp;... There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' pp. x–xi (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

"As an archetype, Apollo personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface rather than at what underlies appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' p.135 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate&amp;nbsp;... Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up"—be vulnerable and empathic—in order to truly know someone else&amp;nbsp;... But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties&amp;nbsp;... she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;}}
Bolen suggests that a Cassandra woman (or man) may become increasingly hysterical and irrational when in a dysfunctional relationship with a negative Apollo, and may experience others' disbelief when describing her experiences.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;

==Corporate world==

Foreseeing potential future directions for a corporation or company is sometimes called "visioning".&lt;ref name="Davies1998"&gt;Davies, P., "The Cassandra Complex: how to avoid generating a corporate vision that no one buys into" pp. 103–123 in ''Success in Sight: Visioning'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult due to a lack of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed "Cassandras"—able to see what is going to happen, but not believed.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global [[stock market]], as happened with [[Warren Buffett]], who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, attracting to him the title of "Wall Street Cassandra".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bear Book: Survive and Profit in Ferocious Markets'', p. 81 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Grove]], in his book ''Only The Paranoid Survive'', reminds the reader of the Helpful Cassandras that sense the winds of change before others and are critical to managing through Strategic Inflection Points.&lt;ref&gt; ''Only The Paranoid Survive'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is a primary source—we need another to establish notability --&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental movement==

Many environmentalists have predicted looming environmental catastrophes including [[climate change]], rise in sea levels, irreversible [[pollution]], and an impending collapse of [[ecosystem]]s, including those of [[rain forest|rainforests]] and [[ocean]] [[reef]]s.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, [[Earthscan]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though much of this has since come to pass, individuals sometimes acquire the label of 'Cassandras', whose warnings of impending environmental disaster are disbelieved or mocked.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"/&gt; [[Environmentalist]] [[Alan Atkisson]] wrote in 1999 that to understand that humanity is on a collision course with the laws of nature is to be stuck in what he calls the 'Cassandra dilemma' in which one can see the most likely outcome of current trends and can warn people about what is happening, but the vast majority cannot, or will not respond, and later if catastrophe occurs, they may even blame you, as if your prediction set the disaster in motion.&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally there may be a "successful" alert, though the succession of books, campaigns, organizations, and personalities that we think of as the environmental movement has more generally fallen toward the opposite side of this dilemma: a failure to "get through" to the people and avert disaster. In the words of Atkisson: "too often we watch helplessly, as Cassandra did, while the soldiers emerge from the Trojan horse just as foreseen and wreak their predicted havoc. Worse, Cassandra's dilemma has seemed to grow more inescapable even as the chorus of Cassandras has grown larger."&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 pp. 32–33 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==

There are examples of the Cassandra metaphor being applied in the contexts of [[medical science]],&lt;ref&gt;Web, S., Contemporary IMRT: Developing Physics and Clinical Implementation, p.357 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantos, J.D., The Lazarus Case: Life-and-Death Issues in Neonatal Intensive Care, p.160 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the media,&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L., Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication, p.157 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to feminist perspectives on reality,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, L., 'The Cassandra Complex', pp. 37–41 in Haring-Smith, T., New Monologues For Women By Women – Vol II (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamotte, D., Women Imagine Change: A Global Anthology of Women's Resistance From 600 B.C.E. p.86 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, S., Angus, I., Orwell, G., My Country Right or Left p.378 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of the metaphor being used in popular music lyrics, such as the 1982 ABBA song "Cassandra",&lt;ref&gt;Atkisson, A., Cassandra's Lyre (song) on album Believing Cassandra 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[ABBA]]: 'Cassandra' recorded October 18, 1982 as the B-side of the single The Day Before You Came&lt;/ref&gt;  Emmy the Great's "Cassandra", and [[Star One (band)|Star One]]'s "Cassandra Complex". The five-part [[The Mars Volta]] song "Cassandra Gemini" may reference this syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;Fear Before the March of Flames, Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party (song) on album The Always Open Mouth 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' or in [[Dead and Divine]]'s "Cassandra Syndrome". The Ohio band Curse of Cassandra is named after the metaphor.

There are also distinct parallels to Old Testament prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Amos - prophets who called attention to the failure of those who thought of themselves as God's people to forsake meaningless sacrifices and devote themselves to caring for "orphans and widows in their distress." The prophets called their societies to thereby honor God and avoid social / political disasters. Their "prophecies" were not well-received; Jeremiah, for example, being thrown into a deep well as well as put in wooden stocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">A '''challenge''' is a request made to the holder of a competitive title for a [[match (game)|match]] between champion and challenger, the winner of which will acquire or retain the title.  In some cases the champion has the right to refuse a challenge; in others, this results in forfeiting the title. The challenge system derives from [[duelling]] and its [[warrior code|code of honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorn|first=Elliott  J.|date=Fall 1986|title=John L. Sullivan: 'The champion of all champions'|journal=The Virginia Quarterly Review|volume=62|issue=4|page=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competitive [[sports]] use some form of [[tournament]] to determine champions, a '''challenge match''' is the normal way of deciding [[professional boxing]] titles and the [[World Chess Championship]]. Some [[racket sport]]s clubs have a reigning champion who may be challenged by any other club member; a [[ladder tournament]] extends the challenge concept to all players, not just the reigning champion. At élite-level competition, there is usually some governing body which authorises and regulates challenges, such as [[FIDE]] in chess. In some cases there is a challengers' tournament, the winner of which gains the right to play the '''challenge round''' against the reigning champion; in tennis this was the case at [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]] until 1922 and in the [[Davis Cup]] until 1972.&lt;ref name="Grasso2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grasso|first=John|title=Historical Dictionary of Tennis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W39oSS7c2xAC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=2011-09-16|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810872370|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FA Cup]]'s official name remains the "Football Association Challenge Cup", although not since [[1872–73 FA Cup|its second season]] in 1873 has the reigning champion receive a bye to [[FA Cup Final|the final]]. The [[America's Cup]] is contested  according to the terms of its [[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|1887 deed of gift]] between yachts representing the champion yacht club and a challenging club. Since 1970, the usual practice, by mutual consent, is for an initial formal "challenger of record" replaced by the actual challenger after [[Herbert Pell Cup|a qualifying tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cupinfo.com/en/americas-cup-brief-history-challenger-of-record-01.php|title=America's Cup - A Brief History of the Challenger of Record 1970-2017 - from CupInfo|publisher=CupInfo|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[1988 America's Cup|1988]] and [[2010 America's Cup|2010]] there were court cases arising from non-consensual challenges.

When the champion dies or otherwise vacates the title, a [[tournament]] among leading contenders may be used to crown a new champion prior to the resumption of challenges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1006">'''Conduct books''' are a [[genre]] of books that attempt to educate the reader on [[social norm]]s.  As a genre, they began in the mid-to-late Middle Ages, although antecedents such as ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'' (c. 2350 BC) are among the earliest surviving works.  Conduct books remained popular through the 18th century, although they gradually declined with the advent of the [[novel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9330">The '''Darwin Lagrangian''' (named after [[Charles Galton Darwin]], grandson of [[Charles Darwin|the naturalist]]) describes the interaction to order &lt;math&gt;\frac{v^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt; between two charged particles in a vacuum and is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jackson, John D.|title=Classical Electrodynamics (3rd ed.)|publisher=Wiley|year=1998|isbn=047130932X}} pp. 596-598&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = L_\text{f} + L_\text{int}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the free particle [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is

:&lt;math&gt; L_\text{f} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{8c^2} m_1 v_1^4 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 + \frac{1}{8c^2} m_2 v_2^4, &lt;/math&gt;

and the interaction Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt; L_\text{int} = L_\text{C} + L_\text{D}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Coulomb force|Coulomb interaction]] is

:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{C} = -\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Charles Galton Darwin|Darwin]] interaction is

:&lt;math&gt; L_\text{D} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \frac{1}{2c^2} \mathbf v_1 \cdot \left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right] \cdot \mathbf v_2. &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the charges on particles 1 and 2 respectively, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the particles, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the velocities of the particles, ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], '''r''' is the vector between the two particles, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in the direction of '''r'''.

The free Lagrangian is the [[Taylor expansion]] of free Lagrangian of two relativistic particles to second order in ''v''. The Darwin interaction term is due to one particle reacting to the [[magnetic field]] generated by the other particle. If higher-order terms in ''v''/''c'' are retained, then the field degrees of freedom must be taken into account, and the interaction can no longer be taken to be instantaneous between the particles. In that case [[Retarded potential|retardation]] effects must be accounted for.

==Derivation of the Darwin interaction in a vacuum==
The relativistic interaction Lagrangian for a particle with charge q interacting with an electromagnetic field is&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 580-581.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L_\text{int} = -q\Phi + {q\over c} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf A, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the relativistic velocity of the particle. The first term on the right generates the Coulomb interaction. The second term generates the Darwin interaction.

The [[vector potential]] in the [[Coulomb gauge]] is described by&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gaussian units]])

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf A - {1\over c^2} {\partial^2 \mathbf A \over \partial t^2} = -{4\pi \over c} \mathbf J_t&lt;/math&gt;

where the transverse current '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[solenoidal field|solenoidal current]] (see [[Helmholtz decomposition]]) generated by a second particle. The [[divergence]] of the transverse current is zero.

The current generated by the second particle is

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf J = q_2 \mathbf v_2 \delta \left( \mathbf r - \mathbf r_2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

which has a [[Fourier transform]]

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf J\left( \mathbf k \right) \equiv  \int d^3r \exp\left( -i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r \right) \mathbf J\left( \mathbf r \right) = q_2 \mathbf v_2 \exp\left( -i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r_2 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The transverse component of the current is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_t\left( \mathbf k \right) = q_2 \left[ \mathbf 1 - \mathbf{\hat k} \mathbf{\hat k} \right] \cdot \mathbf v_2 \exp\left( -i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r_2 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is easily verified that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf J_t\left( \mathbf k \right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which must be true if the divergence of the transverse current is zero. We see that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_t\left( \mathbf k \right) &lt;/math&gt;

is the component of the Fourier transformed current perpendicular to '''k'''.

From the equation for the vector potential, the Fourier transform of the vector potential is

:&lt;math&gt;  
 \mathbf A \left( \mathbf k \right)
 = {4\pi \over c} {q_2\over k^2} \left[ \mathbf 1 - \mathbf{\hat k} \mathbf{\hat k} \right] \cdot \mathbf v_2
\exp\left( -i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r_2 \right)
  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have kept only the lowest order term in v/c.

The inverse Fourier transform of the vector potential is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A \left( \mathbf r \right)  
=\int { d^3 k \over \left ( 2 \pi \right ) ^3 } \; \mathbf A \left( \mathbf k \right) \;{ \exp \left ( i \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r_1 \right )  } 
= {q_2\over 2c} {1 \over  r } \left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right] \cdot \mathbf v_2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2 &lt;/math&gt;

(see [[Common integrals in quantum field theory#Transverse potential with mass|Common integrals in quantum field theory]]).

The Darwin interaction term in the Lagrangian is then

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|
&lt;math&gt;L_{D} = 
{q_1 q_2\over r} {1 \over 2c^2  } \mathbf v_1 \cdot 
\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right]
\cdot \mathbf v_2  &lt;/math&gt;
|}

where again we kept only the lowest order term in v/c.

==Lagrangian equations of motion==
The [[equations of motion|equation of motion]] for one of the particles is

:&lt;math&gt;  {d \over dt} {\partial  \over \partial \mathbf v_1} L\left( \mathbf r_1 , \mathbf v_1 \right) = \nabla_1 L\left( \mathbf r_1 , \mathbf v_1 \right)  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  {d \mathbf p_1 \over dt} = \nabla_1 L\left( \mathbf r_1 , \mathbf v_1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[momentum]] of the particle.

===Free particle===
The equation of motion for a free particle neglecting interactions between the two particles is

:&lt;math&gt;{d \over dt} \left[ \left( 1   + {1\over 2} { v_1^2\over c^2 } \right)m_1\mathbf v_1 \right]=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_1 = \left( 1   + {1\over 2} { v_1^2\over c^2 } \right)m_1\mathbf v_1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Interacting particles===
For interacting particles, the equation of motion becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  {d \over dt} \left[ \left( 1   + {1\over 2} { v_1^2\over c^2 } \right)m_1\mathbf v_1 +{q_1\over c}\mathbf A\left( \mathbf r_1 \right) \right]=
-\nabla {q_1 q_2 \over r}
+\nabla \left[ {q_1q_2 \over  r }{1\over 2c^2}
\mathbf v_1\cdot  
\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right]
\cdot\mathbf v_2 \right]  &lt;/math&gt;

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|
&lt;math&gt; {d \mathbf{p}_1\over dt} 
= {q_1 q_2 \over r^2}{\hat{\mathbf r}}
+{q_1 q_2 \over r^2}{1\over 2c^2} 
\left\{ \mathbf v_1 \left( { {\hat{\mathbf r}}\cdot \mathbf v_2} \right) 
+  \mathbf v_2 \left( { {\hat{\mathbf r}}\cdot \mathbf v_1}\right)
- {\hat{\mathbf r}} \left[ \mathbf v_1 \cdot \left( \mathbf 1 +3 {\hat{\mathbf r}}{\hat{\mathbf r}}\right)\cdot \mathbf v_2\right]
 \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
|}

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_1 =
\left( 1   + {1\over 2} { v_1^2\over c^2 } \right)m_1\mathbf v_1
+{q_1\over c}\mathbf A\left( \mathbf r_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A \left( \mathbf r_1 \right)  =  {q_2\over 2c} {1 \over  r }  
\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right]
\cdot \mathbf v_2  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r =\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2&lt;/math&gt;

==Darwin Hamiltonian for two particles in a vacuum==
The Darwin [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] for two particles in a vacuum is related to the Lagrangian by a [[Legendre transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;  H = \mathbf p_1 \cdot \mathbf v_1 + \mathbf p_2 \cdot \mathbf v_2 - L.&lt;/math&gt;

The Hamiltonian becomes

{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|
&lt;math&gt; H\left( \mathbf r_1 , \mathbf p_1 ,\mathbf r_2 , \mathbf p_2 \right)=
\left( 1   - {1\over 4} { p_1^2\over m_1^2 c^2 } \right){ p_1^2 \over 2 m_1}
\; + \; \left( 1   - {1\over 4} { p_2^2\over m_2^2 c^2 } \right){ p_2^2 \over 2 m_2}
\; + \; {q_1 q_2 \over r }
\; - \; {q_1q_2 \over  r }{1\over 2m_1 m_2 c^2}
\mathbf p_1\cdot  
\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right]
\cdot\mathbf p_2
  .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Hamiltonian equations of motion==
The Hamiltonian equations of motion are

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf v_1 = {\partial H \over \partial \mathbf p_1}  &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;  {d \mathbf p_1 \over dt} = -\nabla_1 H &lt;/math&gt;

which yield

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf v_1  =
\left( 1- {1\over 2} {p_1^2 \over m_1^2 c^2}  \right) {\mathbf p_1 \over m_1}
- {q_1 q_2\over 2m_1m_2 c^2} {1 \over  r }  
\left[\mathbf 1 + \mathbf{\hat r} \mathbf{\hat r}\right]
\cdot \mathbf p_2&lt;/math&gt;

and

{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|
&lt;math&gt;  {d \mathbf p_1\over dt} = {q_1 q_2 \over r^2}{\hat{\mathbf r}}
\; + \; {q_1 q_2 \over r^2}{1\over 2m_1 m_2 c^2} 
\left\{ \mathbf p_1 \left( { {\hat{\mathbf r}}\cdot \mathbf p_2} \right) 
+  \mathbf p_2 \left( { {\hat{\mathbf r}}\cdot \mathbf p_1}\right)
- {\hat{\mathbf r}} \left[ \mathbf p_1 \cdot \left( \mathbf 1 +3 {\hat{\mathbf r}}{\hat{\mathbf r}}\right)\cdot \mathbf p_2\right]
 \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
|}
Note that the quantum mechanical [[Breit equation]] originally used the Darwin Lagrangian with the Darwin Hamiltonian as its classical starting point though the Breit equation would be better vindicated by the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] and better yet [[quantum electrodynamics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Digital self-defense''' is the use of [[self-defense]] strategies by [[Internet]] users to ensure [[digital security]]; that is to say, the protection of confidential [[personal electronic information]].&lt;ref&gt;“Components of Security”, http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~snoeren/stp307/ppt/sld002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet security]] software provides initial protection by setting up a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], as well as scanning computers for [[malware]], [[viruses]], [[Trojan horses]], [[computer worm|worms]] and [[spyware]].  However information at most risk includes personal details such as [[birthdate]]s, [[phone number]]s, [[bank account]] and [[schooling]] details, [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious affiliation]]s, [[email address]]es and [[password]]s.  This information is often openly revealed in [[social networking]] sites leaving Internet users vulnerable to [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and possibly [[Internet crime]]. Mobile devices, especially those with [[Wi-Fi]], allow this information to be shared inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital self-defense requires Internet users to take an active part in guarding their own personal information. Four key strategies are frequently suggested to assist that protection.

==Computer security==
Computer security in this context is referring to [[Internet security]] software. The ongoing security of private information requires frequent updating of virus and spyware definitions so that ongoing developments in malicious software cannot interfere with, or copy, private information.&lt;ref&gt;"Secure your computer", © Commonwealth of Australia 2010 and © Stay Smart Online. http://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/home_internet_users/secure_your_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email Accounts and Usernames==

===Choice of Appropriate Email Account===
The practice of utilising more than one [[email]] account to separate personal and business usage from recreational usage is a strategy commonly used to manage personal privacy. The free and ready availability of email accounts from sites such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] or [[Hotmail]] allows the protection of personal identity through the use of different names to identify each email account. These [[throw-away account]]s can be discarded or replaced at will, providing another level of protection.

===Choice of Username===
A [[username]] is required to set up email accounts and to open accounts for various official, commercial, recreational and social networking sites.  In many cases, an email address may also be utilised as a username. Usernames that correlate with personal information such as names or nicknames are more at risk than ones that are cryptic or anonymous, particularly on social and recreational sites.

==Password Strength==
A [[password]] is a mandatory security measure that accompanies usernames. The use of personal data to construct passwords i.e. family members’ names, pet’s names or birth dates increases the risk to confidential information and are easier to crack than long complicated passwords so [[password strength]] is a key strategy for protecting personal information. A password can be weak or strong:a weak password is ''cutekittens'', a strong password is ''?lACpAs56IKMs''.

According to [[Microsoft]] an ideal password should be at least 14 characters in length and have letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers, where complexity is added by the inclusion of uppercase letters.&lt;ref&gt;"Create Strong Passwords", Microsoft Safety and Security Center. {{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214012154/http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing Personal Information Using Privacy Options==
[[Social networking]] sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as [[personal identifier]]s are routinely used to create public profiles.&lt;ref&gt;"Safer Social Networking". © Commonwealth of Australia 2010.http://www.cybersmart.gov.au/Parents/Brochures%20and%20posters%20and%20contacts/Cybersmart%20contacts.aspx#Information&lt;/ref&gt; Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empirical research''' is [[research]] using [[empirical evidence]]. It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect [[observation]] or [[experience]]. [[Empiricism]] values such research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed [[quantitative research|quantitatively]] or [[qualitative research|qualitatively.]] Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called [[data]]). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.

In some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., "Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?") which is tested through experimentation. Usually, a researcher has a certain [[theory]] regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or [[hypotheses]] will be proposed (e.g., "Listening to vocal voice has a negative effect on learning a word list."). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., "People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence."). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable [[experiment]]. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not,&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, C. J. (2005). ''Research in Psychology: Methods and Design.'' USA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.

==Terminology==
The term [[empirical]] was originally used to refer to certain [[ancient Greek]] practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the [[dogma]]tic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] as perceived in experience. Later [[empiricism]] referred to a theory of [[knowledge]] in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term empirical refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.

==Usage==
The researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the [[Sense|human senses]]) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to [[calibrate]] his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.

In practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned [[research design]]s for the collection of [[Empirical evidence|empirical data]], and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of [[research design]]. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. &amp; Stanley, J. (1963). ''Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among [[Pre-experimental Science|pre-experimental]], [[experimental design|experimental]], and [[quasi-experimental design|quasi-experimental]] designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in [[educational research]].

=== Scientific research ===
Accurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in [[Scientific method|scientific]] studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. [[statistics|Statistical]] formulas such as regression, [[uncertainty coefficient]], t-test, [[chi square]], and various types of [[Analysis of variance|ANOVA]] (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research [[hypothesis]] is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]](s) was observed on the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]](s).

The outcome of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never ''proof''. It can only ''support'' a hypothesis, ''reject'' it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities.

Among scientific researchers, empirical ''evidence'' (as distinct from empirical ''research'') refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well [[Calibration|calibrated]] [[thermometer]], is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.

The varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. In reference with a specific piece of knowledge, this paper will focus on differentiating between rationalism and empiricism or rational views and empirical views. 
In general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hjørland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. First there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists hold the tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. The overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists show primary concerns in how there is gaining of knowledge with respect to the sources of knowledge and concept. In some of the cases, disagreement at the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. In order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are Deduction or Intuition, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">In [[mathematics]], a '''semigroup with no elements''' (the '''empty semigroup''') is a [[semigroup]] in which the [[underlying set]] is the [[empty set]]. Many authors do not admit the existence of such a semigroup. For them a semigroup is by definition a ''non-empty'' set together with an associative binary operation.&lt;ref&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|date=1976|series=L.M.S.Monographs|volume=7}} pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; However not all authors insist on the underlying set of a semigroup being non-empty.&lt;ref&gt;P A Grillet (1995). ''Semigroups''. [[CRC Press]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8247-9662-4}} pp. 3–4 &lt;/ref&gt;  One can logically define a semigroup in which the underlying set ''S'' is empty. The binary operation in the semigroup is the [[empty function]] from {{nowrap|''S'' × ''S''}} to ''S''. This operation [[vacuously]] satisfies the closure and associativity axioms of a semigroup. Not excluding the empty semigroup simplifies certain results on semigroups. For example, the result that the intersection of two subsemigroups of a semigroup ''T'' is a subsemigroup of ''T'' becomes valid even when the intersection is empty. 

When a semigroup is defined to have additional structure, the issue may not arise.  For example, the definition of a [[monoid]] requires an [[identity element]], which rules out the empty semigroup as a monoid.

In [[category theory]], the empty semigroup is always admitted.  It is the unique [[initial object]] of the category of semigroups.

A semigroup with no element is an [[inverse semigroup]], since the necessary condition is vacuously satisfied.

'''esSENSE Club''' is a club promoting [[atheism]], science and [[humanism]] based in [[Kerala]], [[India]]. Founded in 2016, the club emphasises propagating [[freethinking]] and [[rationalism]] among the [[Malayali]] community all over the world. esSENSE Club organises seminars, lectures and debates on most weeks of the year on topics related to atheism, science and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://essense.club/about-essense/ |title=Mission of Essense}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club jointly organised a debate series named ''Samvadam'' along with [[Times of India]] and Inspirit IAS Academy at Thiruvanthapuram in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/toi-samvada-from-today/articleshow/58016836.cms |title=esSENSE- Times of India Debate Series 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual fest of esSense named Essentia was conducted in October 2017 at Town Hall, [[Ernakulam]]. Malayalam author and rationalist C. Ravichandran was a regular speaker for esSense till an organisational split took place in 2018. Apart from having units in all the districts of Kerala, esSense also has units in [[Bangalore]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Perth]] in Australia, United Kingdom and United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.manoramaonline.com/uk/2017/11/08/essence-britain.html |title=esSENSE UK Formation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, "esSENSE aspires to be the premier rationalist platform in India. We bring together rationalist speakers, writers, thinkers, activists, supporters, and well-wishers, with the goal of promoting rationalism and freethinking in Kerala and in the larger global environment. Through our publications, e-magazines, seminars, online media, and other collaborative platforms, we will endeavor to develop rationalist thought, share ideas, expand our intellectual horizons, facilitate learning, and foster collaboration. We build a better tomorrow that embraces science and rationality, pursues freethinking and atheism, and elevates humanism and justice, while resisting superstition, quackery, ignorance and hatred."

==Split== 
[[File:Ravichandran C.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ravichandran]]
esSENSE Club suffered a vertical split when a section of the office-bearers questioned attempt to create a personality cult around C Ravichandran, at whose behest the organisation was set up. This faction alleged that Ravichandran is fostering a fan club around his personality while the opposing faction charged the former with financial misappropriation. Police cases were filed and are pending resolution.

[[File:Regular_polygon_7_annotated.svg|thumb|262px|The [[regular polygon|regular]] [[heptagon]] cannot be constructed using only a [[straightedge and compass construction]]; this can be proven using the field of [[constructible number]]s.]]
{{Algebraic structures}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''field'''  is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] on which [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are defined, and behave as the corresponding operations on  [[rational number|rational]] and [[real number]]s do. 
A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]], which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]] and many other areas of mathematics.

The best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].

The relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] can not be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.

Fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.

== Definition ==
Informally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' ⋅ ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|''&amp;minus;a''}} for all elements ''a'', and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for every nonzero element ''b''. This allows us to consider also the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]] {{math|''a'' &amp;minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, via defining:
:{{math|1=''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&amp;minus;''b'')}},
:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' · ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

===Classic definition===

Formally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation|operations]] called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&amp;nbsp;181}}&lt;/ref&gt; An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to ''every'' pair of its elements. The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''sum'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''product'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a''⋅''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''field axioms''. In these axioms,  {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{math|''F''}}.

* ''[[Associativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}  and  {{math|1=''a'' · (''b'' · ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') · ''c''}}.
* ''[[Commutativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' · ''b'' = ''b'' · ''a''}}.
* ''[[Additive identity|Additive]]'' and ''[[multiplicative identity]]'': there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' · 1 = ''a''}}.
* ''[[Additive inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|−''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (−''a'') = 0}}.
* ''[[Multiplicative inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|1/''a''}},  or {{math|{{sfrac|1|''a''}}}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' · ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.
* ''[[Distributivity]]'' of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'')}}.

This may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''; it is an [[abelian group]] under the addition, with 0 as [[additive identity]]; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under the multiplication, with 1 as [[multiplicative identity]]; the multiplication is distributive over the addition.

===Alternative definition===
Fields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=§II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].&lt;/ref&gt; One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation, (the multiplicative inverse} and two constants 1 and –1, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (–1)}} and {{math|1=–a = (–1) a}}.

==Examples==

===Rational numbers===
Rational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.
They are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|−''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac b a \cdot \frac a b  = \frac{ba}{ab} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac a b \cdot \left(\frac c d + \frac e f \right) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac a b  \cdot \left(\frac c d  \cdot \frac f f + \frac e f \cdot \frac d d \right) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{a}{b} \cdot \left(\frac{cf}{df} + \frac{ed}{fd}\right) = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{cf + ed}{df} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \frac{acf}{bdf} +  \frac{aed}{bdf} = \frac{ac}{bd} +  \frac{ae}{bf} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac a b \cdot \frac c d + \frac a b \cdot \frac e f.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Real and complex numbers===

[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]

{{main|Real number| Complex number}}
The [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions
:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,
where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}.
Addition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces
:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ac''−''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}
It is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &amp;ndash;less intuitively&amp;ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.

===Constructible numbers===
[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]
{{main|Constructible numbers}}
 
In antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through ''B'' in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly &lt;math&gt;h=\sqrt p&lt;/math&gt; from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.

Not all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3] 2&lt;/math&gt; is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.

In addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,

: {{math|1=''A'' · (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' · ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' · ''B'' + ''A'' · ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.

This field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.

==Elementary notions==
In this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.

===Consequences of the definition===
One has {{math|1=''a'' · 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=−''a'' = (−1) · ''a''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|–1}}.

If {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0, then 
{{math|1=0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;(''ab'') = (''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].

===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===
The axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.

Similarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{nowrap|(''F'' \ {0}, ·)}} or just {{math|''F'' \ {0}}} or {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}. 

A field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|⟨''F'', +, ·, −, &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1⟩}} of type {{math|⟨2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0⟩}}, such that {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not defined, {{math|⟨''F'', +, –, 0⟩}} and 
{{math|⟨''F'' ∖ {0}, ·, &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⟩}} are abelian groups, and 
· is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|−''a''}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.

The requirement {{math|1 ≠ 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.

Every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).

===Characteristic===
In addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' ⋅ ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum
:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)

If there is no positive integer such that
:{{math|1=''n'' ⋅ 1 = 0}},
then {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=§I.2, p.&amp;nbsp;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.
For example, the field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.

If {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' ⋅ ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that 
:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}},
since all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; := ''a'' ⋅ ''a'' ⋅ ... ⋅ ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]
:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &amp;rarr; ''F'', ''x'' ⟼ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
is compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.

===Subfields and prime fields===
A ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 ∊ ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' ∊ ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' · ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|–''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.

[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &amp;rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}. All field homomorphisms are [[injective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=section I.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''f''}} is also [[surjective]], it is called an isomorphism (or the fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called isomorphic).

A field is called a [[prime field]] if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite fields==
{{main|Finite field}}
''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a field with four elements. Its subfield {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.

[[File:Clock_group.svg|thumb|In modular arithmetic modulo&amp;nbsp;12, 9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 since 9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13 in {{math|'''Z'''}}, which divided by 12 leaves remainder&amp;nbsp;1. Since 12 is not a prime, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field, though.]]
The simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic "modulo {{math|''n''}}" means to work with the numbers
:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}.}}
The addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''⋅''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''⋅''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Every finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A field with {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial 
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''}}.
Such a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.

==History==
Historically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;omega;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}
(with {{math|&amp;omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[François Viète]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}
for a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Évariste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.

In 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''Körper'', which means "body" or "corpus" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term "field" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.
|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&amp;pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&amp;pi;}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].

==Constructing fields==

===Constructing fields from rings===
A [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=§II.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = ±1}}.

In the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].

Given a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

====Field of fractions====

Given an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=k}^\infty a_i x^i \ (k \in \Z, a_i \in F)&lt;/math&gt;
over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &amp;ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.

====Residue fields====
In addition the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field ''E'') is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field
:{{math|1={{nowrap begin}}''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''p''(''X'')).{{nowrap end}}}}
This field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.
For example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol i, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(i) = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') ∊ '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R[X]/\left(X^2 + 1\right) \ \stackrel \cong \longrightarrow \ \mathbf C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constructing fields within a bigger field===
Fields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to ''E''. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' ⊂ ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.

The [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field extensions===
{{See|Glossary of field theory}}
The notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' ⊂ ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by
:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},
and read "{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}".

A basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.
Extensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.

====Algebraic extensions====
A pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]
:{{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ··· + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}},
with {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0}}. 
For example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation
:{{math|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0}}.
A field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \ \ a_k \in E.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &amp;minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.

====Transcendence bases====
The above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.

Once again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.

A subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, §14, No. 2, Theorem 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.

===Closure operations===
A field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]
:{{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ··· + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''F'', ''n'' &gt; 0}},
has a solution {{math|''x'' ∊ ''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0}}
does not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).

By the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.

Any field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{Overline|''F''}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{Overline|''F''}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, §7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields with additional structure==
Since fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.

===Ordered fields===
{{main|Ordered field}}
A field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|''xy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation
:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
only has the solution {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, §2.3, Corollary 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all possible orders on a fixed field ''F'' is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] W(''F'') of [[quadratic form]]s over ''F'', to '''Z'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=§22, Theorem 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression
:{{nowrap|1 + 1 + ··· + 1}}
whose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.

[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]
An ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &amp;hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.

Since every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.

The [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].

===Topological fields===
Another refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set ''F'' is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' ↦ &amp;minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' ↦ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function
:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' × ''F'' → '''R''',}}
that measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.

The [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the "gaps" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a "gap" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''/''q''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is as small as desired.
The following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;∞}}) is zero.

{| class="wikitable"
! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence
|-
| {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}}} || {{math|1=&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}
|-
| {{math|'''Q'''}} 
|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}
|| {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[p-adic number|{{math|''p''}}-adic numbers]]
|| {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|-
| {{math|''F''(''t'')}} ({{math|''F''}} any field)
|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation
|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}
|| {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|}

The field {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of [[complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gouvêa|1997|loc=§5.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local fields====
The following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them "completely anomalous".&lt;/ref&gt;
* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (local fields of characteristic zero)
* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).

These two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' ∈ '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t'' ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:
* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.
* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Gal}\left(\mathbf Q_p\left(p^{1/p^\infty}\right)\right) \cong \operatorname {Gal}\left(\mathbf F_p((t))\left(t^{1/p^\infty}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Differential fields===
[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=§1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.

==Galois theory==
{{main|Galois theory}}

Galois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form
:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},
where {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.

For a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|σ : ''F'' → ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=§VI.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (can not be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} can ''not'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{\ }&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&amp;ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]:
:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &amp;ge; 5}}).

The [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras
:{{math|''F''  ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''F'' ≅ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
This fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[Étale fundamental group]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariants of fields==

Basic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gouvêa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).

===Model theory of fields===
In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is
:{{math|&amp;phi;(''E'')}} = "for any {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).
The [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&amp;phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by
:{{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;rarr;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}},
since it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}: [[Łoś's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&amp;phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{overline|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are algebraically closed by Łoś's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ulim}_{p \to \infty} \overline \mathbf F_p \cong \mathbf C.&lt;/math&gt;
The Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})
:{{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}.
In addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &amp;rarr; ''F''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The absolute Galois group===
For fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be shown to be the [[Prüfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by
:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; / '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.
A description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely
:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''F'', '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

===K-theory===
[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;K_n^M(F) = F^\times \otimes \cdots \otimes F^\times / \langle x \otimes (1-x)\mid x \in F \smallsetminus \{0, 1\} \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \mu_l^{\otimes n}).&lt;/math&gt;
[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') = ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') agrees with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.

==Applications==

===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===
[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]
If {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}, then the [[equation]] 
:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}
has a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=§3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.

[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===

[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]
A widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing
:{{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a'' ⋅ ''a'' ⋅ ... ⋅ ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}})
in a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation
:{{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''}}.
In [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form
:{{math|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.

Finite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].

===Geometry: field of functions===
[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]
[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:
:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' ⋅ ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') ⋅ ''g''(''x'')}}}}.
This makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].

For having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
form a field, called field of functions.

This occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.

The [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.

The function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=§13, Theorem A}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.

===Number theory: global fields===

[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].
They are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).

[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]
[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(ζ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|ζ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}ζ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|ζ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 1}} for all {{math|''m'' &lt; ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Local fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, whose solutions can easily be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker–Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field
:{{math|'''Q'''(&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' &amp;ge; 2)}}
obtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, &lt;math&gt;F=\mathbf Q(\sqrt{-d})&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|''d'' &gt; 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.

==Related notions==

In addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &amp;ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.

There are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]] form a Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division rings===
[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball can not be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]

Dropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.&lt;/ref&gt; The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the [[hairy ball theorem]] illustrated at the right.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Spacecraft flight dynamics''' is the science of [[space vehicle]] performance, stability, and control. It requires analysis of the [[six degrees of freedom]] of the vehicle's flight, which are similar to those of aircraft: [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in three dimensional axes; and its [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] about the vehicle's center of mass in these axes, known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'', with respect to a defined [[frame of reference]].

[[dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] is the modeling of the changing position and orientation of a vehicle, in response to external forces acting on the body. For a spacecraft, these forces are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth or other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere of the Earth]] or other body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.&lt;ref&gt;Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent. See [[Gravity-gradient stabilization]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, [[Solar power|solar power generation]], communications, or [[astronomical observation]]).

The principles of flight dynamics are normally used to control a spacecraft by means of an [[inertial navigation system]] in conjunction with an [[attitude control system]]. Together, they create a subsystem of the spacecraft bus often called &lt;abbr title="Attitude Determination and Control System"&gt;ADCS&lt;/abbr&gt;.

==Basic principles==
A spacecraft's flight is determined by application of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[second law of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] sum of all forces exerted on the vehicle, m is its current mass, and '''a''' is the acceleration vector, the instantaneous rate of change of velocity ('''v'''), which in turn is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement. Solving for '''a''', acceleration equals the force sum divided by mass. Acceleration is integrated over time to get velocity, and velocity is in turn integrated to get position.

For powered atmospheric flight, the three main forces which act on a vehicle are [[propulsion|propulsive force]], [[aerodynamic force]], and [[gravity|gravitation]]. Other external forces such as [[centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]], are generally insignificant due to the relatively short time of powered flight, and may generally neglected in simplified performance calculations.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11-154}}

===Propulsion===

===Atmospheric force===
Aerodynamic forces, present near a body with significant atmosphere such as [[Earth]], [[Mars]] or [[Venus]], are analyzed as: [[lift (force)|lift]], defined as the force component perpendicular to the direction of flight (not necessarily upward to balance gravity, as for an airplane); and [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], the component parallel to, and in the opposite direction of flight. Lift and drag are modeled as the products of a coefficient times [[dynamic pressure]] acting on a reference area:{{sfnp|Anderson| pp=257–261}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = C_L q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = C_D q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly linear with ''α'', the angle of attack between the vehicle axis and the direction of flight (up to a limiting value), and is 0 at ''α'' = 0 for an axisymmetric body;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; varies with ''α''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; vary with [[Reynolds number]] and [[Mach number]];
*''q'', the dynamic pressure, is equal to 1/2 ''ρv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''ρ'' is atmospheric density, modeled for Earth as a function of altitude in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (using an assumed temperature distribution, [[hydrostatic pressure]] variation, and the [[ideal gas law]]); and
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is a characteristic area of the vehicle, such as cross-sectional area at the maximum diameter.

===Gravitation===
&lt;!--The force that a celestial body exerts on a spacecraft is given by:--&gt;

==Powered flight==
[[File:Space launch flight diagram improved.png|thumb|right|Velocity, position, and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during launch]]
Flight calculations are made quite precisely for space missions, taking into account such factors as the Earth's [[oblateness]] and non-uniform mass distribution; gravitational forces of all nearby bodies, including the Moon, Sun, and other planets; and three-dimensional flight path. For preliminary performance analysis, some simplifying assumptions can be made: the planet is spherical and uniform; the vehicle can be simulated as a point mass; flight path assumes a two-body [[patched conic approximation]]; and the  local flight path lies in a single plane) with reasonably small loss of accuracy.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

The general case of a launch from Earth must take engine thrust, aerodynamic forces, and gravity into account. The acceleration equation can be reduced from vector to scalar form by resolving it into its tangential (speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and angular (flight path angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to local vertical) time rate-of-change components relative to the launch pad. The two equations thus become:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha} m - \frac D m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{ F\sin\alpha }{mv} + \frac L {mv} + \left( \frac g v - \frac v r \right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''F'' is the engine thrust;
:''α'' is the angle of attack;
:''m'' is the vehicle's mass;
:''D'' is the vehicle's [[drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]];
:''L'' is its [[lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]];
:''r'' is the radial distance to the planet's center; and
:''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]], which varies with the inverse square of the radial distance:
::&lt;math&gt;g = g_0\left(\frac{r_0}r\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

Mass decreases as propellant is consumed and [[multistage rocket|rocket stages]], engines or tanks are shed (if applicable).

[[Numerical integration]] of the two rate equations from time zero (when both ''v'' and ''θ'' are 0) gives planet-fixed values of v and θ at any time in the flight:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{v}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{\theta}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

[[Finite element analysis]] can be used to integrate the equations, by breaking the flight into small time increments.

For most launch vehicles, relatively small levels of lift are generated, and a [[gravity turn]] is employed, depending mostly on the third term of the angle rate equation. At the moment of liftoff, when angle and velocity are both zero, the theta-dot equation is [[indeterminate form|mathematically indeterminate]] and cannot be evaluated until velocity becomes non-zero shortly after liftoff. But notice at this condition, the only force which can cause the vehicle to pitch over is the engine thrust acting at a non-zero angle of attack (first term) and perhaps a slight amount of lift (second term), until a non-zero pitch angle is attained. In the gravity turn, pitch-over is initiated by applying an increasing angle of attack (by means of [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled engine thrust]]), followed by a gradual decrease in angle of attack through the remainder of the flight.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}{{sfnp|Glasstone|1965|p=209|loc=§4.97}}

Once velocity and flight path angle are known, altitude &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and downrange distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are computed as:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

[[File:Gravity turn - landing - phase 2.svg|thumb|right|Velocity and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during powered descent and landing]]
:&lt;math&gt;h = \int_{t_0}^t v \cos \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0+h\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = r_0 \int_{t_0}^t \frac v r \sin \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The planet-fixed values of ''v'' and ''θ'' are converted to space-fixed (inertial) values with the following conversions:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_s = \sqrt{v^2 + 2\omega r v \cos\varphi \sin\theta \sin A_z + (\omega r \cos\theta)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the planet's rotational rate in radians per second, ''φ'' is the launch site latitude, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the launch [[azimuth]] angle.
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_s = \arccos\left(\frac{ v \cos\theta}{v_s} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r'' must match the requirements of the target orbit as determined by orbital mechanics (see [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]], below), where final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is usually the required periapsis (or circular) velocity, and final ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is 90 degrees. A powered descent analysis would use the same procedure, with reverse boundary conditions.

==Attitude control==
{{main|Attitude control}}
{{Technical|section|date=December 2011}}

Attitude control is the exercise of control over the orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity (the celestial sphere, certain fields, nearby objects, etc.).  The attitude of a craft can be described using three mutually perpendicular axes of rotation, generally referred to as roll, pitch, and yaw angles respectively (with the roll axis in line with the primary engine direction of thrust).  Orientation can be determined by calibration using an external guidance system, such as determining the angles to a reference star or the Sun, then internally monitored using an inertial system of mechanical or optical [[gyroscopes]].  Orientation is a vector quantity described by three angles for the instantaneous direction, and the instantaneous rates of roll in all three axes of rotation.  The aspect of control implies both awareness of the instantaneous orientation and rates of roll and the ability to change the roll rates to assume a new orientation using either a [[reaction control system]] or other means.
 
Newton's second law, applied to rotational rather than linear motion, becomes:{{sfnp|Beer &amp; Johnston| 1972| p=499}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = I_x\mathbf{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''τ''' is the net [[torque]] (or ''moment'') exerted on the vehicle, I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[moment of inertia]] about the axis of rotation, and '''α''' is the angular acceleration vector in radians per second per second. Therefore, the rotational rate in degrees per second per second is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha} = (180/\pi)\mathbf{T}/I_x,&lt;/math&gt;

and the angular rotation rate '''ω''' (degrees per second) is obtained by integrating '''α''' over time, and the angular rotation '''θ''' is the time integral of the rate, analogous to linear motion. The three principal moments of inertia I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; about the roll, pitch and yaw axes, are determined through the spacecraft's center of mass.

Attitude control torque, absent aerodynamic forces, is frequently applied by a [[reaction control system]], a set of thrusters located about the vehicle. The thrusters are fired, either manually or under automatic guidance control, in short bursts to achieve the desired rate of rotation, and then fired in the opposite direction to halt rotation at the desired position. The torque about a specific axis is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = \sum_{i=1}^N(r_i \times \mathbf{F_i} ), &lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is its distance from the center of mass, and '''F''' is the thrust of an individual thruster (only the component of '''F''' perpendicular to '''r''' is included.)

For situations where propellant consumption may be a problem (such as long-duration satellites or space stations), alternative means may be used to provide the control torque, such as [[reaction wheel]]s or [[control moment gyroscope]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Orbital flight==
{{Further|Orbital mechanics}}

Orbital mechanics are used to calculate flight in orbit about a central body. For sufficiently high orbits (generally at least {{convert|100|nmi|km|disp=flip|sp=us|abbr=off}} in the case of Earth), aerodynamic force may be assumed to be negligible for relatively short term missions (though a small amount of drag may be present which results in decay of orbital energy over longer periods of time.) When the central body's mass is much larger than the spacecraft, and other bodies are sufficiently far away, the solution of orbital trajectories can be treated as a two-body problem.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}}

This can be shown to result in the trajectory being ideally a [[conic section]] (circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola){{sfnp| Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | pp=11-40}} with the central body located at one focus. Orbital trajectories are either circles or ellipses; the parabolic trajectory represents first escape of the vehicle from the central body's gravitational field. Hyperbolic trajectories are escape trajectories with excess velocity, and will be covered under [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Interplanetary flight|Interplanetary flight]] below.

Elliptical orbits are characterized by three elements.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}} The semi-major axis ''a'' is the average of the radius at [[apsis|apoapsis and periapsis]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{r_a + r_p} 2 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] ''e'' can then be calculated for an ellipse, knowing the apses:
:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{r_a} a - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital period|time period for a complete orbit]] is dependent only on the semi-major axis, and is independent of eccentricity:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=33 }}

: &lt;math&gt; TP = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3} \mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]] of the central body.

[[File:Orbit1.svg|thumb|200px|right|The angular [[orbital elements]] of a spacecraft orbiting a central body, defining orientation of the orbit in relation to its fundamental reference plane]]
The orientation of the orbit in space is specified by three angles:
*The ''inclination'' ''i'', of the orbital plane with the fundamental plane (this is usually a planet or moon's equatorial plane, or in the case of a solar orbit, the Earth's orbital plane around the Sun, known as the [[ecliptic]].) Positive inclination is northward, while negative inclination is southward.
*The ''longitude of the ascending node'' Ω, measured in the fundamental plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from a reference direction (usually the [[vernal equinox]]) to the line where the spacecraft crosses this plane from south to north. (If inclination is zero, this angle is undefined and taken as 0.)
*The ''argument of periapsis'' ''ω'', measured in the orbital plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from the ascending node to the periapsis. If the inclination is 0, there is no ascending node, so ''ω'' is measured from the reference direction. For a circular orbit, there is no periapsis, so ''ω'' is taken as 0.

The orbital plane is ideally constant, but is usually subject to small perturbations caused by planetary oblateness and the presence of other bodies.

The spacecraft's position in orbit is specified by the ''true anomaly,'' &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, an angle measured from the periapsis, or for a circular orbit, from the ascending node or reference direction. The ''semi-latus rectum'', or radius at 90 degrees from periapsis, is:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=24}}
:&lt;math&gt;p = a(1-e^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The radius at any position in flight is:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac p {1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the velocity at that position is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left(\frac 2 r - \frac 1 a\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Types of orbit===
====Circular====
For a circular orbit, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'', and eccentricity is 0. Circular velocity at a given radius is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_c = \sqrt{\frac\mu r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Elliptical====
For an elliptical orbit, ''e'' is greater than 0 but less than 1. The periapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the apoapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_a = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The limiting condition is a '''parabolic escape orbit''', when ''e'' = 1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes infinite. Escape velocity at periapsis is then
:&lt;math&gt;v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Flight path angle===
The ''specific angular momentum'' of any conic orbit, ''h'', is constant, and is equal to the product of radius and velocity at periapsis. At any other point in the orbit, it is equal to:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=18}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r v\cos\varphi,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''φ'' is the flight path angle measured from the local horizontal (perpendicular to&amp;nbsp;''r''.) This allows the calculation of ''φ'' at any point in the orbit, knowing radius and velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \arccos\left(\frac{r_p v_p}{r v}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that flight path angle is a constant 0 degrees (90 degrees from local vertical) for a circular orbit.

===True anomaly as a function of time===
It can be shown that the angular momentum equation given above also relates the rate of change in true anomaly to ''r'', ''v'', and ''φ'', thus the true anomaly can be found as a function of time since periapsis passage by integration:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White |1971| pp=31-32}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = r_p v_p \int_{t_p}^t \frac 1 {r^2} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the time required to reach a given anomaly is:
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac 1 {r_p v_p} \int_0^\nu r^2 \, d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

===Orbital maneuvers===
{{see also|Orbital maneuver}}
Once in orbit, a spacecraft may fire rocket engines to make in-plane changes to a different altitude or type of orbit, or to change its orbital plane. These maneuvers require changes in the craft's velocity, and the [[classical rocket equation]] is used to calculate the propellant requirements for a given [[delta-v]]. A [[delta-v budget|delta-''v'' budget]] will add up all the propellant requirements, or determine the total delta-v available from a given amount of propellant, for the mission.

====In-plane changes====
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

====Change of plane====
Plane change maneuvers can be performed alone or in conjunction with other orbit adjustments. For a pure rotation plane change maneuver, consisting only of a change in the inclination of the orbit, the specific angular momentum, ''h'', of the initial and final orbits are equal in magnitude but not in direction. Therefore the change in specific angular momentum can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta h = 2h\sin\left(\frac {|\Delta i|}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the specific angular momentum before the plane change, and Δ''i'' is the desired change in the inclination angle. From this it can be shown{{sfnp|Hintz|2015|p=112}} that the required delta-''v'' is:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = \frac {2h\sin\frac {|\Delta i|}{2}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of ''h'', this can also be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = 2v\cos \varphi\sin\left(\frac {\left|\Delta i\right|} 2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the magnitude of velocity before plane change and ''φ'' is the flight path angle. Using the [[small-angle approximation]], this becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v \cos(\varphi) \left|\Delta i\right|&lt;/math&gt;

The total delta-''v'' for a combined maneuver can be calculated by a vector addition of the pure rotation delta-''v'' and the delta-''v'' for the other planned orbital change.

==Translunar flight==
[[File:Tli.svg|thumb|200px|right|A typical translunar trajectory]]
Vehicles sent on lunar or planetary missions are generally not launched by direct injection to departure trajectory, but first put into a low Earth [[low Earth orbit|parking orbit]]; this allows the flexibility of a bigger [[launch window]] and more time for checking that the vehicle is in proper condition for the flight. A popular misconception is that escape velocity is required for flight to the Moon; it is not. Rather, the vehicle's apogee is raised high enough to take it to a point (before it reaches apogee) where it enters the Moon's gravitational [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] (though the required velocity is close to that of escape.) This is defined as the distance from a satellite at which its gravitational pull on a spacecraft equals that of its central body, which is

: &lt;math&gt;r_\text{SOI} = D\left(\frac{m_s}{m_c}\right)^{2/5},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the mean distance from the satellite to the central body, and
''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the central body and satellite, respectively. This value is approximately {{convert|66300|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from Earth's Moon.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller and White| 1971| pp=333–334}}

A significant portion of the vehicle's flight (other than immediate proximity to the Earth or Moon) requires accurate solution as a [[three-body problem]], but may be preliminarily modeled as a [[patched conic approximation]].

===Translunar injection===
{{Main|Translunar injection}}
This must be timed so that the Moon will be in position to capture the vehicle, and might be modeled to a first approximation as a Hohmann transfer. However, the rocket burn duration is usually long enough, and occurs during a sufficient change in flight path angle, that this is not very accurate, requiring instead integration of a simplified version of the velocity and angle rate equations given above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Powered flight|Powered flight]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha}m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{F\sin\alpha}{mv} + \left(\frac g v - \frac v r\right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-course corrections===
A simple lunar trajectory stays in one plane, resulting in lunar flyby or orbit within a small range of inclination to the Moon's equator. This also permits a "free return", in which the spacecraft would return to the appropriate position for reentry into the Earth's atmosphere if it were not injected into lunar orbit. Relatively small velocity changes are usually required to correct for trajectory errors. Such a trajectory was used for the [[Apollo 8]], [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], and [[Apollo 12]] manned lunar missions.

Greater flexibility in lunar orbital or landing site coverage (at greater angles of lunar inclination) can be obtained by performing a plane change maneuver mid-flight; however, this takes away the free-return option, as the new plane would take the spacecraft's emergency return trajectory away from the Earth's atmospheric re-entry point, and leave the spacecraft in a high Earth orbit. This type of trajectory was used for the last five Apollo missions (13 through 17).

===Lunar orbit insertion===
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

==Interplanetary flight==
In order to completely leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] trajectory relative to the departure planet is necessary, with excess velocity added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun. The desired heliocentric transfer orbit to a [[superior planet]] will have its [[perihelion]] at the departure planet, requiring the hyperbolic excess velocity to be applied in the posigrade direction, when the spacecraft is away from the Sun. To an [[inferior planet]] destination, [[aphelion]] will be at the departure planet, and the excess velocity is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. For accurate mission calculations, the orbital elements of the planets must be obtained from an [[ephemeris]],{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=359}} such as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|that published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

For the purpose of preliminary mission analysis and feasibility studies, certain simplified assumptions may be made to enable delta-v calculation with very small error:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}}
*All the planets' orbits except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have very small eccentricity, and therefore may be assumed to be circular at a constant orbital speed and mean distance from the Sun.
*All the planets' orbits (except Mercury) are nearly coplanar, with very small inclination to the [[ecliptic]] (3.39 degrees or less; Mercury's inclination is 7.00 degrees).
*The perturbating effects of the other planets' gravity is negligible.
*The spacecraft will spend most of its flight time under only the gravitational influence of the Sun, except for brief periods when it is in the [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] of the departure and destination planets.

Since interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in [[heliocentric orbit]] between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away from each other, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}} The patch point between the hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet and the heliocentric transfer orbit occurs at the planet's sphere of influence radius relative to the Sun, as defined above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]]. Given the Sun's mass ratio of 333,432 times that of Earth and distance of {{convert|149,500,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, the Earth's sphere of influence radius is {{convert|924,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} (roughly 1,000,000 kilometers).{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971|p=368}}

===Heliocentric transfer orbit===
The transfer orbit required to carry the spacecraft from the departure planet's orbit to the destination planet is chosen among several options:
* A [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] requires the least possible propellant and delta-v; this is half of an elliptical orbit with [[apsis|aphelion and perihelion]] tangential to both planets' orbits, with the longest outbound flight time equal to half the period of the ellipse. This is known as a [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]-class mission.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |p=3}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} There is no "free return" option, because if the spacecraft does not enter orbit around the destination planet and instead completes the transfer orbit, the departure planet will not be in its original position. Using another Hohmann transfer to return requires a significant loiter time at the destination planet, resulting in a very long total round-trip mission time.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}} Science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] wrote in his 1951 book ''The Exploration of Space'' that an Earth-to-Mars round trip would require 259 days outbound and another 259 days inbound, with a 425-day stay at Mars.
* Increasing the departure apsis speed (and thus the semi-major axis) results in a trajectory which crosses the destination planet's orbit non-tangentially before reaching the opposite apsis, increasing delta-v but cutting the outbound transit time below the maximum.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}}
* A [[gravity assist]] maneuver, sometimes known as a "slingshot maneuver" or ''Crocco mission'' after its 1956 proposer [[Gaetano Crocco]], results in an [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]-class mission with a much shorter dwell time at the destination.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} This is accomplished by swinging past another planet, using its gravity to alter the orbit. A round trip to Mars, for example, can be significantly shortened from the 943 days required for the conjunction mission, to under a year, by swinging past Venus on return to the Earth.

===Hyperbolic departure===
The required hyperbolic excess velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (sometimes called ''characteristic velocity'') is the difference between the transfer orbit's departure speed and the departure planet's heliocentric orbital speed. Once this is determined, the injection velocity relative to the departure planet at periapsis is:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=369}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p} + v_\infty^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The excess velocity vector for a hyperbola is displaced from the periapsis tangent by a characteristic angle, therefore the periapsis injection burn must lead the planetary departure point by the same angle:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \arcsin\frac 1 e\,&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric equation for eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be used for a hyperbola. But the eccentricity can be calculated from dynamics formulations as:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=372}}

:&lt;math&gt;e = \sqrt{1+\frac{2\varepsilon h^2}{\mu^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where h is the specific angular momentum as given above in the [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] section, calculated at the periapsis:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r_p v_p,\,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''ε'' is the specific energy:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}2 - \frac \mu r\,&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the equations for r and v given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]] depend on the semi-major axis, and thus are unusable for an escape trajectory. But setting radius at periapsis equal to the r equation at zero 
anomaly gives an alternate expression for the semi-latus rectum:

:&lt;math&gt;p = r_p(1 + e),\,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a more general equation for radius versus anomaly which is usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{r_p(1 + e)}{1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the alternate expression for p also gives an alternate expression for a (which is defined for a hyperbola, but no longer represents the semi-major axis). This gives an equation for velocity versus radius which is likewise usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left (\frac{2}{r}-\frac{(1-e^2)}{r_p(1+e)}\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equations for flight path angle and anomaly versus time given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] are also usable for hyperbolic trajectories.

===Launch windows===
There is a great deal of variation with time of the velocity change required for a mission, because of the constantly varying relative positions of the planets. Therefore, optimum launch windows are often chosen from the results of [[porkchop plot]]s that show contours of characteristic energy (v&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) plotted versus departure and arrival time.

==Atmospheric entry==
{{main|Atmospheric entry}}
''Atmospheric entry'' is the movement of human-made or natural objects as they enter the [[atmosphere]] of a [[celestial body]] from [[outer space]]—in the case of [[Earth]] from an [[altitude]] above the [[Kármán Line]], (100&amp;nbsp;km).  This topic is heavily concerned with the process of controlled ''re''entry of [[spacecraft|vehicles]] which are intended to reach the planetary surface intact, but the topic also includes uncontrolled (or minimally controlled) cases, such as the intentionally or circumstantially occurring, destructive deorbiting of [[Artificial satellites|satellites]] and the falling back to the planet of "[[Space debris|space junk]]" due to [[orbital decay]].

[[File:Fridericus Spee SJ.jpg|thumb|Contemporary portrait]]
'''Friedrich Spee''' (also ''Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld''; February 25, 1591 – August 7, 1635) was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer.

==Life==
[[File:Paderborn - 2016-09-14 - Friedrich Spee (2).jpg|thumb|Statue in Paderborn]]
Spee was born at [[Kaiserswerth]] on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]]. On finishing his early education at [[Cologne]], he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher&lt;ref name="Hellyer"/&gt; at [[Trier]], [[Fulda]], [[Würzburg]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], where he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1622. He became [[professor]] at the [[University of Paderborn]] in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, [[Wesel]], Trier and Cologne, and preached at [[Paderborn]], Cologne and [[Hildesheim]].

An attempt to assassinate Spee was made at [[Peine]] in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the [[Thirty Years' War]]), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

==Publications==
[[File:Trutz nachtigal 1654.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Trutz-Nachtigal'']]
Spee's literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: ''Goldenes Tugendbuch'' (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and ''Trutznachtigall'' (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present.

His principal work, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' (Precautions for Prosecutors), is a layout for the prosecution of witchcraft, based on his own experiences in [[Westphalia]]. It is thought that he acted for a long time as "witch confessor" in Würzburg, as he seemed to have knowledge of what could be considered the private thoughts of the condemned. The book was printed in Latin in 1631 at [[Rinteln]] without Spee's name or permission. He did not advocate the immediate abolition of trials for witchcraft, but described with [[sarcasm]] the abuses in the prevailing legal proceedings, particularly the use of the [[rack (torture)|rack]]. He demanded measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. If these had been carried out, they would have quickly put an end to the mass persecution of suspected witches.

Nevertheless, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' did bring about the abolition of witch-burning in a number of places, especially at [[Mainz]], and led the way to its gradual suppression. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Even in the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations appeared. Among the members of Spee's Jesuit order, his treatise found a favourable reception. A memorable observation in the book suggested that Germany and England must have more witches and devils than Spain and Italy, since there were so many more stake burnings in the former. This may have been a not so subtle criticism of Protestant reform Europe, which he believed was guilty of even greater abuses than the Catholic countries. His book is still in print.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

===Arguments against torture===
[[File:Cautio criminalis 1631.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Cautio Criminalis'', attributed to "unknown Roman theologian"]]
''Cautio Criminalis'' contains 52 questions which Spee argued and attempted to answer.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Amongst his more notable conclusions were:

* (17) That alleged witches should be provided a [[lawyer]] and a [[legal defense]], the enormity of the crime making this right even more important than normal.
* (20) That there is a real risk that innocents will confess under torture simply to stop the pain.
* (25) That condemning alleged witches for ''not'' confessing under torture is absurd. Spee opposed the notion that such silence was itself evidence of sorcery, as this made everyone guilty.
* (27) That torture does not produce truth, since those who wish to stop their own suffering can stop it with either the truth or with lies.
* (44) That denunciations of accomplices by tortured "witches" were of little value: either the tortured person was innocent, in which case she had no accomplices, or she was really in league with the [[Devil]], in which case her denunciations could not be trusted either.

Spee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion:

:''Many people who incite the [[Inquisition]] so vehemently against sorcerers in their towns and villages are not at all aware and do not notice or foresee that once they have begun to clamor for torture, every person tortured must denounce several more. The trials will continue, so eventually the denunciations will inevitably reach them and their families, since, as I warned above, no end will be found until everyone has been burned.'' (question 15)&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

Spee did not dispute the existence of witches, and opened his work with a declaration that witches are real. However, he was most troubled that innocent people were being tortured and killed alongside real witches, as he strongly believed. He argued (question 13) that the [[Parable of the Weeds]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:24-30 meant that some of the guilty must be allowed freedom, so that the innocent are not condemned either.

===Hymn writer===
[[File:Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld Briefmarke zum 400. Geburtstag.JPG|thumb|German postage stamp honoring Spee's 400th birthday (1991)]]
Spee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the [[Advent song]] "[[O Heiland, reiß die Himmel auf]]", the [[Christmas carol]]s "[[Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt]]" and "{{lang|de|[[Zu Bethlehem geboren]]|italic=no}}", and the Easter hymn "[[Lasst uns erfreuen]]" widely used with the 20th-century English texts "[[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]]" and "[[All Creatures of Our God and King]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5797">'''''Geronimo''''' is a [[US Army]] airborne [[Interjection|exclamation]] occasionally used by jumping [[skydiver]]s or, more generally, anyone about to jump from a great [[height]], or as a general exclamation of [[Anticipation|exhilaration]]. The cry originated in the [[United States]].

==Origins==
At least two different explanations place the origins of the exclamation in [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where some of the first of the [[US Army]]'s [[parachute]] jumps occurred in the 1940s.

According to paratrooper Gerard Devlin, this exclamation dates from August 1940 and is attributed to Private Aubrey Eberhardt, member of parachute test platoon at Fort Benning. The parachute had only recently been adopted for troop drops, and this platoon was the first to test it. On the eve of their first jump, the platoon decided to calm their nerves by spending the day before taking in a film at the Main Post Theatre and a night at the local [[beer garden]]. The film they saw was a [[Western (genre)|Western]] featuring the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Geronimo]]. Its title is uncertain, but it was probably the 1939 film ''[[Geronimo (1939 film)|Geronimo]]'' with [[Andy Devine]] and [[Lone Ranger]] star [[Chief Thundercloud]] in the title role.

On the way back to barracks, Eberhardt's comrades taunted him saying that he would be too scared to remember his name. Eberhardt retorted, "All right, dammit! I tell you jokers what I'm gonna do! To prove to you that I'm not scared out of my wits when I jump, I'm gonna yell ''Geronimo'' loud as hell when I go out that door tomorrow!" Eberhardt kept his promise, and the cry was gradually adopted by the other members of his platoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Gerard M|title=Paratrooper!|year=1979|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Richard Winters'', Winters offers a different explanation: The [[501st Infantry Regiment (United States)|501st Parachute Infantry Regiment]] at [[Fort Benning]] was due to go on the first jump. At the time there was a popular song called "Geronimo" on the radio, which quickly became a favorite amongst the troops. The cry became known to the commanding officer who insisted they would instead jump out and cry ''"Currahee"'', [[Currahee Mountain|the name of a mountain]] at [[Camp Toccoa]], their first training camp. The paratroopers had run up and down the mountain frequently during training, the run known to the troops as "3 miles up, 3 miles down".

There is also a third explanation. Medicine Bluffs on Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where Geronimo was jailed as prisoner of war and his grave is located, are steep cliffs and have come to be known as Geronimo's Bluff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/medicine-bluffs-geronimo/view/google/|title=Medicine Bluffs - Geronimo! in Fort Sill, OK (Google Maps)|date=12 December 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oksenate.gov/senate_artwork/images/artwork/medicine_bluff_at_ft_sill.html|title=Oklahoma State Senate - Senate Artwork|website=www.oksenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall tales were told about Geronimo while at Fort Sill. It was said that one day Geronimo, with the army in hot pursuit, made a leap on horseback down an almost vertical cliff, a feat that the posse could not duplicate. The legend continues that in the midst of this jump to freedom he gave out the bloodcurdling cry of "Geronimo-o-o!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/146|title=Attempted Encroachment on the Medicine Bluffs - Native American Netroots|website=nativeamericannetroots.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/History/_bios/geronimo_pow.htm|title=Fort Sill History - Geronimo|website=sill-www.army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[File:501-Parachute-Infantry-Regiment.svg|thumb|Emblem of the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion]]
Initially, the top brass were wary of the cry, claiming that it constituted a lack of discipline. Others said that it showed bravery and should be encouraged. Eventually the latter view won out, and when the Army's parachute infantry grew, the cry grew with it. In 1941, the Army's first parachute regiment, the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR; now called the [[501st Infantry Regiment (United States)|501st Infantry Regiment]]) incorporated the name "Geronimo" into its insignia, with the permission of the real [[Geronimo]]'s family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-westerns.com/geronimo.htm Geronimo at B-Westerns], retrieved 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_146.html The Straight Dope] Why do parachutists yell "Geronimo!" when jumping from an airplane?", retrieved 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The cry was also incorporated into the song ''Down From Heaven'' by Lieutenant Colonel Byron Paige.

By then, the coverage of the paratroopers' exploits during the war had made the cry "Geronimo" known to the wider public, and its use spread outside the military and U.S. Army.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">'''Goodsall's rule''' relates the external opening (in the perianal skin) of an [[anal fistula]] to its internal opening (in the anal canal). It states that if the perianal skin opening is posterior to the transverse anal line, the fistulous tract will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly, sometimes taking a curvilinear course. A perianal skin opening anterior to the transverse anal line is usually associated with a radial fistulous tract.

Or in more direct terms, it means that anterior-opening fistulas tend to follow a simple, direct course while posterior-opening fistulas may follow a devious, curving path with some even being horseshoe-shaped before opening in the posterior midline.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess BE. Chapter 88. Anorectal Disorders. In: Tintinalli JE, Stapczynski JS, Cline DM, Ma OJ, Cydulka RK, Meckler GD, eds. Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011. http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=6361536. Accessed June 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fistula]]s can be described as [[Anterior#Anterior and posterior|anterior or posterior]] relating to a line drawn in the [[coronal plane]] across the [[anus]], the so-called transverse anal line. Anterior fistulas will have a direct track into the anal canal. Posterior fistulas will have a curved track with their external opening lying in the posterior midline of the [[anal canal]]. An exception to the rule are anterior fistulas lying more than 2.5 cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) that opens into the posterior midline of the anal canal.

Goodsall's rule may not be applicable when the fistula is more than 2.5 cm from the anal verge. In such situations, the fistula is almost always indirect. In situations where there are multiple anal fistuale, the course would be similar to that of posterior-opening fistulae because of branching and communication between these openings.

The investigation of choice for anal fistulas is [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Fistulograms can be used to demonstrate the track of the fistula.

Goodsall's rule is named after [[David Henry Goodsall]] who described it in 1900.

M. (1980). Attributional bias among aggressive boys to interpret unambiguous social stimuli as displays of hostility. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''89''(3), 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dodge, K. A. (1980). Social cognition and children's aggressive behavior. ''Child Development'', 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dodge, K. A. (2006). Translational science in action: Hostile attributional style and the development of aggressive behavior problems. ''Development and Psychopathology'', ''18''(03), 791-814.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person with high levels of hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.

The term "hostile attribution bias" was first coined in 1980 by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, along with several other key pioneers in this research area (e.g., [[Kenneth A. Dodge]]), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of [[Social information processing (cognition)|social information processing]] (similar to other [[attribution bias]]es), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dodge, K. A. (1986). A social information processing model of social competence in children. In M. Perlmutter (Ed.), ''The Minnesota Symposium on Child Psychology: Vol. 18.'' Cognitive perspectives on children's social and behavioral development (pp. 77-125). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1994). A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment.''Psychological Bulletin'', ''115''(1), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), researchers have found that individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development are much more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or [[relational aggression]]) toward others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;De Castro, B. O., Veerman, J. W., Koops, W., Bosch, J. D., &amp; Monshouwer, H. J. (2002). Hostile attribution of intent and aggressive behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Child Development'', 916-934.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, hostile attribution bias is hypothesized to be one important pathway through which other risk factors, such as peer rejection or harsh parenting behavior, lead to [[aggression]]. For example, children exposed to peer teasing at school or child abuse at home are much more likely to develop high levels of hostile attribution bias, which then lead them to behave aggressively at school and/or at home. Thus, in addition to partially explaining one way aggression develops, hostile attribution bias also represents a target for the intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
The term hostile attribution bias first emerged in 1980 when researchers began noticing that some children, particularly aggressive and/or rejected children, tended to interpret social situations differently compared to other children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, Nasby and colleagues presented photographs of people to a group of aggressive adolescent boys (aged 10–16) and observed that a subgroup of these youth exhibited a consistent tendency to attribute hostile intent to the photographs, even when the cues were ambiguous or benign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, [[Kenneth A. Dodge]] and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected were much more likely than other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.

Early studies investigating links between hostile attribution bias and aggression were somewhat mixed, with some studies reporting no significant effects&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, K. A., Lochman, J. E., Harnish, J. D., Bates, J. E., &amp; Pettit, G. S. (1997). Reactive and proactive aggression in school children and psychiatrically impaired chronically assaultive youth. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''106''(1), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthys, W., Cuperus, J. M., &amp; Van Engeland, H. (1999). Deficient social problem-solving in boys with ODD/CD, with ADHD, and with both disorders.''Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry'', ''38''(3), 311-321.&lt;/ref&gt; or small effects&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and other studies reporting large effects.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Hudley, C., &amp; Williams, E. (1992). Attributional and emotional determinants of aggression among African-American and Latino young adolescents. ''Developmental Psychology'', ''28''(4), 731.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, I. D. (1996). Aggressive boys' hostile perceptual and response biases: The role of attention and impulsivity. ''Child Development'', ''67''(3), 1015-1033.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, over 100 studies and a [[meta-analysis]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; have documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior across various samples ranging in age, gender, race, countries, and clinical populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Theoretical formulation ==
Hostile attribution bias is typically conceptualized within a [[Social information processing (cognition)|social information processing]] framework, in which social information (e.g., during an interaction) is processed in a series of steps that leads to a behavioral reaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Accurate social information processing requires a person to engage in six steps that occur in order.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrov, J. M., &amp; Godleski, S. A. (2010). Toward an integrated gender-linked model of aggression subtypes in early and middle childhood. ''Psychological Review'', ''117''(1), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Step 1'': Accurately encode information in the brain and store it in short term memory. During this step, an individual will pay attention to and code specific stimuli/cues in their environment, including external factors (e.g., someone bumping into you; other people's reactions to the situation) and internal factors (e.g., your affective reaction to the situation). 
* ''Step 2'': Accurately interpret or give meaning to encoded information. During this step, an individual may decide if a behavior or situation was meant to be hostile or benign. 
* ''Step 3'': Decide a goal for the interaction
* ''Step 4'': Generate potential responses
* ''Step 5'': Evaluate potential responses and select the "optimal" response
* ''Step 6'': Enact chosen response
Hostile attribution bias is theorized to result from deviations in any of these steps,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; including paying attention to and encoding biased information (e.g., only paying attention to cues suggestive of hostility), biases toward negative interpretations of social interactions (e.g., more likely to interpret situation as hostile), limited ability to generate a broad range of potential responses, and difficulty appropriately evaluating responses and selecting an optimal response. Furthermore, biases in any of the steps affect the rest of the steps.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hostile attribution bias has been particularly linked to step 2 of social information processing (i.e., interpretation of information), but is linked to impairments in other steps as well, including inaccurate perception/encoding of social situations and problems with generating a broad range of potential behavioral responses.  For example, a child with high levels of hostile attribution bias may generate fewer potential responses than other children, and these responses may be limited to hostile or ineffective responses to a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, B. A., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1982). Social maladjustment and problem solving in school-aged children. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'',''50''(2), 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge theorized that hostile attribution bias arises from an individual's hostile [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] about the world that are formed through an interaction between a child's neural dispositions and his/her early exposures to hostile socialization experiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These experiences may include disrupted parental [[Attachment theory|attachment]], [[child abuse]], exposure to family violence, peer rejection or victimization, and community violence.

== Measurement ==

In research settings, hostile attribution bias is typically measured with a laboratory task, in which participants are presented with staged interaction (live actors), video, picture, audio, or written presentations of ambiguous social situations. For example, an ambiguous social situation presented might be a video of a child opening a door, causing the door to knock over a tower of toys that another child was building. After the stimulus is presented, participants would be asked to make attributions about the intent of the actor (i.e., hostile vs. benign). (For example: "''Do you think the girl who opened the door was trying to be mean, nice, or could have been mean or nice?''"). Multiple trials are administered with various ambiguous scenarios, and these attributions are then used by the researchers to determine the level of the child's hostile attribution bias. Careful selection of stimuli and comparison of stimuli across mediums is helpful for accurately assessing an individual's level of hostile attribution bias. A [[meta-analysis]] investigating the link between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior found that the strongest effect sizes were linked with actual staging of social interactions, followed by audio presentation of stimuli, then video and picture presentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Implications ==
===Aggression===

Substantial literature has documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and [[aggression]] in youth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hostile attribution bias is traditionally associated with overt physical aggression (e.g., hitting, fighting), such that higher levels of hostile attribution bias predict more aggressive behavior. In particular, much evidence suggests that hostile attribution bias is especially linked to "reactive aggression" (i.e., impulsive and "hot-blooded" aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation) rather than "proactive aggression" (i.e., unprovoked, planned/instrumental, or "cold-blooded" aggression).&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1996). Social information‐processing mechanisms in reactive and proactive aggression. ''Child Development'', ''67''(3), 993-1002.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond physical aggression, elevated hostile attribution bias is also associated with increased use of [[relational aggression]] (e.g., gossip, spreading rumors, social exclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R. (1996). The role of overt aggression, relational aggression, and prosocial behavior in the prediction of children's future social adjustment. ''Child Development'', ''67''(5), 2317-2327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., Grotpeter, J. K., &amp; Bigbee, M. A. (2002). Relationally and physically aggressive children's intent attributions and feelings of distress for relational and instrumental peer provocations. ''Child Development'', ''73''(4), 1134-1142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Werner, N. E. (1998). Response decision processes in relational and overt aggression. ''Child Development'', 1630-1639.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, N. E. (2012). Do hostile attribution biases in children and parents predict relationally aggressive behavior?. ''The Journal of Genetic Psychology'',''173''(3), 221-245.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case when youth attribute hostile intent to ambiguous relational situations (e.g., not receiving an invitation to a party or not receiving a response to a text).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, C. A., &amp; Ostrov, J. M. (2008). Differentiating forms and functions of aggression in emerging adults: Associations with hostile attribution biases and normative beliefs. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence'', ''37''(6), 713-722.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative adult outcomes===

Hostile attribution bias has also been documented in adult populations, and adults with high levels of hostile attribution bias are over 4 times more likely to die by the age of 50 than adults with low levels of hostile attribution bias.&lt;ref&gt;Barefoot, J. C., Dodge, K. A., Peterson, B. L., Dahlstrom, W. G., &amp; Williams Jr, R. B. (1989). The Cook-Medley hostility scale: item content and ability to predict survival. ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', ''51''(1), 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Hostile attribution bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence&lt;ref&gt;Holtzworth-Munroe, A., &amp; Hutchinson, G. (1993). Attributing negative intent to wife behavior: the attributions of maritally violent versus nonviolent men.''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''102''(2), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and marital/relationship dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, T. N., &amp; Fincham, F. D. (1990). Attributions in marriage: review and critique. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''107''(1), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, parents with high levels of hostile attribution bias are also much more likely to use harsh discipline and aggressive parenting,&lt;ref&gt;MacBrayer, E. K., Milich, R., &amp; Hundley, M. (2003). Attributional biases in aggressive children and their mothers. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''112''(4), 698.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nix, R.

The relation between mothers' hostile attribution tendencies and children's externalizing behavior problems: The mediating role of mothers' harsh discipline practices. ''Child Development'', 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt; which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile attribution bias and aggression across time.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, L. J., Appleyard, K., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (2011). Intergenerational continuity in child maltreatment: Mediating mechanisms and implications for prevention.''Child Development'', ''82''(1), 162-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical implications for intervention===

Hostile attribution bias has been tested as a malleable target for intervention for aggressive behaviors in youth, including in [[Cognitive restructuring|cognitive interventions]] designed to increase accurate identification of others intentions and attribution of benign intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra, N. G., &amp; Slaby, R. G. (1990). Cognitive mediators of aggression in adolescent offenders: II. Intervention. ''Developmental Psychology'', ''26''(2), 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudley, C., &amp; Graham, S. (1993). An attributional intervention to reduce peer‐directed aggression among African‐American boys. ''Child Development'', ''64''(1), 124-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukhodolsky, D. G., Golub, A., Stone, E. C., &amp; Orban, L. (2006). Dismantling anger control training for children: A randomized pilot study of social problem-solving versus social skills training components. ''Behavior Therapy'', ''36''(1), 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relative success has been documented from these interventions in changing levels of hostile attribution bias, although actual enduring changes in aggressive behavior have been modest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

A '''lineage''' in [[Buddhism]] is a line of transmission of the Buddhist teaching that is "theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."{{sfn|Haskel|2001|p=2}} The acknowledgement of the transmission can be oral, or certified in documents. Several branches of Buddhism, including [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] (including [[Zen]] and [[Korean Seon|Seon]]) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] maintain records of their historical teachers. These records serve as a validation for the living exponents of the tradition.

The historical authenticity of Buddhist lineage is questionable. [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] has claimed, speaking about specifically Japanese Zen lineage, "the historicity of this “lineage” simply does not withstand critical scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batchelor|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Batchelor (author)|title=The Lessons of History|url=http://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/the-lessons-of-history|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|volume =10| issue =2|date=Winter 2000|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Storlie has noted that transmission "is simply false on historical grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Storlie|first=Erik|title=Lineage Delusions: Eido Shimano Roshi, Dharma Transmission, and American Zen|url=http://sweepingzen.com/lineage-delusions-eido-shimano-roshi-dharma-transmission-and-american-zen/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] said "much of the traditions about the early history of Chan are the inventions of a later age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conze|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Conze|title=Buddhism: Its Essence and Development|page=201|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2003|ISBN=9780486430959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vinaya==
In the lineage of the [[vinaya]], the requirements for ordination as a [[bhikkhu]] ("monk") or a [[bhikkhuni]] ("nun") include the presence of at least five other monks, one of whom must be a fully ordained preceptor, and another an acharya (teacher). This lineage for ordaining bhikshunis became extinct in the [[Theravada]] school and in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, when [[samanera|śrāmaṇerikā]]s like [[Tenzin Palmo]] wanted full ordination, she had to travel to [[Hong Kong]].

==Mahasiddha==
Lineages in the [[Mahasiddha]] tradition do not necessarily originate from Gautama Buddha, but are ultimately grounded, like all Buddhist lineages, in the [[Adi-Buddha]].

==Chan and Zen lineages==
{{main|Zen lineage charts|Dharma transmission}}

===Construction of lineages===
The idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan Buddhism dates back to the [[epitaph]] for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|1993|p=37}}{{sfn|Cole|2009|p=73–114}}

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan-lineage was developed:
{{quote|These famous biographies were non-sectarian. The Ch'an biographical works, however, aimed to establish Ch'an as a legitimate school of Buddhism traceable to its Indian origins, and at the same time championed a particular form of Ch'an. Historical accuracy was of little concern to the compilers; old legends were repeated, new stories were invented and reiterated until they too became legends.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=5-6}}}}

[[D. T. Suzuki]] contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chan historians made [[Bodhidharma]] the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.{{sfn|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}

===Six patriarchs===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/mag83546.htm 禪宗第七祖之爭的文獻研究]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle teachers of the Chan, Zen and Seon traditions are commonly known in English translations as "[[Patriarch]]s". However, the more precise terminology would be "Ancestors" or "Founders" ({{zh|c=祖|p=zǔ}}) and "Ancestral Masters" or "Founding Masters" ({{zh|c=祖師|zǔshī}}), as the commonly used Chinese terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:

{{Zen Lineage Six Patriarchs}}

===Continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha===
Eventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Gautama is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan.

According to the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713),{{sfn|Chang|1967}} one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng]], Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha through his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]]:
{{quote|Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;&lt;br/&gt;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;&lt;br/&gt;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;&lt;br/&gt;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here&lt;br/&gt;
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,&lt;br/&gt;
And by them many minds came to see the Light.{{sfn|Suzuki|1948|p=50}}}}

The ''[[Denkoroku]]'' gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission,{{sfn|Cook|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}} and 53 overall:

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

===Transmission to Japan===
Twenty-four different Zen lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. [[Sōtō]] was transmitted to Japan by [[Dōgen]], who travelled to [[China]] for Chan training in the [[13th century]]. After receiving [[Dharma transmission]] in the [[Caodong school]], he returned to Japan and established the lineage there, where it is called the [[Sōtō]].

The [[Linji school]] was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it is the [[Rinzai school]].

==Jōdo Shinshū==
In [[Jōdo Shinshū]], "Patriarch" refers to seven Indian, Chinese and Japanese masters before its founder, [[Shinran]].

==Tibetan Buddhism==
The 14th [[Dalai Lama]], in the foreword to ''Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy|last=|first=|publisher=Kagyu Thubten Choling Publications Committee|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha's teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple. The master-disciple relationship is considered extremely sacred by all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karma Kagyu===

====Possession of lineage====
[[B. Alan Wallace|Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;Chagmé ''et al.'', 1998: p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; renders into English a citation of [[Karma Chagme]] ({{bo|w=karma chags med}}, fl. 17th century) that contains an embedded quotation attributed to [[Naropa|Nāropā]] (956-1041&lt;small&gt; CE&lt;/small&gt;):
{{quote|The crucial, primary qualification of a spiritual mentor is stated by Naropa, "The qualification of a spiritual mentor is that [t]he[y][(s/he)] possesses the lineage."&lt;br&gt;
''The Single Meaning of the Vajra Speech'' [Wylie: rDo rje'i gsungs dgongs pa gcig pa] states, "There is great profundity in the connection within the lineage of the holy Dharma." The real lineage of the realization of this Dharma, which transfer blessings,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|"In the Buddhist context, the term blessing should not be understood in terms of grace as in the case of theistic religions.

===Chöd===
[[Chöd]] is an advanced spiritual practice known as "Cutting Through the Ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhicitta.net/Chod.htm|title=Chod - Cutting Through the Ego|last=Rinpoche|first=Yangthang |year=1991|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, based on the [[Prajnaparamita]] sutra, uses specific [[meditation]]s and [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual.

There are several [[hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of how chöd came to Tibet.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One [[Namtar (biography)|''namtar'']] (hagiography) asserts that shortly after [[Kamalaśīla]] won his famous debate with [[Moheyan]] as to whether Tibet should adopt the "sudden" route to enlightenment or his own "gradual" route, Kamalaśīla enacted ''[[phowa]]'',  transferring his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented.  As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha named [[Dampa Sangye]] came across the vacant ''kuten'' or "physical basis" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Dampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of [[Machig Labdrön]]. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own ''kuten'' and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Dampa Sangye.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006).

Sometimes a '''metaphor''' is used to designate the '''language''' of other countries. These expressions refer to national literature heroes, which build the basis of a culture, a history and a nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">In terms of knowledge representation, a '''living graph''' (also referred to as a "lifeline", "living timeline"&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; or "fortune line".&lt;ref name="NatStrat"/&gt;) is a graph similar to a [[chronology]] timeline which places events along a vertical axis to reflect changes over time. The vertical axis can be used to represent many factors, such as relative importance, degrees of success/failure, danger/safety or happiness/sadness. In this sense they have been described as being "timelines with attitude".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

{{terrorism}}
A '''lone wolf''', '''lone-wolf terrorist''', or '''lone actor''', is someone who prepares and commits violent acts alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. He or she may be influenced or motivated by the ideology and beliefs of an external group and may act in support of such a group. In its original sense, a "[[Lone wolf (trait)|lone wolf]]" is an animal or person that generally lives or spends time alone instead of with a group.&lt;ref name="reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lone+wolf|title=Lone wolf - Define Lone wolf at Dictionary.com|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers note the attacks are a relatively rare type of terrorist attack but have been increasing in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common -- And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=14 July 2016|work=|newspaper=FRONTLINE|language=en-US|access-date=4 February 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether an actor has received outside help and what appears to be a lone wolf attack may actually have been carefully orchestrated from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|date=4 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartenstein-Ross|first=Daveed|last2=Barr|first2=Nathaniel|date=26 July 2016|year=|title=The Myth of Lone-Wolf Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/2016-07-26/myth-lone-wolf-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=|pages=|via=|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The term "lone wolf" was popularized by [[white supremacist]]s Alex Curtis and [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] in the 1990s. Metzger advocated individual or small-cell underground activity, as opposed to above-ground membership organizations, envisaging "warriors acting alone or in small groups who attacked the government or other targets in 'daily, anonymous acts.'"&lt;ref name="Adl.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |title=Tom Metzger and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190751/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Metzger.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmel|first1=Michael|title=Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era|date=2013|publisher=Avalon|isbn=1568585136|pages=228–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism expert Brian Michael Jenkins of the [[RAND Corporation]] prefers the term ''stray dog'' to ''lone wolf''. According to Jenkins, most individuals involved in such attacks "skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup".&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel |first1=Jacob |title=Lone Wolves, Terrorist Runts, and the Stray Dogs of ISIS |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |accessdate=7 November 2014 |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=24 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=7 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107133653/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/24/in-canada-the-stray-dogs-of-isis.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though these individuals seem to be acting alone, there are often ties between lone wolves and terrorist organisations for example, terrorist backed online content.&lt;ref&gt;: http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
The term "lone wolf" is used by [[List of law enforcement agencies#United States|US law enforcement agencies]] and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure. The [[FBI]] and [[San Diego Police]]'s investigation into the activities of a self-professed white supremacist, Alex Curtis, was named [[Operation Lone Wolf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|title=Operation Lone Wolf|publisher=[[FBI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "largely due to Curtis' encouragement of other white supremacists to follow what Curtis refers to as 'lone wolf' activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Lone Wolf|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sandiego/about-us/history/operation-lone-wolf|publisher=FBI|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term lone wolf is used to distinguish terrorist actions carried out by individuals from those coordinated by large groups.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Terrorist attacks that are carried out by small cells are not classified as lone wolf attacks. Lone wolf attacks are far more rare than attacks carried out by groups. Since 1940, there have only been around 100 successful lone wolf attacks in the United States.'''&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/lone-wolf-attacks-are-becoming-more-common-and-more-deadly/|title=Lone Wolf Attacks Are Becoming More Common And More Deadly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''The number of attacks is increasing, however, and has grown each year since 2000. Lone wolves generally come from different demographics than far right attackers as well. As compared to those on the far right, lone wolf attackers who become inspired by al-Qaeda and ISIS tend to be younger and better educated. According to studies, lone wolves have more in common with [[mass murder]]ers than they do with members of the organized terrorist groups that often inspire them.

While the lone wolf acts to advance the ideological or philosophical beliefs of an extremist group, they act on their own, without any outside command or direction. The lone wolf's tactics and methods are conceived and directed solely on their own; in many cases, such as the tactics described by Curtis, the lone wolf never has personal contact with the group they identify with. As such, it is considerably more difficult for [[counter-terrorism]] officials to gather intelligence on lone wolves, since they may not come into contact with routine counter-terrorist surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/understanding-lone-wolves-towards-a-theoretical-framework-for-comparative-analysis/ | title=Understanding Lone Wolves: Towards a Theoretical Framework for Comparative Analysis | author1=Jan Leenaars | author2=Dr. Alastair Reed | publisher=The [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] – The Hague (ICCT) | date=2 May 2016 | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 analysis by Sarah Teich, a research assistant at the [[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], found five emerging trends in Islamist lone wolf terrorism in North America and western Europe between 1990 and 2013:
*An increase in the number of countries targeted by lone wolves from the 1990s to the 2000s.
*An increase in the number of people injured and killed by lone wolves.
*Increased effectiveness of law enforcement and counter-terrorism.
*Consistency in the distribution of attacks by "actor types" (loners, lone wolves, and lone wolf packs).
*An increase in the number of attacks against military personnel.&lt;ref name="ict.org.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/Article.aspx?ID=691|title=Trends and Developments in Lone Wolf Terrorism in the Western World|last=Teich|first=Sarah|date=October 2013|publisher=[[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]]|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lone wolves may present a greater threat than organized groups, and terrorists have not been limited to Muslims. According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]],'' "With the exception of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]], experts say the major terrorist attacks in the United States have been perpetrated by deranged individuals who were sympathetic to a larger cause – from [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]] [[Timothy McVeigh]] to the Washington area sniper [[John Allen Muhammad]]," both native-born Americans.&lt;ref name="Csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0527/p02s02-usju.html |title=Lone wolves pose explosive terror threat |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', counter-terrorism officials refer to "lone individuals known to authorities but not considered important enough to escalate investigations" as "known wolves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7795146-10a8-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d |title='Known wolf' attackers force intelligence rethink |first=Sam |last=Jones |date=24 March 2017 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=2 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups actively advocate lone wolf actions. Anti-abortion [[Militant (word)|militant]] terrorist group The [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]] uses "[[leaderless resistance]]" as its organizing principle.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Gonnerman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Gonnerman |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-11-10/news/the-terrorist-campaign-against-abortion/3 |title=Villagvoice.com |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date=10 November 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', in news analysis of the [[Boston Marathon bombings]], the Al-Qaeda activist [[Samir Khan]], publishing in ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', advocated individual terrorist actions directed at Americans and published detailed recipes online.&lt;ref name=NYT5513&gt;{{cite news|title=A Homemade Style of Terror: Jihadists Push New Tactics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/us/terrorists-find-online-education-for-attacks.html|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 May 2013|author=Scott Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===
Lone wolf terrorists are frequently thought to only be Muslims, however, this is not always the case. Lone wolf terrorists may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are not truly a part of them.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Lone Wolf Terrorism: Global Patterns, Motivations and Prevention|last=Spaaij|first=Ramon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' Often, the attacks are attributed to people who have a mixture of political and personal grievances. The attackers can have no actual affiliation to the group that claims them, but instead become radicalized online and through external media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=OPINION {{!}} What Drives Lone Offenders?|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2017/10/OPINION-What-Drives-Lone-Offenders-003-10-2017-0005.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of terrorists determined by authorities to have been lone wolf attacks inspired by [[ISIS]] and/or its ideology, were later found to have been recruited, trained and directed remotely by ISIL to carry out the attacks.&lt;ref name="NotLoneWolf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Not 'Lone Wolves' After All: How ISIS Guides World's Terror Plots From Afar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html |accessdate=5 February 2017 |publisher=New York Times |date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health factors==
Lone wolf terrorists are highly likely to be afflicted by a mental illness. Studies have found that more than 40% of lone wolf terrorists have been diagnosed at some point in their life with a mental illness.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; This puts lone wolves as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/lone-wolf-terrorism|title=Lone Wolf Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health challenges are thought to make some individuals among the many who suffer from certain "psychological disturbances," vulnerable to being inspired by extremist ideologies to commit acts of lone wolf terrorism.&lt;ref name="MentalIllnessKayFactor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental Illness: A Key Factor in "Terror"|url=http://bridge.georgetown.edu/mental-illness-a-key-factor-in-terror/|accessdate=16 February 2017|agency=Johns Hopkins University|publisher=Bridge Initiative Team|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoneWoldTerrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alfaro-Gonzalez|first1=Lydia|title=Report: Lone Wolf Terrorism|date=27 July 2015|publisher=Security Studies Program, Natoonal Security Critical Issue Task Force|url=http://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NCITF-Final-Paper.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queensland University of Technology criminologist Associate Professor Mark Lauchs said it was important the siege wasn't elevated to a "terrorist attack" as such.

In [[physics]], the '''Lorentz transformations''' are a one-parameter family of [[Linear transformation|linear]] [[coordinate transformation|transformations]] from a [[coordinate frame]] in space time to another frame that moves at a constant velocity, the parameter, within the former. The transformations are named after the Dutch [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. The respective inverse transformation is then parametrized by the negative of this velocity.

The most common form of the transformation, parametrized by the real constant &lt;math&gt;v,&lt;/math&gt; representing a velocity confined to the {{mvar|x}}-direction, is expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forshaw|Smith|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;= \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right)  \\ 
  x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - v t \right)\\
  y' &amp;= y \\ 
  z' &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|(''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} and {{math|(''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;)}} are the coordinates of an event in two frames, where the primed frame is seen from the unprimed frame as moving with speed {{math|''v''}} along the {{mvar|x}}-axis, {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \textstyle\left ( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]].

Expressing the speed as &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{v}{c},&lt;/math&gt; an equivalent form of the transformation is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Standard Model of Particle Physics |edition=2nd |first1=W.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Frames of reference can be divided into two groups: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (relative motion with constant velocity) and [[Non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]] (accelerating, moving in curved paths, rotational motion with constant [[angular velocity]], etc.). The term "Lorentz transformations" only refers to transformations between ''inertial'' frames, usually in the context of special relativity. 

In each [[frame of reference|reference frame]], an observer can use a local coordinate system (most exclusively [[Cartesian coordinates]] in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity that can take measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An [[Event (relativity)|event]] is something that happens at a point in space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in [[spacetime]]. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an [[Event (relativity)|event]] as measured by an observer in each frame.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;One can imagine that in each inertial frame there are observers positioned throughout space, each endowed with a synchronized clock and at rest in the particular inertial frame. These observers then report to a central office, where a report is collected. When one speaks of a ''particular'' observer, one refers to someone having, at least in principle, a copy of this report. See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Sard|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

They supersede the [[Galilean transformation]] of [[Newtonian physics]], which assumes an absolute space and time (see [[Galilean relativity]]). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds much smaller than the speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, they reflect the fact that observers moving at different [[velocity|velocities]] may measure different [[Length contraction|distances]], [[time dilation|elapsed times]], and even different [[Relativity of simultaneity|orderings of events]], but always such that the [[speed of light]] is the same in all inertial reference frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the [[postulates of special relativity]].

Historically, the transformations were the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of [[light]] was observed to be independent of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]], and to understand the symmetries of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with [[special relativity]], but was derived before special relativity.

The Lorentz transformation is a [[linear transformation]]. It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz transformation is called a '''Lorentz boost'''. In [[Minkowski space]], the mathematical model of spacetime in special relativity, the Lorentz transformations preserve the [[spacetime interval]] between any two events. This property is the defining property of a Lorentz transformation. They describe only the transformations in which the spacetime event at the origin is left fixed. They can be considered as a [[hyperbolic rotation]] of Minkowski space. The more general set of transformations that also includes translations is known as the [[Poincaré group]].

==History==

{{main|History of Lorentz transformations}}

Many physicists—including [[Woldemar Voigt]], [[George FitzGerald]], [[Joseph Larmor]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon

|pages=809–831}}&lt;/ref&gt; himself—had been discussing the physics implied by these equations since 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|John|O'Connor|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1889, [[Oliver Heaviside]] had shown from [[Maxwell's equations]] that the [[electric field]] surrounding a spherical distribution of charge should cease to have [[spherical symmetry]] once the charge is in motion relative to the aether. FitzGerald then conjectured that Heaviside’s distortion result might be applied to a theory of intermolecular forces. Some months later, FitzGerald published the conjecture that bodies in motion are being contracted, in order to explain the baffling outcome of the 1887 aether-wind experiment of [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson and Morley]]. In 1892, Lorentz independently presented the same idea in a more detailed manner, which was subsequently called [[Length contraction|FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their explanation was widely known before 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rothman|2006|pages = 112f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz (1892–1904) and Larmor (1897–1900), who believed the [[luminiferous aether]] hypothesis, also looked for the transformation under which [[Maxwell's equations]] are invariant when transformed from the aether to a moving frame. They extended the [[Fitzgerald–Lorentz contraction|FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]] hypothesis and found out that the time coordinate has to be modified as well ("[[relativity of simultaneity|local time]]"). [[Henri Poincaré]] gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in ''v''/''c'', the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darrigol|2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larmor is credited to have been the first to understand the crucial [[time dilation]] property inherent in his equations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Macrossan|1986|pages=232–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Poincaré was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]],
and named it after Lorentz.&lt;ref&gt;The reference is within the following paper:{{harvnb|Poincaré|1905|pages = 1504–1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in the same year [[Albert Einstein]] published what is now called [[special relativity]], by deriving the Lorentz transformation under the assumptions of the [[principle of relativity]] and the constancy of the speed of light in any [[inertial reference frame]], and by abandoning the mechanistic aether as unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1905|pages=891–921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation of the group of Lorentz transformations ==
{{Main|Derivations of the Lorentz transformations|Lorentz group}}

An ''[[Event (relativity)|event]]'' is something that happens at a certain point in spacetime, or more generally, the point in spacetime itself. In any inertial frame an event is specified by a time coordinate ''ct'' and a set of [[Cartesian coordinate]]s {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} to specify position in space in that frame. Subscripts label individual events.

From Einstein's [[Postulates of special relativity|second postulate of relativity]] follows

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2 - (y_2 - y_1)^2 - (z_2 - z_1)^2 = 0 \quad \text{(lightlike separated events 1, 2)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D1}}}}

in all inertial frames for events connected by ''light signals''. The quantity on the left is called the ''spacetime interval'' between events {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. The interval between ''any two'' events, not necessarily separated by light signals, is in fact invariant, i.e., independent of the state of relative motion of observers in different inertial frames, as is [[Derivations of the Lorentz transformations#Invariance of interval|shown using homogeneity and isotropy of space]]. The transformation sought after thus must possess the property that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2 - (y_2 - y_1)^2 - (z_2 - z_1)^2 \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; c^2(t_2' - t_1')^2 - (x_2' - x_1')^2 - (y_2' - y_1')^2 - (z_2' - z_1')^2  \quad \text{(all events 1, 2)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D2}}}}

where {{math|(''ct'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} are the spacetime coordinates used to define events in one frame, and {{math|(''ct''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;)}} are the coordinates in another frame. First one observes that {{EquationNote|(D2)}} is satisfied if an arbitrary {{math|4}}-tuple {{math|''b''}} of numbers are added to events {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Such transformations are called ''spacetime translations'' and are not dealt with further here. Then one observes that a ''linear'' solution preserving the origin of the simpler problem

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; c^2t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = c^2t'^2 - x'^2 - y'^2 - z'^2 \\[6pt]
\text{or} \quad &amp; c^2t_1t_2 - x_1x_2 - y_1y_2 - z_1z_2 = c^2t'_1t'_2 - x'_1x'_2 - y'_1y'_2 - z'_1z'_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D3}}}}

solves the general problem too. (A solution satisfying the left formula automatically satisfies the right formula, see [[polarization identity]].) Finding the solution to the simpler problem is just a matter of look-up in the theory of [[classical group]]s that preserve [[bilinear form]]s of various signature.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It should be noted that the separate requirements of the three equations lead to three different groups. The second equation is satisfied for spacetime translations in addition to Lorentz transformations leading to the [[Poincaré group]] or the ''inhomogeneous Lorentz group''. The first equation (or the second restricted to lightlike separation) leads to a yet larger group, the [[conformal group]] of spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt; Equation {{EquationNote|(D3)}} can be written more compactly as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(a, a) = (a', a') \quad \text{or} \quad a \cdot a = a' \cdot a',&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D4}}}}

where {{math|(·, ·)}} refers to the bilinear form of [[Signature (quadratic form)|signature]] {{math|(1, 3)}} on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} exposed by the right hand side formula in {{EquationNote|(D3)}}. The alternative notation defined on the right is referred to as the ''relativistic dot product''. Spacetime mathematically viewed as {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} endowed with this bilinear form is known as [[Minkowski space]] {{math|''M''}}. The Lorentz transformation is thus an element of the group Lorentz group {{math|O(1, 3)}}, the [[Lorentz group]] or, for those that prefer the other [[metric signature]], {{math|O(3, 1)}} (also called the Lorentz group).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The groups {{math|O(3, 1)}} and {{math|O(1, 3)}} are isomorphic. It is widely believed that the choice between the two metric signatures has no physical relevance, even though some objects related to {{math|O(3, 1)}} and {{math|O(1, 3)}} respectively, e.g., the [[Clifford algebra]]s corresponding to the different signatures of the bilinear form associated to the two groups, are non-isomorphic.&lt;/ref&gt; One has

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(a, a) = (\Lambda a,\Lambda a) = (a', a'), \quad \Lambda \in \mathrm O(1, 3), \quad a, a' \in M,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D5}}}}

which is precisely preservation of the bilinear form {{EquationNote|(D3)}} which implies (by linearity of {{math|Λ}} and bilinearity of the form) that {{EquationNote|(D2)}} is satisfied. The elements of the Lorentz group are [[Rotation group SO(3)|rotations]] and ''boosts'' and mixes thereof. If the spacetime translations are included, then one obtains the ''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'' or the [[Poincaré group]].

==Generalities==
The relations between the primed and unprimed spacetime coordinates are the '''Lorentz transformations''', each coordinate in one frame is a [[linear function]] of all the coordinates in the other frame, and the [[inverse function]]s are the inverse transformation. Depending on how the frames move relative to each other, and how they are oriented in space relative to each other, other parameters that describe direction, speed, and orientation enter the transformation equations.

{{anchor|boost}}Transformations describing relative motion with constant (uniform) velocity and without rotation of the space coordinate axes are called ''boosts'', and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames since there is no relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., [[axis–angle representation]], or [[Euler angle]]s, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a ''homogeneous transformation'', which transforms the origin back to the origin.

The full Lorentz group {{math|O(3, 1)}} also contains special transformations that are neither rotations nor boosts, but rather [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] in a plane through the origin. Two of these can be singled out; [[P-symmetry|spatial inversion]] in which the spatial coordinates of all events are reversed in sign and [[T-symmetry|temporal inversion]] in which the time coordinate for each event gets its sign reversed.

Boosts should not be conflated with mere displacements in spacetime; in this case, the coordinate systems are simply shifted and there is no relative motion. However, these also count as symmetries forced by special relativity since they leave the spacetime interval invariant. A combination of a rotation with a boost, followed by a shift in spacetime, is an ''inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation'', an element of the Poincaré group, which is also called the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.

A "stationary" observer in frame {{math|''F''}} defines events with coordinates {{math|''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}. Another frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} moves with velocity {{math|''v''}} relative to {{math|''F''}}, and an observer in this "moving" frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} defines events using the coordinates {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}.

The coordinate axes in each frame are parallel (the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel, the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel, and the {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel), remain mutually perpendicular, and relative motion is along the coincident {{math|''xx&amp;prime;''}} axes. At {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}, the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, {{math|(''x, y, z'') {{=}} (''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;) {{=}} (0, 0, 0)}}. In other words, the times and positions are coincident at this event. If all these hold, then the coordinate systems are said to be in '''standard configuration''', or '''synchronized'''.

If an observer in {{math|''F''}} records an event {{math|''t, x, y, z''}}, then an observer in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} records the ''same'' event with coordinates&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forshaw|Smith|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

(lowercase [[gamma]]) is the [[Lorentz factor]].

Here, {{math|''v''}} is the ''[[parameter]]'' of the transformation, for a given boost it is a constant number, but can take a continuous range of values. In the setup used here, positive relative velocity {{math|''v'' &gt; 0}} is motion along the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, zero relative velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}} is no relative motion, while negative relative velocity {{math|''v'' &lt; 0}} is relative motion along the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes. The magnitude of relative velocity {{math|''v''}} cannot equal or exceed {{math|''c''}}, so only subluminal speeds {{math|−''c'' &lt; ''v'' &lt; ''c''}} are allowed. The corresponding range of {{math|''γ''}} is {{math|1 ≤ ''γ'' &lt; ∞}}.

The transformations are not defined if {{math|''v''}} is outside these limits. At the speed of light ({{math|''v'' {{=}} ''c''}}) {{math|''γ''}} is infinite, and [[faster than light]] ({{math|''v'' &gt; ''c''}}) {{math|''γ''}} is a [[complex number]], each of which make the transformations unphysical. The space and time coordinates are measurable quantities and numerically must be real numbers.

As an [[active transformation]], an observer in F&amp;prime; notices the coordinates of the event to be "boosted" in the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, because of the {{math|−''v''}} in the transformations. This has the equivalent effect of the ''coordinate system'' F&amp;prime; boosted in the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, while the event does not change and is simply represented in another coordinate system, a [[passive transformation]].

The inverse relations ({{math|''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} in terms of {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}) can be found by algebraically solving the original set of equations. A more efficient way is to use physical principles. Here {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} is the "stationary" frame while {{math|''F''}} is the "moving" frame. According to the principle of relativity, there is no privileged frame of reference, so the transformations from {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} to {{math|''F''}} must take exactly the same form as the transformations from {{math|''F''}} to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}. The only difference is {{math|''F''}} moves with velocity {{math|−''v''}} relative to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} (i.e., the relative velocity has the same magnitude but is oppositely directed). Thus if an observer in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} notes an event {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}, then an observer in {{math|''F''}} notes the ''same'' event with coordinates

{{Equation box 1

  z &amp;= z',
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the value of {{math|''γ''}} remains unchanged. This "trick" of simply reversing the direction of relative velocity while preserving its magnitude, and exchanging primed and unprimed variables, always applies to finding the inverse transformation of every boost in any direction.

Sometimes it is more convenient to use {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''v''/''c''}} (lowercase [[beta]]) instead of {{math|''v''}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ct' &amp;= \gamma \left( ct - \beta x \right) \,, \\ 
   x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - \beta ct \right) \,, \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which shows much more clearly the symmetry in the transformation. From the allowed ranges of {{math|''v''}} and the definition of {{math|''β''}}, it follows {{math|−1 &lt; ''β'' &lt; 1}}. The use of {{math|''β''}} and {{math|''γ''}} is standard throughout the literature.

The Lorentz transformations can also be derived in a way that resembles circular rotations in 3d space using the [[hyperbolic function]]s. For the boost in the {{math|''x''}} direction, the results are

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Lorentz boost''' ({{math|''x''}} ''direction with rapidity'' {{math|''ζ''}})
|indent =:
|equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ct' &amp;=  ct \cosh\zeta - x \sinh\zeta \\ 
   x' &amp;= x \cosh\zeta - ct \sinh\zeta \\
   y' &amp;= y \\ 
   z' &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

where {{math|''ζ''}} (lowercase [[zeta]]) is a parameter called ''[[rapidity]]'' (many other symbols are used, including {{math|''θ, ϕ, φ, η, ψ, ξ''}}). Given the strong resemblance to rotations of spatial coordinates in 3d space in the Cartesian xy, yz, and zx planes, a Lorentz boost can be thought of as a [[hyperbolic rotation]] of spacetime coordinates in the xt, yt, and zt Cartesian-time planes of 4d [[Minkowski space]]. The parameter {{math|''ζ''}} is the [[hyperbolic angle]] of rotation, analogous to the ordinary angle for circular rotations. This transformation can be illustrated with a [[Minkowski diagram]].

The hyperbolic functions arise from the ''difference'' between the squares of the time and spatial coordinates in the spacetime interval, rather than a sum. The geometric significance of the hyperbolic functions can be visualized by taking {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''ct'' {{=}} 0}} in the transformations. Squaring and subtracting the results, one can derive hyperbolic curves of constant coordinate values but varying {{math|''ζ''}}, which parametrizes the curves according to the identity

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh^2\zeta - \sinh^2\zeta = 1 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Conversely the {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} axes can be constructed for varying coordinates but constant {{math|''ζ''}}. The definition

:&lt;math&gt; \tanh\zeta = \frac{\sinh\zeta}{\cosh\zeta} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

provides the link between a constant value of rapidity, and the [[slope]] of the {{math|''ct''}} axis in spacetime. A consequence these two hyperbolic formulae is an identity that matches the Lorentz factor

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh\zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \tanh^2\zeta}} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the Lorentz transformations in terms of the relative velocity and rapidity, or using the above formulae, the connections between {{math|''β''}}, {{math|''γ''}}, and {{math|''ζ''}} are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         \beta &amp;= \tanh\zeta  \,, \\
        \gamma &amp;= \cosh\zeta  \,, \\
  \beta \gamma &amp;= \sinh\zeta  \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the inverse hyperbolic tangent gives the rapidity

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \tanh^{-1}\beta  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|−1 &lt; ''β'' &lt; 1}}, it follows {{math|−∞ &lt; ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}}. From the relation between {{math|''ζ''}} and {{math|''β''}}, positive rapidity {{math|''ζ'' &gt; 0}} is motion along the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, zero rapidity {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}} is no relative motion, while negative rapidity {{math|''ζ'' &lt; 0}} is relative motion along the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes.

The inverse transformations are obtained by exchanging primed and unprimed quantities to switch the coordinate frames, and negating rapidity {{math|''ζ'' → −''ζ''}} since this is equivalent to negating the relative velocity. Therefore,

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Inverse Lorentz boost''' ({{math|''x''}} ''direction with rapidity'' {{math|''ζ''}})
|indent =:
|equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

   y &amp;= y' \\ 
   z &amp;= z'
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1
|border colour = black

The inverse transformations can be similarly visualized by considering the cases when {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''ct''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}.

So far the Lorentz transformations have been applied to ''one event''. If there are two events, there is a spatial separation and time interval between them. It follows from the [[linear transformation|linearity]] of the Lorentz transformations that two values of space and time coordinates can be chosen, the Lorentz transformations can be applied to each, then subtracted to get the Lorentz transformations of the differences;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Delta t' &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta t - \frac{v \, \Delta x}{c^2} \right) \,, \\
  \Delta x' &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta x - v \, \Delta t \right) \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with inverse relations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Delta t &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta t' + \frac{v \, \Delta x'}{c^2} \right) \,, \\
  \Delta x &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta x' + v \, \Delta t' \right) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ}} (uppercase [[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a difference of quantities; e.g., {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} for two values of {{math|''x''}} coordinates, and so on.

These transformations on ''differences'' rather than spatial points or instants of time are useful for a number of reasons:

*in calculations and experiments, it is lengths between two points or time intervals that are measured or of interest (e.g., the length of a moving vehicle, or time duration it takes to travel from one place to another),
*the transformations of velocity can be readily derived by making the difference infinitesimally small and dividing the equations, and the process repeated for the transformation of acceleration,
*if the coordinate systems are never coincident (i.e., not in standard configuration), and if both observers can agree on an event {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;}} in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, then they can use that event as the origin, and the spacetime coordinate differences are the differences between their coordinates and this origin, e.g., {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|Δ''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''x''&amp;prime; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;}}, etc.

===Physical implications===

A critical requirement of the Lorentz transformations is the invariance of the speed of light, a fact used in their derivation, and contained in the transformations themselves. If in {{math|''F''}} the equation for a pulse of light along the {{math|''x''}} direction is {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ct''}}, then in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} the Lorentz transformations give {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''ct''&amp;prime;}}, and vice versa, for any {{math|−''c'' &lt; ''v'' &lt; ''c''}}.

For relative speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz transformations reduce to the [[Galilean transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;\approx t \\
  x' &amp;\approx x - vt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

in accordance with the [[correspondence principle]]. It is sometimes said that nonrelativistic physics is a physics of "instantaneous action at a distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three unintuitive, but correct, predictions of the transformations are:
;[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Suppose two events occur simultaneously ({{math|Δ''t'' {{=}} 0}}) along the x axis, but separated by a nonzero displacement {{math|Δ''x''}}.  Then in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, we find that &lt;math&gt;\Delta t' = \gamma \frac{-v\,\Delta x}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;, so the events are no longer simultaneous according to a moving observer.  
;[[Time dilation]]: Suppose there is a clock at rest in {{math|''F''}}. If a time interval is measured at the same point in that frame, so that {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} 0}}, then the transformations give this interval in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} by {{math|Δ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''γ''Δ''t''}}. Conversely, suppose there is a clock at rest in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}. If an interval is measured at the same point in that frame, so that {{math|Δ''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}, then the transformations give this interval in F by {{math|Δ''t'' {{=}} ''γ''Δ''t''&amp;prime;}}. Either way, each observer measures the time interval between ticks of a moving clock to be longer by a factor {{math|''γ''}} than the time interval between ticks of his own clock.
;[[Length contraction]]: Suppose there is a rod at rest in {{math|''F''}} aligned along the x axis, with length {{math|Δ''x''}}.  In {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, the rod moves with velocity {{math|-''v''}}, so its length must be measured by taking two simultaneous ({{math|Δ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}) measurements at opposite ends.  Under these conditions, the inverse Lorentz transform shows that {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''γ''Δ''x''&amp;prime;}}. In {{math|''F''}} the two measurements are no longer simultaneous, but this does not matter because the rod is at rest in {{math|''F''}}. So each observer measures the distance between the end points of a moving rod to be shorter by a factor {{math|1/''γ''}} than the end points of an identical rod at rest in his own frame. Length contraction affects any geometric quantity related to lengths, so from the perspective of a moving observer, areas and volumes will also appear to shrink along the direction of motion.

===Vector transformations===

{{further|Euclidean vector|vector projection}}

[[File:Lorentz boost any direction standard configuration.svg|300px|thumb|An observer in frame {{math|''F''}} observes {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, while {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} observes {{math|''F''}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}}. The coordinate axes of each frame are still parallel and orthogonal. The position vector as measured in each frame is split into components parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity vector {{math|'''v'''}}. '''Left:''' Standard configuration. '''Right:''' Inverse configuration.]]

The use of vectors allows positions and velocities to be expressed in arbitrary directions compactly. A single boost in any direction depends on the full relative [[velocity vector]] {{math|'''v'''}} with a magnitude {{math|{{abs|'''v'''}} {{=}} ''v''}} that cannot equal or exceed {{math|''c''}}, so that {{math|0 ≤ ''v'' &lt; ''c''}}.

Only time and the coordinates parallel to the direction of relative motion change, while those coordinates perpendicular do not. With this in mind, split the spatial [[position vector]] {{math|'''r'''}} as measured in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}} as measured in {{math|''F&amp;prime;''}}, each into components perpendicular (⊥) and parallel ( &amp;#8214; ) to {{math|'''v'''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_\perp+\mathbf{r}_\|\,,\quad \mathbf{r}' = \mathbf{r}_\perp' + \mathbf{r}_\|' \,, &lt;/math&gt;

then the transformations are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                t'  &amp;= \gamma \left(t - \frac{\mathbf{r}_\parallel \cdot \mathbf{v}}{c^2} \right) \\
     \mathbf{r}_\|' &amp;= \gamma (\mathbf{r}_\| - \mathbf{v} t) \\
  \mathbf{r}_\perp' &amp;= \mathbf{r}_\perp
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]]. The Lorentz factor {{math|''γ''}} retains its definition for a boost in any direction, since it depends only on the magnitude of the relative velocity. The definition {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''v'''/''c''}} with magnitude {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}} is also used by some authors.

Introducing a [[unit vector]] {{math|'''n''' {{=}} '''v'''/''v'' {{=}} '''β'''/''β''}} in the direction of relative motion, the relative velocity is {{math|'''v''' {{=}} ''v'''''n'''}} with magnitude {{math|''v''}} and direction {{math|'''n'''}}, and [[vector projection]] and rejection give respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_\parallel = (\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n}\,,\quad \mathbf{r}_\perp = \mathbf{r} - (\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Accumulating the results gives the full transformations,

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Lorentz boost''' (''in direction'' {{math|'''n'''}} ''with magnitude'' {{math|''v''}}) 
|indent =:
|equation = 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

  \mathbf{r}' &amp;= \mathbf{r} + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} - \gamma t v\mathbf{n} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|background colour=white}}

The projection and rejection also applies to {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}}. For the inverse transformations, exchange {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}} to switch observed coordinates, and negate the relative velocity {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} (or simply the unit vector {{math|'''n''' → −'''n'''}} since the magnitude {{math|''v''}} is always positive) to obtain

{{Equation box 1

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

  \mathbf{r} &amp;= \mathbf{r}' + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{r}'\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} + \gamma t' v\mathbf{n} \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

The unit vector has the advantage of simplifying equations for a single boost, allows either {{math|'''v'''}} or {{math|'''β'''}} to be reinstated when convenient, and the rapidity parametrization is immediately obtained by replacing {{math|''β''}} and {{math|''βγ''}}. It is not convenient for multiple boosts.

The vectorial relation between relative velocity and rapidity is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barut|1964|page=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta} = \beta \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n} \tanh\zeta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the "rapidity vector" can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\zeta} = \zeta\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n}\tanh^{-1}\beta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

each of which serves as a useful abbreviation in some contexts. The magnitude of {{math|'''ζ'''}} is the absolute value of the rapidity scalar confined to {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}}, which agrees with the range {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}.

===Transformation of velocities===

{{further|differential of a function|velocity addition formula}}

[[File:Lorentz transformation of velocity including velocity addition.svg|300px|thumb|The transformation of velocities provides the definition [[velocity addition formula|relativistic velocity addition]] {{math|&amp;oplus;}}, the ordering of vectors is chosen to reflect the ordering of the addition of velocities; first {{math|'''v'''}} (the velocity of F&amp;prime; relative to F) then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} (the velocity of X relative to F&amp;prime;) to obtain {{math|'''u''' {{=}} '''v''' &amp;oplus; '''u'''&amp;prime;}} (the velocity of X relative to F).]]

Defining the coordinate velocities and Lorentz factor by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \,,\quad \mathbf{u}' = \frac{d\mathbf{r}'}{dt'} \,,\quad \gamma_\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

taking the differentials in the coordinates and time of the vector transformations, then dividing equations, leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \frac{1}{ 1 - \frac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} }\left[\frac{\mathbf{u}}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}} - \mathbf{v} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{\gamma_\mathbf{v} + 1}\left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{v}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} are the velocity of some massive object. They can also be for a third inertial frame (say ''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;), in which case they must be ''constant''. Denote either entity by X. Then X moves with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to F, or equivalently with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} relative to F&amp;prime;, in turn F&amp;prime; moves with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to F. The inverse transformations can be obtained in a similar way, or as with position coordinates exchange {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}}, and change {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|−'''v'''}}.

The transformation of velocity is useful in [[stellar aberration]], the [[Fizeau experiment]], and the [[relativistic Doppler effect]].

The [[Acceleration (special relativity)#Three-acceleration|Lorentz transformations of acceleration]] can be similarly obtained by taking differentials in the velocity vectors, and dividing these by the time differential.

===Transformation of other quantities===

In general, given four quantities {{math|''A''}} and {{math|'''Z''' {{=}} (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and their Lorentz-boosted counterparts {{math|''A''&amp;prime;}} and {{math|'''Z'''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, a relation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;A^2 - \mathbf{Z}\cdot\mathbf{Z} = {A'}^2 - \mathbf{Z}'\cdot\mathbf{Z}'&lt;/math&gt;

implies the quantities transform under Lorentz transformations similar to the transformation of spacetime coordinates;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
           A' &amp;= \gamma \left(A - \frac{v\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{Z}}{c} \right) \,, \\
  \mathbf{Z}' &amp;= \mathbf{Z} + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{Z}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} - \frac{\gamma A v\mathbf{n}}{c} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition of {{math|'''Z'''}} (and {{math|'''Z'''′}}) into components perpendicular and parallel to {{math|'''v'''}} is exactly the same as for the position vector, as is the process of obtaining the inverse transformations (exchange {{math|(''A'', '''Z''')}} and {{math|(''A''&amp;prime;, '''Z'''&amp;prime;)}} to switch observed quantities, and reverse the direction of relative motion by the substitution {{math|'''n''' ↦ −'''n'''}}).

The quantities {{math|(''A'', '''Z''')}} collectively make up a ''[[four vector]]'', where {{math|''A''}} is the "timelike component", and {{math|'''Z'''}} the "spacelike component". Examples of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|'''Z'''}} are the following:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-

|}

For a given object (e.g., particle, fluid, field, material), if {{math|''A''}} or {{math|'''Z'''}} correspond to properties specific to the object like its [[charge density]], [[mass density]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], etc., its properties can be fixed in the rest frame of that object. Then the Lorentz transformations give the corresponding properties in a frame moving relative to the object with constant velocity. This breaks some notions taken for granted in non-relativistic physics. For example, the energy {{math|''E''}} of an object is a scalar in non-relativistic mechanics, but not in relativistic mechanics because energy changes under Lorentz transformations; its value is different for various inertial frames. In the rest frame of an object, it has a [[rest energy]] and zero momentum. In a boosted frame its energy is different and it appears to have a momentum. Similarly, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics the spin of a particle is a constant vector, but in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] spin {{math|'''s'''}} depends on relative motion. In the rest frame of the particle, the spin pseudovector can be fixed to be its ordinary non-relativistic spin with a zero timelike quantity {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, however a boosted observer will perceive a nonzero timelike component and an altered spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Hagedorn|1997|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all quantities are invariant in the form as shown above, for example orbital [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} does not have a timelike quantity, and neither does the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} nor the [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}. The definition of angular momentum is {{math|'''L''' {{=}} '''r''' × '''p'''}}, and in a boosted frame the altered angular momentum is {{math|'''L'''&amp;prime; {{=}} '''r'''&amp;prime; × '''p'''&amp;prime;}}. Applying this definition using the transformations of coordinates and momentum leads to the transformation of angular momentum. It turns out {{math|'''L'''}} transforms with another vector quantity {{math|'''N''' {{=}} (''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'''r''' − ''t'''''p'''}} related to boosts, see [[relativistic angular momentum]] for details. For the case of the {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} fields, the transformations cannot be obtained as directly using vector algebra. The [[Lorentz force]] is the definition of these fields, and in {{math|''F''}} it is {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''q''('''E''' + '''v''' × '''B''')}} while in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} it is {{math|'''F'''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''q''('''E'''&amp;prime; + '''v'''&amp;prime; × '''B'''&amp;prime;)}}. A method of deriving the EM field transformations in an efficient way which also illustrates the unit of the electromagnetic field uses tensor algebra, [[Lorentz transformation#Transformation of the electromagnetic field|given below]].

===Homogeneous Lorentz group===

Writing the coordinates in column vectors and the [[Minkowski metric]] {{math|''η''}} as a square matrix

:&lt;math&gt; X' = \begin{bmatrix} c\,t' \\ x' \\ y' \\ z' \end{bmatrix} \,, \quad \eta = \begin{bmatrix} -1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1 \end{bmatrix} \,, \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c\,t \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

the spacetime interval takes the form (T denotes [[transpose]])

:&lt;math&gt; X \cdot X = X^\mathrm{T} \eta X = {X'}^\mathrm{T} \eta {X'} &lt;/math&gt;

and is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a Lorentz transformation

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \Lambda X  &lt;/math&gt;

where Λ is a square matrix which can depend on parameters.

The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all Lorentz transformations Λ in this article is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. This set together with matrix multiplication forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], in this context known as the ''[[Lorentz group]]''. Also, the above expression {{math|''X·X''}} is a [[quadratic form]] of signature (3,1) on spacetime, and the group of transformations which leaves this quadratic form invariant is the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] O(3,1), a [[Lie group]]. In other words, the Lorentz group is O(3,1). As presented in this article, any Lie groups mentioned are [[matrix Lie group]]s. In this context the operation of composition amounts to [[matrix multiplication]].

From the invariance of the spacetime interval it follows

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \Lambda^\mathrm{T} \eta \Lambda &lt;/math&gt;

and this matrix equation contains the general conditions on the Lorentz transformation to ensure invariance of the spacetime interval. Taking the [[determinant]] of the equation using the product rule&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two square matrices {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, {{math|det(''AB'') {{=}} det(''A'')det(''B'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives immediately

:&lt;math&gt;[\det (\Lambda)]^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \det(\Lambda) = \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Writing the Minkowski metric as a block matrix, and the Lorentz transformation in the most general form,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{I}\end{bmatrix} \,, \quad \Lambda=\begin{bmatrix}\Gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}\end{bmatrix}  \,, &lt;/math&gt;

carrying out the block matrix multiplications obtains general conditions on {{math|Γ, '''a''', '''b''', '''M'''}} to ensure relativistic invariance. Not much information can be directly extracted from all the conditions, however one of the results

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2 = 1 + \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

is useful; {{math|'''b'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''b''' ≥ 0}} always so it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^2 \geq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Gamma \leq - 1 \,,\quad \Gamma \geq  1 &lt;/math&gt;

The negative inequality may be unexpected, because {{math|Γ}} multiplies the time coordinate and this has an effect on [[Time translation symmetry|time symmetry]]. If the positive equality holds, then {{math|Γ}} is the Lorentz factor.

The determinant and inequality provide four ways to classify Lorentz transformations (herein LTs for brevity). Any particular LT has only one determinant sign ''and'' only one inequality. There are four sets which include every possible pair given by the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s ("n"-shaped symbol meaning "and") of these classifying sets.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Intersection, ∩
! '''Antichronous''' (or non-orthochronous) LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}^\downarrow = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \Gamma \leq -1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
! '''Orthochronous''' LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}^\uparrow = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \Gamma \geq 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
! '''Proper''' LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{+} = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \det(\Lambda) = +1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

|'''Proper orthochronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow = \mathcal{L}_+ \cap \mathcal{L}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;
|-

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{-} = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \det(\Lambda) = -1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
|'''Improper antichronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow = \mathcal{L}_{-} \cap \mathcal{L}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;
|'''Improper orthochronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow = \mathcal{L}_{-} \cap \mathcal{L}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where "+" and "−" indicate the determinant sign, while "↑" for ≥ and "↓" for ≤ denote the inequalities.

The full Lorentz group splits into the [[Union (set theory)|union]] ("u"-shaped symbol meaning "or") of four [[disjoint set]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{+}^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{+}^\downarrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;

A [[subgroup]] of a group must be [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the same operation of the group (here matrix multiplication). In other words, for two Lorentz transformations {{math|Λ}} and {{math|''L''}} from a particular set, the composite Lorentz transformations {{math|Λ''L''}} and {{math|''L''Λ}} must be in the same set as {{math|Λ}} and {{math|''L''}}. This will not always be the case; it can be shown that the composition of ''any'' two Lorentz transformations always has the positive determinant and positive inequality, a proper orthochronous transformation. The sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_0 = \mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; all form subgroups. The other sets involving the improper and/or antichronous properties (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;) do not form subgroups, because the composite transformation always has a positive determinant or inequality, whereas the original separate transformations will have negative determinants and/or inequalities.

===Proper transformations===

The Lorentz boost is

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the boost matrix is

:&lt;math&gt; B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma&amp;-\gamma\beta n_x&amp;-\gamma\beta n_y&amp;-\gamma\beta n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_x&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_x^2&amp;(\gamma-1)n_x n_y&amp;(\gamma-1)n_x n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_y&amp;(\gamma-1)n_y n_x&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_y^2&amp;(\gamma-1)n_y n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_z&amp;(\gamma-1)n_z n_x&amp;(\gamma-1)n_z n_y&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_z^2\\ \end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The boosts along the Cartesian directions can be readily obtained, for example the unit vector in the x direction has components {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''n&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}.

The matrices make one or more successive transformations easier to handle, rather than rotely iterating the transformations to obtain the result of more than one transformation. If a frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} is boosted with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|''F''}}, and another frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is boosted with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, the separate boosts are
:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v})X' \,, \quad X' = B(\mathbf{u})X &lt;/math&gt;
and the composition of the two boosts connects the coordinates in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} and {{math|''F''}},
:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v})B(\mathbf{u})X \,. &lt;/math&gt;
Successive transformations act on the left. If {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} are [[collinear]] (parallel or antiparallel along the same line of relative motion), the boost matrices [[Commutative property|commute]]: {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''') {{=}} ''B''('''u''')''B''('''v''')}} and this composite transformation happens to be another boost.

If {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} are not collinear but in different directions, the situation is considerably more complicated. Lorentz boosts along different directions do not commute: {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} and {{math|''B''('''u''')''B''('''v''')}} are not equal. Also, each of these compositions is ''not'' a single boost, but still a Lorentz transformation as each boost still preserves invariance of the spacetime interval. It turns out the composition of any two Lorentz boosts is equivalent to a boost followed or preceded by a rotation on the spatial coordinates, in the form of {{math|''R''('''ρ''')''B''('''w''')}} or {{math|''B''({{overline|'''w'''}})''R''({{overline|'''ρ'''}})}}. The {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|{{overline|'''w'''}}}} are [[velocity addition formula|composite velocities]], while {{math|'''ρ'''}} and {{math|{{overline|'''ρ'''}}}} are rotation parameters (e.g. [[axis-angle representation|axis-angle]] variables, [[Euler angles]], etc.). The rotation in [[block matrix]] form is simply

:&lt;math&gt;\quad R(\boldsymbol{\rho}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{R}(\boldsymbol{\rho}) \end{bmatrix} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''R'''('''ρ''')}} is a 3d [[rotation matrix]], which rotates any 3d vector in one sense (active transformation), or equivalently the coordinate frame in the opposite sense (passive transformation). It is ''not'' simple to connect {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|'''ρ'''}} (or {{math|{{overline|'''w'''}}}} and {{math|{{overline|'''ρ'''}}}}) to the original boost parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. In a composition of boosts, the {{math|''R''}} matrix is named the [[Wigner rotation]], and gives rise to the [[Thomas precession]]. These articles give the explicit formulae for the composite transformation matrices, including expressions for {{math|'''w''', '''ρ''', {{overline|'''w'''}}, {{overline|'''ρ'''}}}}.

In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used for {{math|'''ρ'''}}. The rotation is about an axis in the direction of a [[unit vector]] {{math|'''e'''}}, through angle {{math|''θ''}} (positive anticlockwise, negative clockwise, according to the [[right-hand rule]]). The "axis-angle vector"
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = \theta \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; 
will serve as a useful abbreviation.

Spatial rotations alone are also Lorentz transformations they leave the spacetime interval invariant. Like boosts, successive rotations about different axes do not commute. Unlike boosts, the composition of any two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation. Some other similarities and differences between the boost and rotation matrices include:

*[[matrix inverse|inverse]]s: {{math|''B''('''v''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''B''(−'''v''')}} (relative motion in the opposite direction), and {{math|''R''('''θ''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''R''(−'''θ''')}} (rotation in the opposite sense about the same axis)
*[[identity transformation]] for no relative motion/rotation: {{math|''B''('''0''') {{=}} ''R''('''0''') {{=}} ''I''}}
*unit [[determinant]]: {{math|det(''B'') {{=}} det(''R'') {{=}} +1}}. This property makes them proper transformations.
*[[symmetric matrix|matrix symmetry]]: {{math|''B''}} is symmetric (equals [[transpose]]), while {{math|''R''}} is nonsymmetric but [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (transpose equals [[matrix inverse|inverse]], {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

The most general proper Lorentz transformation {{math|Λ('''v''', '''θ''')}} includes a boost and rotation together, and is a nonsymmetric matrix. As special cases, {{math|Λ('''0''', '''θ''') {{=}} ''R''('''θ''')}} and {{math|Λ('''v''', '''0''') {{=}} ''B''('''v''')}}. An explicit form of the general Lorentz transformation is cumbersome to write down and will not be given here. Nevertheless, closed form expressions for the transformation matrices will be given below using group theoretical arguments. It will be easier to use the rapidity parametrization for boosts, in which case one writes {{math|Λ('''ζ''', '''θ''')}} and {{math|''B''('''ζ''')}}.

====The Lie group SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3,1)====

The set of transformations

:&lt;math&gt; \{ B(\boldsymbol{\zeta}), R(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \Lambda(\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) \} &lt;/math&gt;

with matrix multiplication as the operation of composition forms a group, called the "restricted Lorentz group", and is the [[special indefinite orthogonal group]] SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3,1). (The plus sign indicates that it preserves the orientation of the temporal dimension).

For simplicity, look at the infinitesimal Lorentz boost in the x direction (examining a boost in any other direction, or rotation about any axis, follows an identical procedure). The infinitesimal boost is a small boost away from the identity, obtained by the [[Taylor expansion]] of the boost matrix to first order about {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt; B_x = I + \zeta \left. \frac{\partial B_x}{\partial \zeta } \right|_{\zeta=0} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

where the higher order terms not shown are negligible because {{math|''ζ''}} is small, and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is simply the boost matrix in the ''x'' direction. The [[matrix calculus|derivative of the matrix]] is the matrix of derivatives (of the entries, with respect to the same variable), and it is understood the derivatives are found first then evaluated at {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt; \left. \frac{\partial B_x }{\partial \zeta } \right|_{\zeta=0} = - K_x \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For now, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is defined by this result (its significance will be explained shortly). In the limit of an infinite number of infinitely small steps, the finite boost transformation in the form of a [[matrix exponential]] is obtained

:&lt;math&gt; B_x =\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left(I-\frac{\zeta }{N}K_x\right)^{N} = e^{-\zeta K_x} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Exponential function#Formal definition|limit definition of the exponential]] has been used (see also [[characterizations of the exponential function]]). More generally&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} = \zeta_x K_x + \zeta_y K_y + \zeta_z K_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} = \theta_x J_x + \theta_y J_y + \theta_z J_z &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol{\zeta}) = e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta}\cdot\mathbf{K}} \, , \quad R(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = e^{\boldsymbol{\theta}\cdot\mathbf{J}} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The axis-angle vector {{math|'''θ'''}} and rapidity vector {{math|'''ζ'''}} are altogether six continuous variables which make up the group parameters (in this particular representation), and the generators of the group are {{math|'''K''' {{=}} (''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and {{math|'''J''' {{=}} (''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, each vectors of matrices with the explicit forms&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum field theory]], a different convention is used for these matrices; the right hand sides are all multiplied by a factor of the imaginary unit {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|−1}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_x = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad K_y = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad K_z = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_x =  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad J_y = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad J_z =  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

These are all defined in an analogous way to {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above, although the minus signs in the boost generators are conventional. Physically, the generators of the Lorentz group correspond to important symmetries in spacetime: {{math|'''J'''}} are the ''rotation generators'' which correspond to [[angular momentum]], and {{math|'''K'''}} are the ''boost generators'' which correspond to the motion of the system in spacetime. The derivative of any smooth curve {{math|''C''(''t'')}} with {{math|''C''(0) {{=}} ''I''}} in the group depending on some group parameter {{math|''t''}} with respect to that group parameter, evaluated at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, serves as a definition of a corresponding group generator {{math|''G''}}, and this reflects an infinitesimal transformation away from the identity. The smooth curve can always be taken as an exponential as the exponential will always map {{math|''G''}} smoothly back into the group via {{math|''t'' → exp(''tG'')}} for all {{math|''t''}}; this curve will yield {{math|''G''}} again when differentiated at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.

Expanding the exponentials in their Taylor series obtains

:&lt;math&gt; B({\boldsymbol {\zeta }})=I-\sinh \zeta (\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {K} )+(\cosh \zeta -1)(\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {K} )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(\boldsymbol {\theta })=I+\sin \theta (\mathbf {e} \cdot \mathbf {J} )+(1-\cos \theta )(\mathbf {e} \cdot \mathbf {J} )^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

which compactly reproduce the boost and rotation matrices as given in the previous section.

It has been stated that the general proper Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and rotation. At the ''infinitesimal'' level the product

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Lambda 
 &amp; = (I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K} + \cdots )(I + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots ) \\
 &amp; = (I + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots )(I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K} + \cdots ) \\
 &amp; = I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K}  + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots   
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

is commutative because only linear terms are required (products like {{math|('''θ'''·'''J''')('''ζ'''·'''K''')}} and {{math|('''ζ'''·'''K''')('''θ'''·'''J''')}} count as higher order terms and are negligible). Taking the limit as before leads to the finite transformation in the form of an exponential

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda (\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} }.&lt;/math&gt;

The converse is also true, but the decomposition of a finite general Lorentz transformation into such factors is nontrivial. In particular,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} } \ne e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K}} e^{\boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J}},&lt;/math&gt;

because the generators do not commute. For a description of how to find the factors of a general Lorentz transformation in terms of a boost and a rotation ''in principle'' (this usually does not yield an intelligible expression in terms of generators {{math|'''J'''}} and {{math|'''K'''}}), see [[Wigner rotation]]. If, on the other hand, ''the decomposition is given'' in terms of the generators, and one wants to find the product in terms of the generators, then the [[Baker&amp;ndash;Campbell&amp;ndash;Hausdorff formula]] applies.

====The Lie algebra so(3,1)====

Lorentz generators can be added together, or multiplied by real numbers, to obtain more Lorentz generators. In other words, the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all Lorentz generators

:&lt;math&gt;V = \{ \boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J}  \} &lt;/math&gt;

together with the operations of ordinary [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication#Scalar multiplication|multiplication of a matrix by a number]], forms a [[vector space]] over the real numbers.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Until now the term "vector" has exclusively referred to "[[Euclidean vector]]", examples are position {{math|'''r'''}}, velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, etc. The term "vector" applies much more broadly than Euclidean vectors, row or column vectors, etc., see [[linear algebra]] and [[vector space]] for details. The generators of a Lie group also form a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of numbers (e.g. [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s), since a [[linear combination]] of the generators is also a generator. They just live in a different space to the position vectors in ordinary 3d space.&lt;/ref&gt; The generators {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] set of ''V'', and the components of the axis-angle and rapidity vectors, {{math|''θ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, are the [[coordinate vector|coordinate]]s of a Lorentz generator with respect to this basis.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In ordinary 3d [[position space]], the position vector {{math|'''r''' {{=}} ''x'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''z'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is expressed as a linear combination of the Cartesian unit vectors {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} which form a basis, and the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''x, y, z''}} are coordinates with respect to this basis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are

:&lt;math&gt;[ J_x, J_y ] =  J_z \,,\quad [ K_x, K_y ] = -J_z \,,\quad [ J_x, K_y ] =  K_z \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

These commutation relations, and the vector space of generators, fulfill the definition of the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}(3, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. In summary, a Lie algebra is defined as a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of numbers, and with a [[binary operation]] [ , ] (called a [[Lie bracket]] in this context) on the elements of the vector space, satisfying the axioms of [[Bilinear map|bilinearity]], [[alternatization]], and the [[Jacobi identity]]. Here the operation [ , ] is the commutator which satisfies all of these axioms, the vector space is the set of Lorentz generators ''V'' as given previously, and the field is the set of real numbers.

Linking terminology used in mathematics and physics: A group generator is any element of the Lie algebra. A group parameter is a component of a coordinate vector representing an arbitrary element of the Lie algebra with respect to some basis. A basis, then, is a set of generators being a basis of the Lie algebra in the usual vector space sense.

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the Lie algebra to the Lie group,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp} \, : \, \mathfrak{so}(3,1) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(3,1),&lt;/math&gt;

provides a one-to-one correspondence between small enough neighborhoods of the origin of the Lie algebra and neighborhoods of the identity element of the Lie group. It the case of the Lorentz group, the exponential map is just the [[matrix exponential]]. Globally, the exponential map is not one-to-one, but in the case of the Lorentz group, it is [[surjective function|surjective]] (onto). Hence any group element can be expressed as an exponential of an element of the Lie algebra.

===Improper transformations===

Lorentz transformations also include [[parity inversion]]

:&lt;math&gt; P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; - \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which negates all the spatial coordinates only, and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]

:&lt;math&gt; T = \begin{bmatrix} - 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which negates the time coordinate only, because these transformations leave the spacetime interval invariant. Here {{math|'''I'''}} is the 3d [[identity matrix]]. These are both symmetric, they are their own inverses (see [[involution (mathematics)]]), and each have determinant −1. This latter property makes them improper transformations.

If {{math|Λ}} is a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation, then {{math|''T''Λ}} is improper antichronous, {{math|''P''Λ}} is improper orthochronous, and {{math|''TP''Λ {{=}} ''PT''Λ}} is proper antichronous.

=== Inhomogeneous Lorentz group ===

Two other spacetime symmetries have not been accounted for. For the spacetime interval to be invariant, it can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is necessary and sufficient for the coordinate transformation to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \Lambda X + C &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is a constant column containing translations in time and space. If ''C'' ≠ 0, this is an '''inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation''' or '''[[Poincaré transformation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2005|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ohlsson|2011|page=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''C'' = 0, this is a '''homogeneous Lorentz transformation'''. Poincaré transformations are not dealt further in this article.

=== Contravariant vectors ===
Writing the general matrix transformation of coordinates as the matrix equation

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    {x'}^0 \\
    {x'}^1 \\
    {x'}^2 \\
    {x'}^3
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    {\Lambda^0}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^1}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^2}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^3}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_3 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x^0 \\
    x^1 \\
    x^2 \\
    x^3
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

allows the transformation of other physical quantities that cannot be expressed as four-vectors; e.g., [[tensor]]s or [[spinor]]s of any order in 4d spacetime, to be defined. In the corresponding [[tensor index notation]], the above matrix expression is

:&lt;math&gt;{x^\prime}^\nu = {\Lambda^\nu}_\mu x^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

where lower and upper indices label [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant components]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics for Physicists |first1=Philippe |last1=Dennery |first2=André |last2=Krzywicki |publisher=Courier Corporation |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-486-15712-2 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHCAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 Extract of page 138]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[summation convention]] is applied. It is a standard convention to use [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] indices that take the value 0 for time components, and 1, 2, 3 for space components, while [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] indices simply take the values 1, 2, 3, for spatial components. Note that the first index (reading left to right) corresponds in the matrix notation to a ''row index''. The second index corresponds to the column index.

The transformation matrix is universal for all [[four-vector]]s, not just 4-dimensional spacetime coordinates. If {{math|''A''}} is any four-vector, then in [[tensor index notation]]

:&lt;math&gt; {A^\prime}^\nu = {\Lambda^\nu}_\mu A^\mu \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, one writes

:&lt;math&gt; A^{\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\mu A^\mu \,.&lt;/math&gt;

in which the primed indices denote the indices of A in the primed frame. This notation cuts risk of exhausting the Greek alphabet roughly in half.

For a general {{math|''n''}}-component object one may write

:&lt;math&gt;{X'}^\alpha = {\Pi(\Lambda)^\alpha}_\beta X^\beta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Π}} is the appropriate [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation of the Lorentz group]], an {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix for every {{math|Λ}}. In this case, the indices should ''not'' be thought of as spacetime indices (sometimes called Lorentz indices), and they run from {{math|1}} to {{math|''n''}}. E.g., if {{mvar|X}} is a [[bispinor]], then the indices are called ''Dirac indices''.

=== Covariant vectors ===
There are also vector quantities with covariant indices. They are generally obtained from their corresponding objects with contravariant indices by the operation of ''lowering an index''; e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;x_\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu}x^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''η''}} is the [[metric tensor]]. (The linked article also provides more information about what the operation of raising and lowering indices really is mathematically.) The inverse of this transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu = \eta^{\nu\mu}x_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where, when viewed as matrices, {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the inverse of {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As it happens, {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. This is referred to as ''raising an index''. To transform a covariant vector {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, first raise its index, then transform it according to the same rule as for contravariant {{math|4}}-vectors, then finally lower the index;

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = \eta_{\rho\nu} {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma \eta^{\mu\sigma}A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rho\nu} {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma \eta^{\mu\sigma} = {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

I. e., it is the {{math|(''μ'', ''ν'')}}-component of the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation. One defines (as a matter of notation),

:&lt;math&gt;{\Lambda_\nu}^\mu \equiv {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

and may in this notation write

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = {\Lambda_\nu}^\mu A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Now for a subtlety. The implied summation on the right hand side of

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = {\Lambda_\nu}^\mu A_\mu = {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

is running over ''a row index'' of the matrix representing {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus, in terms of matrices, this transformation should be thought of as the ''inverse transpose'' of {{math|Λ}} acting on the column vector {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. That is, in pure matrix notation,

:&lt;math&gt;A' = \left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mathrm{T} A.&lt;/math&gt;

This means exactly that covariant vectors (thought of as column matrices) transform according to the [[dual representation]] of the standard representation of the Lorentz group. This notion generalizes to general representations, simply replace {{math|Λ}} with {{math|Π(Λ)}}.

=== Tensors ===
If {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are linear operators on vector spaces {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}}, then a linear operator {{math|''A'' ⊗ ''B''}} may be defined on the [[tensor product]] of {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}}, denoted {{math|''U'' ⊗ ''V''}} according to&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|loc=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
 |indent =:
 |equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;(A \otimes B)(u \otimes v) = Au \otimes Bv, \qquad u \in U, v \in V, u \otimes v \in U \otimes V.&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;    {{EquationRef|(T1)}}
 |cellpadding= 6
 |border
 |border colour = #0073CF

}}

From this it is immediately clear that if {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are a four-vectors in {{mvar|V}}, then {{math|''u'' ⊗ ''v'' ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' ≡ ''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} transforms as

{{Equation box 1
 |indent =:
 |equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;
  u \otimes v \rightarrow \Lambda u \otimes \Lambda v =
    {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu u^\nu \otimes {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma v^\sigma =
    {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma u^\nu \otimes v^\sigma \equiv
    {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma w^{\nu\sigma}.

}}

The second step uses the bilinearity of the tensor product and the last step defines a 2-tensor on component form, or rather, it just renames the tensor {{math|''u'' ⊗ ''v''}}.

These observations generalize in an obvious way to more factors, and using the fact that a general tensor on a vector space {{math|''V''}} can be written as a sum of a coefficient (component!) times tensor products of basis vectors and basis covectors, one arrives at the transformation law for any [[tensor]] quantity {{math|''T''}}. It is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''Λ&lt;sub&gt;χ&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ψ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is defined above. This form can generally be reduced to the form for general {{math|''n''}}-component objects given above with a single matrix ({{math|Π(Λ)}}) operating on column vectors. This latter form is sometimes preferred; e.g., for the electromagnetic field tensor.

==== Transformation of the electromagnetic field ====
[[File:Lorentz boost electric charge.svg|300px|thumb|Lorentz boost of an electric charge, the charge is at rest in one frame or the other.]]
{{main|Electromagnetic tensor}}
{{Further|classical electromagnetism and special relativity}}

Lorentz transformations can also be used to illustrate that the [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}} and [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} are simply different aspects of the same force — the [[electromagnetic force]], as a consequence of relative motion between [[electric charge]]s and observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|Phillips|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the electromagnetic field shows relativistic effects becomes clear by carrying out a simple thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An observer measures a charge at rest in frame F. The observer will detect a static electric field.  As the charge is stationary in this frame, there is no electric current, so the observer does not observe any magnetic field.
*The other observer in frame F′ moves at velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to F and the charge. ''This'' observer sees a different electric field because the charge moves at velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} in their rest frame. The motion of the charge corresponds to an [[electric current]], and thus the observer in frame F′ also sees a magnetic field.

The electric and magnetic fields transform differently from space and time, but exactly the same way as relativistic angular momentum and the boost vector.

The electromagnetic field strength tensor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
  F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0              &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_x &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_y &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_z \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_x &amp;  0              &amp; -B_z            &amp;  B_y   \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_y &amp;  B_z            &amp;  0              &amp; -B_x   \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_z &amp; -B_y            &amp;  B_x            &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix} \text{(SI units, signature }(+,-,-,-)\text{)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

in [[SI units]]. In relativity, the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian system of units]] is often preferred over SI units, even in texts whose main choice of units is SI units, because in it the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} and the magnetic induction {{math|'''B'''}} have the same units making the appearance of the [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field tensor]] more natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a Lorentz boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction. It is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu = \begin{bmatrix}
     \gamma      &amp; -\gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    -\gamma\beta &amp;  \gamma      &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
     0           &amp;  0           &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
     0           &amp;  0           &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  \end{bmatrix}, \qquad

  F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
     0   &amp;  E_x &amp;  E_y &amp;  E_z \\
    -E_x &amp;  0   &amp;  B_z &amp; -B_y \\
    -E_y &amp; -B_z &amp;  0   &amp;  B_x \\
    -E_z &amp;  B_y &amp; -B_x &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix} \text{(Gaussian units, signature }(-,+,+,+)\text{)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the field tensor is displayed side by side for easiest possible reference in the manipulations below.

The general transformation law {{EquationNote|(T3)}} becomes

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu'\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the magnetic field one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_{x'} &amp;= F^{2'3'}
            = {\Lambda^2}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^2}_2 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{23}

         &amp;= B_x, \\
  B_{y'} &amp;= F^{3'1'}
            = {\Lambda^3}_\mu {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{\mu \nu}
            = {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{3\nu}
            = {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_0 F^{30} + {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_1 F^{31} \\
         &amp;= 1 \times (-\beta\gamma) (-E_z) + 1 \times \gamma B_y
            = \gamma B_y + \beta\gamma E_z \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}\right)_y \\
  B_{z'} &amp;= F^{1'2'}
            = {\Lambda^1}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^1}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{\mu 2}
            = {\Lambda^1}_0 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{02} + {\Lambda^1}_1 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{12} \\
         &amp;= (-\gamma\beta) \times 1\times E_y + \gamma \times 1 \times B_z
            = \gamma B_z - \beta\gamma E_y \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}\right)_z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the electric field results

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E_{x'} &amp;= F^{0'1'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^1}_0 F^{10} + {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^1}_1 F^{01} \\
         &amp;= (-\gamma\beta)(-\gamma\beta)(-E_x) + \gamma\gamma E_x
            = -\gamma^2\beta^2(E_x) + \gamma^2 E_x
            = E_x(1 - \beta^2)\gamma^2 \\
         &amp;= E_x, \\
  E_{y'} &amp;= F^{0'2'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{\mu 2}
            = {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{02} + {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{12} \\
         &amp;= \gamma \times 1 \times E_y + (-\beta\gamma) \times 1 \times B_z
            = \gamma E_y - \beta\gamma B_z \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}\right)_y \\
  E_{z'} &amp;= F^{0'3'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{\mu 3}
            = {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{03} + {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{13} \\
         &amp;= \gamma \times 1 \times E_z - \beta\gamma \times 1 \times (-B_y)
            = \gamma E_z + \beta\gamma B_y \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}\right)_z.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|'''''β''''' {{=}} (''β'', 0, 0)}} is used. These results can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
  \mathbf{E}_{\parallel'} &amp;= \mathbf{E}_\parallel \\
  \mathbf{B}_{\parallel'} &amp;= \mathbf{B}_\parallel \\
       \mathbf{E}_{\bot'} &amp;= \gamma \left( \mathbf{E}_\bot + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}_\bot \right) = \gamma \left( \mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B} \right)_\bot,\\
       \mathbf{B}_{\bot'} &amp;= \gamma \left( \mathbf{B}_\bot - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}_\bot \right) = \gamma \left( \mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E} \right)_\bot,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and are independent of the metric signature. For SI units, substitute {{math|''E'' → {{frac|''E''|''c''}}}}. {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}} refer to this last form as the {{math|3 + 1}} view as opposed to the ''geometric view'' represented by the tensor expression
:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu'\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
and make a strong point of the ease with which results that are difficult to achieve using the {{math|3 + 1}} view can be obtained and understood. Only objects that have well defined Lorentz transformation properties (in fact under ''any'' smooth coordinate transformation) are geometric objects. In the geometric view, the electromagnetic field is a six-dimensional geometric object in ''spacetime'' as opposed to two interdependent, but separate, 3-vector fields in ''space'' and ''time''. The fields {{math|'''E'''}} (alone) and {{math|'''B'''}} (alone) do not have well defined Lorentz transformation properties. The mathematical underpinnings are equations {{EquationNote|(T1)}} and {{EquationNote|(T2)}} that immediately yield {{EquationNote|(T3)}}. One should note that the primed and unprimed tensors refer to the ''same event in spacetime''. Thus the complete equation with spacetime dependence is
:&lt;math&gt;
  F^{\mu' \nu'}\left(x'\right) =
    {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}\left(\Lambda^{-1} x'\right) =
    {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

Length contraction has an effect on [[charge density]] {{math|''ρ''}} and [[current density]] {{math|'''J'''}}, and time dilation has an effect on the rate of flow of charge (current), so charge and current distributions must transform in a related way under a boost. It turns out they transform exactly like the space-time and energy-momentum four-vectors,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{j}' &amp;= \mathbf{j} - \gamma\rho v\mathbf{n} + \left( \gamma - 1 \right)(\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} \\
        \rho' &amp;= \gamma \left(\rho - \mathbf{j} \cdot \frac{v\mathbf{n}}{c^2}\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or, in the simpler geometric view,
:&lt;math&gt;j^{\mu^\prime} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu j^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

One says that charge density transforms as the time component of a four-vector. It is a rotational scalar. The current density is a 3-vector.

The [[Maxwell equations]] are invariant under Lorentz transformations.

=== Spinors ===
Equation {{EquationNote|(T1)}} hold unmodified for any representation of the Lorentz group, including the [[bispinor]] representation. In {{EquationNote|(T2)}} one simply replaces all occurrences of {{math|Λ}} by the bispinor representation {{math|Π(Λ)}},

{{criminal law}}
'''Malice''' is a [[legal]] term referring to a party's [[intent (law)|intent]]ion to do [[injury]] to another party.  Malice is either ''expressed'' or ''implied''.  Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Cal. Pen. Code § 188. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the [[defendant]], depending on the nature of the case.

In many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict (for example malice is an element of the crime of [[arson]] in many jurisdictions). In [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater [[damages]], or for [[punitive damages]].  The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo-American law, and in legal systems derived from the English [[common law]] system.

In [[English law|English]] civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in [[negligence]] and misfeasance in a public office includes ''Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council'' [1982] A.C. 158; ''Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food'' [1986] Q.B. 716; ''Jones v Swansea City Council'' [1990] 1 WLR 1453; ''Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England'' [2000]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm Parliament.the-stationary-office.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313092450/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm |date=2006-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis'' [1995] 2 QB 335 in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented.

In English criminal law on ''[[mens rea]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty mind"), ''R v. Cunningham'' (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for "maliciously" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter:
:In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken ... as requiring either:
# an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or
# recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (i.e. the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it).

Lord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in ''R v Mowatt'' (1968) 1 QB 421:
:In the offence under section 20 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], the word "maliciously" does import upon the part of the person who unlawfully inflicts the wound or other [[grievous bodily harm]] an awareness that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some other person … It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.

In the [[United States]], the malice standard was set in the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', allowing free reporting of the civil rights campaign. The malice standard decides whether press reports about a [[public figure]] can be considered defamation or libel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''Manan''' is a name and a word with meanings in various languages.

== Gaelic ==
'''Manan''' (Man-án, also spelled Mannan) is a name with Gaelic roots. Manan is "'''a new beginning '''" or "'''morning '''", a "'''new day'''" or "'''opportunity'''". It insinuates a positive feeling towards an opportunity, or fresh start.

According to a popular legend in Irish folklore, ''"The Giant Boulder"'' - the name of the hero in the story was '''Manan'''.  '''Manan''' saved the Irish village from destruction by positioning a giant boulder blocking the sea, preventing the town's inhabitants from drowning; that village later called every clan leader by the honorary name of '''Manan''', and it stands for honor, strength, and greatness.

== Sanskrit ==
'''Manan''' ({{indic|lang=sa|indic=मनन|trans=manana|defaultipa=mənənə}}; {{indic|lang=hi|indic=मनन|trans=manan|defaultipa=mənən}}) means '''deep thought''', '''contemplation''', or '''profound reflection'''. The root of the word is '''man''' ([[Sanskrit]] मन) — the mind — i.e., the faculty that produces thoughts and feelings.

In [[Vedanta]] group of Hindu philosophical traditions (see, for instance, {{Harvnb|Paranjpe|1998|p=173}}), there are three steps to self-realization: (1) "[[Shravana (hearing)|shravana]]" i.e., careful listening to the teaching of the [[Vedanta]], (2) "'''manana'''" i.e., repeatedly and deeply reflecting on or contemplating what is learned from those teachings, and (3) "[[nididhyasana]]" i.e., becoming completely absorbed in contemplation that no other thought enters the mind.

The Sanskrit derived Manan is a relatively uncommon name given to males in India.

== Tamil ==
Mannan means "king" or "leader"
in Tamil.

== Persian ==
The name Manan can also be of Persian background and is given to males. Manan's meaning encompasses the ideas of conscience, mind, and soul.  It insinuates the qualities of thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and consideration. The name apparently also means fun-loving, naughty, and joyous as well as disciplined and righteous. A "Manan" would not agree with or appreciate wrongdoing, unmannered persons.

== Arabic ==
Manan or Mannan is a name that is also found in Islam; it's an Arabic name. Generally, this is not used alone, as it's preceded by names like Abdul etc. (Abdul Manan or Abdul Mannan, means Slave of the God), it is so because Manan is one of God's names, hence the name Abdul Manan is given.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="898">In [[Dvaita]] theology, ''' Mukti-yogyas''' is a class of souls classified by [[Shri Madhvacharya]] as eligible for mukti or [[moksha]]. Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ('''Mukti-yogyas'''), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration ([[Nitya-samsarins]]), and a third class that is eventually condemned to non-eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mukti-yogyas are [[Jiva]]s or souls who are receptive to spiritual values, and through repeated embodiments they evolve into better and better people, and finally through concentrated spiritual discipline and God's grace attain salvation.

The '''northern ribbon snake''' (''Thamnophis sauritus septentrionalis'') is a [[subspecies]] of [[garter snake]]. It is one of four [[subspecies]] of the ribbon snake (''[[Thamnophis sauritus]]'') and occurs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in southern [[Maine]], [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], southern [[Ontario]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Nova Scotia]], northern [[Ohio|Minnesota, Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]]. It is listed as a state [[endangered species]] in [[Wisconsin]]. It is a slender [[black]] or [[brown]] snake with three bright-[[yellow]] or [[white]] stripes on its back and sides.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The head is black, with the [[scale (zoology)|scales]] alongside the mouth being white. The underside is also white or light yellow, but it is mostly white on juveniles and adults. Adult ribbon snakes are {{convert|45|-|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/subsite/glfc-amphibians/thamnophis-sauritus Northern Ribbon Snake], Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribbon snakes inhabit marshes or live near the edges of lakes, ponds, and streams. They swim well and their diets include [[frog]]s, [[tadpole]]s, [[salamander]]s, small [[fish]], and [[insect]]s.

Northern ribbon snakes have from three to 26 young which are born in late summer. The young snakes are 7-9&amp;nbsp;in long and are colored the same as the adults. As most garter snakes, the mother gives birth to live young ([[ovoviviparous]]).

[[Image:ocw.jpg|thumb|420px|The case study used here to illustrate the transformation process is a slight adaptation of the case used by Bonacin (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigo Bonacin et al. (2004). [http://www.ais.rdg.ac.uk/papers/con-ICEIS2004Rodrigosub1.pdf "From Ontology chart s to Class diagrams: semantic analysis aiding systems design”]. In: ''Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Porto, 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An '''ontology chart''' is a type of [[chart]] used in [[semiotics]] and [[software engineering]] to illustrate an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]].

== Overview ==
The nodes of an ontology chart represent universal [[affordances]] and rarely represent [[particulars]]. The exception is the root which is a particular agent often labelled ‘society’ and located on the extreme left of an ontology chart. The root is often dropped in practice but is implied in every ontology chart. If any other particular is present in an ontology chart it is recognised by the ‘#’ sign prefix and upper case letters. In our ontology chart the node labelled #IBM is a particular organisation.

The arcs represent ontological dependency relations directed from left to right. The right affordance is ontologically dependent on the left affordance. The left affordance is the ontological antecedent of the right affordance. A special category of affordances are determiners. They are recognised by the ‘#’ sign prefix. The two examples above are #hourly rate and #name. All determiners have a second antecedent – the measurement standard. They are usually dropped from the ontology chart but they are implied and obvious.  In the case of hourly rate and name they are currency and language respectively. The names on the arcs are role names of the carrier, the left node, in the relationship node on the right.  For example, the ‘employee’ is the role name of a person while in employment. No ontology chart node has more than two ontological antecedents. Where you find an arc on the ontology chart between a role name and a node, read that as an arc between the right hand side of the role name.  So the arc from employee to works at is an arc between employment and works at

Mathematically, ontology charts are a graphical representation of semi-lattice structures; specifically they are [[Hasse diagram]]s of a single root and no cycles. Ontological dependency is a relationship known mathematically as a partial order set relation (poset). Posets are an object of study in the mathematical discipline of order theory. They belong to the class of binary relations but they have three additional properties: [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]], anti-symmetry and transitivity.

Ontological dependency is a special poset because it is a binary relation, every thing is ontologically dependent on itself for its existence, two things that are mutually ontologically dependent must be the same thing and if a depends on b and b depends on c then a depends on c.   The last of these properties - the transitive property of posets - was exploited by Helmut Hasse to give us the Hasse diagram - a diagram of incredible power, simplicity and if drawn well elegant as well. Because ontology charts have a root that all affordances (realisations/things) are ultimately dependent upon for their existence, they are graphical representation of semi-lattices.

[[File:U.S. 30 in Center Township.jpg|right|thumb|Open fields near [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon, OH]].|alt=Rolling countryside with fields, some cultivated, others not. There is a small house at the left center.]]
The '''open-fields doctrine''' (also '''open-field doctrine''' or '''open-fields rule'''), in the [[U.S. law]] of [[criminal procedure]], is the [[legal doctrine]] that a "[[warrantless search]] of the area outside a [[property]] owner's [[curtilage]]" does not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (9th ed. 2009), open-fields doctrine&lt;/ref&gt; However, "unless there is some other legal basis for the search," such a search "must exclude the home and any adjoining land (such as a yard) that is within an enclosure or otherwise protected from public scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' (9th ed. 2009), open-fields doctrine&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The open fields doctrine was first articulated by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Hester v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hester v. U.S.]]'', 265 U.S. 57 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not extended to the open fields."&lt;ref&gt;''Hester v. U.S.'', 265 U.S. 57, 57 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion appears to be decided on the basis that "open fields are not a "constitutionally protected area" because they cannot be construed as "persons, houses, papers, [or] effects."

This method of reasoning gave way with the arrival of the landmark case ''[[Katz v. U.S.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Katz v. U.S.]]'', 389 U.S. 347 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; which established a two-part test for what constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The relevant criteria are "first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) [[expectation of privacy]] and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable'."&lt;ref&gt;''Katz v. U.S.'', 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Under this new analysis of the Fourth Amendment, a search of an object or area where a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy is, in a legal sense, not a search at all. That search, therefore, does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.

In ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oliver v. U.S.]]'', 466 U.S. 170 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that a privacy expectation regarding an open field is unreasonable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields.&lt;ref&gt;''Oliver v. U.S.'', 466 U.S. 170, 179 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Courts have continuously held that entry into an open field—whether [[trespass]] or not—is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. No matter what steps a person takes, he or she cannot create a reasonable privacy expectation in an open field, because it is an area incapable of supporting an expectation of privacy as a matter of constitutional law. In situations where the police allege that what was searched was an open field, this has the practical effect of shifting the argument from whether any given expectation of privacy is reasonable, to whether the given place is actually an open field or some other type of area like [[curtilage]]. This is because a person ''can'' have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas classed as such.

== Distinguishing open fields from curtilage ==

While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the [[curtilage]], or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, may be protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment.
An area is curtilage if it "harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', 480 U.S. 294, 300 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Courts make this determination by examining "the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Dunn]]'', 480 U.S. 294, 301 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, many structures might extend the curtilage protection to the areas immediately surrounding them. The courts have gone so far as to treat a tent as a home for Fourth Amendment purposes in the past.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Gooch]]'', 6 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[LaDuke v. Nelson]]'', 762 F.2d 1318 (9th Cir. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[LaDuke v. Castillo]]'', 455 F.Supp. (E.D. Wash. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; (Note:  these are 9th Circuit Court of Appeals cases and would not be binding authority in many, if not most, cases.) It is possible that the area immediately surrounding a tent (or any structure used as a home) might be considered curtilage.

Despite this rather broad interpretation of curtilage, the courts seem willing to find areas to be outside of the curtilage if they are in any way separate from the home (by a fence, great distance, other structures, even certain plants).&lt;ref&gt;''[[U.S. v. Hatch]]'', 931 F.2d 1478 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 883 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27283">In [[mathematics]], '''orthogonal coordinates''' are defined as a set of ''d'' coordinates '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) in which the [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] all meet at right angles (note: superscripts are [[Einstein notation|indices]], not exponents).  A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is a constant.  For example, the three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces ''x'' = constant, ''y'' = constant, and ''z'' = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of [[curvilinear coordinates]].

==Motivation==

[[Image:Conformal map.svg|right|thumb|A [[conformal map]] acting on a rectangular grid. Note that the orthogonality of the curved grid is retained.]]

While vector operations and physical laws are normally easiest to derive in [[Cartesian coordinates]], non-Cartesian orthogonal coordinates are often used instead for the solution of various problems, especially [[boundary value problem]]s, such as those arising in field theories of [[quantum mechanics]], [[fluid flow]], [[electrodynamics]] and the [[diffusion]] of [[chemical species]] or [[heat]].

The chief advantage of non-Cartesian coordinates is that they can be chosen to match the symmetry of the problem. For example, the pressure wave due to an explosion far from the ground (or other barriers) depends on 3D space in Cartesian coordinates, however the pressure predominantly moves away from the center, so that in [[spherical coordinates]] the problem becomes very nearly one-dimensional (since the pressure wave dominantly depends only on time and the distance from the center). Another example is (slow) fluid in a straight circular pipe: in Cartesian coordinates, one has to solve a (difficult) two dimensional boundary value problem involving a partial differential equation, but in [[cylindrical coordinates]] the problem becomes one-dimensional with an [[ordinary differential equation]] instead of a [[partial differential equation]].

The reason to prefer orthogonal coordinates instead of general [[curvilinear coordinates]] is simplicity: many complications arise when coordinates are not orthogonal. For example, in orthogonal coordinates many problems may be solved by [[separation of variables]].  Separation of variables is a mathematical technique that converts a complex ''d''-dimensional problem into ''d'' one-dimensional problems that can be solved in terms of known functions.  Many equations can be reduced to [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]].  [[Laplace's equation]] is separable in 13 orthogonal coordinate systems (the 14 listed [[Orthogonal_coordinates#Table_of_orthogonal_coordinates|in the table below]] with the exception of [[Toroidal_coordinates|toroidal]]), and the [[Helmholtz equation]] is separable in 11 orthogonal coordinate systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morse and Feshbach|1953|loc=Volume 1, pp. 494-523, 655-666.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthogonal coordinates never have off-diagonal terms in their [[metric tensor]].  In other words, the infinitesimal squared distance ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can always be written as a scaled sum of the squared infinitesimal coordinate displacements

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = \sum_{k=1}^d \left( h_k \, dq^{k} \right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the dimension and the scaling functions (or scale factors)

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{k}(\mathbf{q})\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sqrt{g_{kk}(\mathbf{q})} = |\mathbf e_k|
&lt;/math&gt;

equal the square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor, or the lengths of the local basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_k&lt;/math&gt; described below.  These scaling functions ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are used to calculate differential operators in the new coordinates, e.g., the [[gradient]], the [[Vector Laplacian|Laplacian]], the [[divergence]] and the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].

A simple method for generating orthogonal coordinates systems in two dimensions is by a [[conformal mapping]] of a standard two-dimensional grid of [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}.  A [[complex number]] ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy'' can be formed from the real coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', where ''i'' represents the [[imaginary unit]].  Any [[holomorphic function]] ''w'' = ''f''(''z'') with non-zero complex derivative will produce a [[conformal mapping]]; if the resulting complex number is written {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''iv''}}, then the curves of constant ''u'' and ''v'' intersect at right angles, just as the original lines of constant ''x'' and ''y'' did.

Orthogonal coordinates in three and higher dimensions can be generated from an orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate system, either by projecting it into a new dimension (''cylindrical coordinates'') or by rotating the two-dimensional system about one of its symmetry axes.  However, there are other orthogonal coordinate systems in three dimensions that cannot be obtained by projecting or rotating a two-dimensional system, such as the [[ellipsoidal coordinates]]. More general orthogonal coordinates may be obtained by starting with some necessary coordinate surfaces and considering their [[orthogonal trajectories]].

==Basis vectors==

===Covariant basis===

In [[Cartesian coordinates]], the [[basis vectors]] are fixed (constant). In the more general setting of [[curvilinear coordinates]], a point in space is specified by the coordinates, and at every such point there is bound a set of basis vectors, which generally are not constant: this is the essence of curvilinear coordinates in general and is a very important concept. What distinguishes orthogonal coordinates is that, though the basis vectors vary, they are always [[orthogonal]] with respect to each other. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;

These basis vectors are by definition the [[Differential geometry of curves#Tangent vector|tangent vector]]s of the curves obtained by varying one coordinate, keeping the others fixed:

[[Image:OrthogonalCoordinates.png|thumb|300px|Visualization of 2D orthogonal coordinates. Curves obtained by holding all but one coordinate constant are shown, along with basis vectors. Note that the basis vectors aren't of equal length: they need not be, they only need to be orthogonal.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i = \frac{\partial \mathbf r}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is some point and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the coordinate for which the basis vector is extracted. In other words, a curve is obtained by fixing all but one coordinate; the unfixed coordinate is varied as in a [[parametric curve]], and the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter (the varying coordinate) is the basis vector for that coordinate.

Note that the vectors are not necessarily of equal length. The useful functions known as scale factors of the coordinates are simply the lengths &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; of the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf e}_i&lt;/math&gt; (see table below). The scale factors are sometimes called Lamé coefficients, but this terminology is best avoided since some more well known coefficients in [[linear elasticity]] carry the same name.

The [[unit vector|normalized]] basis vectors are notated with a hat and obtained by dividing by the length:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf e}_i = \frac{{\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \frac{{\mathbf e}_i}{\left|{\mathbf e}_i\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

A [[vector field]] may be specified by its components with respect to the basis vectors or the normalized basis vectors, and one must be sure which case is meant. Components in the normalized basis are most common in applications for clarity of the quantities (for example, one may want to deal with tangential velocity instead of tangential velocity times a scale factor); in derivations the normalized basis is less common since it is more complicated.

===Contravariant basis===
The basis vectors shown above are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis vectors (because they "co-vary" with vectors). In the case of orthogonal coordinates, the contravariant basis vectors are easy to find since they will be in the same direction as the covariant vectors but [[reciprocal length]] (for this reason, the two sets of basis vectors are said to be reciprocal with respect to each other):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^i = \frac{\hat{\mathbf e}_i}{h_i} = \frac{\mathbf e_i}{h_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;

this follows from the fact that, by definition, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e^j = \delta^j_i&lt;/math&gt;, using the [[Kronecker delta]]. Note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf e}_i = \frac{\mathbf e_i}{h_i} = h_i \mathbf e^i = \hat{\mathbf e}^i&lt;/math&gt;

We now face three different basis sets commonly used to describe vectors in orthogonal coordinates: the covariant basis '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the contravariant basis '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the normalized basis '''ê'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;. While a vector is an ''objective quantity'', meaning its identity is independent of any coordinate system, the components of a vector depend on what basis the vector is represented in.

To avoid confusion, the components of the vector '''x''' with respect to the '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; basis are represented as '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, while the components with respect to the '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; basis are represented as '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = \sum_i x^i \mathbf e_i = \sum_i x_i \mathbf e^i&lt;/math&gt;

The position of the indices represent how the components are calculated (upper indices should not be confused with [[exponentiation]]). Note that the [[summation]] symbols Σ (capital [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]) and the summation range, indicating summation over all basis vectors (''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''d''), are often [[Einstein notation|omitted]]. The components are related simply by:

:&lt;math&gt;h_i^2 x^i = x_i&lt;/math&gt;

There is no distinguishing widespread notation in use for vector components with respect to the normalized basis; in this article we'll use subscripts for vector components and note that the components are calculated in the normalized basis.

==Vector algebra==
Vector addition and negation are done component-wise just as in Cartesian coordinates with no complication. Extra considerations may be necessary for other vector operations.

Note however, that all of these operations assume that two vectors in a [[vector field]] are bound to the same point (in other words, the tails of vectors coincide). Since basis vectors generally vary in orthogonal coordinates, if two vectors are added whose components are calculated at different points in space, the different basis vectors require consideration.

===Dot product===
The [[dot product]] in [[Cartesian coordinates]] ([[Euclidean space]] with an [[orthonormal]] basis set) is simply the sum of the products of components. In orthogonal coordinates, the dot product of two vectors '''x''' and '''y''' takes this familiar form when the components of the vectors are calculated in the normalized basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = \sum_i x_i \hat{\mathbf e}_i \cdot \sum_j y_j \hat{\mathbf e}_j = \sum_i x_i y_i&lt;/math&gt;

This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the normalized basis at some point can form a Cartesian coordinate system: the basis set is [[orthonormal]].

For components in the covariant or contravariant bases,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = \sum_i h_i^2 x^i y^i = \sum_i \frac{x_i y_i}{h_i^2} = \sum_i x^i y_i = \sum_i x_i y^i&lt;/math&gt;

This can be readily derived by writing out the vectors in component form, normalizing the basis vectors, and taking the dot product. For example, in 2D:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y &amp; =
\left(x^1 \mathbf e_1 + x^2 \mathbf e_2\right) \cdot \left(y_1 \mathbf e^1 + y_2 \mathbf e^2\right) \\[10pt]
&amp; = \left(x^1 h_1 \hat{ \mathbf e}_1 + x^2 h_2 \hat{ \mathbf e}_2\right) \cdot \left(y_1 \frac{\hat{ \mathbf e}^1}{h_1} + y_2 \frac{\hat{ \mathbf e}^2}{h_2}\right) = x^1 y_1 + x ^2 y_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the fact that the normalized covariant and contravariant bases are equal has been used.

===Cross product===
The [[cross product]] in 3D Cartesian coordinates is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \times \mathbf y =
(x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) \hat{ \mathbf e}_1 + (x_3 y_1 - x_1 y_3) \hat{ \mathbf e}_2 + (x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1) \hat{ \mathbf e}_3&lt;/math&gt;

The above formula then remains valid in orthogonal coordinates if the components are calculated in the normalized basis.

To construct the cross product in orthogonal coordinates with covariant or contravariant bases we again must simply normalize the basis vectors, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \times \mathbf y = \sum_i x^i \mathbf e_i \times \sum_j y^j \mathbf e_j =
\sum_i x^i h_i \hat{\mathbf e}_i \times \sum_j y^j h_j \hat{\mathbf e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

which, written expanded out,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \times \mathbf y =
(x^2 y^3 - x^3 y^2) \frac{h_2 h_3}{h_1} \mathbf e_1 + (x^3 y^1 - x^1 y^3) \frac{h_1 h_3}{h_2} \mathbf e_2 + (x^1 y^2 - x^2 y^1) \frac{h_1 h_2}{h_3} \mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt;

Terse notation for the cross product, which simplifies generalization to non-orthogonal coordinates and higher dimensions, is possible with the [[Levi-Civita tensor]], which will have components other than zeros and ones if the scale factors are not all equal to one.

==Vector calculus==

===Differentiation===

Looking at an infinitesimal displacement from some point, it's apparent that

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf r = \sum_i \frac{\partial \mathbf r}{\partial q^i} \, dq^i = \sum_i \mathbf e_i \, dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Gradient#Gradient and the derivative or differential|definition]], the gradient of a function must satisfy (this definition remains true if ''ƒ'' is any [[tensor]])

:&lt;math&gt;df = \nabla f \cdot d\mathbf r \quad \Rightarrow \quad df = \nabla f \cdot \sum_i \mathbf e_i \, dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

It follows then that [[del operator]] must be:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \sum_i \mathbf e^i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

and this happens to remain true in general curvilinear coordinates. Quantities like the [[gradient]] and [[Laplacian]] follow through proper application of this operator.

===Basis vector formulae===

is the [[Jacobian determinant]], which has the geometric interpretation of the deformation in volume from the infinitesimal cube d''x''d''y''d''z'' to the infinitesimal curved volume in the orthogonal coordinates.

===Integration===
Using the line element shown above, the [[line integral]] along a path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; of a vector '''F''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathcal P} \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf r =
\int_{\mathcal P} \sum_i F_i \mathbf e^i \cdot \sum_j \mathbf e_j \, dq^j = \sum_i \int_{\mathcal P} F_i \, dq^i
&lt;/math&gt;

An infinitesimal element of area for a surface described by holding one coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' constant is:

:&lt;math&gt;dA = \prod_{i \neq k} ds_i = \prod_{i \neq k} h_i \, dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the volume element is:

:&lt;math&gt;dV = \prod_i ds_i = \prod_i h_i \, dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

where the large symbol Π (capital [[Pi (letter)|Pi]]) indicates a [[product (mathematics)|product]] the same way that a large Σ indicates summation. Note that the product of all the scale factors is the [[Jacobian determinant]].

As an example, the [[surface integral]] of a vector function '''F''' over a ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''constant'' surface &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in 3D is:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathcal S} \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf A =
\int_{\mathcal S} \mathbf F \cdot \hat{\mathbf n} \ d A =
\int_{\mathcal S} \mathbf F \cdot \hat{\mathbf e}_1 \ d A =
\int_{\mathcal S} F^1 \frac{h_2 h_3}{h_1} \, dq^2 \, dq^3
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that '''F'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of '''F''' normal to the surface.

'''Paternity fraud''', also known as '''misattributed paternity'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2598159 | pmid=17664309 | doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 | volume=33 | title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity | date=August 2007 | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=475–80| last1 = Draper | first1 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''paternal discrepancy''',&lt;ref name = "tel1"/&gt; is when a man is incorrectly identified to be the biological [[father]] of a child. The underlying assumption of paternity fraud is that the mother deliberately misidentified the biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B|first=Jacobs, Melanie|date=2004|title=When Daddy Doesn't Want to Be Daddy Anymore: An Argument Against Paternity Fraud Claims|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol16/iss2/3/|journal=Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism|language=en|volume=16|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paternity fraud is related to the historical understanding of [[adultery]].

==Occurrence==
Research published in 2016 indicated that one in 50 British fathers is unknowingly raising a child who is the biological child of another man, and that misattributed paternity is rarer than commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/one-in-50-british-fathers-unknowingly-raise-another-mans-child/ One in 50 British fathers unknowingly raises another man's child] Published by The Telegraph, April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 scientific review of international published studies of paternal discrepancy found a range in incidence, around the world, from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as many of the studies were conducted between the 1950s and the 1980s, numbers may be unreliable due to the inaccuracies of genetic testing methods and procedures used at the time. Studies ranging in date from 1991 to 1999, quote the following incidence rates: 4.0% (Canada), 2.8% (France), 1.4% and 1.6% (UK), and 11.8% (Mexico), 0.8% (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"/&gt; These numbers suggest that the widely quoted and unsubstantiated figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate. However, in studies that solely looked at couples who obtained paternity testing because paternity was being disputed, there are higher levels; an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain cultural groups.&lt;ref name="Wintour"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection | location=United Kingdom | work=The Guardian | first=Patrick | last=Wintour | title=One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study in the [[United Kingdom]] found that biological fathers were misidentified in 0.2% (1 in 500) of the cases processed by the Child Support Agency. Of that 0.2%, those resolved with [[DNA paternity testing]] between 2004 and 2008 showed that between 10 and 19% of mothers had misidentified the biological father; data about why mothers identified the wrong biological father was not available.&lt;ref name="Wintour"/&gt;

===Australia===

The Victorian County Court in 2002 awarded Mr. Magill $70,000 compensation for damages and economic loss against his ex-wife as a result of DNA testing in 2000 that showed only one of three children he was paying support for were genetically his.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/09/1162661797800.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Paternity fraud 'dad' loses appeal | date=9 November 2006 | first=News | last=Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;
That ruling was later overturned in 2005 by the Victorian Court of Appeal finding that "intent to deceive" by the ex-wife had not been proven regarding misrepresentations made by Ms. Magill in birth forms about the children's paternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Appeal-blow-for-man-who-paid-maintenance-for-anothers-children/2005/03/17/1110913737586.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Appeal blow for man who paid maintenance for another's children | date=18 March 2005 | first=Peter | last=Gregory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ruling was in turn then appealed with the High Court of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Dad-loses-child-support-case/2006/10/31/1162056981681.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | location=Australia | title=Dad loses child support case | date=31 October 2006 |agency=Australian Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Australia's High Court struck down the appeal, upholding the 2005 Victorian Court of Appeal ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/51.html | work=Aust LII | location=AUS | title=Magill v Magill | date=9 November 2006 | first=High Court of | last=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chief Justice Murray Gleeson in the 94 page High Court Ruling opined, "Without doubt the appellant's wife deceived him but the hurtful deception was in her infidelity, not in her failure to admit it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/where-are-honesty-and-justice/story-e6frezz0-1111112502345 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Where are honesty and justice? | date=11 November 2006 | first=Larissa | last=Cummings }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Magill as part of the ruling was also ordered to pay the Child Support Agency's legal fees during the previous 18 months of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200611/s1784552.htm | work=ABC News | location=Australia | title=High Court rejects father's deceit claim | date=11 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 High Court Ruling led to many calls from within Australia for reforms and changes to the Family Law Act and the Child Support Act to help protect men in Mr Magill's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/dna-test-rights-proposed-for-duped-dads/story-e6frfkp9-1111112528746 | work=The Australian  | location=Australia | title=DNA test rights proposed for duped dads | date=16 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2008 putative fathers in Australia could begin using DNA testing to confirm paternity regarding support orders after new changes, "section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act", took effect regarding Family Court policies. The Magill case is often cited regarding new law reforms in Australia and is considered a landmark type case.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/parents-war-on-dna/story-e6freuy9-1111117999005 | work=The Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Paternity tests prove hundreds of men duped | date=11 November 2008 | first=Kelvin | last=Bissett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Mr. Cornelio began paying child support for his ex-wife's twins after the couple separated in 1998. The former couple settled upon a joint custody agreement in 2002 that continued Mr. Cornelio's monetary child support for the twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/man-who-didnt-father-twins-must-pay-child-support/article1146243/ | work=The Globe and Mail | location=Canada | title=Man who didn't father twins must pay child support | date=9 April 2009 | first=Kirk | last=Makin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly afterwards Ms. Cornelio requested a reduction in visitation time along with an increase in support payments. Mr. Cornelio became suspicious of the paternity of the twins. A subsequent DNA test revealed that he was not their biological father. A request was made by Mr. Cornelio to be excused from paying further child support, claiming to be the victim of misrepresentation or fraud when Ms. Cornelio failed to disclose the extramarital affair when he signed the 2002 joint custody agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/563571--man-must-pay-support-though-twins-not-his | work=The Toronto Star | location=Canada | title=Man must pay support though twins not his | date=8 January 2009 | first=Precious | last=Yutangco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2008 ruled against the request to be excused or reimbursed for child support payments. Judge van Rensburg, in deciding to deny the request, noted that Mr. Cornelio had wondered at the time of his separation if an affair by his ex-wife had actually been responsible for the twins. "It was not until access was interrupted and Ms. Cornelio commenced proceedings seeking increased child support that the respondent began pursuing this issue," the judge remarked. "The fact of that relationship – even if it has now become strained – is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children's material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii68884/2008canlii68884.html | work= | location=Ontario, Canada | title=Cornelio v. Cornelio, 2008 CanLII 68884 (ON SC) | date=22 December 2008 | first=Superior Court of Justice | last=Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

The default in Finnish law as of 2018 is that the husband is the acknowledged father of the child who is born into wedlock (or to a deceased husband). Only if the wife agrees, can that initial determination be set to something else. However, from 2016 the general right the mother to solely allow or prevent the parental investigation was abolished. The default and immediately forcing juridical assumption of paternity of a husband was not changed in the latest 2015 act.

A man can bring up a later legal action to annul his paternity, disregarding of the resistance of his wife. The legal action for annulment may be brought in the district court by a man whose paternity has been determined on the basis of either marriage or by some other authoratitive decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/319235-isyyslaki-mullistuu-tunnukseen-helpotus-sylkinaytekoe-ja-peruutusmahdollisuus Isyyslaki mullistuu: Tunnukseen helpotus, sylkinäytekoe ja peruutusmahdollisuus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A man who has officially acknowledged paternity relinquishes his rights to further actions if he, knowing the woman had a sexual intercourse with another man, or that she has used foreign sperm for fertilization, has stated in writing following birth of the child that the child is biologically his.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise legally binding prebirth acknowledgment of a man must be rejected, if either the health care staff of the child supervisor do have a founded suspicion that the man is not a father of the child, or he is for any reason not capable to understand what he is doing when acknowledging the paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If a mother deliberately gives false information to the authorities, which contributes to the erroneous establishment of paternity, she may be fined.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===

In 2004, a [[South Korea]]n man was awarded $42,380 compensation for [[pain and suffering]] when a [[DNA test]] established that his ex-wife's paternity claim regarding their child was misattributed. When Mr. Doe, who had married Ms. Doe based on her paternity claim, began a lawsuit against a hospital for switching his child at birth, Ms. Doe claimed to having been pregnant with another man's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-620927.html | work=CBS News | location=South Korea | title=Woman Ordered To Pay For Having Another Man's Baby | date=11 February 2009 | first=Brian | last=Bernbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
On 5 January 2015, the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] (decision 5A_619 of 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swissblawg.ch/2015/02/5a6192014-berechnung-der-einjahrigen.html |title=5A_619/2014: Berechnung der einjährigen Frist zur Anfechtung der Vaterschaftsanerkennung |trans-title=Calculation of the one-year period for contesting paternity recognition |first=Sabine |last=Herzog |work=swissblawg.ch |date=9 February 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decided on a case wherein a plaintiff challenged the paternity of his (alleged) daughter. The plaintiff had his sperm examined in November 2009. As a result of the examination, the plaintiff’s fertility was found to be 3%. The court contended that the alleged father should have started investigating his paternity as a consequence of that finding. The plaintiff actually had his non-paternity confirmed via DNA evidence in 2013 upon failure of his marriage. The court held that the one year time limit under [[Swiss civil code]] article 260c for filing an action lapsed due to the plaintiff’s (the alleged father’s) inactivity for more than two years. The [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] thus confirmed the ruling by the first instance and dismissed the appeal. It follows that the plaintiff’s financial obligations as to his (alleged) daughter will not change.

===United Kingdom===

In the [[United Kingdom]], paternity fraud, like adultery, is not a criminal offence&lt;ref name = "tel1"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/fatherhood/11839479/Should-we-be-doing-more-to-expose-paternity-fraud.html Should we be doing more to expose paternity fraud?] Published in The Telegraph, 4 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; except in the case of the lineage of the children of the British monarch under the [[Treason Act 1351]] where the adulterers are punishable as adultering against the lineage of the King with the King's "companion, ... or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir". Knowingly making a false statement on a public document is a criminal offence, including naming someone who is not the biological father. As of 2008, no individual has been prosecuted in a case involving paternity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection DNA testing: One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims] Published in [[The Guardian]], 1st August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A mother is permitted to not state the name of the biological father if she does not know it.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Draper |first=Heather |year=2005 |title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=475–480 |doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid=17664309 |pmc=2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paternity fraud is a form of [[Non-paternity event|misattributed paternity]].&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

The split in 2002 between a couple, identified for legal reasons as Mr. A and Ms. B, prompted Mr. A to pursue a parental contract to establish his non-married rights as their child's father.  Ms. B then requested a [[DNA test]] that later showed Mr. A was not the (then) five year old's father. Following the discovery Mr. A then sued Ms. B for damages of up to £100,000 as a result of the deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1547568/Lover-must-pay-broker-for-claiming-son-was-his.html | work=The Telegraph | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Lover must pay broker for claiming son was his | date=4 April 2007 | first=Amy | last=Iggulden }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007 in what was reported as the first known case of its kind to reach trial in Britain, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in favor of {{not a typo|Mr. A}} awarding £7,500 distress damages with another £14,943 for holidays and meals out Mr. A spent on Ms. B (not the child). The judgment fell short of listed suit amount because the London court did not allow damages for the child's material costs incurred because of Mr. A's enjoyment of the relationship. The judge, [[John Blofeld (judge)|Sir John Blofeld]], said he was satisfied that Mr. A's motivation in coming to court was not as a lever for contact with the child but because he did not want "to be taken for a ride".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/04/law.world | work=The Guardian | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Stockbroker wins £22,000 damages for paternity deceit | date=3 April 2007 | first=Karen  | last=McVeigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has historically imposed a strong presumption of marital paternity, and has also imposed barriers to paternity challenges once paternity has been legally established. In more recent years, especially since the advent of DNA testing, laws and guidelines have been proposed or enacted that may allow for a paternity challenge by a legal father who later determines he is not a child's biological father, or by a biological father who learns that somebody else has been named on a child's birth certificate as the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580398-1,00.html | work=Time Magazine | location=United States | title=Duped Dads Fight Back | date=19 January 2007 | first=Julie | last=Rawe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Dec-08-Mon-2003/news/22741969.html | work=Review-Journal | location=Las Vegas, Nevada | title=Movement targets `paternity fraud' | date=8 December 2003 | first=Richard | last=Lake }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In the case of ''County of Los Angeles v. Navarro'', in 1996, the County of Los Angeles entered a default judgment against putative father Mr. Navarro and ordered him to pay monthly support for Ms. Doe's two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16132321968914865606 | work=scholar.google | location=California, United States | title=County of Los Angeles v. Navarro | date=30 June 2004 | first=Court of | last=Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complaint to establish paternity filed by the Bureau of Family Support Operations was based on information provided by Ms. Doe naming "Manuel Nava" as the children's father. The agency determined that Mr. Navarro was the father in question and delivered notice to his sister's residence listing Mr. Navarro as "co-resident", a notice Mr. Navarro denied ever receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,125579,00.html | work=Fox News | location=United States | title=Paternity: Innocence Is Now a Defense | date=14 July 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Mr. Navarro, armed with a DNA test showing he was not the children's father, sued the County of Los Angeles asking to be relieved from the support order.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The County of Los Angeles opposed the motion, arguing the motion was filed after the six month limit to contest a default judgment and the mother’s mere assertion that he was the father was insufficient to establish extrinsic fraud. The trial court sided with the County and denied the motion. This ruling was then appealed before the California 2nd Appellate Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5156427484382718804 | work=Case Law [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/b155166.pdf County of L.A. v.

Navarro, Cal: Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate Dist., 8th Div. 2004 | date=30 June 2004 | first=California | last=Court of Appeal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the court of appeal reversed the trial court decision ruling in favor of Mr. Navarro and became the first published California case to hold that the [[statute of limitations]] did not apply in setting aside an old default judgment against a paternity fraud victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/aug/18/20040818-111309-3555r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Court asked to ‘depublish’ child-support ruling | date=18 August 2004 | first=Staff | last=Writer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/California+agency+will+seek+to+depublish+paternity+ruling.-a0125336142 | work=American Association for Justice | location=Trial Magazine | title=California agency will seek to depublish paternity ruling | date=1 November 2004 | first=Sileo | last=Carmel }}&lt;/ref&gt; That request was later denied by the [[California Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r | work=The Washington Times | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
In the case of ''Parker v. Parker'', as part of their 2001 Florida divorce settlement Mr. Parker was obliged to pay $1200 monthly child support based on Ms. Parker's representations to the court that Mr. Parker was the child's biological father. In 2003 Ms. Parker filed a motion for contempt and a petition to enforce child support against Mr. Parker which prompted a DNA test showing that Mr. Parker was not the child's biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15319835621860114145&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 | work=scholar.google | location=Florida, United States | title=Parker v.

The motion was 16 months after their divorce, Florida law (at that time) only allowed the husband 12 months to contest paternity following divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/02/State/Court_backs_deadline_.shtml | work=Tampa Bay Times | location=Florida, United States | title=Court backs deadline for challenging paternity | date=2 February 2007 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Parker's court ordered payments would total about $216,000 over the next fifteen years.

Mr. Parker filed a petition for relief claiming that the misrepresentation of paternity had resulted in a fraudulent support order. This was dismissed by both the Trial and then, in 2005, the Court of Appeal as being intrinsic fraud and subject to the Florida one year time limit to contest a dissolution decree, not extrinsic fraud, or a fraud upon the court, that can form the basis for relief from judgment more than a year later. This ruling was then appealed before the Florida Supreme Court who, in 2007, denied Mr. Parker's suit upholding the Fourth District Court of Appeal 2005 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/index.shtml | work=2007 Florida Supreme Court Decisions | location=[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/sc05-2346.pdf Court Opinion] | title=SC05-2346 Parker v. Parker | date=1 February 2007 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, the Florida statutes changed allowing a DNA test to be considered new evidence to contest a support order after the one year time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2012/0742.18 | work=2012 Florida Statutes | location=Florida, United States | title=Florida Statutes, Title 43, Ch.742, Sec.18 | date=20 June 2006 | first=Florida | last=Senate }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In its published opinion the Supreme Court Ruling in 2007 noted the change in Florida Statutes, "which provides the circumstances and procedures under which a male may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation," however the court decided not to consider the applicability of this new statute to Mr. Parker's circumstances, kicking the question of a retrial under the new law back to the Trial Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0209/p01s01-usju.htm | work=Christian Science Monitor | location=Florida, United States | title=Dad wasn't dad after all, but still owes child support | date=9 February 2007 | first=Warren | last=Richey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the basic facts are little questioned and the case explores differences between [[Extrinsic fraud|extrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic fraud|intrinsic]] fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12677538385052883680&amp;q | work=scholar.google | location=Iowa S.C., United States | title=Dier v.

Hodge | date=1 October 2012 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Tennessee }}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited ''Parker v. Parker'' when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases.

====Iowa====
In 2012 the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] in ruling to allow a paternity fraud tort to proceed as they fall "within the traditional boundaries of fraud law", but advised caution in bringing cases, as they would be "hard to prove, emotional and embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thonline.com/news/iowa-illinois-wisconsin/article_d7e7f75a-97c0-5a35-9a38-ad1f698b74cc.html | work=Telegraph Herald | location=Dubuque, Iowa | title=Iowa court allows paternity-fraud lawsuit | date=2 June 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Mexico====

In the case of ''Barreras v. Trevino'', Mr. Barreras and Ms. Trevino divorced in 1999 with Ms. Trevino shortly afterwards gaining a support order for her supposed daughter with Mr. Barreras named as the putative father. In 2004 a New Mexico court ruled that the child Mr. Barreras had (up until then) paid $20,000 support to Ms. Trevino for did not actually exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2a2451e124 | work=KOB-TV Eyewitness News | location=New Mexico, USA | title=Where's the Baby? | date=6 December 2004 | first=Mark | last=Horner }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Barreras sued a DNA testing laboratory in 2006 for falsifying two separate DNA tests for the supposed child by using samples taken from his adult daughter who, along with one of the lab employees, also face fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://kob.com/article/stories/S190773.shtml | work=NBC News | location=United States | title=Child support fraud case lands in 2 courtrooms | date=10 September 2007 | first=Jeremy | last=Jojola }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ms. Trevino pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of fraud and perjury, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. Trevino served 16 months in federal prison in Arizona for claiming the non-existent girl on tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.clipsyndicate.com/publish/video/658732/trevino_pleads_guilty_to_fraud_perjury | work=Clips Syndicate | location=NBC News, USA | title=Trevino pleads guilty to fraud, perjury | date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the paternity fraud Ms. Trevino was able to obtain a [[birth certificate]], [[Medicare (United States)|medicare card]] and [[Social Security (United States)|social security card]] for the fictitious girl prompting (then) [[Bill Richardson|Gov. Bill Richardson]] to direct New Mexico Department of Human Services to explain how several government agencies became not only unwitting partners in the fraud, but also resisted efforts to correct it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,141525,00.html | work=Fox News | location=New Mexico, United States | title=Agency Culpable in Child Support Scam | date=17 December 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Letters and calls from Mr. Barreras to the New Mexico child support agency about his vasectomy in 1998 were ignored and when the child support enforcement division's order to bring the supposed child in for more paternity tests were not complied with by Ms. Trevino the agency simply closed the case without further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/272130metro12-12-04.htm | work=ABQ Journal | location=Albuquerque, New Mexico | title=Ex-husband Paid $20,000 To Support Nonexistent Daughter | date=12 December 2004 | first=Carolyn | last=Carlson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tennessee====

In the case of ''Hodge v. Craig'' in October 2012, intentional misrepresentation of paternity was recognized by a unanimous Tennessee Supreme Court in ''Hodge v. Craig'', a case where the mother intentionally lied to a man about who the father of the child was. Based on the mother's assurances the couple married but later divorced. The plaintiff dutifully paid child support including medical insurance for the child. Based on physical differences between himself and the child he obtained a tissue sample and confirmed his suspicions. Damages were awarded in compensation for child support paid for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Justia101612&gt;{{cite news|title=When Your Daddy Is Not Really Your Daddy: A Man Successfully Sues His Ex-Wife for Paternity Fraud Damages|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/16/when-your-daddy-is-not-really-your-daddy|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Justia.Com|date=16 October 2012|author=Joanna L. Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision was based on the [[common law]] remedy of [[fraud|intentional misrepresentation]]; the court distinguished the award of damages from a retroactive modification of [[child support]]. The action was for damages; it was not a suit to disestablish paternity.&lt;ref name=TN100112&gt;{{cite web|title=Tina Marie Hodge v.

==Criticism==
The topic of paternity fraud is controversial. In the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', Heather Draper writes, "claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lyn Turner says that the concept of paternity fraud is about the "demonization of mothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Lyn|date=2011-12-01|title=The Denial of Paternity: Pregnancy as a Risk to the ‘Pure Relationship’|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038511416151|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1110–1125|doi=10.1177/0038038511416151|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|right|300px|thumb|RYB color star]]
Within the '''philosophy of color''', there is a dispute between '''color realism''', the view that colors are [[physical properties]] that objects possess, and '''color fictionalism''', a species of [[error theory]] viewing colors according to which there are no such physical properties that objects possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/colour/concrete_dirigible/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gatzia-Colour-Fictionalism-2010.pdf|title=Colour Fictionalism – SFU|author=|date=|website=sfu.ca|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of color==
One of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color. The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/color/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Barry|last=Maund|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as unreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed "relationalism", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen.

Another type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types.

A reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum.

Both relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist.

Primitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory.

==Color discourse==
If color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? ''Prescriptive color fictionalism'' would say no.  In ''prescriptive color fictionalism'',  while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist.

Color vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like [[Leo Hurvich]] that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features.

David Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as "quality realism".

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of University of Texas have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin.

Michael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of "normal" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called ''True Blue''.

Paul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks.

Many philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism (a.k.a. irrealism).

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, ''Color Ontology and Color Science''.

'''Pratigha''' (Sanskrit; Pali: paṭigha; Tibetan Wylie: ''khong khro'') is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "anger". It is defined as a hostile attitude towards sentient beings, towards frustration, and towards that which gives rise to one's frustrations; it functions as a basis for faultfinding, for negative actions, and for not finding a moment of peace or happiness.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 728-729.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
''Pratigha'' is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Six root unwholesome factors|six root unwholesome mental factors]] within the Mahayana [[Abhidharma]] tradition
* One of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] in the Theravada tradition (according to the [[Dhammasangani]])

==Definitions==

===Theravada===
Patigha (Pali) is defined by Theravada sources as: anger, repulsion, collision;&lt;ref name=bd1&gt;[http://dictionary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/4049/patigha A.P. Buddhadatta Mahathera, Concise Pali-English and English-Pali Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; animosity; irritation; indignation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistteachings.org/buddhadhamma-translations-2/publications/awakened-beings?doing_wp_cron Venerable Ajahn Payutto (Phra Payutto), Awakened Beings, section "Eight Noble Beings"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyanatiloka Mahatheran provides the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/4049/patigha, Buddhist Door, Buddhist Dictionary, entry for "paṭigha"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# In an ethical sense, it means: 'repugnance', grudge, resentment, anger, and is a synonym of byāpāda, 'ill-will' (s. nīvaraṇa) and dosa, 'hate' (s. mūla). It is one of the proclivities (anusaya, q.v.).
# '(Sense-) reaction'. Applied to five-sense cognition, p. occurs in the following contexts:
::(a) as paṭigha-saññā, 'perception of sense-reaction', said to be absent in the immaterial absorptions (s. jhāna 5). Alternative renderings: resistance-perception, reflex-perception;
::(b) as paṭigha-samphassa, '(mental) impression caused by 5fold sensorial reaction' (D. 15); s. phassa;
::(c) as Sappaṭigha-rūpa, 'reacting corporeality', and appaṭigha, 'not reacting', which is an Abhidhammic classification of corporeality, occurring in Dhs. 659, 1050. Sappaṭigha are called the physical sense-organs as reacting (or responding) to sense stimuli; and also the physical sense-objects as impinging (or making an impact) on the sense-organs. All other corporeality is appaṭigha, non-reacting and non-impinging. These 2 terms have been variously rendered as resistant and not, responding and not, with and without impact.

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 
:What is pratigha? It is ill-will with regard to living beings, with regard to suffering and with regard to things pertaining to suffering. Its function is to produce a basis for unhappy states and bad conduct.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula (2007), Kindle Locations 757-759.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] states that ''pratigha'' is aimed at "another limited being, one's own suffering, or situations entailing suffering". This involves being impatient with the objects of the ''pratigha'' (''anger''), and wishing to get rid of them, for example, by striking out against them and harming them. It is based on regarding the object as unattractive or repulsive by its very nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xanger Berzin Archives glossary entry for "anger"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Berzin identifies ''[[dvesha]]'' (aversion) as a subcategory of ''pratigha'' (anger) that is directed primarily, although not exclusively, at limited beings.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rescorla–Wagner model''' ("'''R-W'''") is a model of [[classical conditioning]], in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Rescorla2.htm|title=The Rescorla-Wagner Model of Classical Conditioning|last=Abbott|first=Bruce|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong CS-US association means, essentially, that the CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the [[blocking effect]]. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazy|first=Thomas E.|last2=Frank|first2=Michael J.|last3=O’Reilly|first3=Randall C.|date=2010-04-01|title=Neural Mechanisms Supporting Acquired Phasic Dopamine Responses in Learning: An Integrative Synthesis|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=34|issue=5|pages=701–720|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.11.019|issn=0149-7634|pmc=2839018|pmid=19944716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rescorla–Wagner model was created by [[Robert A. Rescorla]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Allan R. Wagner]] of [[Yale University]] in 1972.

==Basic assumptions of the model==
#The change in the association between a CS and a US that occurs when the two are paired depends on how strongly the US is predicted on that trial - that is, informally, how "surprised" the organism is by the US. The amount of this "surprise" depends on the summed associative strength of all cues present during that trial. In contrast, previous models derived the change in associative strength from the current value of the CS alone.
#The associative strength of a CS is represented by a single number. The association is excitatory if the number is positive, inhibitory if it is negative. 
#The associative strength of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is expressed directly by the behavior it elicits/inhibits. 
#The [[Incentive salience|salience]] of a CS (alpha in the equation) and the strength of the US (beta) are constants and do not change during training.
#Only the current associative strength of a cue determines its effect on behavior and the amount of learning it supports. It does not matter how that strength value was arrived at, whether by simple conditioning, reconditioning, or otherwise.
 
The first two assumptions were new in the Rescorla–Wagner model. The last three assumptions were present in previous models and are less crucial to the R-W model's novel predictions.

==Equation==
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V^{n+1}_X = \alpha_X \beta (\lambda - V_{tot})&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;V^{n+1}_X = V^n_X + \Delta V^{n+1}_X&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the strength, on a single trial, of the association between the CS labelled "X" and the US
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the salience of X (bounded by 0 and 1)
* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the rate parameter for the US (bounded by 0 and 1), sometimes called its [[association value]]
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum conditioning possible for the US
* &lt;math&gt;V_X&lt;/math&gt; is the current associative strength of X
* &lt;math&gt;V_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the total associative strength of all stimuli present, that is, X plus any others
&lt;ref name="Assessment of model" /&gt;

==The revised RW model by Van Hamme and Wasserman (1994)==
Van Hamme and Wasserman have extended the original Rescorla–Wagner (RW) model and introduced a new factor in their revised RW model in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Hamme, L.J. |author2=Wasserman, E.A. |year=1994 |title=Cue competition in causality judgements: The role of nonpresentation of compound stimulus elements |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=25 |pages=127–151 |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/causality/VanHammeWasserman04.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065145/http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/causality/VanHammeWasserman04.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that not only conditioned stimuli physically present on a given trial can undergo changes in their associative strength, the associative value of a CS can also be altered by a within-compound-association with a CS present on that trial. A within-compound-association is established if two CSs are presented together during training (compound stimulus). If one of the two component CSs is subsequently presented alone, then it is assumed to activate a representation of the other (previously paired) CS as well. Van Hamme and Wasserman propose that stimuli indirectly activated through within-compound-associations have a negative learning parameter—thus phenomena of retrospective reevaluation can be explained.

Consider the following example, an experimental paradigm called "backward blocking," indicative of retrospective revaluation, where AB is the compound stimulus A+B:
* Phase 1: AB–US 
* Phase 2: A–US

Test trials: Group 1, which received both Phase 1- and 2-trials, elicits a weaker conditioned response (CR) to B compared to the Control group, which only received Phase 1-trials.

The original RW model cannot account for this effect. But the revised model can: In Phase 2, stimulus B is indirectly activated through within-compound-association with A. But instead of a positive learning parameter (usually called alpha) when physically present, during Phase 2, B has a negative learning parameter. Thus during the second phase, B's associative strength declines whereas A's value increases because of its positive learning parameter.

Thus, the revised RW model can explain why the CR elicited by B after backward blocking training is weaker compared with AB-only conditioning.

==Some failures of the RW model==
;Spontaneous recovery from extinction and recovery from extinction caused by reminder treatments (reinstatement)
:It is a well-established observation that a time-out interval after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction, i.e., the previously extinguished reaction or response recurs—but usually at a lower level than before extinction training. Reinstatement refers to the phenomenon that exposure to the US from training alone after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction. The RW model can't account for those phenomena.

;Extinction of a previously conditioned inhibitor
:The RW model predicts that repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone (a CS with negative associative strength) results in extinction of this stimulus (a decline of its negative associative value). This is a false prediction. Contrarily, experiments show the repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone even increases its inhibitory potential

;Facilitated [[reacquisition]] after extinction
:One of the assumptions of the model is that the history of conditioning of a CS does not have any influences on its present status—only its current associative value is important. Contrary to this assumption, many experiments{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} show that stimuli that were first conditioned and then extinguished are more easily reconditioned (i.e., fewer trials are necessary for conditioning).

;The exclusiveness of excitation and inhibition
:The RW model also assumes that [[wikt:excite|excitation]] and [[:wikt:inhibition|inhibition]] are opponent features. A stimulus can either have excitatory potential (a positive associative strength) or inhibitory potential (a negative associative strength), but not both. By contrast it is sometimes observed, that stimuli can have both qualities. One example is [[backward conditioning|backward excitatory conditioning]] in which a CS is backwardly paired with a US (US–CS instead of CS–US). This usually makes the CS become a conditioned excitor. The stimulus also has inhibitory features which can be proven by the retardation of acquisition test. This test is used to assess the inhibitory potential of a stimulus since it is observed that excitatory conditioning with a previously conditioned inhibitor is retarded. The backwardly conditioned stimulus passes this test and thus seems to have both excitatory and inhibitory features.

;Pairing a novel stimulus with a conditioned inhibitor
:A conditioned inhibitor is assumed to have a negative associative value. By presenting an inhibitor with a novel stimulus (i.e., its associative strength is zero), the model predicts that the novel cue should become a conditioned excitor. This is not the case in experimental situations. The predictions of the model stem from its basic term (lambda-V). Since the summed associative strength of all stimuli (V) present on the trial is negative (zero + inhibitory potential) and lambda is zero (no US present), the resulting change in the associative strength is positive, thus making the novel cue a conditioned excitor.

;CS-preexposure effect
:The CS-[[preexposure]] effect (also called [[latent inhibition]]) is the well-established observation that conditioning after exposure to the stimulus later used as the CS in conditioning is retarded. The RW model doesn't predict any effect of presenting a novel stimulus without a US.

;Higher-order conditioning
:In [[higher-order conditioning]] a previously conditioned CS is paired with a novel cue (i.e., first CS1–US then CS2–CS1). This usually makes the novel cue CS2 elicit similar reactions to the CS1. The model cannot account for this phenomenon since during CS2–CS1 trials, no US is present. But by allowing CS1 to act similarly to a US, one can reconcile the model with this effect.

;Sensory preconditioning
:[[Sensory preconditioning]] refers to first pairing two novel cues (CS1–CS2) and then pairing one of them with a US (CS2–US). This turns both CS1 and CS2 into conditioned excitors. The RW model cannot explain this, since during the CS1–CS2-phase both stimuli have an associative value of zero and lambda is also zero (no US present) which results in no change in the associative strength of the stimuli.

'''Risk and actuarial criminology''', unlike many other [[Criminology|theories of crime]], does not focus on the causality of crime. It believes the [[social]] world is too complex and interlocking to understand what causes a [[behaviour]] or [[Social actions|action]]. This theory seeks to understand the emerging forms of [[social control]] that may lead to [[crime]], and concentrates on assessing risk.
Major aspects of this theory are the norms and rules of a society that propel behaviour and private sectors getting involved in citizens lives. This theory does not revolve around issues of justice, the criminal code, or laws, it focuses on questions of how to minimize risk of entrenchments on private security for the general population. Power is a key concept within risk and actuarial [[criminology]]. Power is the highest most emergent form of social control, which contains many interlocking sets of networks such as schools, licensing agencies, organizations etc. This theory looks at the effect of these powers on risk, and the risk to our personal private [[security]].
Risk criminology studies changes such as the rise in private security. Risk criminology sees this change as the social institutions taking more and more interest in the private sector, as well as the public domain such as the government becoming less involved, leaving room for [[self-governance]]. This means that because of these changes in social control, individuals behaviour is understood and analyzed with actuary science, because agencies and organizations are taking an interest in the personal security and risk of their clients. 
Another change that risk assesses, is the blurring of the line between private and public policing. In recent times, private policing outnumbers public policing, which confuses and fragments policing, which explains some patterns of behaviour in our day.&lt;ref name="O'Grady"&gt;O’Grady, W. (2011). Classical Sociological Explanations of Crime. In Crime in Canadian Context. Canada: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corrections ==
Since risk and actuarial criminology does not focus on the causality of crime, which so many theories focus on, it suggests a different perspective and application to corrections. This theory suggests that we stop reacting and dealing with the aftermath of criminals, but look at pre-meditating factors such as why some groups have become dangerous? and what part of these societies do these groups threaten?
It tells us that we need to better prepare the society to understand the risk that offender's hold.&lt;ref name="O'Grady" /&gt;

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Staff was founded&lt;ref&gt;Заявление о создании штаба по защите русских школ. Published in: "Ракурс" No. 1/2003 The text of the founding statement is available [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/party/istorija/18988-/ online {{ru icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being [[ForHRUL]], and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the [[Freedom House]] and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=473c550523 Freedom in the World 2005.

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''SEXINT''' is the practice of monitoring and/or indexing the pornographic preferences of internet users in an effort to later use the information for [[blackmail]]. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of ''sex''ual ''int''elligence retrieved on an [[intelligence service]] target and was first used by [[Jennifer Granick]], Director of Civil Liberties at the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/11/nsa-sexint-abuse-you%E2%80%99ve-all-been-waiting|title=NSA SEXINT is the Abuse You’ve All Been Waiting For|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=November 29, 2013|work=Center for Internet and Society|access-date=May 7, 2014|publisher=Stanford Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/3918/nsa-sexint-abuse-youve-waiting/|title=NSA SEXINT is the Abuse You’ve All Been Waiting For|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=November 29, 2013|work=Just Security|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Uses ==

The term was first used specifically in reference to the practice by [[Five Eyes]] member, the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States of America. It is unclear how often these programs and methods are used in comparison to other Five Eyes initiatives such as [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)]], [[MUSCULAR]], and [[XKEYSCORE]].

The extent to which SEXINT itself is used is unknown. Targets who have come forward are few and far between. While first-hand accounts are rare it is confirmed that 6 people, all followers of [[Islam|Muslim]]s not involved in any terror plots, were demonstrated as potential targets of this method for their influence on the popular video hosting site [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and other social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128.html|title=Top-Secret Document Reveals NSA Spied On Porn Habits As Part Of Plan To Discredit ‘Radicalizers’|last=Greenwald|first=Glen|date=November 26, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 7, 2014|last2=Grim|first2=Ryan|last3=Gallagher|first3=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related abuses ==

The National Security Agency has been able to keep most specific instances of abuse of intel such as SEXINT under [[secret]]. A few reports have slipped through, including an employee able to use the related tactic of gathering [[LOVEINT]] to search for his ex-girlfriend on his first day of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/loveint-on-his-first-day-of-work-nsa-employee-spied-on-ex-girlfriend/|title=LOVEINT: On his first day of work, NSA employee spied on ex-girlfriend|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=September 27, 2013|work=Ars Technica|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much controversy over whether or not agencies such as the National Security Agency have been spying on American citizens. In early May 2014 [[Edward Snowden]] stated that American citizens are watched more closely than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/58451/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-americans|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|last=Volz|first=Dustin|date=April 30, 2014|work=National Journal|access-date=May 7, 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shih Ming-teh''' ({{zh|c=施明德}}; born 15 January 1941) commonly known as '''Chairman Shih''', is a political activist in [[Taiwan]] and was once a [[political prisoner]] for 25-and-a-half years.

He was arrested at the age of 21 in 1962 and charged with creating the "Taiwan Independence League" (a study group) with the intention of overthrowing the [[Kuomintang]] government, Shih was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].  The sentence was commuted to 15 years in 1975, and Shih was released on 16 June 1977.

He promptly joined the [[Tangwai]] (literally meaning "outside the party", because the Kuomintang was the only legally existing political party in Taiwan at that time), became a reporter for the ''[[Liberty Times]]'' and married the American researcher [[Linda Arrigo|Linda Gail Arrigo]]. After playing a part in organizing the 10 December 1979 pro-democracy rally subsequently known as the [[Kaohsiung Incident]], (also known as the Formosa Incident or Meilitao Incident), an arrest warrant was issued charging Shih with treason, and following 26 days on the run he was again arrested and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, while he was incarcerated, Polish politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Lech Wałęsa]] nominated him for Peace Prize.

In July 1987, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] lifted [[martial law]] and offered an amnesty to Shih, but he refused to accept. On 20 May 1990 he was finally released. In total, he spent 25 years in prison, 13 years in [[solitary confinement]] and over 4 years on hunger strike.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 1994, he was elected leader of the legalized opposition Democratic Progressive Party. He was also elected legislator in three occasions. Shih's proposal of a political "[[Grand Reconciliation]]" in Taiwan earned him strong rejection from within the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], to which he resigned on 14 November 2000.

In 2006, Shih carried out a massive protest, known as [[Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go]], in an effort to force the embattled president [[Chen Shui-bian]] to resign. He led an around the clock sit-in in front of the Presidential Building and [[Taipei Railway Station]] in Taipei City, pledging to remain there until such time as President Chen resigned, or the reached the end of his term in March 2008. On 5 December 2006, he left Taipei Railway Station pledging to continue the protest alone in "self-reclusion" at an apartment nearby. As of April 2007, this protest has ended.

Shih was one of the most prominent personalities of the Tangwai movement and greatly contributed to Taiwan's democratization{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He had been referred to by some as "Taiwan's [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]]"{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Shih Ming-te's father Shih Kuo-tsui was a well-known practitioner of [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In February 1947, Shih Ming-te witnessed at [[Kaohsiung Station]] that would later be known as the [[February 28 Incident]]. The student leaders of schools were charged as instigators and some were executed as riots broke out. Students seized weapons from Harbor Garrison and exchanged fires with the guards.

He entered Kaohsiung's Chung-Cheng Senior High in 1957. In 1959, after failing to pass his college entrance exam, he signed up with the ROC Army, passing the admission exams for the artillery school. On occasion he vowed in public to overthrow the ROC government by force, through an armed coup d'état as an army officer. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. That same year, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter when he was 19.&lt;ref name="〈從軍造反記〉"&gt;[http://www.nori.org.tw/read/youth.html 〈從軍造反記〉] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724124423/http://www.nori.org.tw/read/youth.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}，奉獻者•施明德 傳記 新台灣研究文教基金會&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly served as an artillery officer in [[Kinmen]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

=== First imprisonment: 1962–1977 ===
In 1962 Shih was arrested for alleged involvement in the "[[Formosa Independence Movement]]"; over 30 more accomplices, mostly army school and university students, were also arrested. Shih's two brothers, poet and painter [[Shih Ming-cheng]] and medical school student [[Shih Ming-hsiung]] were among them.

In 1964 Shih was sentenced to life imprisonment for orchestrating the independence movement. He was also stripped of his civil rights for life. Shih was roughened up and suffered the loss of his teeth and spinal damage at the age of 22{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

The [[Kuomintang]] regime considered outspoken Shih as a highly dangerous political criminal and therefore prevented him from doing any forced labor that would put him in contact with the world outside prison{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. This gave him time to do research and study{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Shih focused on philosophy, history, international law, linguistics and Japanese{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In the 1970s, Taiwan's government suffered several blows to its international status. First, its seat at the United Nations was taken over by the People's Republic of China, then the United States established official ties with Beijing, severing those with Taipei. A rebellion in the Taiyuan prison, where many of the inmates were political prisoners, was planned{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Access to the Taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast declaration of Taiwan's independence from China was one of their goals{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Many pro-independence prisoners took part in the plot{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. On 8 February 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun. Ultimately the five inmates broke from prison, only to be caught soon after. The breakout plot was foiled. The Kuomintang believed Shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising and therefore kept him in isolation during his time in Taiyuan{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. To this date, the investigation documents are still kept confidential and the implication of Shih is disputed by Shih himself, who sued Lin Shu-chi for defamation{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In 1974, after 12 years of imprisonment, Shih's first wife Chen Li-chu asked for divorce. She had had an affair with one of Shih's friends, who was released before Shih. In 1975, when president [[Chiang Kai-shek]] died, his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded as KMT Chairman. Under his rule, a leniency policy was implemented. On 16 June 1977, Shih was released after serving only 15 years of a life sentence.

=== Leader of the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] ===
During [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]'s presidency, political opposition to the [[Kuomintang]] was suppressed. After [[Peter Huang]]'s attempt to assassinate Chiang proved unsuccessful, the KMT became more aware of opposition. Shih Ming-teh created a "party without a name" amidst the absence of freedom of association in Taiwan at that time. In September 1978 Shih became active in the [[tangwai movement]]. In May 1979 this group of non-Kuomintang activists established the ''[[Formosa Magazine|Meilitao Magazine]]''; Shih was named general manager. During this time, he adopted the English nickname "Nori", after the [[Kun'yomi|Japanese pronunciation]] of the second [[Chinese character]] in his given name, "Teh". For historical reasons, this nickname served as a [[shibboleth]] to enrage ''[[Waishengren]]'' people in Taiwan (mainlanders whose ancestors fought the Japanese), and endear him to the ''benshengren'' (less-recent Hokkien migrants disenfranchised by the Waishengren, and who have a more positive view of Japanese colonization).&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Richard C. (2000) ''Chen Shui-Bian: Building A Community And A Nation''. Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Foundation. p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chee, Soon Juan (1998). ''To Be Free: To be Free: Stories from Asia's Struggle Against Oppression''. Monash Asia Institute. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1979, the Tangwai group commemorated the [[Human Rights Day]] in Kaohsiung. The rally operated without prior approval, with specific stipulations that no torches and weapons were allowed. Police intervened and clashed with the protestors resulting in various damages. The event would be known as the [[Kaohsiung Incident|Meilitao Incident]], a milestone in Taiwan's democratization process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1979.htm 〈The "Kaohsiung Incident" of 1979〉]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, Shih dramatically escaped: [[Chang Wen-ing]], then a dentist and later Mayor of [[Taichung City]], performed plastic surgery on Shih to change his looks so he could escape overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Joyce|title=Newsmakers: Taichung Major Chang goes it alone|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/10/15/0000107194/1|accessdate=23 April 2017|date=15 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih was later caught along with the dentist, and sentenced to life in prison for the second time.

During the 1980 Meilitao Incident trials Shih was defiant and proud facing a potentially fatal court-martial decision{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He declared during his defense: "Taiwan should be independent, in fact, it already is, it has been for 30 years and currently it is known as the Republic of China"{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Shih also demanded an end to the political monopoly of the Kuomintang, the control of the Taiwanese press, and martial law, so that the 30-plus-year rubber-stamping legislative session could be dissolved{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

=== Second imprisonment and hunger strike: 1980–1990 ===
In 1983, one of {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Shih's allies, Professor [[Chen Wen-chen]] ,was murdered;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twhistory.org.tw/20010702.htm 〈Truth, finding the perpetrator, and recollection: The 20th anniversary of the Chen Wen-chen incident&gt; ] 台灣歷史學會&lt;/ref&gt; Shih Ming-te began a 1-month hunger strike to protest what he believed to be an assassination ordered by the secret police{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

[[Communist Poland|Polish]] union leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] (Nobel Peace 1983) nominated Shih Ming-teh for the 1984 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In 1985, Shih commenced an indefinite [[hunger strike]]. He demanded an end to [[martial law]] and state-sponsored political murders{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}, implementation of a democratic system and release of all Meilitao Incident political prisoners. Shih was sent to the Tri-Service General Hospital and underwent [[force-feeding]] through a [[nasogastric tube]] during his four and half years of protest.

On 15 July 1987, the 38-year-long order of martial law was declared over by the KMT government, when President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] announced nationwide sentence reductions and conditional releases. Shih declined the offer{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. In 1988, Shih went on another hunger strike protest with his brother Shih Ming-cheng. His brother died on 23 August 1988;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prison report Editorial: Let Shih Ming-teh go!|journal=Taiwan Communiqué|date=September 1988|issue=36|page=19|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/twcom/tc36-int.pdf|issn=1027-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih survived.

=== Release ===
On 20 May 1990, the new president [[Lee Teng-hui]] officially assumed the presidency and ordered a special amnesty for all Meilitao Incident prisoners. Shih ripped up his amnesty document and demanded an unconditional release{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. When President Lee announced the invalidation of the Meilitao Trials, Shih Ming-te finally accepted his release as an innocent person{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Upon recovering his freedom, he joined the now legal [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which originated in the Tangwai movement.

=== Political career ===
In 1992, Shih was elected [[legislator]] for the Tainan County constituency in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. [[Republic of China legislative election, 1992|This election]] was the first free direct legislative elections in Taiwan history.

Between 1994 and 1996 Shih was elected Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party.&lt;ref name="dpp_president"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpp.org.tw/history/pub/LIT_4.asp?ctyp=LITERATURE&amp;catid=1816 |title=民主進步黨歷任黨主席 |accessdate=December 25, 2006 |author=民主進步黨 |date=2002 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015003717/http://www.dpp.org.tw/history/pub/LIT_4.asp?ctyp=LITERATURE&amp;catid=1816 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, he claimed that "Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign nation, when the Democratic Progressive Party is in power, there is no need and it will not announce Taiwan's independence". At the same time Shih proposed a political and social Grand Reconciliation. Elected legislator for a new term in 1996, he ran for the presidency of the Legislative Yuan, gaining a vote from former archrival [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] but losing one from Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Chin-cheng. [[Liu Sung-pan]] was elected the [[President of the Legislative Yuan]].

On 23 March 1996, [[Republic of China presidential election, 1996|Taiwan's first direct presidential election]] was held. The Democratic Progressive Party's candidate was defeated by incumbent president [[Lee Teng-hui]], with only 21.1% of the vote(The DPP got around 30% in before regional elections). Shih Ming-te resigned to his position as party chief, and Chang Chun-hsiung assumeed as acting leader of the opposition party. Shih shifted his attention to the completion of the "Meilitao [[Oral History]] Records".

[[File:President Direct Election Movement Ming-te Shih Yi-hsiung Lin and Hsin-liang Hsu.jpg|left|400px|thumb|Shih (left front) in 1992]]

On 1 April 1997, Shih was indicted for a violation to the Mass Gathering and Demonstration Act. He had organized in 1992 a protest demanding direct presidential elections. [[Huang Hsin-chieh]], [[Hsu Hsin-liang]] and [[Lin Yi-hsiung]] went to prison with Shih for 50 days. This was the third time Shih was imprisoned, but now as a legislator. He was released after 41 days.

In 1998, Shih was re-elected legislator but this time representing a [[Taipei City]] constituency. He would continue his efforts for the completion of the "Meilitao Oral History Records". In three years, 200 individuals of the political spectrum. The oral testimonies amounted to over 6 million words, and were edited to a 600,000 word four volume version. To date, this is the most comprehensive historical research of the 1970–1990 era in Taiwan's development, earning it a publishing prize. This was the result of Shih's individual efforts, using his own financial and personal resources. Neither the Democratic Progressive Party nor the government of Taiwan have helped complete this overwhelming historic research project.

In 2000, [[Chen Shui-bian]], the former [[Mayor of Taipei City]], was elected president. Shih congratulated the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party [[Lin Yi-hsiung]] for the triumph. He said in an interview that since his childhood dream of ousting the Chiang's KMT regime had been accomplished, he would leave the political party. In May, Chen before he assumed the presidency, visited Shih's office to personally ask him if he was willing to be appointed senior political advisor. Shih rejected Chen's offer once more, but instead proposed Hsu Hsin-liang for the position.

Shih condemned President Chen for leading the country with a minority government, ignoring the KMT majority in the Legislative Yuan and risking political stability. After Chen rejected his suggestion for an alliance with the opposition majority in the Legislative Yuan, Shih further walked away from the party. Believing that Taiwan's greatest challenge in the 21st century was globalization, together with former colleagues Hsu Hsin-liang and [[Sisy Chen]], famous Wen Shih-ren and a dozen others intellectuals and entrepreneurs, founded the "''Shan'' (Mountain) Alliance". Their goal: to draw a road map for Taiwan in the 21st century.

Shih ran as an independent twice, in December 2001 and December 2004. On the first occasion he lost with 24,925 votes, on the second he narrowly lost the race by receiving 26,974 votes in the highly contested Taipei North Constituency. He had proposed a parliamentary political system to overcome the aggravation of political differences in Taiwan's society.

In December 2002, Shih ran as Mayor candidate for Kaohsiung City. His platform: turn the port-city into a [[free port]], much like Hong Kong or [[Amsterdam]], to cope with the challenge of [[globalization]]. Direct maritime links with Chinese ports was also part of the proposal. Shih perceived that the political division was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election.

In September 2003, Shih Ming-te was a visiting scholar at [[George Mason University]] for a one-year period. During his tenure, Shih researched what he called the "One China: European Union Model" as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and reiterated his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system, in an attempt to put an end to the political polarization into the two camps (blue or Kuomintang-based and green or Democratic Progressive Party-centered) which was deteriorating into ethnic rivalry between Chinese refugees coming to rule Taiwan in 1949, and those who were there before that time.

On 6 October 2005, the Department of Political Science at the [[National Taiwan University]] opens the "Shih Ming-te Lecture" series; ethnic harmony, political reconciliation and cross-Strait peace are its core values.

In May, 2006, "Shih Ming-te Lecture" invited Mr. [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]], Former [[State President of South Africa]], to a dialog with Shih Ming-te: "Maintaining Peace: South Africa's Experience, a Perspective for Taiwan?" is the topic.

In May 2015, Shih announced his intention to run for president as an independent candidate in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loa|first1=Lok-sin|title=Shih Ming-te launches campaign for presidency|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/22/2003618886|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again reiterated the Broad One China Framework first proposed in 2014, in which China and Taiwan govern one legal entity separately. Both governments would be allowed to join international organizations and not use military force against the other, instead "resolving issues through consensus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=I-chia|title=‘Broad one-China framework’ set|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/05/28/2003591400|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Wei-ting|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=Presidential hopeful Shih Ming-teh vows to form coalition Cabinet|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201505210025.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih ended his campaign in September, as he had not been able to fulfill the [[Central Election Commission (Taiwan)|Central Election Commission]] requirements needed to stand in the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kao|first1=Evelyn|title=Independent pulls out of presidential race|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201509150026.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerber|first1=Abraham|title=Shih Ming-te fails to meet threshold, ends candidacy|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/16/2003627834|accessdate=16 September 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign ==

===Chronology===
On 9 August 2006, Shih wrote an open letter to President [[Chen Shui-bian]], whose aides, wife and son-in-law were implicated in several corruption cases. Shih urged Chen to resign as a display of strength in times of crisis, respect for public opinion and acknowledgement of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nori.org.tw/english/main3.asp?idno=30 〈Shih Ming-teh's Letter To Chen Shui-bian〉] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010250/http://www.nori.org.tw/english/main3.asp?idno=30 |date=December 5, 2008 }}, Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go Headquarters&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Chen Shui-bian had been Shih's defense attorney in the aftermath of the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] and had been imprisoned for 18 months himself.

On 12 August 2006, Shih gave a keynote speech to kick-start the "Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go" campaign in the February 28 Incident Memorial Park. He argued that the people could not bear with so much corruption anymore. Shih asks all those who support the movement a NT$100 (US$3, €2.3) donation as a symbol of commitment and consent, as well as a display of determination to ask Chen Shui-bian to leave the Presidential Office. Shih vowed to lead the people in a protest until Chen Shui-bian stepped down if the donations came in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2006/08/12/87690/NT$100-donation.htm 〈NT$100 donation fund legal, account numbers available: Ho〉], August 12, 2006, the china news&lt;/ref&gt; By 22 August 2006, a sum equivalent of that from over 1 million people had been received (the actual number of donators cannot be computed because there was no restriction on the maximum amount of money one could transfer to the designated account) in only seven days. The designated account was quickly closed and the preparations for the marathon protest started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5323466.stm 〈Protests against Chen gain ground 〉], September 7, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2006, the anti-corruption campaign organizers started training for the sit-ins (emergency procedures in case of police intervention).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2006/08/25/88743/Deposing-Chen.htm 〈Deposing Chen up to people's will, Shih says〉], August 25, 2006, the china post&lt;/ref&gt; The sit-in began on a rainy day on 9 September 2006. According to the Chinapost, over 300,000 people gathered that day on Ketagalan Avenue, in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei under the pouring rain. The Taipei Police Department claimed there were only 100,00 protestors. According to the organizers' request, most of them were wearing red shirts; no controversial flags or political icons should be displayed, not even the Republic of China flag, perceived as a pro-Kuomintang device. Some protestors still brought along a small Republic of China flag or other campaign items with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5329816.stm 〈Taiwan leader faces mass protest 〉], September 9, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2006, a Democratic Progressive Party Taipei city counselor booked the [[Ketagalan Boulevard]] site where the red-clad protestors were still gathered. Shih Ming-teh decided to move the protest to Taipei Railway Station. A climax was reached the night of the procession: a large perimeter of over 5.5 kilometers around the heavily guarded Presidential Building and Residence at the heart of Taipei was quickly flooded by peaceful red-clad protestors: the ''China Post'' reported that over 8 hundred thousand people had joined the candlelight encirclement; the Taipei Police again contradicted this with an estimate of 3 hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5348830.stm 〈TMass march against Taiwan leader 〉], September 15, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2006, Shih declared that he would not form his own political party nor participate in any political negotiations, he also made it clear that he was not willing to engage in negotiations with former president Lee Teng-hui; instead he would stay with the red-clad anti-Chen protestors. On 20 November 2006, Shih Ming-te urged Taipei City Mayor [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (the Kuomintang's 2008 presidential hopeful) to resign amidst accusations of corruption. Shih said he was not contemplating anti-corruption protests against Ma, but insisted there should not be double standards regarding corruption allegations. Ma was acquitted.

On 30 November 2006, the last night of protest by the Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign. Shih Ming-te later travelled to Thailand for a TV interview and panel discussion.

On 7 December 2006, the Special State Funds case of President Chen and his wife was underway, campaign organizers claimed that Taiwan needed to go back to normal, but Shih would protest until Chen steps down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncleyap-news.blogspot.com/2006/12/rocs-mr-shih-ming-teh-will-begin-self.html 〈ROC's Mr. Shih Ming Teh will begin SELF-IMPRISONMENT 〉], December 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2007, Shih announced the end to his self-imprisonment and started preparations for the second stage of the anti-Chen campaign. Plans involved presenting candidates for the next legislative elections. Originally schedduled for late 2007, the elections would instead be carried out in early 2008.

== Controversy ==
Shih is often considered a "romantic revolutionary" in Taiwan media. He believes that he is rooted in his ability "to pursue unlimited aspirations and ideals under restrictive conditions".&lt;ref name="〈從軍造反記〉"/&gt; The latest editions of Taiwan's High-School textbooks list Shih Ming-teh as a political activist. Shih's former Legislative Yuan secretary, cartoonist and writer Yu-fu, thinks Shih "is never quite sure of his own place in history".

Shih is accused by his ex-wife Chen, Li Zhu, in her book, "The Innocent Song of a Taiwanese Woman," of using her as a sex toy, and failing his responsibility as a husband.  Chen also claimed Shih been indifferent to his responsibility toward their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/gossip/2008-09/236314.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927064938/http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/gossip/2008-09/236314.html |archivedate=September 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih Ming-te often says: "I have been locked up for 25 years, where were you then?"{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

Another former secretary of Shih, Kuo Wen-pin, wrote about his opinion of Shih on Taiwan Daily (15 October 2000): Taking a look at 40 years of his struggle for Taiwan's democracy, he revealed himself as a visionary, making several pioneering proposals ahead of his time.

Over 20 years ago, Shih already said the four evils of Taiwan's path towards democracy were the political monopoly by the Kuomintang, the press control in Taiwan, the martial law and the "ten thousand year" legislative session (萬年國會). Risking death penalty, Shih advocated for a "Republic of China, Taiwanese Independence Model", and added that "Taiwan is already an independent country, it has been so for over 30 years". For his opinions, Shih was considered seditious and the media, organizations, academia, everyone attacked him and humiliated him, only for the Democratic Progressive Party to adopt and implement his ideas; they even led the way to Lee Teng-hui's "Silent Revolution" political compromises. When the Kuomintang's 50 years in power ended, the Chen Shui-bian administration accepted some of his teachings. Arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism, but the abuse of public power and the media by individuals to insult, humiliate, and defame others is still common practice. The DPP party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means, but this has yet to be seen.

In the aftermath of Shih's "red-shirt" movement, he became a darling of PRC-controlled media, including CCTVPhoenix TV, and the People's Daily.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.huanqiu.com/people/2010-05/806828_7.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Shih's efforts in discrediting the DPP have been widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/zhuanti/238778.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 2006, ifeng.com, web portal of pro-CCP television channel Phoenix TV, reported Shih planned a trip to Thailand to discuss his "red shirt" philosophy.  In the same article, Shih also rebutted claims by representative of the American Institute in Taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ifeng.com/taiwan/detail_2006_11/20/967875_0.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2010, [http://www.chinanews.com.cn/tw/tw-twyw/news/2010/01-16/2075541.shtml chinanews.com.cn, a PRC media outlet, reported the possibility of Shih running for presidency in 2012.] On 19 April 2010, www.chinataiwan.org, a Chinese government sponsored site, reported Shih claimed numerous prominent DPP leaders, including Chen Shui-bian and Hsieh Chang-ting, were undercover agents for the Kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinataiwan.org/plzhx/hxshp/zhzh/201004/t20100419_1326363.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Huaxia.com, yet another pro-CCP website, Shih's accusations have caused a general panic in the DPP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huaxia.com/thpl/tdyh/wzf/2010/04/1849396.html&lt;/ref&gt; A former supporter and pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Wang, Jie Nan, wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with Shih, starting from Shih's "red shirt" movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the DPP with outlandish accusations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/apr/24/today-o3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2011, Shih courted controversy when he asked [[Tsai Ing-Wen]] to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid. Despite his own support for [[LGBT rights in Taiwan]], Shih was roundly criticized by major women's groups including the Awakening Foundation, the Taiwan Women's Link and the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association. Tsai herself characterized the request as "surprising" and refused to reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/04/17/2003500949|title = Tsai takes stand on right to privacy|work=The Taipei Times |date = Apr 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Snellen chart''' is an [[eye chart]] that can be used to measure [[visual acuity]]. Snellen charts are named after the Dutch [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Herman Snellen]], who developed the chart in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;H. Snellen, Probebuchstaben zur Bestimmung der Sehschärfe, Utrecht 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ophthalmologists  and vision scientists now use an improved chart known as the [[LogMAR chart]].

==History==
Snellen developed charts using symbols based in a 5×5 unit grid. The experimental charts developed in 1861 used abstract symbols.&lt;ref name="Pfoff Laser and Eye Home"&gt;{{cite web | title=New Page 1 | website=Pfoff Laser and Eye Home | url=http://www.pfofflaserandeye.com/The%20Informed%20Patient/Contrast%20and%20Glare/Contrast%20and%20Glare%20BG.htm | accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snellen's charts published in 1862 used alphanumeric capitals in the 5×5 grid. The original chart shows A, C, E, G, L, N, P, R, T, 5, V, Z, B, D, 4, F, H, K, O, S, 3, U, Y, A, C, E, G, L, 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ski.org/Colenbrander/Images/History_VA_Measuremnt.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The normal Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person taking the test covers one [[human eye|eye]] from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top.  The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye.
The symbols on an acuity chart are formally known as "[[Eye chart|optotypes]]".
In the case of the traditional Snellen chart, the optotypes have the appearance of block letters, and are intended to be seen and read as letters. They are not, however, letters from any ordinary typographer's font. They have a particular, simple geometry in which:
*the thickness of the lines equals the thickness of the white spaces between lines and the thickness of the gap in the letter "C"
*the height and width of the optotype (letter) is five times the thickness of the line.
Only the ten letters C, D, E, F, L, N, O, P, T, Z are used in the common Snellen chart.  The perception of five out of six letters (or similar ratio) is judged to be the Snellen fraction.&lt;ref&gt;"eye, human. "Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Wall-mounted Snellen charts are inexpensive and are sometimes used for approximate assessment of vision, e.g. in a primary-care physician's office. Whenever acuity must be assessed carefully (as in an eye doctor's examination), or where there is a possibility that the examinee might attempt to deceive the examiner (as in a motor vehicle license office), equipment is used that can present the letters in a variety of randomized patterns.
BS 4274-1:1968(British Standards Institution) "Specification for test charts for determining distance visual acuity" was replaced by BS  4274-1:2003 "Test charts for clinical determination of distance visual acuity — Specification".  It states that "the luminance of the presentation shall be uniform and not less than 120 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Any variation across the test chart shall not exceed 20 %."
According to BS 4274-1:2003 only the letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z should be used for the testing of vision based upon equal legibility of the letters.

==Snellen fraction==

[[Visual acuity]] = Distance at which test is made / distance at which the smallest [[optotype]] identified [[Subtended angle|subtends]] an angle of five [[Minute and second of arc|arcminutes]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=="6/6"(m) or "20/20"(ft) vision==
{{further|Visual acuity#Expression}}
Snellen defined “standard vision” as the ability to recognize one of his optotypes when it subtended 5 minutes of arc. Thus the optotype can only be recognized if the person viewing it can discriminate a spatial pattern separated by a [[visual angle]] of one [[Minute and second of arc|minute of arc]].

Outside of the United States, the standard chart distance is {{convert|6|m}}, and normal acuity is designated "6/6".  Other acuities are expressed as ratios with a numerator of 6. Some clinics do not have 6-metre eye lanes available, and either a half-size chart subtending the same angles at {{convert|3|m}}, or a reversed chart projected and viewed by a mirror is used to achieve the correct sized letters.

In the most familiar acuity test, a Snellen chart is placed at a standard distance: 6 metres. At this distance, the symbols on the line representing "normal" acuity subtend an angle of five minutes of arc, and the thickness of the lines and of the spaces between the lines subtends one minute of arc. This line, designated 6/6 (or 20/20), is the smallest line that a person with normal acuity can read at a distance of 6 metres.

Three lines above, the letters have twice the height of those letters on the 6/6 (or 20/20 in the US) line. If this is the smallest line a person can read, the person's acuity is "6/12" ("20/40"), meaning that this person needs to approach to a distance of {{convert|6|m}} to read letters that a person with normal acuity could read at {{convert|12|m}}.  In an even more approximate manner, this person could be said to have "half" the normal acuity of 6/6.

At exactly 6 metres' distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 minutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc), which means that the chart should be sized such that these letters are 8.73&amp;nbsp;mm tall and the topmost (6/60) "E" should be 87.3&amp;nbsp;mm tall. Putting it another way, the eye should be at a distance 68.76 times the height of the top (6/60) letter. The formula is

&lt;math&gt;w=2d \, {\tan{{\theta} \over {2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the optotype height or width (which are the same due to the optotype being on a square grid), &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from eye to chart, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle subtended by the optotype, which is 5 arcminutes as specified by Snellen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howett|first1=Gerald L.|title=Size of Letters Required for Visibility as a Function of Viewing Distance and Observer Visual Acuity|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-ff8dc22d75e66f29ebdb2bb2085ee683/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-ff8dc22d75e66f29ebdb2bb2085ee683.pdf|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office.|publisher=United States Department of Commerce. National Bureau of Standards|archivedate=18 June 2013|accessdate=11 December 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/sizeoflettersreq1180howe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another calculation for United States clinics using 20-foot chart distances (slightly more than 6 m), and using a 17 mm model eye for calculations, and a letter which subtends 5 minutes of arc, gives a vertical height of the 20/20 letter to be 8.75 mm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwelleyesight.com/eye-math/2020-letter/ 20/20 Calculation, Dr. Craig Blackwell, MD]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acuity charts are used during many kinds of vision examinations, such as "refracting" the eye to determine the best eyeglass prescription. During such examinations, acuity ratios are never mentioned.

The largest letter on an eye chart often represents an acuity of 6/60 (20/200), the value that is considered "legally blind" in the US. Some individuals with moderate [[Near-sightedness|myopia]] may not be able to read the large E without glasses, but have no problem reading the 6/6 (20/20) line or 6/4.5 (20/15) line with glasses. By contrast, legally blind individuals have a visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less when using the best corrective lens.

== Electronic Chart ==
To ensure adequate illumination of the Snellen charts, various medical device manufacturers had developed Snellen chart products with backlight or projection.

== Digital Chart ==
Since computer monitors typically have good lighting for reading and LCD/LED monitors have high DPI between 96 to 480, they are suitable for displaying optotypes. Commonly digital chart products support randomizing optotypes displayed to prevent patients from cheating through memorizing the chart. In [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)]], there are Snellen chart apps for smart phones and tablets.

'''Statistical graphics''', also known as '''graphical techniques''', are graphics in the field of [[statistics]] used to visualize quantitative [[data]].

== Overview ==
Whereas [[statistics]] and [[data analysis]] procedures generally yield their output in numeric or tabular form, graphical techniques allow such results to be displayed in some sort of pictorial form. They include [[Plot (graphics)|plots]] such as [[scatter plot]]s, [[histogram]]s, [[probability plot]]s, [[spaghetti plot]]s, residual plots, [[box plot]]s, block plots and [[biplot]]s.&lt;ref name="NIST03"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda15.htm The Role of Graphics] in: ''NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods'', 2003-2010. Accessed May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exploratory data analysis]] (EDA) relies heavily on such techniques. They can also provide insight into a data set to help with testing assumptions, [[model selection]] and [[regression model validation]], estimator selection, relationship identification, factor effect determination, and [[outlier]] detection. In addition, the choice of appropriate statistical graphics can provide a convincing means of communicating the underlying message that is present in the data to others.&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;

Graphical statistical methods have four objectives:&lt;ref&gt;William G. Jacoby (1997). ''Statistical Graphics for Univariate and Bivariate Data: Statistical Graphics'' pp.2&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt;
* The exploration of the content of a data set
* The use to find structure in data
* Checking assumptions in statistical models
* Communicate the results of an analysis.

If one is not using statistical graphics, then one is forfeiting insight into one or more aspects of the underlying structure of the data.

== History ==
Statistical graphics have been central to the development of science and date to the earliest attempts to analyse data. Many familiar forms, including [[Bivariate map|bivariate plots]], [[Choropleth map|statistical maps]], [[bar chart]]s, and [[coordinate paper]] were used in the 18th century. Statistical graphics developed through attention to four problems:&lt;ref name="JRB78"&gt;[[James R. Beniger]] and Dorothy L. Robyn (1978). "Quantitative graphics in statistics: A brief history". In: ''The
American Statistician''. 32: pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Spatial organization in the 17th and 18th century
* Discrete comparison in the 18th and early 19th century
* Continuous distribution in the 19th century and 
* Multivariate distribution and correlation in the late 19th and 20th century. 
Since the 1970s statistical graphics have been re-emerging as an important analytic tool with the revitalisation of [[computer graphics]] and related technologies.&lt;ref name="JRB78"/&gt;

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|180px|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s Cholera map in dot style, 1854.]]
Famous graphics were designed by:
* [[William Playfair]] who produced what could be called the first [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s. For example, in 1786 he published the well known diagram that depicts the evolution of [[England]]'s imports and exports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]], who used statistical graphics to persuade the British Government to improve army hygiene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] who plotted deaths from [[cholera]] in [[London]] in 1854 to detect the source of the disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]] who designed a large portfolio of maps of which the one depicting [[Napoleon]]'s campaign in [[Russia]] is the best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World March for Peace and Nonviolence''' is an initiative of [[World without Wars]], an international organization which has worked for peace and nonviolence since 1995 and was created by the [[Humanist Movement]].

The project of the World March was launched in 2008 and is supported by hundreds of organizations and personalities in the Arts, Music, Politics, Literature, Sports, etc.

The March started October 2 (Gandhi's birthday), 2009 in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] and finished on January 2, 2010 in [[Punta de Vacas]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]]. The March was intended to rise worldwide awareness for nonviolence. Concrete demands of the March are: abolition of nuclear weapons;  withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of non-aggression treaties among nations and the renunciation by governments of war as a way to resolve conflicts.

The World March for Peace and Nonviolence is projected to include millions of individuals, on six continents in 90 countries, traveling some 160,000 kilometers.

==Demands put forward by world march==

* Nuclear disarmament at a global level.
* The immediate withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories.
* The progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons.
* The signing of non-aggression treaties between countries.
* The renunciation by governments of the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts.

==Notable endorsers==
One of the key strategies to promote the March is to receive endorsements from as many celebrated personalities as possible in a variety of fields. These include: Nobel Prize winners, national presidents, sportsmen and women, actors and actresses, singers, composers etc.

Amongst this list are:
