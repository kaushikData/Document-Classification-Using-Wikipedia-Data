'''Ahmed Dabbah''' ({{lang-ar|احمد ذباح}}, {{lang-he|אחמד דבאח}}; born 27 January 1955) is an [[Israeli Arab]] politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Kadima]] between 2012 and 2013, the party's first non-Druze Arab MK.&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; He also served as mayor of [[Deir al-Asad]] and the now-dissolved city of [[Shaghur]].&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

==Biography==
Dabbah started his career as a primary school teacher, before becoming the owner and CEO of "Saleh Dabbah and Sons", a business conglomerate including supermarkets and a slaughterhouse,&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; as well as establishing the Dabbah shopping mall in [[Deir al-Asad]]. He has nine children.&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

===Political career===
In 1992 he joined [[Likud]], but transferred to Kadima after it was founded in 2005,&lt;ref name=JP&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=281261 Former mayor to become Kadima's first Arab MK] The Jerusalem Post, 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of its leading activists.&lt;ref name=YNN/&gt; Although he was given a high placing by [[Ariel Sharon]] on the party's original list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 Knesset elections]],&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; he was ultimately placed only 51st on the final list,&lt;ref name="17 Knesset"&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections17/heb/list/list.asp?id=30 Kadima] 17th Knesset website {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failed to win a seat as the party won only 29. He was placed 36th on the party's list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]],&lt;ref name="18 Knesset"&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections18/heb/list/List.aspx?ListId=77 Kadima] 18th Knesset website {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but again failed to win a seat as the party won only 28 seats.

Dabbah has been the mayor of Deir-el-Asad, as well as the head of the Shagur Local Council.  As mayor of Deir-el-Asad, Dabbah helped [[Shaul Mofaz]] gain votes among the Arab-Israeli public,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/dichter-to-quit-knesset-take-ministerial-role/|title=Kadima MK quits Knesset to join government as home front protection minister|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=15 August 2012| author=Ser, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was running to replace [[Tzipi Livni]] as leader of Kadima. Dabbah helped bring 1,121 votes from his town of Deir-el-Asad for Shaul Mofaz, which totals more votes than both Mofaz's and Livni's combined votes from Tel Aviv, which numbered 1,112. Dabbah has said that he is a public figure that the public trusts, and objects to being called a "vote contractor."&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=281261|title=Former mayor to become Kadima's first Arab MK|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=15 August 2012|accessdate=15 August 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dabbah was sworn into the Knesset on 16 August 2012 as a replacement for [[Avi Dichter]],&lt;ref name="JPost sworn in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=281445|title=Ahmad Dabah is sworn in as newest member of Knesset| publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=19 August 2012|author=Hoffman, Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/MKIndex_Current_eng.asp?view=5 Replacements Among Knesset Members] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned his seat on 14 August after leaving the party in order to join the [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] government as an independent.&lt;ref name=YNN&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4268229,00.html Dichter quits Kadima to join government] Ynetnews, 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This took the number of Arab members of the Knesset to 17, a record.&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

[[File:1931.01.31 23 Andrussow Pilot Plant diagramm Herne Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram from 1931 showing the Andrussow process]]
The '''Andrussow process''' is an industrial process for the production of [[hydrogen cyanide]] from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  1.5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →   HCN  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The process is based on a reaction that was discovered by [[Leonid Andrussow]] in 1927. In the following years he developed the process that is named after him. HCN is also produced in the [[BMA process]].

==Side reactions==
This reaction is very [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]].

The '''B&amp;O Warehouse''' is a building in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], adjacent to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. It was constructed by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) beginning in 1899, with later sections completed in 1905, adjacent to the B&amp;O's [[Camden Yards station|Camden Station]] and freight yard at Camden and Eutaw streets. Often purported to be the longest brick building on the East Coast, the {{convert|1116|ft|m|0|adj=on}} long, eight-story brick structure had 430,000 square feet (almost 40,000 m²) of floor space for merchandise storage and distribution, large enough to hold 1,000 carloads of freight at a time, the B&amp;O advertised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert H. Harwood, Jr.]], ''Impossible Challenge''.  Baltimore, Md.: Bernard, Roberts and Co., 1979 ({{ISBN|0-934118-17-5}}), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad historian Herbert H. Harwood proclaimed it an "awesome structure&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;a truly classic turn-of-the-century railroad warehouse."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; The warehouse was used by the B&amp;O through the 1960s but was mostly vacant by the 1970s due to the use of trucks and newer, more efficient single-floor warehouses located in industrial parks elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Salamon, David P. Oroszi, and David P. Ori, ''Baltimore and Ohio &amp;ndash; Reflections of the Capitol Dome''. Silver Spring, Md.: Old Line Graphics, 1993 ({{ISBN|1-879314-08-8}}), pp. 26&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the downtown stadium for the Orioles, which opened in 1992, the former B&amp;O warehouse was converted to team offices, team spaces, and a private club for the Orioles.  It is also used for private wedding receptions.

In the entire history of Camden Yards, [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], has been the only player to hit the warehouse with a home run. He did so in the 1993 MLB [[Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)|Home Run Derby]], in which he tied [[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]] before losing in a playoff. No player has accomplished the feat in a game.

The '''Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Building''' is a historic [[office building]] located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], United States. It is the former headquarters of the old Consolidated Gas, Light and Electric Power Company of Baltimore City, which was a merger at the turn of the 20th century of the former century old Gas Light Company of Baltimore with several other formerly competing gas and electric power companies which had risen in the late 19th century, to form a single metropolitan wide unified utility system. In 1955, the old cumbersome Consolidated title was jettisoned and the utility rebranded as the [[Baltimore Gas and Electric|Baltimore Gas and Electric Company]] (BG&amp;E).

A 21-story [[skyscraper]] designed by the Boston and Baltimore-based architectural firm of [[Parker, Thomas and Rice]], and was constructed in 1916. Standing at {{convert|88|m|abbr=on}} it was tied with the [[Emerson Bromo-Seltzer Tower]] from 1916 to 1923 as the [[List of tallest buildings in Baltimore|tallest building in Baltimore]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} It was constructed with a structural steel skeleton and tile arch flooring structure. The exterior is clad with gray granite and gray and white marble from the first through third floors (including the mezzanine) and glazed [[terra cotta]] in a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Classical Style.  The building includes sculptures at the fourth floor representing "knowledge", "light", "heat" and "power."&lt;ref name="baltarch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorsey|first=John|author2=Dilts, James D.|title=A Guide to Baltimore Architecture|publisher=Tidewater Publishes|location=Centreville, Maryland|year=1981|edition=Second|page=57|isbn=0-87033-272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1380.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Building|date=June 2003|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=David M. Facenda|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

A smaller addition was built in 1966, designed by Fisher, Nes, Campbell and Associates.&lt;ref name="baltarch"/&gt;

It was purchased in 2006 and reopened in 2007 as luxury apartments complete with two penthouse levels by [[Southern Management Corporation]].

Gates, Senior, to avoid confusion with his son.}} (b. 1925) and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]] (1929–1994). His ancestry includes [[English American|English]], [[German American|German]], [[Irish American|Irish]], and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062031/http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scottish Americans |publisher=Alba West |url=http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html |access-date=April 29, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172722/http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]]. Gates' maternal grandfather was J.W. Maxwell, a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.{{Sfn |Manes | 1994 |p= 15}}  Early on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p = 47}} When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the [[Congregational Christian Churches]], a [[Protestant]] [[Reformed]] denomination.&lt;ref name="Congregational 1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ubYgIB0TgUYC&amp;pg=PA12 |quote = The Gates family regularly went to services at the University Congregational Church.| first =Jeanne M | last = Lesinski |publisher=Twenty First Century Books | accessdate =March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-1-58013-570-2|date = September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congregational 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates Speaks: Insight from the World's Greatest Entrepreneur|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LUwu-DTwa5cC&amp;pg=PA3 |quote = The Gates family attended the University Congregational Church, where the Reverend Dale Turner was pastor. | first = Janet | last = Lowe| publisher = Wiley | accessdate=March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-0-471-40169-8|date = January 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congregational 3"&gt;{{cite book| title = Something Happened: A Political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies | url =https://books.google.com/?id=tsl3EVBtdxcC&amp;pg=PA228|quote=Bill Gates was a member of the baby boom, born in 1955 into an upper-middle-class family near Seattle."

At 13, he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside School]], a private preparatory school.{{Sfn | Manes| 1994| p = 24}}  When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p= 27}}  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students{{snd}} Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans{{snd}} for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{Sfn | Manes | 1994|p = 34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | agency = V3 | title = Paul Allen spills the beans on Gates' criminal past | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130312212620/http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | archivedate = March 12, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in [[Computer Center Corporation|CCC]]'s software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via [[Teletype]]{{clarify| date=July 2018}}, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[COBOL]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/speeches/2005/09/bill-gates-lakeside-school | title = Remarks by Bill Gates, co-chair | accessdate = July 13, 2013 | work = Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&amp;nbsp;– Press Room, Speeches | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703072235/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2005/09/Bill-Gates-Lakeside-School | archivedate = July 3, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 14}}  In 1972, Bill Gates served as a congressional [[Page (assistance occupation)|page]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Schuman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A.

Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate ''[[magna cum laude]]''. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO5LIILHmcYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA263|title=Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases: Competitiveness and Globalization|author1=Michael Hitt|author2=R.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard,{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}} and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at [[Honeywell]] during the summer of 1974.{{Sfn |Wallace| 1993| p = 59}}  The [[MITS Altair 8800]] was released the following year. The new computer was based on the [[Intel 8080 CPU]], and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 18}}  Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}}  Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school.  I was officially on [a] [[leave of absence|leave]] [of absence]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4G1RtoKyI&amp;t=53 The History of Microsoft – 1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211023447/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4G1RtoKyI&amp;t=53 |date=February 11, 2017 }}: Bill Gates explaining that his departure from Harvard was reversible if Microsoft had failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gates read the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', which demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], he contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name="keyevents"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft |format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,&lt;ref name="thocp1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name=thocp1 /&gt; Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=thocp1 /&gt; Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}}  This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name="thocp1" /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], Washington, on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name="keyevents" /&gt;

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business.  Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, according to Bill Gates' own claims, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |last=Gates |first=William 'Bill' |title=Remarks |date=October 13, 2005 |location=Waterloo, [[Ontario|ON]] |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- self promotion from himself --&gt;

=== IBM partnership ===
[[IBM]] approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}}  IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter.  When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes|first1=John Steele|last1=Gordon|first2=Michael|last2=Maiello|authorlink1=John Steele Gordon|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=March 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029221703/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|archivedate=October 29, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}}  Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer.

Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/0000/PX00738.pdf |title=Challenges and Strategy |format=PDF |work=Groklaw |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."&lt;ref name="freiberger19810831"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49 | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | last=Freiberger | first=Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | publisher=InfoWorld | page=49 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902132455/https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49 | archivedate=September 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times.

Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.&lt;ref name="rensin"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David|last= Rensin|title= The Bill Gates Interview|year= 1994|journal= Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&amp;nbsp;– Church Hill Club |first=Steve |last=Ballmer |date=October 9, 1997 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420152806/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He interrupted presentations with such comments as "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"&lt;ref name="time GOS"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html | first=Walter | last= Isaacson | title = The Gates Operating System |work=Time | date= January 13, 1997 | accessdate= March 31, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619090559/http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html|archivedate = June 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Why don't you just give up your [[Employee stock option|options]] and join the [[Peace Corps]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | title =Breaking Windows | work =The Wall Street Journal | last =Bank | first =David | date =February 1, 1999 | accessdate =March 31, 2008 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160416032811/http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | archivedate =April 16, 2016 | deadurl =yes | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.&lt;ref name="time GOS" /&gt; When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i8aV1bK5vmwLaw9wYr9nY5bFc4YA |first=Glenn |last=Chapman |title=Bill Gates Signs Off |date=June 27, 2008 |agency=Agence France-Presse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630070506/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i8aV1bK5vmwLaw9wYr9nY5bFc4YA |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdc97"&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx |first=Bill |last=Gates |title=Remarks by Bill Gates |location=San Diego |date=September 26, 1997 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420152409/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herbold"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|year=2004|last=Herbold|title=The Fiefdom Syndrome: The Turf Battles That Undermine Careers and Companies&amp;nbsp;– And How to Overcome Them|isbn=0-385-51067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's [[programming language]] products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100]],&lt;ref name="allison1993"&gt;{{cite interview | last=Gates | first=Bill | subjectlink=Bill Gates | interviewer=David Allison | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | title=Bill Gates Interview | work=Transcript of a Video History Interview / Computer History Collection | publisher=[[National Museum of American History]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] | accessdate=April 10, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402195548/http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | archivedate=April 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.&lt;ref name="pdc97" /&gt; He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, [[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote that when he watched Gates announce [[Microsoft Excel]], "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat [[hack (programmer subculture)|hack]]."&lt;ref name="pournelle198509"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n329/mode/2up | title=PCs, Peripherals, Programs, and People | work=BYTE | date=September 1985 | accessdate=March 20, 2016 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.&lt;ref name="mscorpnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates |publisher=Microsoft |date=June 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619230935/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |archivedate=June 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antitrust litigation ===
{{Further |United States Microsoft antitrust case|European Union Microsoft competition case}}
[[File:Bill Gates - United States v. Microsoft.jpg|thumb|Gates giving his [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we".  The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.&lt;ref name="GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court |first=Elizabeth |last=Wasserman |publisher=CNN |date=November 17, 1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407052251/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reported:
{{quote|Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm |title=Microsoft's Teflon Bill |work=BusinessWeek |date=November 30, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407081113/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilemann |first1=John |title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth |date=November 1, 2000 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft.html |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |issue=8.11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528131641/http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft.html |archivedate=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]], and blocking competition, both in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt;

=== Appearance in ads ===

[[File:Bill Gates mugshot.png|thumb|right|Mugshots of 22-year-old Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]]]

In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside.  The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own [[mugshot]] of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977, for a traffic violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title=Mugshots |publisher=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724142703/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers. After getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (''[[Seinfeld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://grnlight.net/index.php/everything-else-misc/110-microsoft-s-small-screen-of-bore | title = Adblog | publisher = MSNBC | accessdate = May 23, 2014 | date = September 8, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233115/http://grnlight.net/index.php/everything-else-misc/110-microsoft-s-small-screen-of-bore | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/seinfeld-and-gates-hit-the-road-for-vista/|title=Seinfeld and Gates Hit the Road for Vista|author=Ina Fried|publisher=''[[CNET]]''|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=July 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231203711/http://www.cnet.com/news/seinfeld-and-gates-hit-the-road-for-vista/|archivedate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8&amp;nbsp;billion to US$78.5&amp;nbsp;billion. {{as of|2014|January}}, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaires Worth $3.7 Trillion Surge as Gates Wins 2013|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-02/billionaires-worth-3-7-trillion-surge-as-gates-wins-2013.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=January 2, 2014|author=Matthew G.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In the interview,  Gates provided his perspective on  climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann S.

Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of [[superintelligence]]; in a [[Reddit]] "ask me anything", he stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with [[Elon Musk]] and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/28/bill-gates-also-worries-artificial-intelligence-is-a-threat/|date=January 28, 2015|title=Bill Gates Says You Should Worry About Artificial Intelligence|first=Eric|last=Mack|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=February 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219122941/http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/28/bill-gates-also-worries-artificial-intelligence-is-a-threat/|archivedate=February 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines|title=Bill Gates Is Worried About the Rise of the Machines|publisher=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=February 19, 2015|first=Andrew|last=Lumby|date=January 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219122609/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines|archivedate=February 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/24/apple-co-founder-on-artificial-intelligence-the-future-is-scary-and-very-bad-for-people/|title=Apple co-founder on artificial intelligence: 'The future is scary and very bad for people'|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Holley|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417053459/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/24/apple-co-founder-on-artificial-intelligence-the-future-is-scary-and-very-bad-for-people/|archivedate=April 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Permalink to an answer from "Hi Reddit, I'm Bill Gates and I'm back for my third AMA.

=== Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ===
{{Main|Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}

Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|title=Gates foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523010101/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|archivedate=May 23, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|title=The Top Ten US Charitable Foundations|author=Robin Toal|date=September 16, 2013|work=Funds For NGOs|publisher=Funds For NGOs, LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081521/http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|archivedate=April 7, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist|author=Cronin, Jon|date=January 25, 2005|accessdate=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015134954/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|archivedate=October 15, 2007|deadurl=no|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|archivedate=April 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] as a major influence.

Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in ''[[The Power of Half]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505|title=They half it in them|author=Bina Abraham|date=October 1, 2010|newspaper=Gulf News|accessdate=March 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121122929/http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505|archivedate=January 21, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates, and investor [[Warren Buffett]] signed a commitment they called the "[[Giving Pledge]]."

Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect [[Frank Gehry]]. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/14/bill-gates-donates-20-million-to/|title=Bill Gates Donates $20&amp;nbsp;million to MIT|author=Matthew G.H.

The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the [[Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]] is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/map-directions/buildings|title=Our Campus TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SPACES|year=2014|work=Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083133/http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/map-directions/buildings|archivedate=April 7, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates also donated $6&amp;nbsp;million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of [[Stanford University]].

On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen [[Ice Bucket Challenge|dumping a bucket of ice water on his head]].

In November 2017, Gates said he would give $50&amp;nbsp;million to the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital that seeks treatment for [[Alzheimer's disease]].

They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002).

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates stated in regard to his faith:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.&lt;ref name="God" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, Gates said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree with people like [[Richard Dawkins]] that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm&amp;nbsp;– not all&amp;nbsp;– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.&lt;ref name="God"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|date=March 27, 2014|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509035553/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|archivedate=May 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
Blue Prism was founded in 2001 by a group of process automation experts to develop technology that could be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations.&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch" /&gt; Initially their focus was on the white collar back office where they recognised an enormous unfulfilled need for automation. The company was co-founded by Alastair Bathgate and David Moss&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch" /&gt;  to provide a new business-led, more granular and economic approach that today is known as [[Robotic Process Automation]], or RPA. In doing so Blue Prism created a digital workforce. In 2003 Blue Prism’s first commercial product was launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Co-operative Financial Services]] began using Blue Prism software in 2005, to automate manual processes in customer services.&lt;ref name=cw-extends&gt;

===Robotic Process Automation===
[[Robotic Process Automation]] (RPA) is the application of technology that provides organizations with a digital workforce that follows rule-based business processes and interacts with the organisations systems in the same way that existing users currently do.&lt;ref name="LSEBook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Service Automation: Robots and The Future of Work|publisher=London School of Economics|page= |isbn=0956414567 |author=Professors Leslie Willcocks and Mary Lacity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesBPO"&gt;{{Citation|title=Times BPO Supplement|publisher=Raconteur|url=http://np.netpublicator.com/netpublication/n34908574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechChangingBPO"&gt;{{Citation|title=How is technology changing BPO?|publisher=Computer Weekly|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/inside-outsourcing/2012/06/how-is-technology-changing-bpo.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HfSThreat"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing#|archive-date=2015-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChappelERPA"&gt;{{Citation|title=Understanding Enterprise RPA: The Blue Prism Example|publisher=David Chappel &amp; Associates|url=http://www.davidchappell.com/writing/white_papers/Understanding_Enterprise_RPA--The_Blue_Prism_Example_v1.0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSENewApproach"&gt;{{Citation|title=A new approach to automating services|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68135/1/Willcocks_New%20approach_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HFSUnderlings"&gt;{{Citation|title=Welcoming our robotic security underlings|publisher=HFS Research|url=https://www.hfsresearch.com/pointsofview/welcoming-our-robotic-security-underlings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Prism coined the term "robotic automation" in 2012.&lt;ref name=rauto&gt;

==Blue Prism technology==
Blue Prism is built on the [[Microsoft .NET Framework]]. It automates any application and supports any platform ([[mainframe]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], web, etc.) presented in a variety of ways (terminal emulator, thick client, thin client, web browser, Citrix and web services). It has been designed for a multi-environment deployment model (development, test, staging, and production) with both physical and logical access controls. [https://tekslate.com/blue-prism-training/ Blue Prism RPA software] includes a centralized release management interface and process change distribution model providing high levels of visibility and control. Additional control is provided to the business via a centralised model for process development and re-use. The software supports regulatory contexts such as [[PCI-DSS]], [[HIPAA]] and [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|SOX]], with a large number of controls in place to provide the necessary security and governance.

In 2016, Blue Prism received one of the top honors at the AIconics Awards, named as The Best Enterprise Application of AI.&lt;ref name="AIConics"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism: Best Enterprise Application of AI|publisher=aibusiness.org|url=http://aibusiness.org/aiconics-award-winners-blue-prism-best-enterprise-application-of-ai-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIConics2"&gt;{{Citation|title=London 2016 AIConics Winners|publisher=theaiconics.com|url=http://theaiconics.com/2016-winners/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Prism supports only "back-office" unattended robots and does not offer attended "front-office" robots.&lt;ref name="Comparison of two RPA leaders BluePrism and UiPath"&gt;{{Citation|title=Comparison of two RPA leaders BluePrism and UiPath|publisher=blog|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comparison-two-rpa-leaders-blueprism-uipath-jakub-vaňhara/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
The main competitors in the Robotic Process Automation market include UIPath and Automation Anywhere. &lt;ref name="Blue Prism Competitors and Alternatives in Robotic Process Automation"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism Competitors and Alternatives in Robotic Process Automation|publisher=gartner.com|url=https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/robotic-process-automatio-software/vendor/blue-prism/alternatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The independent market research company Forrester Research identified these three companies as leaders both in terms of their market presence as well as the quality of their offering in a 2017 study.
&lt;ref name="forrester-wave-robotic-process-automation"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Forrester Wave™: Robotic Process Automation, Q1 2017|publisher=forrester.com|url=https://www.edgeverve.com/wpcontent/uploads/2017/02/forrester-wave-robotic-process-automation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, industry analyst firm [[Wikibon]] attempted to test Robotic Process Automation platforms noting: "we contacted three RPA vendors — Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and UiPath — to test and validate each of these propositions. Only one vendor, UIPath, responded."&lt;ref name="Assessing RPA Time-to-Value"&gt;{{Citation|title=Assessing RPA Time-to-Value with UiPath|publisher=blog|url=https://wikibon.com/assessing-rpa-time-value-uipath/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The digital workforce==
Blue Prism’s digital workforce is built, managed and owned by the user or customer, spanning operations and technology, adhering to an enterprise-wide robotic operating model. It is code-free&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{Citation|title=What knowledge workers stand to gain from automation|publisher=Harvard Business Review|url=https://hbr.org/2015/06/what-knowledge-workers-stand-to-gain-from-automation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can automate any software in a non-invasive way. The digital workforce can be applied to automate processes in any department where clerical or administrative work is performed across an organization.&lt;ref name="TEDxDavidMoss"&gt;{{Citation|title=White Collar Robots: The Virtual Workforce|publisher=TEDx Talks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SximAg9t4w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body-centred countertransference''' involves a psychotherapist's experiencing the physical state of the patient in a clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Phillips, ''Mental Illness and the Body'' (2006) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as [[Countertransference#Body-centred countertransference|somatic countertransference]], it can incorporate the therapist's gut feelings, as well as changes to breathing, to heart rate and to tension in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Su Fox, ''Relating to clients'' (2008) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various approaches==

[[Dance therapy]] has understandably given much weight to the concept of somatic countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Pallaro, 'Somatic countertransference', in ''Authentic Movement'' vol 2 (2007) Chap 7&lt;/ref&gt; Jungian [[James Hillman]] also emphasised the importance of the therapist using the body as a sounding-board in the clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Pallaro, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-[[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] therapies like [[bioenergetic analysis]] have also stressed the role of the body-centered countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Bloom, ''The Embodied Self'' (2006) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] patients and those suffering from [[Borderline personality disorder]] create more intense embodied countertransferences in their therapists,&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Latawec, ''When the Professional is Personal'' (2008) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; their personalities favouring such non-verbal communication by impact&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; over more verbalised, less somatic interactions.

==Orbach==

[[Susie Orbach]] has written emotively of what she described as "wildcat sensations in my own body...a wildcat countertransference"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, 'Speaking Bodies' in ''Bodies'' (London 2009) 48-76, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of body countertransference. She details her [[Joseph J. Sandler#Role responsiveness and actualization|role responsiveness]] to one patient who evoked in her what she called "an unfamiliar body experience...this purring, reliable and solid body"&lt;ref&gt;Orbach, p. 52-5&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance the fragmented body image of the patient herself.

==The Irish experience==
===In female trauma therapists===
Irish psychologists at NUI Galway and University College Dublin&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2005).  [[Burnout (psychology)|Burnout]] in female counsellor/therapists of the NCS: Studies I, II and III. Papers presented at the 35th Annual conference of the psychological society of Ireland, Derry, Nov 17-20th&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female [[trauma therapists]]. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; have recently begun to measure body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists using their recently developed 'Egan and Carr Body-Centred Countertransference Scale' (2005), a sixteen symptom measure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121271/1/BodycentredCounter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their research was influenced by developments in the psychotherapy world which was beginning to see a therapist's role in a therapeutic dyad as reflexive; that a therapist uses their bodies and 'self' as a tuning fork to understand their client's internal experience and to use this attunement as another way of being empathic with a client's internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M. (2006).  The analyst's body as a tuning fork:  Embodied resonance in countertransference.  Journal of Analytical Psychology, 51, 109-124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wosket, V.  (1999).  The therapeutic use of self.  London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearlman and  Saakvitne's seminal book on [[vicarious traumatization]] and the effect of trauma work on therapists has also been an important directional model for all researchers studying the physical effects of trauma work on a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, L. A., &amp; Saakvitne, K. W. (1995). Trauma and the therapist: Countertransference and vicarious traumatization in psychotherapy with incest survivors.  New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 

High levels of body-centred countertransference have since been found in both Irish female trauma therapists and clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is also known as 'somatic countertransference' or 'embodied countertransference' and it links to how [[mirror neurons]] might lead to 'unconscious automatic somatic countertransference' as a result of [[postural mirroring]] by the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, B. (2006).  Help for the helper: self-care strategies for managing burnout and stress. London:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Loughran (2002) found that 38 therapists out of 40 who had responded to a questionnaire (which was distributed to a sample of 124 therapists) on a therapist's use of body as a medium for transference and countertransference communication reported that they had experienced bodily sensations (nausea or churning stomach, sleepiness, shakiness, heart palpitations, sexual excitement, etc.) while in session with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Loughran, E. H. (2002). The therapists's use of body as a medium for [[transference]] and countertransference communication. Unpublished Doctor of Psychology Dissertation.  Wright Institute:  California.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency of symptom occurrence===

A list of the frequency of occurrence of body-centred countertransference symptoms reported by trauma therapists (Sample A: 35 Female Irish Trauma therapists&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt;) and Irish clinical psychologists (Sample B: 87 Irish Clinical Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;)in the previous six months 'when in-session with a client' is given below in order of frequency:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
#Sleepiness (A; 92%, B; 76%)
#Muscle Tension (A; 83%, B; 79%)
#Yawning (A; 65%, B; 77%)
#Unexpected shift in body (A; 77%, B; 57%)
#Tearfulness (A; 71%, B; 61%)
#Headache (A; 54%, B; 53%)
#Stomach Disturbance (A; 41%, B; 46%)

#Nausea (A; 23%, B; 18%)
#Numbness (A; 29%, B; 15%)
#Sexual Arousal (A; 26%, B; 11%)
#Genital pain (A; 6%, B; 2%)
{{Col-end}}

===Somatization===

A small but significant relationship was found between female trauma therapists' level of body-centred countertransference and number of sick leave days taken, suggesting a possible relationship between uncensored body-centred countertransference and [[somatization]]. This relationship was not however found in [[clinical psychologists]] who were working mainly with a non-trauma population. Therapists have noted the connection between a tendency for some clients to express emotional discomfort by focusing on [[bodily symptoms]] rather than being able to put their emotional distress into words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121822/1/SomatizationDis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that such processes are more common in people who have experienced [[childhood abuse]] and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Pribor, E. F., Yutzy, S. H., Dean, J. T., Wetzel, R. D.  (1993).  [[Briquet's syndrome]], dissociation and abuse.  American Journal of Psychiatry, 150, 1507-1511.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent research which measured female [[genital arousal]] in response to rape cues found that women when listening to rape, consent or violence developed genital arousal more frequently than men. It also might explain the relatively frequent reported experience of sexual arousal amongst Irish female trauma therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Suschinsky, K. D. &amp; Lalumiere, M. L. (2010).  Prepared for anything?  An investigation of female genital arousal in response to rape cues.  Psychological Science OnlineFirst@  10.1177/0956797610394660&lt;/ref&gt;  Further validation of body-centred countertransference in psychologists and therapists is on-going in both [[NUI Galway]] and Trinity College Dublin.

==Cautions==

Therapists have been warned against assuming too automatically that their body-feelings always involve somatic resonance to the client, as opposed to being produced from their own feelings/experiences - the same problem appearing with countertransference generally.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Sanderson, ''Counselling Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse'' (2006) p. 136-7 and p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent a year with Beechams in London, to learn about their products and their marketing worldwide.  1961, he returned to Aiyars Advertising as [[Creative Director]] with the responsibility of all creative work as well as handling the Beecham account. Eventually Aiyars linked with LPE, London as LPE-Aiyars and he was elected to the board.

In March 1972, he left Aiyars Advertising to co-found Chaitra Advertising (now Leo Burnett). In 1983, he left Chaitra to form his own consultancy,  GLIMA. Clarion Advertising appointed him as a Creative Consultant. In 1992, he supported the formation of Nova Advertising Palace with executives from Clarion and  had a long association with this agency as Consultant, Managing Director and shareholder.

In 2001, he retired but continues to do charity work for the church and some NGOs.

The '''capital resources, performance and scalability (CPS) model''' is a set of case analysis frameworks recommended by the Global Alliance for Strategy in collaboration with [[European School of Management and Technology]] and is widely used for assessing the sustainability and competitive ability of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;The INSEAD-Wharton Alliance on Globalizing: Strategies for Building Successful Global Businesses, Robert E. Gunther, Hubert Gatignon, John R. Kimberly, {{ISBN|0-521-83571-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==

The CPS model has several published versions, the latest revision being the one developed by Dr. P. V. Lele in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmt.org/eng/consulting/esmt-competition-analysis/ ESMT Competition Analysis – European School of Management and Technology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frameworks ==
The CPS model, in its most popular version, has five frameworks:
* MAN-CHA
* BOSH value
** SAC score
** ENPT score
** Y.U.K.U. Score
* Differential derivation value (DVD) index
* tri-VIN framework
* Technology polarization at normal purchasing power

== Applications and criticism ==

CPS has been very useful in [[consumer durables]] and [[fast-moving consumer goods]] industries. However, the model fails to be effective in [[manufacturing industry]]. 
In several emerging businesses such as software services and [[business process outsourcing]], the DVD index returns a negative value, making the model redundant.

'''Joaquin "Chino" Roces''' (June 29, 1913 – September 30, 1988) was the founder and owner of [[TV5 Network, Inc.|Associated Broadcasting Company]] and ''[[The Manila Times]]''.

==Early life==
Chino Roces was born on June 29, 1913 to Alejandro "Moy" Roces and Antonia "Nena" Pardo from [[San Miguel, Manila]].  He has seven siblings; Ramon Roces, Alejandro "''Anding””Roces, Jr., Filomena "''Nenita'' " Roces de Verzosa, Isabel "''Bebeng''" Roces, Mercedes Roces, Rafael "''Tuti''" Roces, Antonia "''Chucha''" Roces de Prieto and Marcos "''Taling''" Roces.

He started his publishing career in his father's newspaper chain [[Tribune - La Vanguardia - Taliba|TVT]] (Tribune - La Vanguardia - Taliba) before [[World War II]].  Don Chino later headed the Roces family media empire composed of newspapers The [[Manila Times]], [[Daily Mirror]], [[Sunday Times]], [[Taliba]], [[Women's Magazine Variety]], Radio stations [[DZMT]] / [[DZWJ]] and TV Station [[The 5 Network|ABC Channel 5]]. He also organized media groups, the [[Philippine News Agency]] (PNA), and [[Philippine Press Institute]].

Don Chino was arrested and jailed when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was imposed in 1972, together with [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]], [[Jose Diokno|Pepe Diokno]], [[Lorenzo Tanada]] and other journalists. As soon as he was released, he took to the streets to openly protest the Marcos government. After the assassination of Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino in 1983, he further intensified his protest and during a vigil on [[Mendiola]] Bridge, Don Chino was drenched by water cannons.

On October 15, 1985, Don Chino founded the [[Cory Aquino for President Movement]] (CAPM). It was launched in the National Press Club. He gathered over 1 Million Signatures from all over the nation to draft [[Corazon Aquino]] to run against Marcos.

After the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA revolution]] he returned to publishing, first joining forces with [[Geny Lopez]] in the [[Manila Chronicle]], and then later once more the publisher of the family owned The Manila Times.

On July 22, 1988, President Aquino conferred on him the [[Philippine Legion of Honor|Philippine Legion of Honor Award]] (degree of chief Commander) the highest honor the country can bestow to a civilian.

==Personal life==
He was married to Dona Pacita Carvajal and had four children namely: Joaquin "''Joaqui''" Roces Jr., Arturo Roces, Edgardo "''Eddie''" C. Roces, and Rocio Rosalinda Antonia Roces.

==Death==
He died of lymphatic cancer on September 30, 1988 at the age of 75 in Manila, Philippines.

'''Christian Kern''' (&lt;small&gt;Austrian&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈkrɪstja:n ˈkɛrn}}; born 4 January 1966) was [[Chancellor of Austria]] from 17 May 2016 to 18 December 2017 and [[Chairperson of the Social Democratic Party of Austria|chairman of the]] [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] from 25 June 2016 to 25 September 2018.

A business journalist by profession, the member of Austria's Social Democratic Party served as spokesman of the SPÖ's parliamentary group leader in the mid-1990s, before he became a senior manager in Austria's leading electricity company [[Verbund|Verbund AG]]. In 2010, Kern was appointed [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the state-owned [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (ÖBB), chairing the [[Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies]] (CER) from 2014 onwards. Following the resignation of [[Werner Faymann]] amidst the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|presidential election]], the governing Social Democrats nominated Kern for the office of Chancellor.

Kern was sworn in as Chancellor of Austria on 17 May 2016, vowing to continue the "[[Grand coalition#Austria|Grand coalition]]" with the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] (ÖVP), but promising a "[[New Deal]]" that would bring about more jobs by cutting [[red tape]] while ensuring ordinary workers receive a share of economic prosperity. Kern criticized the Austrian political elite as being power-obsessed and devoid of a meaningful political agenda about the country's future.

== Early life and education ==
Kern was raised in [[Simmering (Vienna)|Simmering]], a working-class district of Vienna, as the son of an electrician and a secretary.&lt;ref name=TheLocal&gt;{{cite news |title=Christian Kern: no more normal service |publisher=[[The Local]] |url=http://www.thelocal.at/20160513/christian-kern-no-more-normal-service |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[journalism]] and [[communication studies|communication]] at the [[University of Vienna]] followed by postgraduate education at the Management Zentrum St. Gallen.

== Career ==
Kern started his career in 1989 as a [[Business journalism|business journalist]] writing for the ''Wirtschaftspressedienst'' and Austrian business magazine ''Option''. In 1991, he became an assistant of the [[Federal Chancellery of Austria|Federal Chancellery]]'s undersecretary of state for civil service, {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Kostelka|de}}. When Kostelka became chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) parliamentary group in 1994, Kern remained his chief of office and spokesman.

In 1997, Kern moved to the largest Austrian electricity supplier, the [[Verbund AG]], where from 1999 he oversaw marketing and sales. In 2007 he was appointed a senior manager overseeing foreign [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]], investments, and the Austrian [[Electric power transmission|high-voltage transmission grid]]&lt;ref name=derstandard/&gt;

===CEO of the Austrian Federal Railways===

In 2010, Kern was selected to take over the post as CEO of the [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (ÖBB).&lt;ref name=TheLocal /&gt; He was appointed chairman of the [[Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies]] (CER) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CER Chairman Christian Kern to become new Austrian Chancellor {{!}} CER:Home|url=http://www.cer.be/media/press-releases/cer-chairman-christian-kern-become-new-austrian-chancellor|publisher=[[Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies]]|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kern has been a board member of [[FK Austria Wien]] since 2009.

In 2012, ÖBB celebrated the 175th anniversary of the ''[[North railway (Austria)|Nordbahn]]'', the earliest predecessor company marking the start of [[rail transport in Austria]]. Kern inaugurated an exhibition on the company's complicity with the [[Third Reich]], named "The Suppressed Years – Railway and National Socialism in Austria 1938–1945". He referred to that period as "the darkest part of our company's history," adding that "We are obliged to commemorate and with this documentation we would like to further contribute to coming to terms with the past. No matter how incredible these events may seem to us today, we need to clearly accept these times as part of our ÖBB history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title="Repressed Years – the Austrian Railways and National Socialism between 1938 and 1945" |publisher=Agentur Milli Segal |url=http://www.millisegal.at/obb/index.php/presse/presse-engl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611101003/http://www.millisegal.at/obb/index.php/presse/presse-engl |archive-date=11 June 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition later went on tour and was presented at the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Espace Léopold|parliamentary building in Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Suppressed Years Railway and National Socialism in Austria 1938 – 1945 |publisher=[[Austrian Federal Railways|ÖBB]] |url=http://konzern.oebb.at/de/verdraengtejahre/Infoflyer_Exhibition_The_Suppressed_Years.pdf |year=2014 |accessdate=21 May 2016 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his extraordinary engagement accounting for the company's past, in June 2013 the [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien|Vienna Israelite Community]] awarded Kern the [[Marietta and Friedrich Torberg Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Torberg-Medaille für Christian Kern |publisher=ÖBB |url=http://konzern.oebb.at/de/verdraengtejahre/Torberg-Medaille/index.jsp |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512190658/http://konzern.oebb.at/de/verdraengtejahre/Torberg-Medaille/index.jsp |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the 2015 [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]], Kern organized the transport of hundred thousands of migrants coming from the "[[Balkan route]]" across the country. He is considered a supporter of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s migration policy.&lt;ref name=FT0517&gt;{{cite news |author=Ralph Atkins |title=New Austrian leader warns mainstream parties may ‘disappear’ |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5333d224-1c33-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122.html |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Austrian Trade Union Federation|Austrian trade unionist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Roman Hebenstreit|de}}, who is also chairman of the ÖBB's [[works council]] described Kern in 2016 as "the first ÖBB boss to really stand by his workers."&lt;ref name=TheLocal /&gt;

{{see also|Kern government}}
Since 2014, Kern was repeatedly named as one of the possible successors for [[Werner Faymann]]'s Chancellor post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Rosemarie Schwaiger |title=ÖBB-Chef Christian Kern hat Chancen, Nachfolger von Kanzler Faymann zu werden |magazine=[[Profil (magazine)|profil]]|url=http://www.profil.at/oesterreich/oebb-chef-christian-kern-chancen-nachfolger-kanzler-faymann-377137 |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Austrian news magazine ''[[Profil (magazine)|profil]]'' referred to him as the "Chancellor of hearts" and the Federal Railways he led as "the only state institution that flawlessly worked amidst the refugee crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Eva Linsinger |title=Christian Kern: Kanzler der Herzen |magazine=[[Profil (magazine)|profil]] |url=http://www.profil.at/oesterreich/christian-kern-kanzler-der-herzen-5858210 |date=16 September 2015 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Half a year later, when on 9 May 2016 Chancellor Faymann resigned from all his posts, Kern was again named one of the candidates alongside Time Warner manager [[Gerhard Zeiler]] and former Siemens manager {{Interlanguage link multi|Brigitte Ederer|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Eric Frey]] |title=Kanzlernachfolge: Lieber Zeiler als Kern |newspaper=[[Der Standard]] |url=http://derstandard.at/2000036615981/Kanzlernachfolge-Lieber-Zeiler-als-Kern |date=11 May 2016 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a 12 May party session, the Social Democrats agreed on nominating Kern for the country's highest executive office. He was announced to be appointed the new Chancellor by 17 May, and to be nominated as party chairman at the upcoming party congress on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPÖ legt sich offenbar fest |publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] |url=http://orf.at/stories/2339106/ |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=12 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cynthia Kroet |title=Christian Kern named as new Austrian Chancellor |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/christian-kern-named-as-new-austrian-chancellor/ |work=[[Politico]] |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kern was sworn into office on 17 May by outgoing President [[Heinz Fischer]].

At his first press conference, Kern called for a change in the style of cooperation within the coalition government, warning the two parties risked otherwise "disappearing from the screen". He reaffirmed his position that in the refugee crisis, Austria was right not to "leave women and children standing in the rain," while ensuring order and security.&lt;ref name=FT0517 /&gt;

In spite of his credentials as a manager, Kern's nomination of members of the party's left wing, {{Interlanguage link multi|Sonja Wehsely|de}} and [[Jörg Leichtfried]] as new ministers was interpreted as a turn towards the party's left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Oliver Pink |title=Christian Kern: Ein Pragmatiker mit Linksdrall |newspaper=[[Die Presse]] |url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/4987560/Christian-Kern_Ein-Pragmatiker-mit-Linksdrall |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of Wehsely, who is known for her staunch pro-asylum course during the [[European migrant crisis]], was however considered all too controversial, with political analyst Thomas Hofer referring to it as a declaration of war (''"kleine Kampfansage"'') against conservative coalition partner [[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wehsely als Ministerin wäre "Kampfansage" |publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] |url=http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2774116/ |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wehsely ultimately declined and decided she would stay city councillor in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wehsely sagt Kern ab |newspaper=[[Österreich (newspaper)|Österreich]] |url=http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/politik/Wehsely-sagt-Kern-ab/235879569 |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=21 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hofer however expects Kern to follow the centrist examples of German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] or Britain's [[Tony Blair]], combining pro-business policies with a social conscience.&lt;ref name=TheLocal /&gt;

Kern appointed [[Muna Duzdar]], a lawyer and chairwoman of the Palestininian-Austrian Society, as state secretary in the Chancellery, where she will be the first Muslim to hold a government post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muna Duzdar: Faymann-Kritikerin sitzt nun im Kanzleramt |newspaper=[[Die Presse]] |url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/4990042/Duzdar_FaymannKritikerin-sitzt-nun-im-Kanzleramt |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Duzdar, who has previously come out as a sharp critic of Israel, will now be in charge of Jewish community affairs, irritated the Jewish community. According to ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' author Samuel Laster, Duzdar's appointment may however be considered a "signal of openness" for Kern who is "widely regarded as a friend of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Samuel Laster |title=Austria’s election, Jews and Israel |newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Austrias-election-Jews-and-Israel-454925 |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after taking office, Kern's government implemented several law-and-order measures, including a ban on Muslim face-covering veils and a tightening of immigration rules.&lt;ref&gt;Shadia Nasralla and Francois Murphy (April 6, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-politics-alliance-idUSKBN1781P9 Austrian Social Democrats move toward ending ban on far-right alliances] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Kern criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against [[Russia]] that target EU–Russia energy projects, including [[Nord Stream|Nord Stream 2]] gas pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-and-austria-warn-u-s-over-expanded-russia-sanctions/ Germany and Austria warn US over expanded Russia sanctions]". ''[[Politico]]''.

===Campaign for the 2019 European elections===
In September 2018, Kern announced that he would resign as national party leader and instead run as top candidate for the Austrian Social Democrats in the [[European Parliament election, 2019|European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirsti Knolle (September 18, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-politics-opposition/austrian-center-left-ex-chancellor-kern-to-run-for-european-parliament-idUSKCN1LY2YA Austrian center-left ex-chancellor Kern to run for European Parliament] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Kern married Karin Wessely, with whom he has three sons.

'''Ioan-Codruţ Şereş''' (born 2 August 1969) is a [[Romania]]n engineer and politician. A member of the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC), he was a member of the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] for [[Maramureş County]] from 2004 to 2008. In the [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu]] cabinet, he was [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Minister of Economy and Commerce]] from 2004 to 2006.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Zalău]], and from 1988 to 1993 attended the [[Technical Military Academy of Bucharest]], becoming a mechanical engineer and graduating first in his class. In 1999 he earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] through a programme organised by the [[University of Ottawa]], [[HEC Montréal]] and the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]]. From 1993 to 1999 he worked at the [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defence Ministry]], being assigned to the procurement department from 1996. From 1999 to 2004 he held management positions at three different firms, including as assistant director of [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]] (1999-2000) and as director of business development and strategy at [[Grivco]] (2001-2003), both owned by [[Dan Voiculescu]], leader of the PC.&lt;ref name="cvministru"&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060525065056/http://www.gov.ro/guvernul/afis-ministru.php?ordcabinet=11 Curriculum vitae] at the Romanian Government site; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Şereş became president of Antena 1 and of [[Intact Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/media/codrut-seres-presedintele-antena-1-si-intact-production-191316.html "Codruţ Sereş, preşedintele Antena 1 şi Intact Production" ("Codruţ Sereş, President of Antena 1 and Intact Production")], ''România liberă'', 23 June 2010; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Şereş joined the PUR (PC from 2005). In 2002, he became head of its department devoted to financing infrastructure projects for local PUR officeholders, and helped finance ten projects. In 2003 he became secretary general of the party, rising to vice president the following year, when he was also [[Romanian legislative election, 2004|elected]] senator.&lt;ref name="cvministru"/&gt; In the Senate, he sat on the following committees: budget, finance, banking and capital markets (2006-2008); equal opportunity (2006); and privatisation and administering state assets (2004-2006). He was also vice president of the body during one session.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=115&amp;cam=1&amp;leg=2004 Parliamentary profile]; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he served as Economy Minister from December 2004 to December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documentare.rompres.ro/guverne.php?i=12 Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu Government]; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; resigning when the PC withdrew its support from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.dailybusiness.ro/stiri-finante-banci/pc-iese-de-la-guvernare-ministrul-economiei-demisioneaza-508 "PC iese de la guvernare, ministrul Economiei demisionează" ("PC Leaves Government, Economy Minister Resigns")], dailybusiness.ro, 3 December 2006; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, prosecutors from the [[Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism]] (DIICOT) opened an investigation into Şereş dealing with his relationship to the [[Bulgaria]]n consultant Stamen Stanchev. They charged he had granted insider information or otherwise used his position to help Stanchev facilitate the privatisation of [[Electrica]] South Muntenia, of the Romanian government's 8% holding in [[Petrom]], and of [[Romexterra Bank]], as well as the planned privatisation of the [[Turceni Energy Complex]], allegations that he denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristian Stănescu, Georgeta Ghidovăţ, Simona Popa, Claudiu Târziu, [http://old.cotidianul.ro/dosarul_spionaj_in_ministere_tradatorul_ii_platea_intretinerea_spionului-18593.html "Dosarul Spionaj în ministere: 'Trădătorul' îi plătea întreţinerea 'spionului'" ("Espionage in Ministries Dossier: 'The Traitor' Paid Housing for 'The Spy'")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726051523/http://old.cotidianul.ro/dosarul_spionaj_in_ministere_tradatorul_ii_platea_intretinerea_spionului-18593.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, ''Cotidianul'', 26 November 2006; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a formal criminal case was opened against Şereş, who was indicted for treason and organised crime; five other persons are involved in the case, including Şereş' former ministerial colleague [[Zsolt Nagy (politician)|Zsolt Nagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/social/codrut-seres-si-zsolt-nagy-deferiti-justitiei-in-dosarul-privatizarilor-4112767 "Codruţ Şereş şi Zsolt Nagy, deferiţi justiţiei în dosarul privatizărilor" ("Codruţ Şereş and Zsolt Nagy, Handed over to the Justice System in the Privatisations Dossier")], Mediafax, 30 March 2009; accessed August 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he was convicted of the charges and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihaela Cojocariu, [http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/dosarul-tradare-fostii-ministrii-codrut-seres-zsolt-nagy-isi-afla-marti-sentinta-1_529cdd29c7b855ff5666d07c/index.html "Fostul ministru Codruţ Sereş, condamnat la 6 ani de închisoare în dosarul în care este acuzat de trădare" ("Former Minister Codruţ Sereş, Sentenced to 6 Years' Imprisonment in the Case in Which He Is Accused of Treason")], ''Adevărul'', 3 December 2013; accessed December 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, upon the exhaustion of his appeals, he was given a sentence of four years and eight months and incarcerated.

In 1995, Şereş married Adina Zugravu, with whom he had a daughter in 1996 and whom he divorced in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">{{about|a history of one corporation|the history of all corporations|History of companies}}
A '''corporate history''' is a [[chronological]] account of a [[business]] or other co-operative organization. Usually it is produced in written format but it can also be done in audio or [[audiovisual]]ly. Thousands of companies across the industrialized world have put their stories to paper, albeit in their own unique ways – from relatively benign, albeit colorful chronicles, usually written for the private [[archive]]s of founding families, to titles with well-defined corporate applications. Corporate histories in the [[United States]] have been particularly prolific, those in the [[UK]] less so.

== History ==
In the late 19th century, corporate histories were initially written by [[Victorian era]] businessmen, either the founder of a company himself, members of the surviving family owners or long-serving [[employee]]s. Rather than being [[wiktionary:sequential|sequential]] histories, as is now done, many of them were [[diary]]-type personal recollections or short, superficial [[public relations]] exercises.  One of the earliest corporate histories, that of a publishing company in the UK called the Catnach Press, was done in 1886. A notable early US corporate history, published in 1902, was that of [[Standard Oil]].

Academic involvement probably started in 1924 when [[George Unwin]] and co-author George Taylor published a detailed history, ''Samuel Oldknow and the Arkwrights: The Industrial Revolution at Stockport and Marple''. It was published by the Manchester University Press. 

Between the [[World War]]s, the majority of business histories, and especially in the UK, were house histories, consisting mainly of reminiscences and anecdotes. Only a tiny handful of serious work existed using business records which had found their way into museums, county record offices or the private possession of collectors.  Corporate histories were typically unplanned. Relevant records were often discovered by chance and deemed interesting enough to turn into historical narratives which were funded either by the family descendants of the long-dead businessmen in question or, less frequently, the author in association with a publisher. They had one thing in common - they were generally records of companies that had died or otherwise dropped out of sight. One exception occurred In 1938, when the [[Bank of England]] commissioned a two-volume 250-year anniversary history. Written by [[J. H. Clapham]], professor of economic history at Cambridge, it took six years to produce. It was a deliberately celebratory vehicle for this famous British institution. 

Modern corporate history took a large conceptual step in 1947 when the then chairman of [[Unilever]], Geoffrey Heyworth (later [[Geoffrey Heyworth, 1st Baron Heyworth|Lord Heyworth]]) approached [[G. N. Clark]], who had led the national campaign against the destruction of business records, for his advice on writing the history Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch manufacturing company. Clark, who had just become a professor of modern history at Oxford, suggested as author a younger colleague, [[Charles Wilson (historian)|Charles Wilson]]. The result was a classic, two-volume work that transformed the writing of business history in the UK from a public relations exercise into a reputable branch of scholarship. Wilson's work, about one of western Europe's most important companies, made him the father of modern corporate histories in the UK.

== Current practices ==

The majority of books written today are PR projects expressly designed to celebrate important anniversaries. There are also fewer: More histories of [[United Kingdom|British]] companies were being produced in the last year of the 19th century than were published in the last year of the 20th century.

Many more corporate histories are used in the education system of the US than in the UK and other countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Many companies see their corporate histories as effective purveyors of long-term [[organizational memory]] and especially suitable for transmitting strategy. As such it can provide an efficient induction/educational tool for transient employees in the highly [[labour market flexibility|flexible labor market]]. Corporate historians collect and catalog materials and disseminate information for internal use. "When people think of an archives, they tend to think of the [[National Archives]] in Washington," Dave Smith, the manager of [[Walt Disney Co.]]'s multimillion-piece collection of artifacts, said in 2003. "But a lot of organizations maintain them, including businesses."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Markey, [http://www.usaweekend.com/03_issues/031123/031123historians.html "The incredible value of everyday things: From soda to soap flakes, even mundane objects have blue-chip appeal"], ''USA Today'' (weekend), 23 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the largest corporate archive ever assembled is that of  [[AT&amp;T]], which began gathering historical material in 1921. As of 1999, its collection was overseen by a full-time staff of 11 people, and included {{convert|50000|ft|m}} of documents; 800,000 still photos; 12,000 various gadgets and artifacts, some of them dating back to Alexander Graham Bell; and 16,000 films and videos about AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;David Stamps, [http://www.allbusiness.com/services/educational-services/4276767-1.html "The Next Wave of the Future: History"], ''Training'' magazine, 1 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

He served his apprenticeship in [[Dufftown]]&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt; in [[Banffshire]] then founded a successful retail watchmaking and jewellery business in [[Liverpool]], England in 1871 after moving there age 22,&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt; with shops in most large cities in Great Britain, aided by the slogan "Who watches the Police?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16887586 ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 12 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; after winning a tender to supply watches for the Liverpool Police. Advertising in Australian newspapers brought so much business he decided to move there and emigrated in 1886. He founded the business of Stewart Dawson and Co. in [[Sydney]] and soon had branches in [[Melbourne]], and [[Auckland]] and [[Dunedin]] in [[New Zealand]] and [[Regent Street]] in London. After making the company a [[limited liability company]] in 1907, Dawson sold the company in 1931 to RHO Hills&lt;ref name="Carters"/&gt; [[department store]] (now [[House of Fraser]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c2682 HOUSE OF FRASER Archive :: Company: RHO Hills Ltd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting company operated until 'around 1935'.&lt;ref name="Carters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SilCltn"&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/electroplatesilverD.html English electroplate silver: marks and hallmarks of British silver plate: Da-Dh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He dealt extensively in inner-city real-estate, including some of the most significant transactions in Australian history. Anticipating the [[Great Depression]], he converted much of his property (valued around  £1,000,000) from ownership to rental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4467152 obituary ''The Argus'' 8 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; One significant property he owned was half of the [[Strand Arcade]] ([[Pitt Street]] end). This peculiar arrangement was to have far-reaching consequences as a result of piecemeal development and inconsistent maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/strand_arcade Strand Arcade&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was noted for his contribution to the [[First World War|war]] effort, and served on many committees.

He founded the Ambassadors Restaurant in 1923, long one of the most fashionable in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21979177 ''Brisbane Courier'' 8 August 1932]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- His heirs included his wife Harriet Stewart Dawson, sons Percy Stewart Dawson (d. 1947), Norman Stewart Dawson (appointed Major, won VC, killed in car crash 1940) and Stuart Stewart Dawson, daughters Lila Arnold, Vanna Jerrard (not Gerrard) and Bertha Verral (not Verrai) and grand-daughter Joyce Verral.

More details at http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16969689 Grandson David Stewart Dawson jr (son of Stuart) was subject of many news items inappropriate for Wikipedia --&gt;
He had a head office, 'The Treasure House' (built 1907) in [[Hatton Garden]], London and homes in [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] and [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach, Sydney]], a villa in [[Monte Carlo]] and a three-storey country mansion, "Bon Accord" in [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]] in the [[Greater Blue Mountains Area|Blue Mountains]], close to [[Norman Lindsay]]'s home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.carters.com.au/index.cfm/index/5116-stewart-dawson-and-co-silver-and-precious-objects/ |title= Stewart Dawson and Co: Silver and precious objects |publisher= Carters Antiques  = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On his death the Monte Carlo villa went to his widow, Harriet Stewart Dawson (née McNab) (1864–1945) who married Prince Michal Radziwill, "Ordynat" (entailed estate holder) of the Palace and estate of Antonin in Ostrow County, Poland (1870–1955) in 1938.&lt;ref&gt; Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia Probate Packet for the Estate of the late Princess Radziwill &lt;/ref&gt; "Bon Accord" was kept as a guest house by his heirs, managed by [[Hugh D.

'''Donald Alvin Coleman''' (born January 11, 1952) is an American entrepreneur, advertising executive and a pioneer in the growing field of multicultural advertising. Coleman is the founder, chairman and CEO of [[GlobalHue]], the largest multicultural advertising agency in the United States, working with blue chip brands and organizations to communicate with African-American, Asian and Hispanic consumers.  He is also a former [[American football]] player, having played [[college football]] at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1971 to 1973 and professional football for the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[New York Jets]] from 1974 to 1978.

==Early years==
Coleman was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 1952,&lt;ref name=PFR/&gt; and grew up in that city's [[Old West End District (Toledo, Ohio)|Old West End]] neighborhood.  His mother, Dorothy Coleman, worked for the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], and his father, Augustus Coleman, worked as a [[skycap]] for [[United Airlines]] and as a janitor at a library.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the suggestion of teachers at his public school, who told his parents that Coleman was not sufficiently challenged, he transferred to [[St. John's Jesuit High School and Academy]].  He attended St. John's from 1966 to 1970 where he excelled in academics and sports.  Coleman was an All-City and All-State running back for St. John's and was recruited by multiple colleges to play football. He later recalled: "When it came time to select a university, I had about 20 coaches visiting the house, talking up their programs. I chose the University of Michigan. I received a full scholarship."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author=Don Coleman|title=Boss: Lessons From the Gridiron|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 17, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/jobs/18boss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Michigan==
Coleman enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1970 on a football scholarship. He played [[college football]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] under head coach [[Bo Schembechler]] from 1971 to 1973.  Coleman began the 1971 season as a backup [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], but Schembechler moved him to [[defensive end]] in late September 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Shifts Coleman To End|newspaper=The Blade, Toledo, Ohio|date=September 29, 1971|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nMlOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3AEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7556,4727795&amp;dq=don-coleman+michigan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U-M's Grambau Making Comeback|newspaper=The Owosso Argus-Press|date=September 29, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4aoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=883,2976106&amp;dq=don-coleman+michigan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman played at defensive end from 1972 to 1973 and helped the Wolverines tie for first place in the [[Big Ten Conference]] both years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1972fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1973 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1973fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan All-time Rosters Search Page |publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library |url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200732/http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}(Enter "Coleman" for last name and "Donald" for first name on the search page, and press enter)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although still listed as a defensive end, Schembechler described Coleman's role as follows in 1973: "In our defense we use a flop-end.  So Coleman is actually a pro linebacker.  He has to cover the pass as part of his responsibility today more so than normal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Cute' defenders make the big play|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=September 25, 1973|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ORZKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tx4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3269,1342308&amp;dq=don-coleman+michigan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman had 51 tackles and 52 assists for the Wolverines.&lt;ref name=Stat&gt;{{cite web |title=Michigan Football Statistic Archive Query Page |publisher=University of Michigan |url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/footstart.php |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112175906/http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/footstart.php |archivedate=November 12, 2007 |df= }}(To access Coleman's record, enter "Don" as his first and "Coleman" as his last name in the main search page.

==Professional football==
Coleman was drafted by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the 16th round (398th overall pick) of the [[1974 NFL Draft]].  He played two seasons for the Saints in 1974 and 1975, appearing in 27 NFL games.&lt;ref name=PFR&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Coleman|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ColeDo20.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman was cut by the Saints in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Scoreboard|newspaper=Daily Sentinel|date=August 5, 1976|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w9JDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qq8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3541,1958810&amp;dq=don-coleman+orleans&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He signed as a free agent with the [[New York Jets]] shortly after being released by the Saints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman Is Signed|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 21, 1976|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/08/21/140224372.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he missed the entire [[1976 NFL season]] with a left knee injury.

==Advertising career==
While recovering from football injuries, Coleman obtained an [[M.B.A.]] degree in marketing from [[Hofstra University]] in New York in 1976.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;  In 1978, he was hired as an assistant account executive at the [[Campbell-Ewald]] advertising agency in Detroit. He later recalled: "I was the only black person in account management in the office. It was boring work, but I was speedy and accurate, persevered and became a full account executive."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1983, he became senior vice president and management supervisor on the [[Chevrolet]] account.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Coleman next began a career in advertising directed to minority communities.  He was hired in 1983 as a senior vice president and account director for Burrell Advertising, a Chicago firm specializing in advertising to minorities.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 1988, he formed Don Coleman Associates, which became Don Coleman Advertising in 1991.  He sold a minority interest in the company and bought two additional agencies, one focused on the Asian-American market (Innovasia Communications) and one focused on the Hispanic market (Montemayor y Asociados).  He combined the companies into [[GlobalHue]], specializing in a culture based approach to marketing.   He is the chairman and chief executive of GlobalHue.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 2009, GlobalHue's capitalized billings were $833.7 million. The company has approximately 300 employees in [[Southfield, Michigan]] and New York City.  Its clients include Subway, the United States Navy, U.S. Census 2010, Verizon Wireless, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Walmart and Chrysler Group.&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Coleman|publisher=The History Makers|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=1008&amp;category=Businessmakers&amp;occupation=Advertising%20Executive&amp;name=Don%20Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, GlobalHue was named "Multicultural Advertising Agency of the Decade" by ''[[Adweek|Advertising Week magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MULTICULTURAL AGENCY OF THE DECADE: GlobalHue|publisher=Advertising Week|url=http://www.bestofthe2000s.com/multicultural-agency-of-the-decade.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316022032/http://www.bestofthe2000s.com/multicultural-agency-of-the-decade.html|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike Chapman|title=Q&amp;A: GlobalHue's Don Coleman|publisher=Advertising Week|date=January 14, 2010|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/qa-globalhues-don-coleman-101319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/business/business-news/2009/12/15/globalhue-named-multicultural-agency-of-the-decade|title=Making Cultural Connections|publisher=Black Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine named GlobalHue the BE 100 Advertising Agency of the Year, an honor that GlobalHue also received in 1998 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/small-business/2010/05/19/watch-2010-be100s-award-winners |title=WATCH: 2010 BE 100s Award Winner|publisher=Black Enterprise|date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman's daughter, Kelli Coleman, has also worked for GlobalHue since 2002 and is the vice president for business development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Twenty in the Twenties: Kelli Coleman, 23|publisher=Crain's Detroit|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/dcce?Site=CD&amp;Date=20080331&amp;Module=10&amp;Kategori=twenties&amp;Class=101&amp;Type=2008Winners&amp;ID=1018065&amp;Selected=5&amp;nomdcache=1&amp;nocache=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Coleman launched The Coleman Entrepreneurial Scholarship (CES), which strives to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice among college students of ethnic backgrounds, particularly African-American and Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackenterprise.com/b-e-100s-rename-test/be100s-news/2009/02/03/advertising-mogul-creates-scholarship-to-promote-entrepreneurialism/&lt;/ref&gt;  CES awards $50,000 in scholarships annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targetmarketnews.com/storyid02040903.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Markham''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] currently being developed. It is located within Markham Centre and [[Unionville, Ontario|Unionville]] and is proposed to serve as the heart of Markham. &lt;!-- This may be a crystal ball. --&gt;Businesses in the district are expected to employ as many as 16,000 individuals,&lt;ref name=GCL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guelphcivicleague.ca/page.php?p=55|title=Downtown Markham Makeover|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=Guelph Civic League}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheStar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/245107|title=Digging for an elusive dream|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=The Toronto Star | work=The Star | date=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may house as many as 10,000 residents.&lt;ref name=glance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownmarkham.ca/pdfs/FS-At%20a%20Glance.pdf|title=Downtown Markham Facts at a glance|date=March 2006|accessdate=2007-10-12|author=Remington Group, and the Town of Markham|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005120132/http://www.downtownmarkham.ca/pdfs/FS-At%20a%20Glance.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development will have a high density of residential, retail, commercial and mixed-use structures. The community is being developed, built and wholly financed by The [[Remington Group Inc]].

==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Downtown Markham is a planned urban hub and the largest planned mixed-use development in Canada. The development spans 243 acres and is situated in one of the fastest growing regions in the province. It will be the commercial &amp; financial district within Unionville at the center of the city of Markham, and will consist of a mix of residential, office and retail uses.

Two million square feet of retail space will include international retailers, local shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Downtown Markham will also offer more than 3.4 million square feet of office space in a commercial district adjacent to [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]].

The vibrant urban centre is being designed and developed following sustainable guidelines, including energy efficient power sources and LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified residential and commercial projects. Aside from allowing greater density, the development also enjoys 72 acres of natural and landscaped green space, improved walkability and easy access to public transit, including [[Viva Rapid Transit]] and [[GO Transit]].

Downtown Markham refers to an area south of [[Uptown Markham, Ontario|Uptown Markham]] / [[York Regional Road 7|Highway 7]], west of [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]] / [[Main Street Unionville]], east of [[York Regional Road 65|Warden Avenue]], and north of [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407 ETR]].

On the other hand, Markham Centre or Unionville refers to a broader area. Markham Centre is bounded north to Apple Creek Boulevard / [[Carlton Road]], east to [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], west to Rodick Road, and south to [[York Regional Road 71|14th Avenue]].

==History==
[[File:Down town markham 17.41.41.jpg|thumb|right|Verclaire Gate South in May 2016.]]
[[File:Down town markham 17.39.26.jpg|thumb|right|The Cineplex new theatre just built.]]
[[File:DowntownMarkhamConstruction.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Downtown Markham construction site in 2009.]]
The current City of Markham was created in 1971 when the former town was expanded by amalgamation with [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]] and [[Unionville, Ontario|Unionville]]. With its original historic downtown, [[Markham Village, Ontario|Markham Village]], being small and situated tn the far eastern part of the amalgamated municipality, the city decided a larger, more centrally-located downtown was needed.

The area south of Unionville to the east of Warden Avenue was frozen for development by the province during the planning and construction of express toll road Highway 407. In 1992, a plan was approved to develop the area with higher commercial density.

The Town of Markham has approved the plan, according to Markham's former mayor, [[Donald Cousens]].&lt;ref name=GCL /&gt; The community situated in Unionville was planned to be self-sustained and [[Transit-oriented development|transit-oriented]] based on [[smart growth]] development. Construction began in 2005, when [[Enterprise Drive]] was completed.

[[Aviva Canada]] built its second Canadian headquarters on Birchmount Road and a new [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex]] theatre opened on April 4, 2015. It provides a bigger space to include a few VIP theatres, a new gaming corner and much higher capacity than the old Cineplex theatre at [[First Markham Place]].

The [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel and the York condo is now under construction on the corner of Enterprise Drive and Birchmount Road. It is scheduled to be finished by the end of 2018.

==Development==
Downtown Markham located in the City of Markham's Unionville Village is using a development strategy named [[smart growth]]. The community will try to limit urban sprawl by creating a denser urban centre. The urban centre is planned to be a transit-oriented community, with everything close by and fully transit dependent.&lt;ref name=TheStar /&gt; In addition, the community was also planned to be environmentally sustainable as well.

The community was planned by the City of Markham, in co-operation with The Remington Group. The Remington Group is mainly in charge of constructing most of the structures across this new community.

According to the plan approved by the city council, the community will contain residential condos and townhouses, commercial, and retail buildings.&lt;ref name=GCL /&gt; Some of these structures have already begun construction. Updates as to what is built is underway.

Downtown Markham in Unionville has been nominated as the country's largest mixed-used development, as well as North America's largest LEED (leadership-in-energy-and-environmental-design) registered development.&lt;ref name=100k&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownmarkham.ca/pdfs/100K%20ClubFINAL_FINAL_Feb28,2008.pdf|title=New York.

==Transportation==
[[File:WardenVIVA3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[VivaNext#Completed rapidway stations|Warden Vivastation]]]]
The primary modes of transportation in Downtown Markham are: [[List of York Regional Roads|Regional Roads]], [[List of municipal roads in Markham, Ontario|municipal roads]], [[Ontario Highway 407|a toll highway]], [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|bus rapid transit]], and [[GO Transit|GO Trains]].&lt;ref name=TheStar /&gt;

===York Regional Roads===
The community is bounded with three York Regional Roads, which are numbered as [[York Regional Road 3|3]] (Kennedy Road), [[York Regional Road 7|7]] (Highway 7), and [[York Regional Road 65|65]] (Warden Avenue).

===Toll Highway===
[[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] serves the community with exits on Warden Avenue and Kennedy Road.  The highway leads east to [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] and west to [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]].

===Bus Rapid Transit===
The community is served by the [[VivaNext#Completed rapidway stations|Warden]], Enterprise and [[Unionville GO Station|Unionville]] stops on the [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|VIVA]] bus rapid transit system. Warden and Enterprise are served by three lines: [[Viva Purple]], [[Viva Green]], and [[Viva Pink]], while Unionville Station is only served by Viva Pink. As of 2011, [[Viva Purple]] is the only line with all-day service, the other lines operate only during rush hour. It is scheduled that when Downtown Markham is fully functional and occupied, [[Viva Green]] will return to full service. The community is anticipated to be highly dependent on these transit routes, as part of the planned smart growth.

Viva Purple connects the locale to [[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]] and [[York University]]; Viva Green connects the locale to [[Don Mills (TTC)|Don Mills Station]] and [[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]]; Viva Pink connects the locale to [[North York, Ontario|North York City Centre]].

Other bus routes that serve the area include:
* TTC 68 Warden
* YRT 8 Kennedy
* YRT 1 Highway 7

===GO Transit===
[[GO Transit]] operates [[Unionville GO Station]] on the [[Stouffville line]] during peak commuter traffic. The GO train line connects the Downtown Markham to [[Whitchurch-Stouffville|Stouffville]] and [[Toronto|Downtown Toronto]].

==Environmental sustainability==
The community reserves {{convert|72|acre|m2}} as a natural reserve, which includes an ecologically sensitive area, [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]].

==Facilities==

There are two recreational facilities in Downtown Markham:

* [[Markham Pan Am Centre]] was built for [[2015 Pan American Games]] and became a city-owned facility after completion of the games in September 2015
* [[Markham YMCA Rudy Bratty Centre]] was completed in 2006 and upgraded in 2008; featuring two pools and other fitness facilities for YMCA members

==Education==

[[York University]]/[[Seneca College]] [[Markham Campus (York University)|Markham Campus]] site will be built next to the Markham Pan Am Centre.

'''Fusion GPS''' is a commercial research and strategic intelligence firm based in Washington, D.C. The company conducts open-source investigations and provides research and strategic advice for businesses, law firms and investors, as well as for political inquiries, such as [[opposition research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fusion GPS – Investigative reporting approach to investment research |url=http://www.integrity-research.com/fusion-gps-investivative-reporting-approach-to-investment-research/|website=Integrity Research|access-date=January 17, 2017|date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "GPS" initialism is derived from "Global research, Political analysis, Strategic insight".&lt;ref name=GPS&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714001553/http://www.fusiongps.com/about.html "About Fusion", archived version of Fusion GPS web site from July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was co-founded in 2011 by [[Glenn R. Simpson]], a former investigative reporter and journalist for ''[[Roll Call]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''; Peter Fritsch, former ''Wall Street Journal'' senior editor; and former ''Wall Street Journal'' journalist Thomas Catan.&lt;ref name="McB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Jessica|title=Fusion GPS: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/07/fusion-gps-dossier-russia-trump-jr-christopher-steele-democrat-planned-parenthood-glenn-simpson-peter-fritsch-natalia-veselnitskaya-grassley-hearing/|website=Heavy.com|accessdate=July 22, 2016|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Opposition research on Mitt Romney===
Fusion GPS was hired by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in 2012 to do opposition research on U.S. presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name="McB"/&gt; In February 2012, the magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' published an article on [[Frank L. VanderSloot|Frank VanderSloot]] and his company Melaleuca, who combined had given $1 million to a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney. After the article was published, an intern at Fusion GPS did a search of Idaho court records on VanderSloot by phone and fax. In January 2013, VanderSloot sued ''Mother Jones'' for defamation in the February 2012 article. In the course of the litigation, VanderSloot deposed Fusion GPS founder Simpson on the "theory that Mother Jones conspired with Obama's team to defame VanderSloot".&lt;ref name="MoJo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeffery|first1=Clara|last2=Bauerlein|first2=Monika|title=We Were Sued by a Billionaire Political Donor.

===Planned Parenthood===
In August 2015, [[Planned Parenthood]] retained Fusion GPS to defensively investigate the veracity of a series of undercover videos released by [[anti-abortion]] activists [[David Daleiden]] and Sandra Merritt from [[The Center for Medical Progress]] that they claim showed Planned Parenthood officials agreeing to sell fetal tissues obtained through abortions to medical researchers. Fusion GPS hired video and transcription experts to analyze the videos and summarized the findings in a forensic report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hemingway|first1=Mark|title=Politico &amp; NYT Fail to Mention Report Exonerating Planned Parenthood Produced By Democratic Opposition Research Firm|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/politico-nyt-fail-to-mention-report-exonerating-planned-parenthood-produced-by-democratic-opposition-research-firm/article/1020250|website=Weekly Standard|accessdate=17 January 2017|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report claimed that the "unedited" videos posted by activists had been "heavily edited". The anti-abortion activists attributed the gaps to "bathroom breaks and waiting periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haberkorn|first1=Jennifer|title=Report for Planned Parenthood finds sting videos manipulated|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/planned-parenthood-undercover-videos-report-finds-manipulation-121800|website=Politico.com|accessdate=17 January 2017|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was provided to U.S. congressional leadership as evidence as they were considering funding and other issues related to Planned Parenthood operations.&lt;ref name="MattH"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Matt | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-planned-parenthood-charges-activists-20170328-story.html | title = Two Antiabortion Activists behind Undercover Planned Parenthood Videos Charged with 15 Felonies | publisher = Los Angeles Times|date=March 28, 2017|accessdate=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a grand jury declined to indict Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing, on March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California - one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.&lt;ref name="MattH"/&gt; On 21 June 2017, fourteen of these charges were dismissed, with [[Motion for leave|leave]] to amend, on the grounds that they were legally insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SF judge deals setback to prosecutors in abortion sting videos |author=Bob Egelko |date= June 21, 2017 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-judge-deals-setback-to-prosecutors-in-abortion-11237776.php |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2017, state prosecutors refiled the 14 dismissed charges with numerical identifications for each video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egelko|first=Bob|url=http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/California-files-more-charges-against-11271723.php|title=California files more charges against antiabortion activists |website=SfGate|date=July 7, 2017 | access-date=October 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCN"&gt;{{cite web |last=News|first=Bay City|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-court-ruling-allows-felony-charges-proceed-anti-abortion-activists/ |title=SF court ruling allows felony charges to proceed against anti-abortion activists|publisher=Daily Herald|date=August 24, 2017 | access-date=October 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 2017, the San Francisco Superior Court rejected new defense motions to dismiss the charges and allowed the case to proceed. Daleiden then pleaded not guilty, while Merritt did not enter a plea at the time.&lt;ref name="BCN"/&gt;

===Prevezon Holding===
In 2013, the US Department of Justice, represented by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, [[Preet Bharara]], sued Prevezon Holding, a [[Republic of Cyprus]] corporation registered in New York State as a foreign business corporation, under the [[Magnitsky Act]] for [[money-laundering]]. The lawsuit sought forfeiture of various assets and real estate holdings in the US.&lt;ref name="MacKra"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Neil|last2=Kramer|first2=Andrew E.|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/world/europe/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer.html| title =Natalia Veselnitskaya, Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr., Seen as Fearsome Moscow Insider|publisher = The New York Times|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erb|first1=Kelly Phillips|title=Lawyer With Key Evidence In Russian Corruption Scandals Falls From Building Before Testifying|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/03/24/lawyer-with-key-evidence-in-russian-corruption-scandals-falls-from-building-before-testifying/#702e1b3d526c|website=Forbes|accessdate=July 22, 2017|date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2017, two months after President Trump had dismissed Bharara, the lawsuit was settled for $6 million, without Prevezon admitting to any wrongdoing and with both sides claiming victory.&lt;ref name="MacKra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="settled"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feeley|first1=Jef|last2=Van Voris|first2=Bob|title=Laundering Suit Ends as Russian Firm, U.S. Claim Victory|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-13/u-s-reaches-5-9-million-deal-in-russian-fraud-laundering-case|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=July 22, 2016|date=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole shareholder of Prevezon was Russian citizen [[Denis Katsyv]], whose father is Petr Katsyv, vice president of Russia's state-run rail monopoly and "reportedly a business associate of [[Vladimir Yakunin]], a confidant of [[Vladimir Putin]]".&lt;ref name="Erb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollstone"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matt Taibbi|authorlink1=Matt Taibbi|title=Russiagate and the Magnitsky Affair, Linked Again|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/trump-russia-russiagate-magnitsky-affair-linked-again-w492290|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 August 2017|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katsyv’s Russian lawyer [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]] was not licensed to practice in the US, and Katsyv hired the law firm of [[BakerHostetler]] to represent Prevezon; BakerHostetler hired Fusion GPS in early 2014 to provide research help for the litigation.&lt;ref name=frankel /&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE /&gt;&lt;ref name="rollstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rfe2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckel|first1=Mike|title=In U.S. Money-Laundering Case, Shades Of Russian Corruption|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/us-money-laundering-case-russian-corruption-browder-magnitsky-prevezon-katsyv/27494612.html|website=RadioFreeEurope|accessdate=7 August 2017|date=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2016, the appellate court disqualified BakerHostetler from the case because they had represented [[Bill Browder]]’s hedge fund [[Hermitage Capital Management]] for nine months in 2008/2009 when the U.S. Justice Department was investigating a tax fraud scheme in Russia involving "co-opted Hermitage portfolio companies".  The U.S. Justice Department had argued that Hermitage Capital was a victim of the tax fraud and that BakerHofstetler’s prior work on behalf of Hermitage Capital created a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|title=The Legal Battle Behind the Trump Tower Meeting|url= http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/legal-battle-behind-trump-tower-meeting-n785776|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frankel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Alison|title=2nd Circuit disqualifies BakerHostetler from forfeiture case in rare mandamus grant|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2016/10/18/2nd-circuit-disqualifies-bakerhostetler-from-forfeiture-case-in-rare-mandamus-grant|publisher=Reuters Blog|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of their litigation support for BakerHostetler and their client Verezon, Fusion GPS investigated Browder, a witness central to the U.S. Justice Department's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthews|first1=Christopher M.| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-managers-credibility-questioned-in-russian-laundering-case-1431557601 | title = Hedge-Fund Manager's Credibility Questioned in Russian Laundering Case | publisher = The Wall Street Journal|date=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2017, Fusion GPS accused the White House of trying to "smear" it for investigating the president's alleged ties to Russia. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed to Browder's testimony as vindication of Trump's claims that ongoing investigations into potential ties between his campaign and Moscow are political ploys to undermine his presidency. Fusion GPS countered that it worked only with a law firm in New York "to provide support for civil litigation" unrelated to Russian efforts to do away with the Magnitsky Act, saying it had no reason to register under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA).&lt;ref name = TH-Greenwood/&gt;

On March 30, 2017, [[Charles Grassley|Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa]] called for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into purported connections between Fusion GPS and Russia, and an inquiry as to whether Fusion GPS was acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

===Trump dossier and Christopher Steele===
{{main|Trump–Russia dossier}}
In September 2015, Fusion GPS was hired by ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]'', a conservative political website, to do opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. In spring 2016 when Trump had emerged as the probable Republican candidate, the ''Free Beacon'' stopped funding investigation into Trump.&lt;ref name = "freebeacon" /&gt; From April 2016 through October 2016, the law firm [[Perkins Coie]], on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the [[Democratic National Committee]], retained Fusion GPS to continue opposition research on Trump.&lt;ref name = "how"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Confessore|first1=Scott Shane, Nicholas|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|title=How a Sensational, Unverified Dossier Became a Crisis for Donald Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=17 January 2017|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clintondnclawyer"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-campaign-dnc-paid-for-research-that-led-to-russia-dossier/2017/10/24/226fabf0-b8e4-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html |title=Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier |last=Entous |first=Adam |last2=Barrett |first2=Devlin |date=October 24, 2017 |website=The Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=October 25, 2017 |last3=Helderman |first3=Rosalind S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrcdossier" /&gt; In June 2016, Fusion GPS retained [[Christopher Steele]], a private British corporate intelligence investigator and former [[MI-6]] agent, to research any Russian connections to Trump.

====House Intelligence Committee investigation====
On October 4, 2017, Chairman [[Devin Nunes]] of the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the management of the company, demanding documents and testimony in late October and early November 2017. According to a Democratic committee source, the subpoenas were issued unilaterally by the Republican majority of the committee.&lt;ref name="Nunes_subpoena"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perez|first1=Evan|last2=Raju|first2=Manu|last3=Herb|first3=Jeremy|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/10/politics/fusion-gps-subpoenas-devin-nunes/index.html|title=Nunes signs off on new subpoenas to firm behind Trump–Russia dossier|publisher=CNN|date=October 11, 2017 | access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikisource|House Intelligence Committee Interview of Glenn Simpson}}
On October 18, 2017, the House Intelligence Committee held a private meeting with two executives of Fusion GPS, Peter Fritsch, and Thomas Catan. The purpose was to seek information about their creation of "the opposition-research dossier that makes salacious claims about President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg-House&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/executives-of-firm-tied-to-trump-dossier-won-t-answer-queries|title=Executives of Firm Tied to Trump Dossier Take the Fifth at Committee Meeting|last=House|first=Billy|date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was attended by committee staff and a single committee member, Representative [[Tom Rooney (Florida politician)|Tom Rooney]] (R-FL). In response to the questions asked at the meeting, Fritsch and Catan invoked their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment rights]] against self-incrimination. Their attorney, Joshua Levy, said that prior to the meeting he had informed the committee in writing that his clients would invoke their rights, but they were compelled to appear nevertheless. He added they would cooperate with "serious" investigations but that a "Trump cabal has carried out a campaign to demonize our client for having been tied to the Trump dossier."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg-House/&gt;&lt;ref name="subpoena2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Miranda|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/21/politics/fusion-gps-injunction/index.html|title=Fusion GPS asks court to stop lawmakers from seeing financial records|publisher=CNN|date=October 22, 2017|access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2017, Fusion GPS filed for a court injunction against Nunes' subpoena seeking the firm's bank records for a period of more than two years, arguing it would damage and possibly destroy the business as well as violate their First Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertrand|first=Natasha|title=The firm behind the Trump–Russia dossier is fighting to shield its bank records from Devin Nunes|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fusion-gps-trump-russia-subpoena-bank-records-2017-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=October 25, 2017|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 4, 2018 U.S. District Court Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] struck down Fusion's application, ruling that Fusion's bank must turn over the financial records subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee; Fusion asked the judge to stay his order because they plan to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/fusion-gps-bank-records-house-investigation/index.html|title=Fusion GPS fighting order to turn over bank records|last=Polantz|first=Katelyn|date=January 5, 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2017, ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]'', a conservative political website, told the House Intelligence Committee that it had retained Fusion GPS's services from 2015 to May 2016, to research Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. The objective was the discovery of damaging information. The ''Free Beacon'' and its primary source of funding, hedge fund manager [[Paul Singer (businessman)|Paul Singer]], denied any involvement in the creation of the Steele dossier, pointing out that they had stopped funding research on Trump before Steele was engaged.&lt;ref name="freebeacon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth P.|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|title=Conservative Website First Funded Anti-Trump Research by Firm That Later Produced Dossier|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=November 1, 2017|date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2, 2018, the founders of Fusion GPS, [[Glenn R. Simpson]] and Peter Fritsch, authored an op-ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', requesting that Republicans "release full transcripts of our firm’s testimony" and further explaining that, "the Steele dossier was not the trigger for the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian meddling. As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp."&lt;ref name = oped&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/opinion/republicans-investigation-fusion-gps.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Republicans’ Fake Investigations|last=Simpson|first=Glenn R.|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-03|last2=Fritsch|first2=Peter|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate Judiciary Committee investigations==
{{Wikisource|Senate Judiciary Committee Interview of Glenn Simpson}}

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and ranking Democrat [[Dianne Feinstein]] made arrangements in July 2017 for Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson to testify before their committee. It was agreed that Simpson would not testify in public but would be interviewed privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-07-25/the-latest-trump-mocks-hill-probe-on-russia|title=The Latest: Senate Panel Subpoenas Manafort to Testify|date=July 25, 2017|work=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwood_7/26/2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Greenwood | first=Max | title=Co-founder of firm tied to Trump dossier agrees to speak to Senate panel | website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date=July 26, 2017 | url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/343697-co-founder-of-firm-tied-to-trump-dossier-agrees-to-speak-to-senate | access-date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee wanted to question Simpson about the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA). A previous witness, banker and human rights activist Bill Browder, had accused Simpson and Fusion GPS of  evading registration as foreign agents for campaigning to influence and overturn the [[Magnitsky Act]].&lt;ref name=TH-Greenwood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/344207-fusion-gps-white-house-trying-to-smear-us-on-russia | title=Fusion GPS: White House Trying To Smear Us On Russia |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |last=Greenwood|first=Max|first2= Megan|last2=Wilson|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion GPS said through their attorney that they were not required to register under FARA.&lt;ref name=TH-Greenwood/&gt; Senators were expected to also use the hearing "to press Justice Department officials on what they know about Veselnitskaya, Prevezon, Fusion GPS and their connections to both the Trump campaign or the Russian government."&lt;ref name="BI-July"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fusion-gps-trump-dossier-russia-trump-jr-manafort-2017-7|title=Senate Intel Committee Subpoenas The Research Firm Tied To The Bombshell Trump–Russia Dossier|work=[[Business Insider]]|last=Logan|first=Bryan|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2017, Simpson was questioned for 10 hours by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door meeting. The Committee did not release a transcript of the hearing, but indicated that Fusion GPS had given more than 40,000 documents for the investigation.&lt;ref name="DukMo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dukakis|first1=Ali|last2=Mosk|first2=Matthew|title=Attorney: Glenn Simpson did not reveal clients for Trump 'dossier' to investigators|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/attorney-glenn-simpson-reveal-clients-trump-dossier-investigators/story?id=49367909|work=ABC News|date=August 22, 2017|access-date= August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson kept the identities of the firm’s clients confidential;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/22/congress-investigate-fusion-gps-simpson-241924|title=Fusion GPS co-founder meets with congressional investigators|date=August 22, 2017|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Politico|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/22/trump-dossier-figure-questioned-behind-closed-doors-on-capitol-hill.html|title=Trump dossier figure questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill|last=Singman|first=Brooke|date=August 22, 2017|work=Fox News|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the client names—conservative website ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]'',&lt;ref name="freebeacon" /&gt; and a law firm representing the DNC and the Clinton presidential campaign&lt;ref name="clintondnclawyer" /&gt;—were revealed in October 2017 as a result of the House Intelligence Committee investigation.

'''Georges Hobeika''' ([[Baskinta]], 8 February 1962) is a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[fashion designer]] of [[haute couture]] and [[ready-to-wear]] clothing. Hobeika officially opened his atelier in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 1995, and has been presenting his collections in [[Paris]], during the city’s official [[Paris Fashion Week|fashion weeks]], for over a decade. Hobeika is officially recognized by the "[[List of grands couturiers|Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]]", as a guest member.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionwindows.net/2009/11/georges-hobeika/&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Hobeika owns and manages his fashion house which includes four lines: Georges Hobeika Couture – Georges Hobeika Bridal – Georges Hobeika Signature – GH by Georges Hobeika. Georges Hobeika operates the fashion label from his showroom on the [[rue Royale]] in Paris and from his atelier headquarters in Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1037404/interview-georges-hobeikas-new-couture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Hobeika was born in [[Baskinta]], a village in the mountains of Lebanon, and was one of eight siblings. His mother, Marie, was a seamstress and encouraged her children to assist her in her boutique atelier. Hobeika particularly liked his mother’s vocation and pursued it as a passionate hobby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultraextra.org/interviews/2012/12/7/9vrjaj3ds463h1bnk8435uzsnmmpqt&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobeika studied civil engineering in university, and pursued architectural design in his studies. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] forced him to leave the country in order to secure a better future for him and his family. Hobeika traveled to Paris and worked as an intern for several Parisian fashion houses, including [[Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jetsetfashionmagazine.com/wordpress/fashion/my-interview-with-georges-hobeika&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Georges Hobeika Design Label ==

They worked together to establish a fashion label.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modemonline.com/fashion/mini-web-sites/fashion-brands/references/georgeshobeika&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hoyle Casino Empire''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] developed and published by [[Sierra Entertainment]] on Windows computers, in which the player must run a casino and try to make profit, attract customers and get good ratings.

==Gameplay==
The goal of ''Hoyle Casino Empire'' is to create a thriving casino. There are two modes in the game; Empire Mode and Sandbox Mode. Empire Mode sends the player to one of eight casinos starting with a small one and working up to the biggest casino. In each casino the player will have specific objectives to meet in a limited time in order turn the casino into a successful place. Not meeting the objectives in time will end the game. Sandbox mode allows the player to build whatever casino desired without any objectives to follow or limited time. In this mode, the player is limited to one kind of casino, but can unlock more upon winning them from the Empire Mode.

The player starts in a specific kind of building with a limited amount of starting money, certain areas of space to build, and starting at a First Level Status. A Level Status determines what kind of casino games and services can be built in the casino. Increasing a Level Status requires a sum of cash, a number of customers in the casino and a number of good ratings. The Level Status can go as high as four. The number of customers can be increased by introducing more games and services and the good ratings can be increased by introducing variety, room decor, building extensions, cash donations, deluxe services and satisfying customers' general requirements.

General requirements for customers include cash desks (and ATMs) to withdraw money for gambling, bathrooms, eating establishments, drinking establishments and hotel accommodations. If those general requirements are not met, customers may decide to leave the casino and give bad reviews. Cash donations can only keep dissatisfied customers happy temporarily. Customers come in different classes, ranging from Tourists who carry little cash to VIPs who have lots of money. When building games and services in the casino, maintenance is needed to keep the casino running. Service men are needed to maintain the slot machines, custodians keep the casino and bathrooms clean, waitresses serve drinks and security guards keep unwanted offenders out.

Earning money legally is done by establishing sufficient services to the number of customers and accepting commercial stunt deals with agreements met. However money can be earned illegitimately by increasing the House Edge to Cheating Mode, accepting crooked deals such as money laundering. Such illegalities can lead to financial losses and degrading of ratings if found out by city authorities. While attempting to earn profit, the player must keep in mind the maintenance and employee wage expenses that present in the gameplay. If money goes below zero, then the player is in debt and cannot spend on anymore services or building until sufficient cash is earned.

'''Hugh David MacEwen Barton''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (17 January 1911 – 16 April 1989) was a British Hong Kong businessman who served as chairman and managing director of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] from 1953 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thistle and the Jade: A Celebration of 175 Years of Jardine Matheson|first1=Maggie|last1= Keswick|first2= Clara|last2= Weatherall|publisher=Frances Lincoln|year=2008|ISBN=0-7112-2830-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
Sir Hugh was born on 17 January 1911 in Ireland. After graduating from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge University]], Barton joined Jardines in 1933 as a tea taster and climbing the ranks to become [[Tai-pan]] in 1953 at just 42 years old. Barton was assigned to several key areas throughout Asia spending most of his time in Shanghai before returning to Hong Kong in 1949 when the group's assets fell under the new Communist regime. Barton served with the [[Irish Guards]] and fought in the [[Second World War]]. He retired from the military in 1944 as a Lt. Colonel and returned to work for Jardine Matheson after the war.

A persistent and flamboyant character, he was appointed Taipan of Jardines, replacing Sir John Keswick. During his tenure, he oversaw the incredible growth of the company in Hong Kong and throughout Asia after the devastating war years and continued trade with China. He also served as a director of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] from 1955 to 1959, Vice Chairman from 1960 to 1961. It's also interesting to note that he also served as the Chairman of the bank from 1962 to 1963, holding the chairmanship title of both the bank and Jardines. As taipan of Jardines, he oversaw the opening of the company headquarters in 1956 along [[Connaught Road]], a 16-story building which was already replaced in 1972.

He is best remembered for the historic and landmark event of leading Jardines to its [[initial public offering]]. Initially distributing the shares at $2.78, within a week it shot up to $5.22, having been oversubscribed 56 times. 

During his tenure, Jardines owned much of the richest land in Hong Kong, controlled two of the island's three profitable English newspapers, and has substantial interests in banking, shipping, insurance, utilities, streetcars and airlines and being agent for 77 major companies, trading products ranging from machine tools to fine Scotch throughout Asia. He sat in Hong Kong's governing bodies and the boards of its richest banks. He presided over a time when Jardine Matheson was at the peak of its economic and political power over Hong Kong.

He founded the Penta Hotel Chain, supported by five airlines: [[Swiss Air]], [[Alitalia]], [[Air France]], [[British Airways]] and [[Lufthansa]] Airlines. Eventually, Air France and Alitalia backed out of the deal. The Hotel chain was also supported by UBS, Swiss Bank, Deutsch Bank and a British investment Bank. The Pental Hotel chain still exists but mainly in Germany.

In a [[Time Magazine]] article in 1961, he was described as "Tall (6 ft. 3 in.), suave and social, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge-educated]] Hugh Barton joined Jardines in 1933 as a tea taster, scrupulously lives up to the company's cherished traditions, including the raising of ponies that race under the Jardines' silks." After retiring in 1963, he became an influential diplomat in Europe, representing Hong Kong businesses' interests there. 

In 1965, he became a director of [[S.G. Warburg]]. He was invested as a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1966. In describing Jardines, a commentator stated, "Jardines always was, and still is, a Scottish house that kept the Sabbath and everything else it could lay hands on." He died in April 1989 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p26834.htm The Peerage: Hugh David MacEwen Barton]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Andrew Haley''' (January 4, 1899 &amp;ndash; August 6, 1981) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Florida]].

Born in [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]], [[Alabama]], Haley attended the public schools and the [[University of Alabama]]. During World War I, Haley enlisted in Troop A, Second Cavalry, in April 1917 and served overseas. He was an accountant in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], Florida, from 1920 to 1933. He served as general manager of John Ringling estate 1933&amp;ndash;1943.

On December 4, 1942, Haley married Aubrey Ringling (née Aubrey Barlow Black), the widow of Richard T. Ringling who had died in 1931. Richard Ringling was the son of [[Alf T. Ringling]] one of the original [[Ringling brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=57843603&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1943 to 1945, he was the first vice president of Ringling Circus and president and director of [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey]]. In 1944, [[Hartford circus fire|a fire broke out at a Ringling Circus show]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] that killed 169 persons. On the day of the fire Haley was the highest ranking executive traveling with the circus. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbo.com/health/medical-news/haley-volunteer-pushing-for-rename-of-hospital-540080&lt;/ref&gt;  During the subsequent trial, he and five other circus officials pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to charges of [[involuntary manslaughter]] and were sentenced to prison. He served eight months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ringling V.P. Released After Serving 8 Mos. of Fire Penalty |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety160-1945-12#page/n198/mode/1up/ |accessdate=2017-01-15 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1945-12-26 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1945 was returned to Florida, where he received a [[pardon]] from [[governor of Florida|Governor]] [[Millard F. Caldwell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flsouthern.edu/library/mckay-archives/digital-exhibits/haley-congressman.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley worked for Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey from 1946 to 1948. He later engaged in newspaper publishing and later in general printing business. He served as chairman of the Democratic executive committee of Sarasota County 1935&amp;ndash;1952. He served as member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]] from 1949 to 1952. He was a delegate in [[1952 Democratic National Convention|1952]], [[1956 Democratic National Convention|1956]], and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]] to all three [[Democratic National Convention]]s.

Haley was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[83rd United States Congress|Eighty-third]] and to the eleven succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1953 &amp;ndash; January 3, 1977). He served as chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs ([[93rd United States Congress|Ninety-third]] and [[94th United States Congress|Ninety-fourth]] Congresses). In the high-profile 1970 election for the [[United States Senate]] from Florida to choose a successor to [[Spessard L. Holland]], Haley strongly supported his fellow Democrat [[Lawton Chiles]], a [[Florida State Senate|state senator]] from [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], who scored an easy victory over the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Candidate|nominee]], [[William C. Cramer]] of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. Haley called Cramer "little in stature and big in mouth" and suggested that the Republican candidate should "talk less and work more."&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970", ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (April 1990), p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley was not a candidate for reelection to the [[95th United States Congress|Ninety-fifth]] Congress in 1976.

Haley died in Sarasota on August 6, 1981 and was interred in Boca Raton Cemetery in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]].  The James A. Haley Veterans Hospital located in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] is named after him.

'''Jean-Claude Falmagne''' (born February 4, 1934, in Brussels, Belgium) is a [[mathematical psychology|mathematical psychologist]] whose scientific contributions deal with problems in [[reaction time]] theory, psychophysics, [[philosophy of science]], measurement theory, [[decision theory]], and educational technology.  Together with Jean-Paul Doignon, he developed [[knowledge space|knowledge space theory]], which is the mathematical foundation for the [[Aleks|ALEKS]] software for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, including K-12 mathematics, chemistry, and accounting.

== Early life and career ==
After finishing high school, Falmagne spent two years in the Belgian army, where he became an officer.  Military service was mandatory in Belgium at the time.  In 1954, he enrolled at the [[University of Brussels]] (Université Libre de Bruxelles) as a student in the psychology department.  He received his undergraduate degree in 1959 and was hired as an assistant at the University of Brussels, which is a faculty position in the Belgian system.  He obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1965 from the same institution.

While working on his doctoral dissertation, which dealt with reaction times, Falmagne became interested in the applications of mathematics to the cognitive sciences.  In 1964, he was invited by [[Patrick Suppes]] to spend the summer at [[Stanford University]].  He presented the results of his dissertation at a conference there and met several prominent mathematical psychologists, including [[William K. Estes|Bill Estes]], [[Richard C. Atkinson|Dick Atkinson]], and [[Duncan Luce]], and the mathematician [[János Aczél (mathematician)|János Aczél]].  Suppes, Luce, and Aczél had a strong influence on Falmagne’s choice of scientific career and on his approach to solving scientific problems.  His visit to Stanford convinced him that he needed to continue his education in the United States.

With the support of [[Fulbright scholar|Fulbright]] and [[Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique|FNRS]] fellowships, Falmagne held post-doctoral positions at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the [[University of Michigan]] between 1966 and 1969.  His interests grew to include psychophysics, measurement theory, and probabilistic models of ordering and algebraic measurement.  After short teaching stints back in Europe at the University of Brussels and the University of Paris, he returned to the United States in 1971 as a Professor of Psychology at New York University.

In 1989, he joined the faculty of University of California, Irvine, accepting an appointment at the Department of Cognitive Sciences and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences.  He remained there until his retirement in 2004.

Until 2013, Falmagne was Chairman of [http://www.aleks.com ALEKS Corporation], a web-based educational software company that he founded with some of his graduate students.  He is currently a Research Professor  at the [[University of California, Irvine]].

== Research ==
In 1978, Falmagne solved a well-known problem, posed in 1960 by the economists H.D. Block and [[Jacob Marschak]] in their article "Random Orderings and Stochastic Theories of Responses", concerning the representation of choice probabilities by random variables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Block|first=H.D.|title=Contributions to Probability and Statistics|year=1960|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=97–132|contribution=Random Orderings and Stochastic Theories of Responses|first2=Jacob|last2=Marschak|editors=Olkin, Ghurye, Hoeffding, Madow and Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his findings in the ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology''.{{ran|F78}}

=== Knowledge spaces, media theory, learning spaces and the ALEKS software ===
In 1985, Falmagne, along with Jean-Paul Doignon, wrote “Spaces for the Assessment of Knowledge”.{{ran|DF85}}  In this article, they presented a formal framework for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, such as arithmetic, algebra, and chemistry.  This early framework was combinatoric in character, and as such insufficient for a practical assessment, which is unavoidably plagued by careless errors on the part of the test takers.  In time, they created a stochastic framework for the description of the evolution of an assessment, question by question.{{ran|FD88}}  With extensive financial support from the [[National Science Foundation]], their work on the [[stochastic]] framework led to the creation of the web-based system ALEKS for the assessment and learning of mathematics and science.  Falmagne and Doignon's 2011 book, ''Learning Spaces'',{{ran|FD11}} contains the most current presentation and development of the stochastic framework for the assessment of knowledge.  Learning spaces are specific kinds of knowledge spaces, whose best applications are to situations where assessments guide efficient learning.  Learning spaces are a part of the concept of Media Theory,{{ran|EFO07}} which explores the modeling of knowledge structures and knowledge states.  More generally, these lines of research are collectively called Knowledge Space Theory and are being pursued by many investigators, mostly in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.

=== The meaningfulness of scientific laws ===
A common practice in the statement of scientific laws ensures that the mathematical expression of the law is invariant with respect to changes of units of its variables—except for the values of dimensional constants. In dimensional analysis, this invariance is implicit and captured by the concept of "quantities". In "Scales and Meaningfulness of Quantitative Laws", Falmagne and [[Louis Narens]] argue that the requirement of invariance, which they call "meaningfulness" should be part of the axioms or theory establishing the law, rather than result from them.{{ran|FN83}} They proposed a more powerful framework making this invariance explicit in the notation.  This approach was generalized by Falmagne in "Meaningfulness and Order Invariance: Two Fundamental Principles for Scientific Laws",{{ran|F04}} and applied to several exemplary laws of physics.

=== Other work ===
The monograph ''Elements of Psychophysical Theory''{{ran|F85}} presents the mathematical foundation of psychophysics and includes an introduction to measurement theory and functional equations.  Falmagne's work in philosophy of science concerns foundational issues in algebraic measurement{{ran|DF69}}{{ran|F75}} and in probabilistic measurement.{{ran|F76}}  A distinctive feature of his research lies in the use of functional equations in order to achieve generality.{{ran|F80}}{{ran|AF99}}{{ran|AF00}}{{ran|FD10}}

== Awards and honors ==
Falmagne is the recipient of Fulbright and [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1973|Guggenheim]] Fellowships and of a von Humboldt Award. In 1994, he was recognized as a "Friend of NSERC" by the [http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada] and [[János Aczél (mathematician)|János D. Aczél]] .  That same year, he was elected as a member of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]]. He is also a fellow of the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]]. He received an Innovation Award from the University of California, Irvine in 2004 and a doctoris honoris causa degree in science from the University of Graz in 2005.

In celebration of Falmagne's 70th birthday in 2004, a "[http://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/empg/index.php?path=falmagne.html Falmagne Symposium]" was held at the annual meeting of the [[European Mathematical Psychology Group]] in Ghent, Belgium, and a "Falmagne Festschrift Meeting" was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  Two special issues of the ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology'' were published in 2005 with the papers presented at two meetings organized to honor his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special Issue Honoring Jean-Claude Falmagne|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date=December 2005|volume=49|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222496/49/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a conference on meaningfulness and learning spaces was held in Irvine in honor of his 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imbs.uci.edu/node/25451 Conference on Meaningfulness and Learning Spaces: A Tribute to the Work of Jean-Claude Falmagne], UC Irvine Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, February 27–28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the UC Irvine Alumni Association gave him their highest honor, the Extraordinarius award.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.uci.edu/features/lauds-laurels-to-salute-18-campus-luminaries/|title=Lauds &amp; Laurels to salute 18 campus luminaries: Cognitive scientist-turned-mathematician and educational software entrepreneur Jean-Claude Falmagne will receive prestigious Extraordinarius award|journal=UCI News|publisher=University of California, Irvine|date=April 3, 2015|first=Laura|last=Rico}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hays Hammond''' (31 March 1855 &amp;ndash; 8 June 1936) was a [[mining engineer]], [[diplomat]], and [[philanthropist]]. Known as the man with the [[Midas touch]], he amassed a sizable fortune before the age of 40.  An early advocate of deep mining, Hammond was given complete charge of [[Cecil Rhodes]]' mines in [[South Africa]] and made each undertaking a financial success. But after the dismal failure of the [[Jameson Raid]], Hammond, along with the other leaders of the [[Reform Committee (Transvaal)|Johannesburg Reform Committee]], was arrested and subsequently sentenced to death.  The Reform Committee leaders were released after paying large fines, but like many of the leaders, Hammond left Africa for good.  He returned to the United States, became a close friend of President [[William Howard Taft]], and was appointed a special [[United States Ambassador]].  At the same time, he continued to develop mines in [[Mexico]] and [[California]] and, in 1923, he made another fortune while drilling for oil with the [[Burnham Exploration Company]].  His son, [[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]], patented over 400 inventions, and is widely regarded as the father of ''radio control''.

==Early life==
Hammond was the son of Major Richard Pindell Hammond, a [[West Point]] graduate who fought in the [[U.S.-Mexican War|Mexican War]], and Sarah, daughter of Harmon Hays and his wife, née Elizabeth Cage. Sarah was sister to Captain [[John Coffee Hays]] of the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]], and had formerly been married to Calvin Lea.&lt;ref name="time10may1926"&gt;{{cite magazine| author =| date=May 10, 1926| title=Unique|magazine=[[Time Magazine]]| volume=| issue=| issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved in 1849 to California to prospect in the [[California gold rush]], and young John was born in San Francisco. After an adventuresome boyhood in the [[American Old West]], Hammond went East to attend the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] of Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1876, and later attended the Royal School of Mines, Freiberg, Germany, 1876–1879, and there he met his wife-to-be, Natalie Harris.

==Mining career==
Hammond took his first mining job as a special expert for the [[US Geological Survey]] 1879-1880 in Washington, DC. He returned to California in 1881 to work for Senator Hearst, the mining magnate and father of [[William Randolph Hearst]].  In 1882, he was sent to hostile country in [[Mexico]], near [[Sonora]], to become superintendent of Minas Neuvas.  When a revolution broken out, Hammond barricaded his family in a small house and fought off the attacking guerrillas.

From 1884-1893, Hammond worked in San Francisco as a consulting engineer for Union Iron Works, Central Pacific Railway and Southern Pacific Railway.  In 1893, Hammond left for South Africa to investigate the gold mines in Transvaal for the Barnato Brothers. In 1894, he joined the [[British South Africa]] Company to work with [[Cecil Rhodes]] and opened mines in the Rand, in [[Mashonaland]] (territory which became [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). In 1895, he was managing Rhodes' property in [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], with headquarters at [[Johannesburg, South Africa]].  An early advocate of deep-level mining, Hammond was given complete charge of Rhodes' gold and diamond mines and made each undertaking a financial success. While working for Rhodes, he made his worldwide reputation as an engineer. He continued to work for Rhodes until 1899, but events in Africa would go on to change Hammond's life forever.

===Reform Committee of Transvaal===
[[Image:Natalie Harris Hammond.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Natalie Harris Hammond&lt;/center&gt;]]
When Hammond arrived in the Transvaal, the political situation was tense. The gold rush had brought in a considerable foreign population of workers, chiefly British and American, whom the Boers referred to as "Uitlanders" (foreigners).  These immigrants, manipulated by Rhodes, formed a [[Reform Committee (Transvaal)|Reform Committee]] headed by Colonel [[Francis William Rhodes|Frank Rhodes]] (brother of Cecil), Hammond, and others. They demanded a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary, a better educational system, and charged that the Government under President [[Paul Kruger]] had made promises, but failed to keep them. These demands were orchestrated by Rhodes, knowing that Kruger would never accede to them, justifying subsequent intervention by the British government to protect the supposed interests of British miners, the vast majority of whom had no desire to vote or settle in the Transvaal. Civility finally collapsed when [[Leander Starr Jameson]], the [[British South Africa Company]]'s Administrator General for [[Matabeleland]], prematurely invaded the Transvaal with 1 500 troops in the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]] and was captured by the Boers in December 1895. Shortly thereafter, the Boer government arrested Hammond and most of members of the Reform Committee and kept them in deplorable conditions.  The U.S. Senate petitioned President Kruger for clemency.

The Reform Committee case was heard in April.  Hammond, [[Lionel Phillips]], [[George Farrar]], Frank Rhodes and [[Percy Fitzpatrick]], all of whom had signed an incriminating  document found with Jameson's raiders, were sentenced to be hanged, but Kruger commuted the sentence the next day. For the next few weeks, Hammond and the others were kept in jail under deplorable conditions.  In May it was announced that they would spend 15 years in prison, but by mid-June Kruger commuted the sentences of all, Hammond and the other lesser figures each paying a ₤2,000 fine. The ringleaders had been shipped off to London to be dealt with by the imperial Government, paying fines of ₤25,000 each. All fines, amounting to some ₤300,000, were paid by Rhodes. Shortly hereafter, Hammond left for England.

===Return to United States===
[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|Former residence of John Hays Hammond in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
About 1900, the now famous Hammond moved to the U.S., and reported on mining properties in the U.S. and Mexico. He reported on the value of the [[Camp Bird Mine]] in Colorado, pursuant to its sale in 1902. His report on [[Winfield Scott Stratton]]'s Independence mine, also in Colorado, and then being floated on the London market, revealed that the ore reserves had been greatly overvalued, and burst the stock bubble. He became a professor of mining engineering at Yale University 1902-1909, and from 1903–1907, he was employed by [[Daniel Guggenheim]] as a highly paid general manager and consulting engineer for the [[Guggenheim Exploration Company]] (Guggenex).

Hammaond's five-year contract included a $250,000 base salary and "an interest from each property that he brought in to Guggenex."  He earned $1.2 million in the first year alone.  He employed Pope Yeatman, his eventual successor at Guggenex, and [[Alfred Chester Beatty]].&lt;ref name=Hawley&gt;{{Cite book |author=Charles Caldwell Hawley |title=A Kennecott Story |publisher=The University of Utah Press |year=2014 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
In 1907, Hammond became the first president of the [[Rocky Mountain Club]] and he remained president of the club until it disbanded in 1928.&lt;ref name="nyt19jan1907"&gt;{{cite journal| author = | date=January 19, 1907 | title=Rocky Mountain Club Incorporates| journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt4mar1928"&gt;{{cite journal| author = | date=March 4, 1928| title=Rocky Mountain Club Ends a short but famous career; Its Huge Gifts of Money and Services in the War Gave It a Notable Record| journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammond was also active in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and he became a close friend of President [[William Howard Taft]] whom he had known since his student days at Yale.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"&gt;{{cite journal| author =Benjamin B Hampton | date=April 1, 1910 | title=The Vast Riches of Alaska | journal=Hampton's Magazine | volume=24 | issue=1 | issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1908 it was announced that Hammond was a candidate for Vice-President for the Republican party, but he did not receive many delegates at the national convention.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt; Nevertheless, he became acquainted with many prominent politicians at the convention and became the president of the League of Republican Clubs.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt;  He moved to Washington to be closer to the President and he accompanied President Taft on many excursions.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt;  In 1911, Taft then sent him to the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] as a special U.S. Ambassador, and twice sent him to assist [[Nicholas II of Russia]] on irrigation and other engineering problems.  In addition to Taft, Hammond also befriended Presidents Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, and Coolidge.
 
Hammond became chairman the U.S. Coal Commission, 1922-1923.  His close friendship and longtime business associations with [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the highly decorated Scout who he knew from Africa, led Hammond to become a wealthy oil man when Burnham Exploration Company struck oil at [[Dominguez Oil Field]], near [[Carson, California]], in 1923.

== May 1926: A Celebration of Hammond ==
[[Image:John hays hammond time 10may1926.jpg|left|100px|thumb]]
In May 1926, an organization called "The Company of Friends of John Hays Hammond" sponsored eleven dinners around the world ([[Manhattan]], [[San Francisco]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[Manila]], etc.) in honor of Hammond.  Over 10,000 people wrote tributes to Hammond, including: Hearst whose father gave him his first job, [[Woolf Barnato]] whose father ([[Barney Barnato]]) took him to South Africa, Sir [[Lionel Phillips]] who was condemned to death with him, the Guggenheims who employed him at a fabulous salary, former President Taft who offered him an ambassador position, and President [[Calvin Coolidge]] who consulted with him on the coal situation.  The event was so extraordinary that ''[[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]]'' put Hammond on the cover of the May 10, 1926 issue and ran a biographical sketch on him called "Unique".&lt;ref name="time10may1926"/&gt;

He died of coronary occlusion on June 8, 1936, in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].

==Family==
[[Image:Hammond jr hammond sr 2.jpg|thumb|John Hays Hammond Jr. &amp; Sr., c. 1922]]
He married Natalie Harris, of Harrisville, Mississippi (40 miles SSW south of the state capital, Jackson) on January 1, 1881, in Hancock, Maryland. Together they had three sons and one daughter:

[[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]] (1888 - February 12, 1965) was born in San Francisco, California.  In 1893 he moved with his family to South Africa, and five years later the family moved to England.  The family returned to the United States in 1900, and Hammond attended Lawrenceville School, started inventing, and went on to study at the Sheffield School of Yale University, graduating in 1910.  He established the Hammond Radio Research Corporation in 1911 and eventually developed a radio controlled torpedo system for the navy, which he successfully demonstrated in 1918.  Between 1926 and 1929, he built a medieval-style castle in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondcastle.org |work= |title=Hammond Castle &amp; Museum | accessdate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natalie Hays Hammond]] (1904–1985) was born in Lakewood, New Jersey. Her estate in [[North Salem, New York]] was converted into the Hammond Museum &amp; Japanese Stroll Garden in 1957.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondmuseum.org |work=|title=Hammond Museum &amp; Japanese Stroll Garden | accessdate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris Hays Hammond, a financier, became president of Dominguez Oil Fields Company, which earned him $2 million in 1936, and president of Laughlin Filter Corporation, a small New Jersey company which manufactures centrifuges. In 1928, he and [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.|Anthony "Tony" Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.]] were among the directors of Acoustic Products Co., which later became Sonora Products Corp. of America.&lt;ref name="time16aug1937"/&gt;

Nathaniel Harris Hammond, died 1906, and [[Richard Pindle Hammond]], composer, born in London, England, were the two other children.

John Hays Hammond died in 1936 at the age of 81 in an easy chair in his showplace at Gloucester, Massachusetts. He left an estate estimated at $2.5 million, mostly to his four surviving children: inventor John Hays Hammond Jr.; artist Natalie Hays Hammond; composer Richard Pindle Hammond; and financier Harris Hays Hammond.&lt;ref name="time16aug1937"&gt;{{cite magazine| author = | date=August 16, 1937| title=Millennium Payment|magazine=[[Time Magazine]]| volume=| issue=| issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store, which is known for its sign depicting a revolver, was founded in 1911 by John Jovino who sold it to the Imperato family in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}} It remains in the family.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; The store was once located at 5 [[Centre Market Place]], part of a gun district behind the former [[240 Centre Street|police headquarters]] on [[Centre Street (Manhattan)|Centre Street]], but later moved to its present location.

The store "does about $1 million worth of business annually", a figure which was higher before the [[New York Police Department]] opened an internal firearms bureau.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}} The company used to  own a gun factory in [[Brooklyn]], the only one in the city, which made [[Colt M1911]] pistols and reproductions of [[American Civil War]]-era [[Henry rifle]]s.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news

|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Selling Guns: A Tradition and a Dilemma
|author=Randy Kennedy
|date=April 5, 2000
|publisher=The New York Times
|accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, known as [[Henry Repeating Arms]], moved its headquarters from New York City to [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], in 2013.

Although many of its customers are in law enforcement, the company was near the top of a list of sellers whose guns were linked to New York City crimes in a 2003 report by a [[Columbia University]] researcher using data from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]]. Some 102 guns of 11,700 used in crimes and later identified came from the Jovino shop.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; According to current owners, until the 1980s the Jovino Company was "one of the biggest dealers in the country" and sold guns to many police departments. The study did not suggest any wrongdoing by the dealers listed (the store is not responsible for how people use the products they legally sell) and did not take into account that a store that has a higher volume of sales would most likely have a higher number of sales to people who later used the firearms in crimes, even if the store had a lower ratio of firearms used in crimes bought from the store per total sales than a store with a smaller volume of sales.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; A 2007 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article raised questions about the store's sales to [[United Nations]] diplomats from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}}

The shop was seen in the film ''[[Serpico]]'', in the thirteenth episode (Season One) of ''Law and Order (A Death in the Family)'' and very briefly in ''[[Mean Streets]]'' as well as ''[[The Brave One (2007 film)|The Brave One]]''. The shop’s Centre Market Street location was seen in the 1957 television series ''[[Decoy]]'', appearing in the first season, episode four, titled ''[[To Trap a Thief]]''.

{{POV check|date=October 2012}}
'''Merab Ratishvili''' (born May 16, 1959) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] businessman, political scientist and author who has been imprisoned in Georgia since 15 July 2008 for his political activities and opposition to the [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] government.

Merab Ratishvili was born in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], and educated in Moscow. He is a former Chair of the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation, as referenced on the back cover of the English versions of his novels "Juga" and "Iliadi".

On 26 October 2007 Merab Ratishvili was arrested in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and on 15 July 2008 sentenced to 9 years imprisonment, charged with the possession and use of drugs.

Both Georgian and international [[human rights]] organisations reported that in their opinion Ratishvili had been arrested because of his support for the political opposition to Mikheil Saakashvili, then President of Georgia.

Merab Ratishvili always maintained his innocence, and his case was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights accepts Ratishvili’s claim against Georgia. http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/news/16429.html Georgian Times, 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 report by the then Public Defender of Human Rights in Georgia [[Sozar Subari]] Merab Ratishvili was identified as a political prisoner.
 
A 2011 report by the Georgian Young Lawyers Association highlighted Merab Ratishvili’s case and concluded that “the preliminary investigation and court review were conducted with both material and procedural violations, meaning that the verdict delivered in Ratishvili’s case is unlawful.”.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Analysis Of Cases of Criminal and Administrative Offences with Alleged Political Motive {{cite web |url=http://www.gyla.ge/attachments/964_savaraudod%20politikuri%20motivaciis%20saqmeebi_Full_ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731010644/http://gyla.ge/attachments/964_savaraudod%20politikuri%20motivaciis%20saqmeebi_Full_ENG.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-31 |df= }} Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, Tbilisi, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2009 report the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH), stated, ''“The FIDH fact-finding mission is convinced that Merab Ratishvili is the victim of a purely fabricated, politically motivated case”''.&lt;ref&gt;After the rose, the thorns: political prisoners in post-revolutionary Georgia. http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/PolPrisGeorgia.pdf International Federation for Human Rights, Paris, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Thomas Hammarberg]], Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, visited Merab Ratishvili in [[Rustavi]] prison No.6 as part of a visit to Georgia to report on the administration of justice and level of protection of human rights in the justice system of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Administration of justice and protection of human rights in the justice system in Georgia https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1809789 Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 Ratishvili was one of the first prisoners released by the new Georgian government, which acknowledged he was a political prisoner.

Ratishvili used his time in prison to become a novelist. His first two novels, "Juga" and "Iliadi", have been translated into Russian, English and French. Other works, including another novel, "White Lama", are available in Georgian. A ful list is available from the Kaligrami publishing house in Tbilisi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19179">A '''business proposal''' is a written offer from a seller to a prospective buyer.
Business proposals are often a key step in the [[complex sales]] process—i.e., whenever a buyer considers more than price in a purchase.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, Larry. Shipley Associates Proposal Guide, ([http://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php Proposal Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111033643/https://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php |date=2008-11-11 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal puts the buyer's requirements in a context that favors the seller's products and services, and educates the buyer about the capabilities of the seller in satisfying their needs.&lt;ref name=Ricci&gt;Ricci, Laura; (1996–2007), The Magic of Winning Proposals (publisher R³) {{ISBN|0-9657399-1-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of proposals==
There are three distinct categories of business proposals:
* Formally solicited 
* Informally solicited
* Unsolicited

Solicited proposals are written in response to published requirements, contained in a [[request for proposal]] (RFP), [[request for quotation]] (RFQ), [[invitation for bid]] (IFB), or a [[request for information]] (RFI).

'''Request for proposal (RFP)'''

RFPs provide detailed specifications of what the customer wants to buy and sometimes include directions for preparing the proposal, as well as evaluation criteria the customer will use to evaluate offers. Customers issue RFPs when their needs cannot be met with generally available products or services. RFIs are issued to qualify the vendors who are interested in providing service/products for specific requirements. Based on the response to RFI, detailed RFP is issued to qualified vendors who the organization believes can provide desired services. Proposals in response to RFPs are seldom less than 10 pages and sometimes reach 1,000's of pages, without cost data.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;
 
'''Request for quotation (RFQ)'''

Customers issue RFQs when they want to buy large amounts of a commodity and price is not the only issue—for example, when availability or delivering or service are considerations. RFQs can be very detailed, so proposals written to RFQs can be lengthy but are generally much shorter than an RFP-proposal.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; RFQ proposals consist primarily of cost data, with brief narratives addressing customer issues, such as quality control.
 
'''Invitation for bid (IFB)'''

Customers issue IFBs when they are buying some service, such as construction. The requirements are detailed, but the primary consideration is price. For example, a customer provides architectural blueprints for contractors to bid on. These proposals can be lengthy but most of the length comes from cost-estimating data and detailed schedules.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

'''Request for information (RFI)'''

Sometimes before a customer issues an RFP or RFQ or IFB, the customer will issue a [[Request for Information]] (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to gain "marketing intelligence" about what products, services, and vendors are available. RFIs are used to shape final RFPs, RFQs, and IFBs, so potential vendors take great care in responding to these requests, hoping to shape the eventual formal solicitation toward their products or services.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

===Informally solicited proposal===
Informally solicited proposals are typically the result of conversations held between a vendor and a prospective customer. The customer is interested enough in a product or service to ask for a proposal. Typically, the customer does not ask for competing proposals from other vendors. This type of proposal is known as a sole-source proposal. There are no formal requirements to respond. But they choose good quality of product."

===Unsolicited proposal===
Unsolicited proposals are marketing brochures. They are always generic, with no direct connection between customer needs or specified requirements. Vendors use them to introduce a product or service to a prospective customer. They are often used as "leave-behinds" at the end of initial meetings with or customers or "give-aways" at trade shows or other public meetings. They are not designed to close a sale, just introduce the possibility of a sale.&lt;ref&gt;Khalsa,Mahan. Franklin Covey, [http://www.franklincovey.com/saletraininggroup.php-Let's Get Real]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

===Formally solicited proposals===
# Requirements Matrix, which matches customer requirements with the paragraph and page numbers of where those requirements are addressed in the proposal
# Executive Summary, which outlines the primary benefits of the vendors's solutions to the customer's requirements
# Technical Volume, which demonstrates how each requirement will be met
# Management Volume, which describes how the program will be managed
# Cost Volume, which provides all costing data, as well as implementation plans and schedules&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

=== Informally solicited business proposal ===
# A description of the seller's capabilities or products
# A discussion of key issues
# A description of the buyer's specifications and how they will be met
# The cost of the offering
# A schedule for delivery of the products or services
# Proof of prior experience i.e. Testimonials from previous customers, Descriptions of previous projects&lt;ref name=Ricci/&gt;

==Managing business proposals==

Managing proposals presents an enormous challenge for sales and marketing teams. Many established management methods are ill-suited to deal with the broader issues associated with the production and delivery of proposals. In these cases, organizations often rely on outsourcing by identifying a proposal manager to support their proposal development needs.  

===The process of proposal management===
Proposal management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:
* '''Creator''' – responsible for creating and editing content.
* '''Editor''' – responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.
* '''Publisher''' – responsible for releasing the content for use.
* '''Administrator''' – responsible for managing access permissions to documents and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles.
* '''Consumer''' or viewer – the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.

Increasingly, the term proposal management is being used to suggest that engagement with the proposal process is important to more than just the sales team, and should also affect those working in marketing, legal, and sales.

There is also a trend towards using [[proposal software|proposal management software]] that allows users to quickly and easily create proposals, collaborate with team members, track and analyze [[customer engagement]].

==Proposal writing==

Writing a successful proposal can be made easier through the development of a proposal checklist that contains the necessary standardized information that is typically contained in 80% of all of your sales proposals. This makes it much easier for the proposal writer to build a shell and then research the roughly missing 20%. For example, the Company Name, Mission Statement, History, Qualifications should remain the same for most proposals leaving the Pricing section and specific Product and Service options specific to the customer to be customized for the current target customer. At times, the process can be tedious, but the steps are pretty basic. Besides solicited and unsolicited proposals, the others that exist include internal proposals and sole-source contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Wed. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal proposals===
Internal proposals are ideas or projects that are presented to whomever holds the position of top management in a company. These types of proposals can be written by a particular individual, group, department, or division of a particular company. One example of this is when the manager of a product line writes a proposal suggesting that the company should robotize the production process. Some advantages to this includes easier communication, knowing the client's needs and making fast decisions. Some advantages to this may include competition from other companies and the loss of management champions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Web. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sole-source contract===
These types of proposals are made when a private firm, government agency, or association negotiates to supply a service or product to a single company and when a company has excellent credibility and a track record of achievements. The standard format for this type of proposal consists of information about a specific product, including the price and delivery schedules. Some advantages to this include not having to have resources to win a contract and the firm or client knows what time the work will be coming.

===Format===
Proposals are based on research, making it important for the researcher of the proposal to know about their client. The researcher must know the background of the idea that is being presented and show that he or she is well prepared to deal with a problem or situation their client has. The research for a company, institute, firm, etc. is done in advance, thereby increasing the chances of a well done proposal and the reader of the proposal will have a good idea of the outcome from the research that has been done. A general format for proposals includes the title page, abstract, scholarly statement of the problem and the method to solve it, the budget, and biographical information.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” Journal of Business Communication. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 Apr. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
As small as it may seem, it is important that the title page be curt and definite. It would be a good idea to use key words for the purpose of indexing as long as it written in a relevant pattern.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Abstract===
This part of the proposal should state the situation, method, goal, scope, and the expected outcome. It usually consists of 200 words. Carl B. Palmer, Chief of Sponsored Research, Grants and Research Contracts, Office Space Science, and NASA says that the summary of an abstract has to be “short, lean, and all muscle.” He also points out that managers usually take a short glance at the abstract and will only concentrate on the proposal itself if a message comes through.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Statement and method===
It is important to highlight the main idea that is being presented. First the writer of the proposal should state what the idea is and do something to make it unique. Next, the writer should explain what to do with the idea. Be sure to avoid phrases such as: “No one has thought of doing this before” or “This is entirely original.” Doing so, will make the writer seem dull and inattentive.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Budget===
The writer of the proposal includes the grant and the total amounts of money it is going to be paid by it. It is stressed that the pay scale must be compatible with the company's scale. The money of researchers is part of a single person's company salary and because of this, a business is required to take away some of the duties of a researcher. The writer includes the estimated costs of disposable materials, equipment, and supplies. This part of the proposal would also consist of travel, publication costs, and direct costs.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13–20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical information===
This part of the proposal basically deals with proving to the client that the person writing and submitting the proposal is capable of doing the job. Everyone that contributed to the making of the proposal is mentioned, including their achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, a proposal uses persuasion to get its audience to buy into their idea. One example is when a proposal tries to persuade one or more sponsors to invest in a project. Another example of using a proposal to persuade a client is when the company writing the proposal is asking for a grant.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Proposal Planning &amp; Writing. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The categories that can involve grants include social services, health care, religions, philanthropy, economic development, government, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. ''Proposal Planning &amp; Writing''. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Persuasion can only work when these components are involved; sponsor values, applicant credibility, proposal logics, and proposal psychologics. Another way to make proposals persuasive is to connect the ideas of a project to the sponsor's values or problems of interest.

===Sponsor values===
Sponsors or grantmakers main focuses include any specific dilemma, inequities or injustices. Their mission is to fill in the space between the categories of  “what is” and “what ought to be.” One example is an organization trying to prevent child abuse called The Prevent Abuse Foundation. Their activities include giving support to families and children and teaching about the abuse and how to eliminate it. In addition to this, the foundation serves grass roots, community-based groups with technical and professional assistance, sharing the best program practices and evaluation techniques.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Models of Proposal Planning &amp;Writing. Connecticut. Praeger Publishers. 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applicant credibility===
An applicant's job is to authorize organizational, individual, and project credibility. When an organization is proposing an idea to be presented by a project director, it is important for them to have credibility. Being persuasive is also one of the keys to success. An organization would try to convince its target of how different and unique it is from any other company. One example is a biology department at a university asking for money to do research in genetics. The department may go on to say that it has had 30 years of medical studies in biology and that their research inspects both hormonal and genetic elements that causes gene regulation.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal logics===
This basically deals with the making of proposal elements that illustrates an identified gap, an improved situation, and resulting benefits to the intended population. Benefits serve as the good things that will happen by completing the objectives that are presented. The components must reflect a relationship between the sponsor values and the project that is being proposed. An exact description of the problem or need is required along with the purpose of the organization, funds and how to complete the objections. It also includes a timeline and a summarization of  the intended audience.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal psychologies===
Sponsors would usually provide money for both psychological and logical reasons. Proposal psychologics tend to the emotional needs of the sponsor. The components that can be found in a successful proposal include passion, ownership, energy, trust, and commitment. Sponsors use grants as investments. Sponsors need to feel that you are serious about helping them with their problems. One example can be a proposal to a federal agency and a private college that describes its long history of achievement by working with community partners, controlling national programs that helps the intended population, and institutionalizing project activities. The project partners have worked with grant related initiatives which includes a six-year joint teacher education program among the Midwestern Regional College and the College of Native Americans. The ideas the project director has for Native American middle school kids includes Achievement in Math, Math and Science Immersion and Kids Math Camp.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;
As long as a proposal expresses interest and concern for the values and ideal of the sponsor, there is a good chance for success.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

The '''Remington Rand strike of 1936–37''' was a strike by a [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|federal union]] affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) against the [[Remington Rand]] company. The strike began in May 1936 and ended in April 1937, although the strike settlement would not be fully implemented until mid-1940.

The strike is notorious for spawning the "[[Mohawk Valley formula]]," a corporate plan for [[strikebreaking]] to discredit [[trade union|union]] leaders, frighten the public with the threat of violence, use local police and vigilantes to intimidate strikers, form puppet associations of "loyal employees" to influence public debate, fortify workplaces, employ large numbers of [[strikebreaker]]s, and threaten to close the plant if work is not resumed.  The Mohawk Valley formula was described in an article by company president [[James Rand, Jr.]], and published in the ''National Association of Manufacturers Labor Relations Bulletin'' in the fourth month of the strike.  The article was widely disseminated in pamphlet form by the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM) later that year.

In a landmark decision, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] called the Mohawk Valley formula "a battle plan for industrial war."&lt;ref&gt;Quote in "Glossary, History at the Department of Labor," U.S. Department of Labor, no date. The "Mohawk Valley formula" refers to the town of Ilion, New York, which is located in the [[Mohawk Valley]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In March 1934, the AFL began organizing skilled workers at two [[typewriter]] companies, [[Underwood Typewriter Company]] and Remington Rand.  The employees organized the District Council of Office Equipment Workers, a [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|federal union]] affiliated with the [[Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO|Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor]]. Six plants were organized in the towns of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]], [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in New York; in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; and in [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] and [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Rodden"&gt;Rodden, ''The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg"&gt;Stolberg, ''The Story of the CIO,'' 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Rand, Jr., president of [[Remington Rand]], refused to bargain with the union. On May 8, 1934, 6,500 workers struck to force the company to recognize the union and sign a [[collective bargaining]] agreement. On June 18, 1936, the firm recognized the union and signed a contract which provided wage increases and established a [[grievance]] procedure.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

Remington Rand, however, continued a policy of harassment and obstruction toward the union. It often violated the contract in small ways (forcing the union to file time-consuming and costly grievances), harassed union leaders, and generally contested the union at every turn.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medieval"&gt;"'Medieval, Shocking,' " ''Time,'' March 22, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1936, the District Council of Office Equipment Workers became the Remington Rand Joint Protective Board.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

==Beginning of the strike==
Worker anger had built high by May 1936, when the company spread rumors that its plants were being bought by an unknown firm that would no longer recognize the union. Remington Rand then announced it had purchased a typewriter plant in nearby [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] and might close the Tonawanda and Syracuse facilities. The union demanded information on possible plant closures, which the company refused.

The union then threatened a strike. In retaliation, the company distributed its own strike ballots and claimed that it alone could speak for workers. Outraged union officials seized and destroyed the company's ballots, interrupted and broke up meetings at which ballots were handed out, and harassed and physically intimidated managers trying to conduct balloting.&lt;ref&gt;"Syracuse Shop Shut by Remington Rand,"  ''Associated Press,'' May 22, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reshuffle"&gt;"Rand Reshuffle," ''Time,'' June 22, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB"&gt;''Remington Rand, Inc.'', 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Board quickly held its own strike vote. More than 75% of the union's members voted to strike. Union officials asked the company to submit the dispute to a federal mediator, but the company refused to do so. Instead, Remington Rand fired the presidents of the local unions in Tonawanda and Syracuse along with fifteen other union activists. Infuriated workers in Ilion, Syracuse and Tonawanda walked off their jobs on May 25, 1936, followed by Remington Rand workers in Ohio and Connecticut the following day.&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strike in 6 Plants of Remington Rand," ''New York Times,'' May 26, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded"&gt;"Six Rand Factories Guarded in Strike," ''New York Times,'' May 27, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence during the strike==
The Remington Rand strike was a particularly violent strike.  Although no one died during the strike, both sides{{qn|date=December 2012}} engaged in beatings with fists and clubs, rock and brick throwing, vandalism, threats and physical intimidation. But historians and federal officials point out that the company went out of its way to antagonize workers and use private security personnel (sometimes disguised as workers) to instigate violence and riots. The record before the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) and the scholarly literature show that the level of violence in the strike was deliberately manipulated by Remington Rand, and was several orders of magnitude higher than it would have been had the company not taken the actions it did.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medieval" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering"&gt;"'Whispering' Used to Break Ranks," ''New York Times.'' November 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable incidents include:
*In mid-June 1936, the company sent 100 strikebreakers through the picket line toward the front gate of the plant in Tonawanda.  The company deliberately withdrew its protection of the workers when they reached the picket line. A fight broke out between the strikebreakers and the 500 picketers. Tonawanda police, waiting nearby, descended on the picketers and beat hundreds with [[Club (weapon)|billy-clubs]].&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;
*Beginning July 3, 1936, a four-day running riot began around the Middletown, Ohio, plant.  The riot began when the company attempted to bring hundreds of strikebreakers through the picket lines unprotected. Over the following two days, workers hurled stones at strikebreakers, keeping them from entering the plant. When the company attempted to bring the workers in on buses on July 7, workers seized and boarded the buses, then forced the strikebreakers off the buses. Two were parked at the plant gates and torn apart. A third was chased by police through the streets of the town, only to crash on the lawn in front of City Hall.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HalfDozen"&gt;"Half Dozen Beaten in Rand Strike Riot," ''Associated Press,'' July 4, 1936; "Workers Stoned in Ohio Rand Strike," ''Associated Press,'' July 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"3 Buses Wrecked by Rand Strikers," ''Associated Press,'' July 8, 1936; "Deadlock Persists in Ohio," ''Associated Press,'' July 12, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On July 24, 1936, striking workers threw home-made bombs at plants in Middletown and Syracuse, injuring one policeman. The bombs did only minor damage.&lt;ref&gt;"Policeman Hurt By Strike Bomb at Rand Plant," ''United Press International,'' July 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 12, 1936, Syracuse police shot and injured two strikers, leading the governor of the state to threaten to bring in the [[New York Army National Guard|National Guard]] unless local authorities showed more restraint.&lt;ref name="Rand Strike 1936"&gt;"2 Shot in Rand Strike," ''Associated Press,'' August 13, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 22, 1936, striking workers at the Middletown plant hurled large iron balls at police, injuring four.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;"4 Hurt in Rioting at Rand Factory," ''Associated Press,'' August 23, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike tactics==
The Remington Rand strike is notable for the wide array of aggressive anti-union tactics employed by the employer. The [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) documented these tactics in a 120-page decision, ''Remington Rand, Inc.'', 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937).  The tactics used were not merely inventive (although some had been used by employers before), but, as the NLRB argued, were specifically designed and utilized to undermine the democratic process, manipulate public opinion through deceit and terror, and violate federal law.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;

===Plant closures===
With the union out on strike, Remington Rand quickly began consolidating its plants. The company later admitted that it had long wanted to close several of its plants, but that the union was too strong and would not have permitted it.  Remington Rand contracted with [[millwright]]s several months before the strike began (discussions which courts and federal agencies later interpreted as a sign of the company's bad-faith bargaining) to dismantle the plants.  Within days of the strike's commencement, Remington Rand contractors began crating plant machinery in Middletown, Syracuse and Tonawanda. Workers tried blocking the millwrights and trucks from entering and leaving the plant but were mostly unsuccessful. Strikers subsequently pelted trucks with stones, bricks and bottles, or laid iron spikes in the roadway to puncture the tires of trucks.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Rand Moves Machines," ''New York Times,'' June 5, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Acquitted"&gt;"Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking," ''New York Times,'' November 19, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misleading information about plant closures was also common. When the strike began, the [[List of mayors of Syracuse, New York|mayor of Syracuse]] met with Rand and won Rand's personal reassurance that the company would not close the plant.  But Rand planned exactly that, and his lie was designed to win backing of city officials for the company's anti-union campaign. The company also often placed "For Sale" signs in front of factories or announced their closing in advertisements. In some cases, the company went so far as to hire private security guards to pose as millwrights to support its claim that it was closing plants.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, ''From Blackjacks to Briefcases,'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Announcements of plant closures were designed to demoralize striking union members and frighten workers who had remained on the job into staying. They also were used to terrorize local citizens who feared for the economic life of their towns.  Often, company officials would later make statements suggesting that the plant would stay open if the union gave up the strike, statements which encouraged local citizens to put intense emotional, political and economic pressure on the union.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders"&gt;"U.S. Board Orders Remington Rand to Re-Employ 4,000," ''New York Times,'' March 15, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Threatens"&gt;"Threatens to Close a Remington Plant." ''Associated Press,'' June 13, 1936; "Remington Rand Drops 3 Plants," ''Associated Press,'' June 14, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of private security forces===
Remington Rand also hired very large numbers of private security forces to protect its property and attempt to re-open some facilities.  The company had engaged in extensive pre-strike planning with "detective agencies" (a euphemism for private security guard companies) in all its locations. In discussions with these firms, the company clearly conveyed the attitude that it had every intention of provoking a strike in order to break the union, and would not engage in good-faith bargaining.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt; One company which provided private security forces, led by Pearl Bergoff, received $25,850.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand, Bergoff and Chowderhead," ''Time,'' December 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Remington Rand claimed it had to hire its own private police forces to protect its property and the strikebreakers.  But the union and local officials argued that Remington Rand's real goal was to foment trouble. As Middletown Mayor Leo Santangelo pointed out: "There were more policemen outside than there were men wanting to come in."&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

===Support of local law enforcement===
Remington Rand also relied heavily on local police and specially-sworn county sheriff's deputies to provide protection. Several months before the strike began, the company informed local officials that it intended to provoke the union and would need the cooperation of local officials. Many enthusiastically did so, believing that the company would close its plants (harming the city's tax base) if they did not.  In Syracuse, for example, the mayor gave the company unlimited police protection.  Where local officials resisted the company's request for help, Remington Rand intimidated them into offering assistance.  The mayor of Ilion later admitted that he was forced to provide police protection: His own personal banker had threatened to call in his loans and delete his personal and business lines of credit, and a "citizens' committee" formed by the company threatened to institute a boycott against his business and a slander campaign against him personally if he did not cooperate.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PoliceProtect"&gt;"Police Will Protect Remington Workers," ''New York Times,'' May 28, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Syracuse Rand Plant Guarded," ''Associated Press,'' January 2, 1937; "Fear of 'Trouble' Attributed to Rand," ''Associated Press,'' November 9, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local law enforcement personnel played a particularly important role in terrorizing the population of Ilion and turning public opinion against the union. Remington Rand paid [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] to deputize 300 special sheriff's deputies to provide protection for company and town property. Remington Rand armed the deputies with Remington handguns and billy-clubs, and bought civilian automobiles to serve as squad cars. While these deputies and the town police remained under the control of their respective governmental authorities, the company worked closely with county and town officials to heighten tensions within the town.  Squads of six sheriff's deputies and one police officer were armed with shotguns and stationed at every road and path leading into the town. Local citizens had to obtain passes from the Remington Rand company to enter the town. Later, company officials disingenuously accused local police of using kid gloves on strikers, which gave local police the political cover they needed to increase the level of violence aimed at picketers.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Urges Police Club Syracuse Rioters," ''Associated Press,'' June 12, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Expose"&gt;"Union 'Expose' Used in Breaking Strike," ''New York Times,'' November 26, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of strikebreakers===
Remington Rand also fired all striking workers and replaced them with permanent replacements. Initially, few replacement workers were willing to take the company up on its offer. The union ringed each plant with thousands of workers, family members and supporters, and few replacement employees were willing to run the gauntlet of angry, sometimes violent union members.  Others feared reprisals against them and their families if they took work at the plant. At first, Remington Rand gave security guards a $5 a day bonus if they successfully made it past the picketers and into the plant, where they pretended to be workers.&lt;ref&gt;"Incited Violence, Strike Guards Say," ''Associated Press,'' September 24, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; But the company soon began offering large bonuses for replacement workers, and in the depths of the [[Great Depression]] few people could afford to turn down work.&lt;ref name="Acquitted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Offers Bonus for 800 Workers," ''New York Times,'' June 6, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misinformation===
Remington Rand also made a significant number of false and misleading statements designed to mislead the media, demoralize strikers and reassure investors. Sixteen days into the strike, for example, company president James Rand announced an end to the strike at all six plants, a statement which roiled the union and led hundreds of workers to mistakenly accuse elected union leaders of selling out.{{qn|date=December 2012}} In fact, no agreement had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand is Optimistic on Strike Trends," ''New York Times.'' June 11, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Remington Rand announced that workers in Ohio had returned to work under a new collective bargaining agreement which offered highly favorable terms. The announcement demoralized workers in New York and Connecticut, and raised suspicions about the competence and reliability of union leaders. The truth was that only 21 of the 911 workers at the plant had accepted these terms, and they had not supported the strike.&lt;ref name="Reopens"&gt;"Rand Plant Reopens," ''Associated Press,'' June 30, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Remington Rand officials falsely claimed that 5,300 of the company's workers had crossed picket lines and were back at work.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed"&gt;"Rand Pickets Curbed," ''Associated Press,'' July 19, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tonawanda, the company planted a rumor among the picketers that several union members were returning to work. The company then hired 85 security guards to impersonate these "returning workers," and armed them with bricks and clubs. When a pitched battle broke out between the impersonators and picketers, company photographers took pictures of the near-riot. The company shipped the security guards out of town that night and turned the photos over to the local newspapers—which duly printed them as "proof" that "labor goons" had attacked "honest working men."&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt; The corporation then used this incident to manipulate a state court into imposing a [[temporary injunction]] against the strikers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Misinformation was also used to frighten local citizens and manipulate public opinion. For example, on June 9, 1936, Remington Rand announced that it had employed 500 strikebreakers to resume production at its plant in Syracuse. In fact, the company had hired no replacement workers at all.  Working behind the scenes with the company, the local police then announced a major increase in the number of police protecting the Remington Rand plant.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hiring 500 to End Syracuse Strike." ''Associated Press.'' June 10, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; When violence died down in Ohio, President Rand announced he would "hire 1,000 men if necessary" to protect the plant.  Angry union members reinforced their pickets, and when Rand attempted to bring even a small number of guards to the plant they were pelted with stones—leading to the violence Rand had claimed already existed.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rand to Guard Plant," ''Associated Press,'' August 18, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other tactics===
The Remington Rand company also worked with local courts to influence the outcome of the strike.  The company used relationships and ''[[ex parte]]'' communications with judges prior to the strike to ensure that strikers would be dealt with harshly, although the number of these cases appears to be limited. In Syracuse, for example, two teenaged girls were sentenced to 30 days in jail for merely waving a rubber rat at replacement workers. In Middletown, local judges handed down six-month prison sentences to a large number of picketers based solely on the testimony of two Remington Rand security guards. In many cases, however, the company manipulated events to ensure that [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] judges would impose the maximum sentence or the outcome the company desired.  Remington Rand often incited picketers to riot. Working with local law enforcement officials, the company would then present evidence in court implicating workers but not management. This manipulation of the judicial system often led judges to severely restrict union picketing near company property. In New York, for example, a federal judge limited picketing to only four workers at a time, and all workers had to wear a large badge identifying themselves as such. (Nearly two years later, federal investigations exposed the company-law enforcement collusion.)&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hear Rand Strike Charge," ''Associated Press,'' July 1, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand also formed "citizens' committees" controlled by the company to put additional pressure on the union. Federal investigators later found that these citizens' committees were founded and funded by the company, and used to intimidate businessmen, banks and others into withdrawing support from or opposing the striking workers. In New York, for example, landlords raised the rent of strikers to put pressure on them to return to work.  Citizens' committees also put political pressure on local elected officials, bringing local and county law enforcement under the control of the firm.  In Ohio, local officials order law enforcement personnel to padlock and seal local union offices after minor pretextual complaints by company officials. In Elmira, the mayor ordered the police to ban circulation of the local labor newspaper. Citizens' committees were also used to secretly manipulate public opinion against the union and its members. Unaware of the true nature of these committees, the media often reported their demands for an end to the strike or denunciations of union "violence" – which encouraged the public to turn against the strikers.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, "Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict," ''Public Opinion Quarterly,'' March 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand also engaged in threats and intimidation. The company hired at least 80 men and women to pose as religious missionaries, and had these individuals visit strikers' homes. Once in the home, the "missionary" would harangue the family and demand that the breadwinner return to work. In other cases, groups of company employees posing as "concerned citizens" would mass in front of strikers' homes and demand that the worker abandon the picket line, leave town, or return to work.  These activities were often coordinated with company back-to-work campaigns and reinforced by mistaken media reports of large numbers of picket-line crossings.&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

==Events during the strike==
Largely unprepared for the strike, the union was able to win at least one early battle against Remington Rand.  The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor of the state of New York, [[Herbert H. Lehman]], refused to allow the [[New York State Police]] to intervene in the strike, despite the company's demands.&lt;ref&gt;"Lehman Bars State Police in the Rand Strike," ''New York Times,'' June 6, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand began its misinformation campaign immediately. In mid-June, Remington Rand threatened to close its plants in Middletown, Norwood, Syracuse, and Tonawanda unless workers returned to work immediately. Politicians pleaded with union officials to end the strike.&lt;ref name="Threatens" /&gt; A few days later, Remington Rand announced (incorrectly) that union leaders in Ohio had accepted an offer to return to work. The announcement created deep divisions between leaders and members in the union, and between union chapters in the various plants. However, only 21 workers out of 911 had accepted the offer, and most of those had not been union members.&lt;ref name="Reshuffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reopens" /&gt;

On July 6, the union held a mass demonstration in Syracuse in support of workers in Ohio who had rioted over the previous days. Despite the size of the Syracuse riot, company officials declared the strike "definitely broken."&lt;ref name="HalfDozen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstration at Syracuse." ''Associated Press.'' July 7, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, a federal judge significantly restricted union picketing at Remington Rand's plants in New York. The union was limited to only four picketing workers at a time, and all picketers had to wear large badges identifying themselves as union members.&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt; Federal officials later determined that the violence which led the court to impose the injunction had been instigated by Remington Rand.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;

On July 22, Governor [[Wilbur L. Cross]] of Connecticut asked Governor [[Martin L. Davey]] of Ohio and Governor Lehman of New York to meet with him and Rand's president to discuss an end to the strike. Despite interest from the governors and union, Cross abandoned his plan for a tri-state arbitration committee after a spate of violence at Remington Rand plants and receiving a host of pre-conditions from Rand himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Asks Typewriter Co. Strike Parley," ''United Press International,'' July 23, 1936; "Asks Rand Strike Parley," ''Associated Press,'' July 23, 1936; "Lehman Backs Cross in Rand Peace Move," ''New York Times,'' July 24, 1936; "New Violence Marks Strike in Rand Plants," ''Associated Press,'' July 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union won a few skirmishes in the strike in August 1936. New York Governor Lehman ordered a special session of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate division of the New York Supreme Court]] to hear an emergency appeal of a state court ruling granting an injunction against the union under the State Anti-Injunction Law of 1935. The appeal was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;"Lehman Summons Court in Rand Case," ''New York Times,'' August 1, 1936; "Rand Strike Writ Upheld on Appeal," ''New York Times,'' August 19, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; After a fresh outbreak of violence in Syracuse on August 11, in which two strikers were shot and injured by local police, Governor Lehman threatened to replace policemen with National Guard troops unless local law enforcement authorities proved capable of more restraint.&lt;ref name="Rand Strike 1936"/&gt;

Contract talks begin in earnest in late July 1936, three months into the strike. The AFL had filed a variety of [[unfair labor practice]] (ULPs) charges against Remington Rand, but the company had won a temporary injunction halting any NLRB hearings on the ULPs in mid-July.&lt;ref name="PicketsCurbed" /&gt; Remington Rand officials were particularly concerned that NLRB hearings would expose their anti-union tactics. Company officials, worried that the [[United States Supreme Court]] and other federal courts would uphold the [[National Labor Relations Act]], began negotiations as a fall-back strategy. Those negotiations collapsed on September 2, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Strike Talks End," ''Associated Press,'' September 3, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point in the strike came 10 days later. [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|U.S. district court]] Judge John Knight lifted the temporary injunction and ordered the NLRB to proceed with its ULP hearings.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Concern Loses Plea for Injunction," ''Associated Press,'' September 13, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB hearings, as well as [[United States Senate]] hearings into strikebreaking in general, began in late September. Evidence of the extensive anti-union campaign in the Remington Rand strike became public in late November 1936, and made national headlines.&lt;ref name="Whispering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expose" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Strikebreaking Services,'' S. Report 6, Part I, Committee on Education and Labor, U.S. Senate, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1937, public exposure of the Remington Rand company's anti-union efforts had led to a significant deterioration in the firm's public support. The company did not cut back on its efforts, and rumor-mongering about plant closures and to demoralize workers was still effective. But public opinion and media opinion proved much harder to manipulate, and many elected officials were quietly withdrawing support for the company.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;

On March 11, 1937, United States Secretary of Labor [[Frances Perkins]] attempted to mediate an end to the strike. When Perkins attempted to reach Rand by telephone, his aides claimed to not know where he was.  When Perkins sent him telegrams and letters, company staff said they did not know how to reach him. Perkins was forced to publish an open letter in newspapers in Connecticut, New York and Ohio, asking Rand to speak to her.  He did so the next day, but refused to discuss the strike with her. The incident embarrassed and angered Perkins, but Rand's rudeness further eroded the company's public standing.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Perkins Writes Open Letter to Rand," ''Associated Press,'' March 12, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 1937, the NLRB issued a decision finding Remington Rand guilty of violating federal labor law. The decision, ''Remington Rand, Inc.,'' 2 NLRB 626, was an astonishing 120-page decision in which the Board recounted nearly every anti-union tactic the company had undertaken in the last year. The Board accused Rand of putting himself above the law and wantonly violating the National Labor Relations Act. The Board's discussion of Remington Rand's actions was cast in moral terms. Although many of the actions were not necessarily illegal, the Board was deeply distressed that the company and its president would engage in behavior which, in the Board's view, constituted open economic and class warfare. The NLRB ordered Remington Rand to reinstate, with back pay, the union members who had been discharged, to reinstate all workers still on strike, to dismantle its company unions, and recognize the union in its six existing plants as well as the new plant in Elmira.&lt;ref name="Rodden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoardOrders" /&gt;

Rand refused to obey the NLRB order. Instead, the same day that the Board issued its opinion, he agreed to meet with Perkins and discuss the strike.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand to Discuss Strike," ''Associated Press,'' March 13, 1937; "Remington Rand Defies U.S. Board," ''New York Times,'' March 16, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB's ruling, however, placed the company in a difficult legal position, and Remington Rand quickly reached an agreement with the union after a short session mediated by Perkins. Terms of the agreement were not released for a month.&lt;ref name="Approve"&gt;"Approve Rand Peace Plan," ''New York Times,'' April 21, 1937; "Strikers Approve Rand Peace Terms," ''New York Times,'' April 22, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLRB immediately sought a federal court ruling ordering Remington Rand to obey its orders.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Case Taken to Court by NLRB," ''Associated Press,'' March 18, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand's position in the strike worsened when a federal grand jury indicted James Rand, Jr., and [[Pearl Bergoff]], owner of Bergoff Industrial Service (a strikebreaking "detective agency"), of violating the [[Byrnes Act]], a federal law enacted in 1936 which forbade the interstate transportation of strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Jury to Hear Remington-Rand Case," ''Associated Press,'' April 11, 1937; "Rand and Bergoff Indicted by Federal Jury For Putting Strike-Breakers in Middletown," ''New York Times,'' April 13, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 1937, union members approved a settlement with Remington Rand permitting all workers to return to their jobs.  Initially, some workers refused to agree to the pact, but a month's lobbying by the AFL led to overwhelming passage.&lt;ref name="Approve" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strike Peace Delayed." ''New York Times.'' March 21, 1937; "Rehiring Is Ordered By Remington Rand," ''New York Times,'' April 20, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand and Bergoff were acquitted of violating the Byrnes Act on November 18, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Shaplen, "Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking," ''New York Times,'' November 19, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand, however, continued to resist the NLRB's order. But on February 14, 1938, Judge [[Learned Hand]], writing for a unanimous court, ruled in ''National Labor Relations Board v. Remington Rand, Inc.'' [[Case citation|94 F.2d 862]] (1938), that the company must obey the terms of the NLRB's decision.&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Denies Writ to Labor Board Against Remington-Rand in Labor Row," ''Associated Press,'' July 1, 1937; "Court Tells Rand to Recognize A.F.L.," ''Associated Press,'' February 15, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Remington Rand appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to grant [[certiorari]], thereby upholding the appellate court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;''Remington Rand v. National Labor Relations Board,'' cert denied, [[Case citation|304 U.S. 576]] (1938); "Remington Rand Appeals," ''Associated Press,'' April 17, 1938; "6,000 in Rand Units Strike Over Court," ''Associated Press,'' June 2, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand began slowly furloughing strikebreakers after the Supreme Court's refusal to hear its case.&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Rand Warned By Court," ''Associated Press,'' June 5, 1938; "Rand to Oust 800, Rehire Strikers," ''Associated Press,'' June 9, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the strike==
Another two years would pass before the NLRB's order in ''Remington Rand, Inc.'' would be fully implemented.

During the strike, Remington Rand had established [[company union]]s at all its plants.  Now the AFL and these company unions battled one another to represent the workers at the firm. In late June 1938, the company union demanded an immediate NLRB election to determine whether employees should continue to have a union or not.  The AFL argued that no election was appropriate until all striking workers had been rehired.  The two sides battled repeatedly over the election issue, and in October 1938 announced an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Ask Rand Vote at Once," ''Associated Press,'' June 26, 1938; "Rand Peace Reported," ''Associated Press,'' October 11, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington Rand refused to implement the terms of the agreement, however.  In August 1939 the company union again petitioned the NLRB to hold elections to determine whether employees wished to have a union or not. The union filed a series of ULPs in September and October, leading to another round of NLRB hearings.  The situation deteriorated so badly that union members in Tonawanda struck in early April 1940.  The strike spread and violence quickly broke out.  Unwilling to undergo another large strike, Remington Rand agreed to dismantle its company unions on April 8, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"NLRB Vote Is Asked By Remington Rand," ''Associated Press,'' August 8, 1939; "Stay Asked Against NLRB," ''Associated Press,'' October 3, 1939; "Rand Offers Labor Peace," ''Associated Press,'' March 29, 1940; "Rand Strike Spreads," ''Associated Press,'' April 6, 1940; "Rand-A.F.L. Strife Settled by NLRB," April 9, 1940; "Rand Striker Held in Shooting," ''Associated Press,'' April 10, 1940; "Orders Rand Mediation," ''Associated Press,'' April 11, 1940; "Remington Rand Strike Ends," ''Associated Press,'' May 3, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the series of agreements with the AFL and the NLRB, Remington Rand continued to resist implementing the court's order. On June 4, 1940, the NLRB filed suit against the company seeking to have it declared in contempt of court.  Remington Rand had enough, and on June 30, 1940, agreed to dismantle its company unions and recognize the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;"Rand Plant Shut," ''Associated Press,'' June 5, 1940; "Remington Rand, Inc., Bows to NLRB Order," ''New York Times,'' June 30, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Mohawk Valley formula"==
{{main|Mohawk Valley formula}}
The June 1936 issue of the NAM's ''Labor Relations Bulletin'' immortalized the "Mohawk Valley formula" as a classic blueprint for [[union busting]].  The nine-point formula, as devised by James Rand, Jr., is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Rodden, ''The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When a strike is threatened, label the union leaders as "agitators" to discredit them with the public and their own followers. Conduct balloting under the foremen to ascertain the strength of the union and to make possible misrepresentation of the strikers as a small minority. Exert economic pressure through threats to move the plant, align bankers, real estate owners and businessmen into a "Citizens' Committee."
# Raise high the banner of "law and order", thereby causing the community to mass legal and police weapons against imagined violence and to forget that employees have equal right with others in the community.
# Call a "mass meeting" to coordinate public sentiment against the strike and strengthen the Citizens' Committee.
# Form a large police force to intimidate the strikers and exert a psychological effect. Utilize local police, state police, vigilantes and special deputies chosen, if possible, from other neighborhoods.
# Convince the strikers their cause is hopeless with a "back-to-work" movement by a puppet association of so-called "loyal employees" secretly organized by the employer.
# When enough applications are on hand, set a date for opening the plant by having such opening requested by the puppet "back-to-work" association.
# Stage the "opening" theatrically by throwing open the gates and having the employees march in a mass protected by squads of armed police so as to dramatize and exaggerate the opening and heighten the demoralizing effect.
# Demoralize the strikers with a continuing show of force. If necessary turn the locality into a warlike camp and barricade it from the outside world.
# Close the publicity barrage on the theme that the plant is in full operation and the strikers are merely a minority attempting to interfere with the "right to work". With this, the campaign is over—the employer has broken the strike.

'''Rideau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|d|oʊ}} {{respell|REE|doh}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁido}}) Recognition is a private, North American based company that provides corporate and governmental recognition programs and products. Founded in 1912 as the Stephenson Company, the company has undergone several buyouts and ventures in different geographical markets. Rideau was the first [[Canada|Canadian]] company to produce the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]], as well as the first Canadian company to be granted its own [[Coat of Arms]] by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority|The Heraldic Authority]].

==History==
[[Image:Rideau Hall04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rideau Hall]], the company's [[namesake]]]]

===Growth and Transition===
In 1912 the Stephenson Company, situated on Saint-Maurice Street in [[old Montreal]], began as a producer of emblematic jewelry for associations such as the [[Freemasonry|Masons]], the [[Knights of Columbus]], and other organizations. During [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], the company produced military insignia for the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Rideau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rideau.com/en/about_history.asp |title=Rideau History |accessdate=2009-01-16 |publisher= Rideau}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the mid 50’s the company's shares were sold to a U.S.-based company that moved Stephenson Company's headquarters to [[Montreal north|Montreal North]]. The company was later sold back to two Montrealers who had numerous business interests but nevertheless, Stephenson went into a steady state of decline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

By 1968, The Stephenson Company was almost bankrupt and was reduced to a staff of five. In that same year, Stephenson was purchased by Ed and Phyllis Hart.&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; Its largest customer was [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon Cosmetics]], which used the company's awards to help incentivize its sales force.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the 1970s Avon began selling Stephenson's jewelry door-to-door along with its traditional [[cosmetics]], which proved successful and helped both Avon and Stephenson flourish.&lt;ref name="Fix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/profit100/2008/success-stories/article.aspx?id=20080601_198708_198708 |title=Mr. Fix It |accessdate=2009-02-26 |publisher= Canadian Business Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Harts partnered with Maurice Bradden of D’Orlan Jeweler’s, helping to launch its manufacturing capabilities on the European continent in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The facility produced [[Nina Ricci (brand)|Nina Ricci]] fashion jewelry in the European Common Market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1978, the Harts sold the operation to their four children and family friend&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; and continued to expand in Europe.  In 1979, The Stephenson company opened a subsidiary, The Jeweller's Guild, in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Jeweler's Guild sold fashion jewelry exclusively by mail order.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1980 other subsidiaries were set up in France, Holland and Germany and they too sold fashion jewelry by mail order.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Stephenson and its subsidiary companies did well until [[Modern economic history of UK#1979–1990: the Thatcher era|1982]], when the company's over-expansion coupled with the economic recession forced the company to change and reinvent itself.&lt;ref name="Fix"/&gt;
[[File:OrderofCanadaFemale.jpg|thumb|right|Rideau was the first [[Canadian]] company to produce the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]].]]
In 1983, the newly restructured Stephenson Company started producing the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]].&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; Up until The Stephenson company was granted permission to produce the award, it had been produced solely in [[England]] by [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|crown jeweler]] [[Garrard &amp; Co|Garrards of London]].&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, Christopher (2006). ''The Order of Canada'', p.196. [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto. {{ISBN|0-8020-3940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of [[Bruce W. Beatty|Bruce Beatty]], the chief designer of the [[Canadian Honours System]], the owners renamed the company ''Rideau'' to reflect their service the [[Governor General of Canada]], who resides in [[Rideau Hall]] in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, Christopher (2006). ''The Order of Canada'', p.336. [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto. {{ISBN|0-8020-3940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Rideau shifted its focus from government decorations and medals to their current focus of corporate recognition and point-based recognition solutions. In 2006, Rideau acquired Recognition Management Institute (RMI) a company whose focus was helping businesses grow by building relationships with their employees and customers. Rideau made an investment in analytic data (big data) research in 2008 and proved the link between employee recognition and company's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In that same year, RMI became "Vistance Learning". By 2012, the implementation of Vistance Analytics made Rideau the first data-driven recognition company. In 2015, Vistance was fully deployed within a major global financial services company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rideau.comj&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business under the Rideau name===
Towards the end of the 80’s promotional products and fashion jewelry were increasingly being off-shored to the Far East, so the company began focusing on corporate recognition programs. It began providing fully outsourced recognition programs to [[Royal Bank of Canada|RBC]], [[Scotiabank]], [[Bank of Montreal|BMO]], [[Molson]], [[Alcan]], [[Canadian Pacific]], and the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/profit100/2008/success-stories/article.aspx?id=20080601_198708_198708 |title= Canada's Fastest Growing Companies |accessdate=2009-01-16 |format= |publisher= ''[[Canadian Business]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Rideau Recognition became the first Canadian company to be granted its own [[Coat of Arms]] by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority|The Heraldic Authority]], bearing the [[Latin]] motto ''Opus excellentiae'' ("Impressions of excellence").&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt;

Rideau Recognition is also a sponsor of [[Recognition Professionals International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recognition.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=147 |title=Sponsorship |accessdate=2009-01-23 |publisher=[[Recognition Professionals International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions and Alliances===
In April 2006, Rideau Recognition announced their acquisition of Recognition Management Institute (RMI), a London, Ontario-based consulting organization specializing in training managers how to recognize and retain top employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com|title=Online Press Release Distribution Service - PRWeb|website=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Rideau Recognition executed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Birks Group, Inc. whereby Birks Group sold its corporate sales division, also known as "Birks Business" to Rideau for CAD $5.625 million (approximately USD $4.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;newswire.ca "Birks Group and Rideau announce strategic alliance: Rideau acquires Birks Corporate Sales Division and the two enter into supply and licensing agreements for Birks Business products"&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2017, Rideau acquired Pressed Metal Products, a Vancouver-based company that manufactures emblematic insignia jewelry, awards and medals.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rideau.com|title=Rideau Recognition Solutions|website=Rideau Recognition Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebranding===
In March 2017, Rideau Recognition underwent a rebranding which included a new logo, website, corporate signature and colors and a new Vistance platform and proprietary score called Recognition Quotient (RQ).&lt;ref&gt;newswire.ca "Rideau rallies behind 'Return on Recogniton' with newrobust Vistance platform and proprietary Recognition Quotient"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vistance===
Vistance Analytics &amp; Prescriptive Learning is a division of Rideau. Vistance Analytics analyzes the impact of recognition programs and employee perceptions on an organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Vistance Learning is a prescriptive online assessment and learning management system to help leaders improve their organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPI) through critical development, employee recognition and engagement skills.

The initial concept for Vistance was created in 2007 from a think tank of organizational psychologists and recognition experts hired by Rideau Recognition Solutions to determine whether employee recognition has a measurable impact on business outcomes.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"/&gt;

===Environmental Awareness===
Rideau Recognition is the first recognition firm to be certified as Carbon Neutral. The firm has been a participant and stakeholder to the United Nations Global Compact (UNCG) since 2005. Rideau has helped plant over 100,000 native trees and was the recipient of the Eterne Award in 2015.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"/&gt; This award is given to companies who support Tree Canada and exemplify the best in environmental stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;treecanada.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to repeat performance''' is a [[consumer]] right of [[Legal remedy|remedy]] created under section 55 of the UK [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents Consumer Rights Act 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides for a new right for a consumer to require a trader to perform a service again, if the trader is in breach of the agreed services contract or its implied terms, or to perform again such part of the service as is necessary in order to conform with the contract.

This right was created alongside a right to price reduction. The right to repeat performance takes priority unless performance cannot be repeated. A trader in breach of a services contract is obliged to repeat its performance within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer, and to bear any necessary costs in doing so.

It is possible to agree a contract which excludes the possibility of repeat performance.

This part of the Consumer Rights Act came into effect on 1 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-consumer-protection/2010-to-2015-government-policy-consumer-protection#appendix-8-consumer-rights-act-2015 2010 to 2015 government policy: consumer protection], accessed 24 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' [[Public Bill Committee]], an amendment was proposed by [[Stella Creasy]] MP, shadow minister for Business, Innovation and Skills:

:"Where the quality of provision of services has been deemed to be hazardous or so poor as to cause the consumer to reasonably lose confidence in the trader’s ability to provide services which they would wish to purchase, the consumer may refuse a repeat performance and exercise their right to price reduction...."

This amendment was withdrawn on assurances that existing [[common law]] and statutory remedies provide protection for consumers from traders who would unnecessarily endanger their personal safety, and especially that consumers would not be obliged to allow them back into their homes ever again if they do not feel happy with that.&lt;ref&gt;They work for you, [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2013-14/Consumer_Rights_Bill/11-0_2014-03-06a.2.0 Clause 55 - Right to repeat performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Cutler "Sam" Ward''' (January 27, 1814 — May 19, 1884),&lt;ref name="SCWObit1884"/&gt; was an American poet, politician, author, and gourmet, and in the years after the Civil War he was widely known as the "King of the Lobby." He combined delicious food, fine wines, and good conversation to create a new type of [[lobbying]] in Washington, DC — social lobbying — over which he reigned for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="nypl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ward, Samuel. Papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/collection/pdf_finding_aid/wards.pdf|website=archives.nypl.org|publisher=[[The New York Public Library]]|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sam was born in New York City into an old New England family and was the eldest of seven children. His father, [[Samuel Ward (banker)|Samuel Ward III]], was a highly respected banker with the firm of [[Prime, Ward &amp; King]]. His grandfather, Col. [[Samuel Ward, Jr.]] (1756—1832), was a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Sam's mother, Julia Rush Cutler, was related to [[Francis Marion]], the "Swamp Fox" of the American Revolution.

When Sam's mother died while he was a student at the [[Round Hill School]] in Northampton, Massachusetts, his father became morbidly obsessed with his children's moral, spiritual, and physical health. It wasn't until he was a student at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], where he joined the [[Philolexian Society]] and from which he graduated in 1831, that he began to learn about the wider world.

The more he learned, the less he wanted to become a banker. He convinced his father first to let him study in Europe. He stayed for four years, mastering several languages, enjoying high society, earning a doctorate degree from the [[University of Tübingen]], and, in [[Heidelberg]], meeting [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], who became his friend for life. Sam literally dined out for decades on stories of his experiences during these years.

==Career==
He returned to New York, married Emily Astor, the eldest daughter of businessman [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.]], in January 1838 and tried to settle into the life of a young banker.

His father, Samuel Ward III, died unexpectedly in November 1839.  Next, Sam's brother Henry died suddenly of typhoid fever.  In February 1841, his wife gave birth to a son, but within days both she and the newborn died.  Sam was executor of his father's several-million-dollar estate, partner now in a prestigious banking firm, guardian of his three sisters, a widower, father of a toddler, and 27 years old.

He remarried in 1843, and urged on by his new wife, Sam began speculating on Wall Street. In September 1847, the financial world was stunned by news that Prime, Ward and Co. (King had wisely withdrawn) had collapsed.

===California gold rush===
Broke, Sam joined the [[California Gold Rush|'49ers]] rushing to California. He opened a store on the San Francisco waterfront; plowed his profits into real estate; claimed he made a quarter of a million dollars in three months; and lost it all when fire destroyed his wharves and warehouses. For a time he operated a ferry in the California wilderness; he alluded to mysterious schemes in [[Mexico]] and South America; and he bobbed up in New York a wealthy man again.

He plunged back into speculating and lost all of his money again, and with it went Medora's affection. This time he finagled a berth on a diplomatic mission to [[Paraguay]]. When he sailed home in 1859, he brought with him a secret agreement with the [[president of Paraguay]] to lobby on that country's behalf and headed to Washington, DC, to begin a new career.

===Washington, D.C.===
Sam was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with many friends and family in the South. He also believed in gradual emancipation, which put him at odds with his sister, [[Julia Ward Howe|Julia Ward]], who would later write "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]," and her husband, [[Samuel Gridley Howe]]. But there was no question that he would remain loyal to the Union. He put his dinner table at the disposal of his neighbor Secretary of State [[William Henry Seward]]. His elegant meals, which had already begun to be noticed, provided the perfect cover for Northerners and Southerners looking for neutral ground. In the early days of the war, Sam also traveled through the Confederacy with British journalist [[William Howard Russell]], secretly sending letters full of military details back to Seward for which he surely would have been hanged or shot if exposed.

In 1862, he told Seward he was wrong to think that the Confederacy would have rejoined the Union had war been averted:  "I differ from you.  I found among the leaders a malignant bitterness and contemptuous hatred of the North which rendered this lesson necessary.  within two years they would have formed entangling free trade and free navigation treaties with Europe, and have become a military power hostile to us."&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, Allan. ''The War for the Union'', vol. 1, ''The Improvised War, 1861-1862'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the war's end, Sam's friends in high places, his ''savoir faire,'' his trove of anecdotes and recipes, and his talents for diplomacy augured well for his success in Washington, where the coals were hot and ready for an era of unprecedented growth and corruption that became known as "the Great Barbeque" or [[Gilded Age|"The Gilded Age."]]

His entrée into the Johnson administration was Secretary of the Treasury [[Hugh McCulloch]], who, faced with the colossal task of financial reconstruction, turned for help to Sam, who won for him a partial victory via cookery. Soon Sam was boasting to Julia that he was lobbying for insurance companies, telegraph companies, steamship lines, railroad lines, banking interests, mining interests, manufacturers, investors, and individuals with claims. Everyone, he crowed, wanted him. What they wanted was a seat at his famous table. His ''plan de campagne'' for lobbying often began with ''pâté de campagne,'' with a client footing the bill.

Sam took great care in composing the menu and guest list for his lobby dinners. If his client's interests were financial, members of the appropriate House and Senate committees received invitations. Mining and mineral rights? That was another group of players. He also orchestrated the talk around the table and used stories from his variegated life like condiments at his dinners.

The results? "Ambrosial nights," gushed one guest. "The climax of civilization," another enthused. But how did these delightful evenings serve his clients' ends? Subtly, and therein lies what set Sam Ward apart as a [[lobbyist]]. He claimed, and guests agreed, that he never talked directly about a "project" over dinner. Instead, he let a good food, wine, and company educate and convince, launch schemes or nip them in the bud. At these evenings new friendships developed, old ones were cemented, and Sam's list of men upon whom he could call lengthened.

This was the hallmark of what reporters labeled the "social lobby," and, by the late 1860s, Sam was hailed in newspapers across the country as its "King." And yet nowhere in this age of corruption and scandal—not in the press, in congressional testimony, or in his own letters or those of his clients—was there any hint that "the King" ever offered a bribe, engaged in blackmail, or used any other such methods to win his ends.

===Later life===
By the late 1870s, the "King of the Lobby" was slowing down. Although friends urged him to retire, the truth was that he couldn't. Sam was famous, but he was not rich. He lived well—very well indeed—but on other men's money. But then his luck changed once again. Years earlier, a wealthy Californian, [[James R. Keene|James Keene]], had been a poor, desperately ill teenager in the California gold fields and Sam had nursed him back to health. Keene never forgot his kindness. He manipulated railroad stock with his good "SAMaritan" in mind, and, when he came East in 1878, he gave Sam the profits—nearly $750,000.

With this dramatic change in his circumstances, the "King" abdicated his crown, decamped for New York, and naively backed unscrupulous strangers developing a grand new resort on Long Island. To no one's surprise but Sam's, the project failed and Sam's final fortune evaporated.

In order to evade creditors, Sam sailed for England. He bobbed up in London and was straightaway entertained by his many friends there and then moved on to Italy.  During Lent in 1884, he became ill near Naples. On the morning of May 19, he dictated one last lighthearted letter and died.&lt;ref name="SCWObit1884"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Famous Lobbyist Dead; Sam Ward Dies in Italy in His Seventy-First Year. a Man Who Enjoyed Himself in Making Others Happy--Prince of Good Fellows and Friend of Great Men.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1884/05/20/archives/a-famous-lobbyist-dead-sam-ward-dies-in-italy-in-his-seventyfirst.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 May 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Ward (Emily Astor).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ann Hall]], ''Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Ward ([[Astor family#Bloodline|Emily Astor]])'', 1837. Miniature on ivory, 5 1/2 x 4 1/2 in. Private collection, Barrytown, New York]]
In January 1838, he married Emily Astor, eldest daughter of businessman [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.]] and Margaret Rebecca Armstrong of the [[Livingston family]]. In November 1838, Emily gave birth to their daughter, Margaret Astor Ward, who married [[John Winthrop Chanler]], son of John White Chanler and Elizabeth Shirreff Winthrop.  Together, they had ten children, including [[William A. Chanler|William Astor Chanler, Sr.]], [[Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler]], and [[Robert Winthrop Chanler]].  In February 1841, Emily gave birth to a son, but within days both she and the newborn died. Sam was executor of his father's several-million-dollar estate, partner now in a prestigious banking firm, guardian of his three sisters, a widower, father of a toddler, and 27 years old.

In 1843, Sam married a beautiful fortune-hunter from [[New Orleans]], Medora Grymes, who bore two sons in quick succession.&lt;ref name="Jacob2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Kathryn Allamong|title=King of the Lobby: The Life and Times of Sam Ward, Man-About-Washington in the Gilded Age|date=2010|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801893971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8K1fvejDBQEC|accessdate=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

Within days of his passing, obituaries appeared in dozens of newspapers in the United States and England. The ''New York Times''' obituary filled two entire columns. The ''New York Tribune'' correctly concluded that Sam Ward's "greatest achievement was establishing himself in Washington at the head of a profession which, from the lowest depths of disrepute, he raised almost to the dignity of a gentlemanly business....He never resorted to vulgar bribery; he excelled rather in composing the enmities and cementing the rickety friendships which play so large a part in political affairs, and he tempted men not with the purse, but with banquets, graced by vivacious company, and the conversation of wits and people of the world."

Sam's book of poetry, ''Lyrical Recreations,'' soon sank into obscurity. His hilarious anonymous magazine accounts of his stint in the gold fields were edited into a volume entitled ''Sam Ward in the Gold Rush'' in 1949. For years after his death, bar patrons ordered "Sam Wards," a drink he invented of cracked ice, a peel of lemon, and yellow [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|Chartreuse]]. Restaurants carried Chicken Saute Sam Ward on their menus for decades. Locke-Ober in Boston served for years a dish called Mushrooms Sam Ward. He was immortalized by his nephew author [[Francis Marion Crawford]] as the delightful Mr. Bellingham in ''Dr. Claudius.'' And Sam's name has been kept alive by scholars speculating upon the identity of the anonymous author of "[[The Diary of a Public Man]]," published in 1879.

The social lobby that Sam Ward perfected also lives on. Although entertaining by lobbyists has been circumscribed by legislation, it endures because, as Sam understood, bringing people together over good food, wine, and conversation remains a fruitful way to conduct business. As [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] noted 100 years after Sam's death, ".....every close student of Washington knows half the essential business of government is still transacted in the evening.....where the sternest purpose lurks under the highest frivolity." Sam Ward's art was to guarantee that the guests who enjoyed his ambrosial nights never focused on the purpose that lurked beneath his perfectly cooked ''poisson.''

A '''seasonal industry''' is activity within an economic [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] in which the majority of operations take place during only part of the year, usually within a period of half a year or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Assembly Bills, Original and Amended|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDhRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA50-IA67|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, as with [[agriculture]], this limitation may relate to [[climate]] or other forces of nature. In others, the seasonality may relate to annual variations in human activity (for example, [[tourism]], [[restaurant]]s, some forms of [[manufacturing]]).

Seasonal industries often feature large swings in labor force size, and in many cases, precipitate mass [[Migrant worker|migrations of workers]]. 

In those countries that provide them, [[unemployment benefit]]s may be affected by a worker's seasonal status. That is, in certain cases, a seasonal worker may not be considered "[[unemployed]]" during the off-season for the sake of benefits or aggregated statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal|title=Colorado Workforce Regulations (example)|accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515190615/http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite being functionally inactive.

He further praised Siti for her brave efforts to experiment her voice [[melisma]] with new musics or songs.&lt;ref name="M.Nasir Puji Suara Dato' Siti Nurhaliza"&gt;{{cite web|title=M.Nasir Puji Suara Dato' Siti Nurhaliza|url=http://www.budiey.com/m-nasir-puji-suara-dato-siti-nurhaliza/|author=Budiey Isma|language=ms|date=17 November 2008|work=Sensasi Selebriti| accessdate = 12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gareth Gates]] who has performed together with Siti during MTV Asia Awards 2004 when he was asked what does he think about Siti, he said, "She definitely has the looks and she certainly has the voice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1144">A '''strategic bankruptcy''' may occur when an otherwise solvent company makes use of the [[bankruptcy|bankruptcy laws]] for some specific business purpose.&lt;ref&gt;See Kevin J. Delaney, Strategic Bankruptcy (University of California Press, 1998) for a discussion of this phenomenon by reference to particular cases.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2002 [[Kmart]] filed [[Chapter 11]] for protection from creditors. One of the main problems affecting Kmart's cash flow and therefore its liquidity was that Kmart was locked into long-term leases at premium rates with respect to various unprofitable stores. While in chapter 11 reorganization, Kmart was able to renegotiate or rescind those particular leases.

In some countries, like Sweden, it is common at least for smaller companies with deep debts, to have a bankruptcy, and close down the company, but where the owner has prepared a new company which buys important assets including the name, and continues with much smaller debts.

'''Sydney Smith Lee''' (September 2, 1802 – July 22, 1869), called '''Smith Lee''' in his lifetime, was an American naval officer who served as a captain in the [[Confederate States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He was the third child of [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]] and [[Anne Hill Carter Lee]], and the older brother of Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]].

==Early life and education==
Lee was born in Camden, New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;http://leefamilyarchive.org/reference/books/alexander/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; on September 2, 1802. At the age of 18 on December 30, 1820 he was appointed [[midshipman]] in the [[United States Navy]] and 8 years later promoted to lieutenant on May 17, 1828. During the [[Mexican–American War]] Lee fought in the [[Battle of Veracruz]] with his brother [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E.]]; and afterwards was stationed there. He was promoted to [[commander]] on June 4. 1850 and accompanied [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Perry]] to Japan in 1853, commanding his flagship [[USS Mississippi (1841)|''USS Mississippi'']].

==Career==
Commander Lee served as commandant of the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] and [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. He resigned from the service on April 17, 1861, the day [[Virginia in the American Civil War#Secession timeline|Virginia declared it had seceded]] though the resignation was not accepted. After dismissal on April 22, 1861 he accepted a commission as commander in the [[Confederate States Navy]].

When the U.S. Navy abandoned the [[Gosport Navy Yard]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], Commander Lee became the commanding officer there. When Union forces regained it, he was put in charge of batteries at [[Drewry's Bluffs, Virginia]]. On May 6, 1864, he became chief of the Confederate Navy's Bureau of Orders and Detail, replacing [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[John K. Mitchell]]. Lee was promoted to captain, and remained at this post until the end of the war.

Lee fought for the Confederacy reluctantly. As late as 1863 he denounced South Carolina for "getting us into this snarl" of secession, complaining that Robert and his family had persuaded him to act against his love of the US Navy.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/robert-e-lee%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cseverest-struggle%E2%80%9D|first=Elizabeth Brown|last=Pryor|title=Robert E. Lee's 'Severest Struggle'|publisher=American Heritage|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and death==
Lee's wife was Anne Marie Mason of Virginia. One of their sons was Confederate [[Major General]] [[Fitzhugh Lee]] who later became [[Governor of Virginia]], diplomat and writer; and served as Major General of [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] during the [[Spanish–American War]]. At least four more of his sons served in the Confederate States Army or Navy. After the war Lee became a farmer and died at [[Richlands, Virginia]], on July 22, 1869.

'''Winthrop Paul "Win" Rockefeller''' (September 17, 1948 – July 16, 2006) was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician and businessman who served as the 17th [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Arkansas]] from 1996 until his death in 2006. He was a member of the [[Rockefeller family]].

==Early life ==
Rockefeller was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[governor of Arkansas|Arkansas Governor]] [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] (1912—1973) and actress Jievute "Bobo" Paulekiute (1916—2008). His parents separated in 1950 and divorced four years later. His maternal grandparents were [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/bobo-rockefeller-91-married-well-divorced-better/76767/&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller grew up in both the United States and in [[Europe]] and was educated at schools in New York, [[England]], and in [[Switzerland]]. He graduated from [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], a degree in Ranch Management.

==Career==
Rockefeller served from 1981 to 1995 on the Arkansas State Police Commission. In 1991, he was appointed by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to serve on the President’s Council on Rural America and became chairman of the council. He was a president of the [[Quapaw Area Council]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and served on the board of directors of the national Scouting organization.

He was elected his state's [[lieutenant governor]] in a November 1996 [[special election]] triggered by the resignation of Governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] and the succession to the governorship of then-Lieutenant Governor [[Mike Huckabee]]. Rockefeller was subsequently re-elected in 1998 to a full four-year term with 67 percent of the vote, far greater than the vote received by his father in the 1966 and 1968 gubernatorial elections. Rockefeller was elected once again in 2002 with 60 percent of the vote.

According to his website: "As Lieutenant Governor he focused on economic development, education and literacy. As Acting Governor on September 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon]], he resisted calls to declare a state of emergency and instead urged Arkansans to remain calm and to donate blood. He sponsored Project ChildSafe, a national firearms safety program that has distributed hundreds of thousands of free [[Gun safety#Locks|trigger locks]] in Arkansas. He was honorary chairman of the Arkansas Literary Festival. In 1997, Rockefeller created ''Books in the Attic'', a program using existing resources, Boy Scouts, and volunteers to ensure access to reading opportunities for all children. In 2004, he served as the chairman of the [[Arkansas Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.ar.us/ltgov/ Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On March 22, 1971, Rockefeller married Deborah Cluett Sage of New York, the eldest daughter of Louis Davidson Sage and the former Constance Cluett Ward. The couple met while both were studying in [[Oxford, England]]. The wedding took place at the Bruton Parish Church at [[Colonial Williamsburg]] in [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].

The couple had three children:
*Andrea Davidson Rockefeller (b. July 31, 1972)
*Katherine Cluett Rockefeller (b. February 7, 1974)
*Winthrop Paul Rockefeller Jr. (b. July 10, 1976)

The couple divorced on January 11, 1979. 

On June 4, 1983, Rockefeller married Lisenne Dudderar, an administrative assistant with the Arkansas [[Nature Conservancy]]. They had four sons:
*William Gordon Rockefeller
*Colin Kendrick Rockefeller (born c. 1990)
*John Alexander Camp Rockefeller
*Louis Henry Rockefeller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman &amp; Wright|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Freeman+%26+Wright-a0194193029|publisher=The Free Library|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kowal|first=Jessica|title=A Seattle School Where Extra Kindness Is Part of the Curriculum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/26/education/26hutch.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|accessdate=April 13, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They adopted a daughter, Grace, in [[Hong Kong]]. Win and Lisenne founded a school for children with learning disabilities in Little Rock, now known as the Academy at [[Riverdale (Little Rock)|Riverdale]].

==Wealth==
Rockefeller served as chief executive of Winrock Farms, Inc., which had been set up by his father, and had interests in various small businesses around the state: in retailing, automobiles, farming, and the resort industry. He was an active member of the [[National Federation of Independent Business]]. Rockefeller was ranked # 283 on the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine list of the nation's wealthiest people in 2005, with a fortune the magazine estimated at $1.2 billion. As lieutenant governor, which was a part-time job, he forwarded his $34,673 state salary to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-07-16-rockefeller_x.htm Ark. Lt. Gov. Win Paul Rockefeller dies - USA Today, 16 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
Rockefeller had announced his candidacy for governor and was expected to face the more conservative [[Asa Hutchinson]] in the Republican primary election in May 2006. On July 20, 2005, however, he bowed out of the race, citing [[Myeloproliferative neoplasm|myeloproliferative disease]], a blood disorder that can develop into [[leukemia]] if left untreated. In October 2005 and March 2006, Rockefeller underwent unsuccessful [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplants]] at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. On July 8, 2006, after the failure of his second bone marrow transplant, he returned to Little Rock, where he died eight days later at the [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]. On July 19, his body lay in state in the rotunda of the [[Arkansas State Capitol]], and the next day, a memorial service was held at [[Pulaski Heights]] [[United Methodist Church]], of which Rockefeller was a member. At the time of his death, he was survived by his mother, wife, children, and one granddaughter.
