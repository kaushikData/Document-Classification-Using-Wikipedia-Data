'''''Ator''''' is a film series of four Italian movies made in the 1980s created by director [[Joe D'Amato]], under the pseudonym David Hills. D'Amato wrote and directed the first, second, and fourth films in the series, himself disregarding the existence of the third. Ator was played in the first three films by [[Miles O'Keeffe]], while [[Eric Allan Kramer]] played the Son of Ator in the fourth.

Ator is a swordsman, alchemist, scientist, magician, scholar, and engineer, with the ability to sometimes produce objects out of thin air (see ''Ator 4''). The series seems to emulate the main character of the popular ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' movies. The first Conan film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', was released in Europe in April 1982; the first ''Ator'' movie was filmed shortly thereafter and came out later the same year, premiering October 7, 1982. D'Amato, a highly prolific [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] director, likely created Ator purely as an attempt to make money from the success of the ''Conan'' films.

== Films ==
=== ''Ator l'invincibile'' ===
{{Main|Ator, the Fighting Eagle}}
The first film in the series is 1982's ''Ator l'invincibile'', translated into English as ''Ator the Invincible''. It was released in America as ''Ator, The Fighting Eagle''. As the film opens Ator asks his father for permission to marry his sister. Ator's father tells Ator that he is adopted and so he can marry his sister if he likes. The rest of the film deals with Ator's sister being kidnapped by the high priest of the Spider Kingdom and Ator having to go on an epic quest to save her.

=== ''Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion'' ===
{{Main|Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion}}
1984's ''Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion'', released in America as ''The Blademaster'' (and in a re-edited TV version years later as ''Cave Dwellers'') lends credence to the argument that Joe D'Amato was using Ator as a ploy to make money from the Conan franchise. Like its predecessor, it went into production shortly after the theatrical release of the second ''Conan'' movie, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', and was released later the same year.

In this film, Ator and his sidekick Thong travel from the mythic "Ends of the Earth" to save Ator's mentor from an evil warlord. The film ends with Ator destroying an ancient object of power (called in the film the "Geometric Nucleus") that his mentor was guarding to protect it from falling into the hands of evil men.

Unintentionally comic moments sometimes arise when writer/director Joe D'Amato has Ator use modern-day technology in the film. For example, Ator storms a castle using a 1980s style [[hang gliding|hang glider]], and later destroys the "Geometric Nucleus" in a nuclear bomb explosion, complete with [[mushroom cloud]], at the end of the film.

The film was a box office and home video failure. An edited version entitled ''Cave Dwellers'' was featured on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', causing it to become a cult sensation. The American theatrical cut, ''The Blademaster,'' now enjoys modest success on home video and DVD as a cult favorite.

=== ''Iron Warrior'' ===
{{Main|Iron Warrior}}

Joe D'Amato dropped the ''Ator'' franchise in 1986, around the same time when it became public knowledge that there were no plans to make a third ''Conan'' movie. Instead, in 1987, a new director, Alfonso Brescia, wrote and directed the third ''Ator'' film, ''Iron Warrior'', which follows the same loose plot as ''Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion''. The film abandons the continuity of the first two films (even so far as to completely contradict Ator's established back-story of having been adopted as a baby, instead opening with him playing as a child with a twin brother), and with writer/director D'Amato gone, the unintentional plot device of anachronisms disappears. Instead, Brescia turns the film into an [[art film|art house]] picture, utilizing a variety of cinematic techniques and camera tricks to act as symbols or give deeper meaning to the film. Ator's character is also drastically changed: Here, he has black hair in a ponytail, and speaks roughly 50 words in the entire movie. 

The film pays homage to a number of popular films from the time, including the first ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.  The film's score is, as with the first of the series, provided by [[Carlo Maria Cordio]] - one of his themes for the film is a simple reworking of a very similar cue heard throughout Joe D'Amato's 1981 film [[Absurd (film)|''Absurd'' (film)]] (also scored by Cordio).

=== ''Ator 4'' ===
{{Main|Quest for the Mighty Sword|}}
Joe D'Amato was reportedly displeased with Brescia's approach to his character, and so re-took control of the franchise in 1988. In 1990, D'Amato released the final Ator film, ''Ator l'invincible'', a retooling of the first film in the series. It was released in Europe and the United States under a variety of titles including: ''Ator III: The Hobgoblin'' (indicating D'Amato's disregard for the previous film), ''[[Quest for the Mighty Sword]]'', and ''Hobgoblin''. Here, [[Eric Allan Kramer]] plays the son of Ator; this is the only film in the series not to feature Miles O'Keeffe in the lead role.

The "hobgoblin" suit was recycled from the notorious ''[[Troll 2]]''; in fact, this film was released as ''Troll 3'' in [[Germany]].

==Controversy==
In 2016, Televisa realized people watched more Netflix than cable television.
To re-gain all their lost viewers, they decided to remove all its original content from [[Netflix]] in order to create its own Netflix-like streaming service, which was called Blim. Soon after Televisa announced Blim, the Mexicans started mocking Televisa through [[Internet meme|memes]] that strongly opinionated and mocked Televisa  for producing lesser quality original content in comparison to the more critically acclaimed [[Netflix]] original content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yucatan.com.mx/espectaculos/breves-del-espectaculo/memes-se-lanzan-contra-blim|title=“Memes” se lanzan contra Blim - El Diario de Yucatán|website=yucatan.com.mx|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] itself released an ad which made fun of Televisa's original content, and criticized Bilm and Televisa for the perceived lesser quality of their content, as well as for removing their content from Netflix. The ad featured a man being sad because Televisa original content was removed, and his mom looking weird at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/netflix-se-burla-de-televisa-y-rebelde/#gs.EtJ8xNM|title=Netflix se burla de Televisa y Rebelde - Forbes Mexico|date=4 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Televisa retaliated by releasing an ad, where a look-like man dressed the same as the man who was sad in Netflix's ad, was happy for buying Blim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regeneracion.mx/blim-intenta-burlarse-de-netflix-y-nada-sale-bien/|title=Blim intenta burlarse de Netflix y todo sale mal (VIDEO)|date=25 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Televisa's ad did not got the response it expected, because the ad only caused Televisa to get even more not favorable criticisms in comparison to Netflix. Causing Blim and Televisa to be even more heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,{{quotation needed|date=October 2018}} some which were as far as thanking Televisa for removing their content from Netflix. The main argument against Televisa, was people arguing there was no need to pay for a streaming service, in order to see series that are available to watch without even needing to buy cable in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dos semanas probando Blim|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/blogs/alejandro-aleman/2016/03/11/dos-semanas-probando-blim|website=eluniversal.com.mx|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpnoticias.com/enelshow/television/2016/02/22/blim-copia-de-netflix-fracasara-porque-televisa-no-entiende-a-los-mileniales|title=Blim, copia de Netflix, fracasará porque Televisa no entiende a los mileniales|date=22 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Captain Atom''''' was an [[Comics in Australia|Australian comic book]] series created and written by [[Jack Bellew]] with illustrations by [[Arthur Mather]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, John and Hay, John A. (2001). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YgX_TOK9xa4C&amp;pg=PA332&amp;lpg=PA332 "Mather, Arthur"]. ''The Bibliography of Australian Literature'', Vol. 3, pp. 332–333. University of Queensland Press. {{ISBN|0702235989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published from 1948 to 1954, with 64 issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/75660/|title=Captain Atom (Atlas)|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also appeared as strips in a number of Australian newspapers. The protagonist, the first to use the name, has no relation to the later American superhero [[Captain Atom]],&lt;ref name=MarySue/&gt; published by [[Charlton Comics]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/1667/|title=Captain Atom (Charlton)|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[DC Comics]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/3349/|title=Captain Atom (DC)|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The fledgling publishing company [[Atlas Publications]] achieved its first major success with its ''Captain Atom''. It was drawn by Arthur Mather,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mather_arthur.htm|title=Arthur Mather|publisher=[[Lambiek#Lambiek website|Lambiek Comiclopedia]] |date=18 May 2007|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who like [[Yaroslav Horak]] and [[Andrea Bresciani]], became a regular artist for Atlas. The character was co-created and written by [[Jack Bellew]] under the pen name "John Welles". The character is based on a combination of [[Fawcett Publications]]' [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Quality Comics]]' [[Captain Triumph]] (first published in 1941 and 1943 respectively).&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panel by Panel – An Illustrated history of Australian Comics|author1=Ryan, John|page=190|date=1979 |publisher=Cassell Australia |isbn=0-7269-7376-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncs.net.au/who-were-the-australian-superheroes-and-where-have-they-gone/|title=Who were the Australian superheroes and where have they gone?|publisher=Network Creative Services Pty Ltd |date=29 June 2016|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's origin had identical twin brothers being caught in an atomic bomb blast and becoming fused into one, with Dr. Bikini Rador (a nuclear physicist) being the dominant persona. By shouting the magic word, ''Exenor!'', Rador transforms into his now atomic-powered twin. Rador takes on the identity of Larry Lockhart, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, to fight crime, switching places with his brother when situations call for a superhero.&lt;ref name=MarySue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/agent-of-style-captain-atom-part-1/|title=Agent of S.T.Y.L.E. – Captain Atom’s Atomic Ensemble!|last=Kistler|first=Alan|publisher=''[[Dan Abrams#The Mary Sue|The Mary Sue]]''|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/capatom.htm|title=Captain Atom|publisher=International Catalogue of Superheroes|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic was originally published entirely in colour, but Atlas followed its chief rival, [[K.G. Murray Publishing Company|K.G. Murray]], and switched to black and white two years later when the cost of colour printing became prohibitive. Despite the switch to black and white, the ''Captain Atom'' series remained successful, running to 64 issues over the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, Toby and Stone, Grant (1994).

Captain Atom was one of the few original Australian comic heroes to have his own merchandising and fan club. In the 1950s the fan club boasted that it had "over 75,000 members".&lt;ref name=MarySue/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;  

The character was revived in 1985 and again in 2016 by [[Gerald Carr (cartoonist)|Gerald Carr]], appearing in Meteor Comics' ''[[Vixen (Australian comics)|Vixen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vixen Magazine''. [http://www.vixenmagazine.com/CAPATOM.html Great Australian Comic Book Creations: "Captain Atom"]&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Atom, renamed as the Atomic Warrior, featured alongside another 1950s Australian comic book hero, The Panther (created by [[Paul Wheelahan]]), and Carr's Vixen and Brainmaster.

There is a visual reference to Captain Atom in the Watchmen comic book. In the origin story of Dr Manhattan (who is based on the Charlton Comics Captain Atom), the character is shown rejecting a helmet which is part of his US Government-supplied costume. The helmet design and the overall costume, although a different colour, somewhat resemble that of the Atlas Comics Captain Atom. The British artist, Dave Gibbons, may have been familiar with the Australian character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6002">A '''color suite''' (also called a '''color bay''', '''telecine suite''', or '''color correction bay''') is the [[control room]] for [[color grading]] [[video]] in a [[post-production]] environment.

==Technology and specifications==
The video source could be from: a [[telecine]], a [[video tape recorder]] (VTR), a [[motion picture film scanner]], [[virtual telecine]] or a [[Direct to Disk Recording]] (DDR) or the older system called a [[film chain]]. A high end [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] color suite may use a [[Da Vinci Systems]] or [[Pandora International]]'s color corrector. If a VTR is the source for the video the room is often called a ''tape to tape'' suite. Many suites are designed to operate as a telecine suite or a tape to tape suite by changing the configuration of the suite. The operator of the suite is usually called a ''Colorist''. If a telecine is the source this is called a ''Film to Tape'' operation. A color suite may use one [[Video formats|video standard]] or be able to change configuration to a number of standards like: [[high-definition video]], [[NTSC]], or [[PAL]] or a [[digital intermediate|DI]] workflow. Color suites are sometime placed in [[digital cinema]] [[movie theaters]] with a [[video projector]] for color correction to that [[Image resolution|display format]].

The suite room will also have video equipment in the [[Production control room]] for monitoring the video signal like: [[Video monitor]], [[Waveform monitor]] and [[vectorscope]].

[[Image:Telecine site 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Shadow Telecine in a color correction suite.]]

The suite may have an either a [[Non-linear editing system]] (NLE) or [[Linear editing]] system to control the source and record device. This may be internal to the color grading device, as in a Pandora's poggle or Da Vinci's 2k or external, as in Da Vinci's TLC (telecine controller).

A [[vision mixer]] may also be in the suite for monitoring different video sources or for simple or [[special effect]]s in the video. A [[character generator]] is sometime used also for titling and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]].

The suite may have equipment to read, log and insert into the video Kodak's [[Keykode]]. Keykode is bar coding that is placed at regular intervals on negative films to aid in identifying and counting of film frames. Evertz, [[Aaton]] and [[ARRI]] are three types of readers for telecine use.

The suite may or may not have [[audio post production]] equipment. This would be to monitor and if needed sync up the [[Sound film#Technology|program audio]] to the video source if the sound was not on [[Sound-on-film|the film]]. An audio [[mixing console]] and other [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio equipment]] such as effects devices may also be in the suite. The audio may be from the [[film soundtrack]]. The term [[MOS (film)|MOS]] is used, on a [[clapperboard|slate]], when a scene is filmed without sync sound or any sound. A clapperboard slate is used at the start and sometime at the end of scene to mark particular takes recorded during a production.

Other equipment that may be used in the suite are: digital still store\[[Frame grabber]] to store references frames, [[Noise reduction|noise reducer]] to reduce film grain/dirt and [[Signal-to-noise ratio|video noise]]; [[video router]] and [[audio router]].

The telecine, VTRs and some of the larger equipment are often placed in a [[central apparatus room]] or ''machine room'' and are interconnected through [[Cable tray]]s or [[raised floor]] to the color suite by [[patch panel]]s, [[Coaxial cable]]s, [[Computer network]] and [[Multicore cable]]s.

Some color suites are at video post production facilities that rent them by the hour for the transfer of [[TV commercials]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and [[movies]].
These color suites would have a client area behind the colorist. With the [[Customer|client]] present this would be called a supervised session.

The '''Cyr wheel''' (also known as the '''roue Cyr''', '''mono wheel''',&lt;ref name="monowheel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gymmedia.com/wheel-gymnastics/real-History-Mono-Wheel-Cyr-Wheel | title = The real History of Mono Wheel (Cyr Wheel) | publisher = GymMedia.com | date = 29 December 2012 | accessdate = 28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''simple wheel''') is an acrobatic apparatus that consists of a single large ring made of aluminum or steel with a diameter approximately {{convert|10|to|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} taller than the performer.&lt;ref name="FEDEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fedec.eu/datas/files/fedec_cyrwheelmanual_en_2011.pdf | format = PDF | title = Cyr Wheel: Instruction Manual | publisher = European Federation of Professional Circus Schools (FEDEC) | date = 2011 | pages = 7-10 | accessdate = 28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inertie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inertie.ca/historique_roue.php |title=Historique Roue Cyr (in English) |publisher=inertie.ca |accessdate=2015-10-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315162338/http://inertie.ca/historique_roue.php |archivedate=2016-03-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer stands inside the Cyr wheel and grasps its rim, causing it to roll and spin gyroscopically while performing acrobatic moves in and around the rotating wheel. The apparatus and its movement vocabulary have some similarities with the [[German wheel]], but whereas the German wheel consists of two large rings linked together by horizontal crossbars and has handles for the performer to hold onto, the modern Cyr wheel consists of a single ring and has no handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rhoenrad.com/en/about.html | title = About Wheel Gymnastics | publisher = International Wheel Gymnastics Federation | accessdate = 28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyr wheel takes its name from Daniel Cyr, who reinvented it as a [[circus]] apparatus at the end of the 20th century.

There are records of people using a similar apparatus as sports equipment during the mid-20th century in Germany,&lt;ref name="monowheel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rhoenrad-dtb.de/2012/irv-nimmt-mono-wheel-in-wm-programm-auf.html | title = IRV nimmt Mono-Wheel als offizielle Disziplin in das WM-Programm auf | publisher = ''Rhoenradturnen in Deutschland'' | date = 1 January 2012 | accessdate = 4 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130211164456/http://www.rhoenrad-dtb.de/2012/irv-nimmt-mono-wheel-in-wm-programm-auf.html | archivedate = 11 February 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was referred to as the ''Einreifen'' or ''mono wheel'', having been developed by Adalbert von Rekowski as a variation on Otto Feick's popular ''[[Rhönrad]]'' (German wheel).&lt;ref name="rekowski"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/rollendes-revival-fotostrecke-109934-7.html | title = Rollendes Revival: Das total durchgedrehte Ding | author = Gerlind Vollmer | publisher = ''Spiegel Online'' | date = 12 July 2007 | accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monowheel"/&gt; 

Around 1996, the wheel was reinvented and developed as a circus apparatus by Daniel Cyr, a graduate of the [[École nationale de cirque|National Circus School in Montreal]] and co-founder of the [[contemporary circus]] troupe [[Cirque Éloize]].&lt;ref name="inertie"/&gt; Cyr claims the idea came to him from a large [[hula hoop]] and an old circular wrought-iron coat rack.&lt;ref name="inertie"/&gt; His design for the wheel went through several iterations, evolving from steel to aluminum, adding a PVC coating, and eventually implementing a multi-part design that could be disassembled for easier transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/circus-arts/cyr-wheel1.htm | title = History of Acrobatic Wheels - How the Cyr Wheel Works | publisher = HowStuffWorks.com | author = Dave Roos | date = 13 March 2015 | accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyr first performed with the apparatus in the Cirque Éloize production of ''Excentricus'',&lt;ref name="inertie"/&gt; which toured North America, Europe and Asia between 1997 and 2002. He subsequently presented a Cyr wheel circus act at the 2003 Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in [[Paris]] and won the Silver Medal for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Cyr Wheel / Daniel Cyr / Cirque Éloize|url=http://www.cirque-eloize.com/en/who-are-we/the-cyr-wheel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its recent popularization as a [[circus skill]], hundreds of circus artists from around the world have performed in the wheel and it is now taught in several major circus schools.&lt;ref name="FEDEC"/&gt; The USA Wheel Gymnastics Federation and the International Rhoenradturnen Verband, with significant assistance from coaches and athletes from the [[École Nationale de Cirque de Montréal]], developed rules for Cyr wheel competition.  The first such competition was held in [[Chicago]] in October 2011 and the first world championships in Cyr wheel competition was held during the 10th World Championships in Wheel Gymnastics, July 7-14, 2013 in Chicago.

Professional [[circus school]]s that offer advanced training on the Cyr wheel include: the [[Ecole Supérieure des Arts du Cirque]] (ESAC) in Belgium, the [[National Centre for Circus Arts]] in the UK, the Centre national des arts du cirque (CNAC) in France, and the [[École nationale de cirque]] in Montreal.

Cyr wheels are typically made of stainless steel tubing or aluminum tubing approximately {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} in diameter. They are often composed of 3 or 5 individual pieces fixed together by steel or aluminum couplings. They may be painted and covered with an anti-slip plastic coating to add friction and protect the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.corbinstreehouse.com/blog/2011/06/roue-cyr/ | title = Making a roue cyr | author = Corbin Dunn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rhönradbau.de/en/cyr-wheel | title = Cyr Wheel | publisher = rhönradbau.de | accessdate = 28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FEDEC"/&gt;

Smaller wheels spin faster, work better for smaller spaces, and make "no hand" tricks easier than larger wheels. Larger wheels are more graceful and there is more room for suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.coggscircus.com/q-and-a-cyr-wheel/ | title = Cyr Wheel Q &amp; A | publisher = Coggs' Circus | accessdate = 28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of ''Dark'' is based on stealth combat. Eric has many supernatural vampiric 'skills' at his disposal; he can use Shadow Leap to quickly teleport to different areas and to perform stealth finishers, make himself temporarily invisible, see in the dark and slow down time. His abilities are linked to a certain amount of 'blood points' which are used up each time Eric uses a skill. He can drink blood from his enemies to restore his health and blood points.

==Plot==
The game follows the story of Eric Bane ([[Doug Cockle]]), a newly turned vampire suffering from [[amnesia]]. He learns that his transformation is not complete and that, if he does not drink the blood of his sire, he will mutate into a mindless ghoul. In order to avoid being such a foul creature, he receives missions to drink ancient vampires' blood. However, an angel in Eric's view appears to guide him to the righteous path, and ease intolerable pain that comes from not drinking appropriate blood as it disappears. With a question of this vision, he tries to recover his deleted memories and his true self.

}}

''Dark'' received "generally unfavorable reviews" on both platforms according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=mcpc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcx360/&gt; Much of the game's criticism has been aimed at the poor melee combat, camera, script, and lack of interest in the game's protagonist.  In a mixed review, Jon Blythe of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine|Official Xbox Magazine UK]]'' stated: "''DARK'' is frustrating, because that initial feeling of being a zippy blur of a vampire in a world of neon-lit night never leaves you. It's just swamped in frustrating design decisions, a script that lurches from passable to laughable, weak enemy AI, and a vortex of a lead character who's impossible to like or hate."&lt;ref name=oxmuk/&gt; Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] stated that "low-budget games can be delightful and surprising, but only if the core elements work. Here, they don't. In its best moments, this is only ever a reminder of better games. In its worst moments - of which there are far too many - ''Dark'' frustrates and irritates as only a clumsy stealth game can."&lt;ref name=eurog/&gt;

Michael Engle of The Game Scouts said, "I would rather [insert cliché about how to kill a vampire here] than play this game."&lt;ref name=gamescouts&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thegamescouts.com/2013/07/dark-review.html | title = Dark Review | publisher = The Game Scouts | first = Michael | last = Engle | date = 12 July 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130715002049/http://www.thegamescouts.com/2013/07/dark-review.html | archivedate = 15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the most negative review on the website, Andrew Reiner of ''[[Game Informer]]'' complained that "I’ve played a lot of bad Xbox 360 games for achievements, but hardly any are as unpolished and poorly executed as ''Dark''. It’s easily one of this generation’s worst titles. Even when the stealth is working moderately well, the slow pacing is a killer, and no amount of blood sucking brings satisfaction. Most levels were completed through trial and error, failure after failure, and then success coming from exploiting an AI bug or an odd design decision."&lt;ref name=gi/&gt;

'''Debbie Downer''' is a name of a fictional ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' character who debuted in 2004, and who was portrayed by [[Rachel Dratch]].

The character's name, [[wiktionary:Debbie Downer|Debbie Downer]], is a [[slang]] phrase which refers to someone who frequently adds bad news and negative feelings to a gathering, thus bringing down the mood of everyone around them. Dratch's character would usually appear at social gatherings and interrupt the conversation to voice negative opinions and pronouncements. She is especially concerned about the rate of [[Feline immunodeficiency virus|feline AIDS]], a subject that she would bring up on more than one occasion, saying it was the number one killer of domestic cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sims |first=David |date=May 1, 2014 |title=Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer,' Ten Years After Her Debut |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/05/remembering-every-second-of-debbie-downer-ten-years-after-her-debut/361518/ |work=The Atlantic |location=Boston, MA |ref={{sfnRef|"Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer'"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First appearance in 2003–04 season==
The first appearance of Debbie Downer was on May 1, 2004, with guest host [[Lindsay Lohan]].{{sfn|"Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer'"}} Debbie and five family members—played by Lohan, [[Jimmy Fallon]], Dratch, [[Amy Poehler]], [[Fred Armisen]], and [[Horatio Sanz]]—are eating breakfast at a restaurant in [[Walt Disney World]].{{sfn|"Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer'"}} While the family makes small talk, Debbie makes negative comments on current events followed by a knowing look at the camera and a cartoonish "[[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]]" sound made by a [[Mute (music)|muted]] trombone.{{sfn|"Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer'"}}

In this sketch, everyone on camera [[corpsing|cracked up]] because of both the "wah-wah" sound effect and Dratch flubbing a line early on and correcting herself.{{sfn|"Remembering Every Second of 'Debbie Downer'"}} The sketch was listed at #99 as part of [[TV Land]]'s "Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==2004–05 season==
Debbie Downer appeared in a sketch in the 2004-05 season opener with [[Ben Affleck]] as the guest host. The cast members who appeared in this sketch were more composed and did not laugh out loud at Debbie's pronouncements. This trend continued throughout the rest of the season.

In future airings of the Affleck episode, the live Debbie Downer sketch was replaced by the dress rehearsal version, along with an opening title card explaining that the dress rehearsal "worked better." In the dress rehearsal, the cast all cracks up just as they did in the Lindsay Lohan episode.

The character appeared two more times that season: once at [[Thanksgiving]] dinner (with [[Luke Wilson]] as host) and another at the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Oscars]] with [[Hilary Swank]] (playing herself). The latter sketch revealed that Debbie babysat Swank when Swank was a child. [[Will Forte]] appeared in the sketch as Swank's then-husband, [[Chad Lowe]].

==2005–06 season==
In 2005, the season premiere of ''Saturday Night Live'' featured a Debbie Downer sketch at the end of the episode. Host [[Steve Carell]]'s character, '''Bob Bummer''', is just as negative, and he and Debbie fall in love.

The December 17, 2005, episode, hosted by [[Jack Black (actor)|Jack Black]], included a [[Christmas]]-themed sketch showing Debbie in her childhood during a visit from [[Santa Claus]].  This episode contradicts her debut sketch, as here she refers to her last name being "Downer."

On April 15, 2006, Debbie returned for her final appearance before Dratch departed the show, this time at a bachelorette party at a strip club in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for her sister, played once again by host Lohan, despite not being invited in the first place.  As with the very first sketch, there is one point when the orchestra mistakenly began playing the "wah-wah" sound effect at the wrong time.

==2010 appearance==
During the May 8, 2010, episode hosted by [[Betty White]], there was a Debbie Downer sketch filmed during dress rehearsal, but it was cut from the live show due to time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Soraya Roberts, [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/nbc-releases-betty-white-un-aired-saturday-night-live-debbie-downer-sketch-article-1.178492 NBC releases Betty White's un-aired 'Saturday Night Live' 'Debbie Downer' sketch], ''New York Daily News'', (May 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is now posted on NBC.com's ''Saturday Night Live'' page, featuring video clips of old and new sketches from the show's 35-years-and-counting tenure. A group of suburban women (all played by the guest actresses listed in addition to then-current cast member [[Kristen Wiig]]) are having a lingerie party and, as usual, Debbie Downer ruins everyone's fun. One housewife (played by [[Amy Poehler]]) yells at Debbie and asks her why she's so miserable all the time. Downer thinks back to her childhood where during her birthday, her depressed grandmother (played by White) warns her not to enjoy her birthday cake because [[gluten]] allergies run in her family.

==2015 appearance==
During the SNL 40th anniversary special, Dratch appears briefly at the beginning as Downer, telling the audience that starting a show with a musical performance decreases viewership.

==Theme song==
Every sketch opened with a prologue, then the theme song (and corresponding video) plays, followed by the body of the sketch. The sketch would ultimately close with the last line of the song played again (and one more negative fact from Debbie).  The song ends with an extreme close-up of Debbie's pained expression.

Theme song lyrics:
"You're enjoying your day, 
everything's going your way,
then along comes Debbie Downer.
Always there to tell you 'bout a new disease,
a car accident, 
or killer bees.
You'll beg her to spare you,
'Debbie, please!'
but you can't stop Debbie Downer!"

The Christmas sketch began with a special theme song. It featured an animated Debbie, looking much like ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|The Grinch Who Stole Christmas]]'', and a tune similar to the Grinch's song. Steve Carell's Bob Bummer also had his own theme song.

'''''Deer Drive Legends''''' is a three-dimensional hunting video game, developed by Raylight s.r.l.&lt;ref name="Raylight Games"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raylightgames.com/2012/02/deer-drive-legends-3ds-official-press-release/|title=''Deer Drive Legends'' Official Press Release|publisher=Raylight Games|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 3D hunting game was published by [[Maximum Games]] and released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in May 2012 for both retail and download via [[Nintendo eShop]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/deer-drive-legends-3d/ |title=''Deer Drive Legends'' Tech Info |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503062303/http://www.gamespot.com/deer-drive-legends-3d/ |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later ported as a [[Wii]] and retail [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PC game, and released in November 2012. The PC version was re-titled as '''''Deer Hunt Legends'''''. Unexpectedly, the Wii version of the game was eventually re-released as a [[WiiWare]] title on November 19, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/11/nintendo_download_14th_november_north_america |title=Nintendo Download: 14th November (North America) |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |publisher=Nintendo Life |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first WiiWare title ever since ''[[Retro City Rampage]]'' launched on the platform in February 2013.

The PC version became available in Europe via digital distribution when it was released globally on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in January 2013. The Nintendo 3DS and WiiWare versions of the game were released in Europe in August and November 2013 respectively, wherein the Nintendo 3DS version is exclusively an eShop downloadable with a reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/08/nintendo_download_8th_august_europe |title=Nintendo Download: 8th August (Europe) |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |publisher=Nintendo Life |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/11/nintendo_download_28th_november_europe |title=Nintendo Download: 28th November (Europe) |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |publisher=Nintendo Life |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Deer Drive Legends'' is rated T for Teens by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWeamyK9tt8|title=''Deer Drive Legends'' Official Trailer|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deer Drive Legends'' has little relation to the [[Deer Drive (2007 video game)|2007 ''Deer Drive'']] and [[Deer Drive (2009 video game)|2009 ''Deer Drive'']] games, other than having similar titles and [[deer hunting]] concepts.

==Setting==
''Deer Drive Legends'' takes place in numerous locations throughout the world, including the African Savannah, [[Rocky Mountains]], and [[Great Lakes]]. Players will explore famed hunting regions across four continents in search of the biggest trophy.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/82721/Deer_Drive_Legends.php|title=''Deer Drive Legends'' |publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
Players will take down a number of elusive animals such as bears, antelope, elk, deer, moose, and mountain lions. The game also features prehistoric species such as the [[Smilodon]], [[T-Rex]], and [[Gastornis]].&lt;ref name="Nintendo-x2.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo-x2.com/news/view/23799/more-3d-hunting-with-deer-drive-legends|title=More hunting with ''Deer Drive Legends'' |publisher=Nintendo-x2.com|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Devil's torture chamber illusion.jpg|right|thumb|A performance of ''The Devil's Torture Chamber'' by magician Guy Kent on a British TV show from the 1970s]]
The '''Devil's Torture Chamber''' is a magic [[magic (illusion)|stage illusion]] of the classic type involving a female [[magician's assistant]] in a large box and is probably best categorised as a [[magic (illusion)#Penetration|penetration]] or [[magic (illusion)#Restoration|restoration-type]] illusion.

==Description==
The magician presents an upright cabinet that is just big enough to hold a person with a little space above their head. The magician then presents a rack of metal spikes. Spectators are offered the chance to tap the spikes with a metal implement to prove they are real and solid. The spikes are fitted into the top of the cabinet pointing downwards. An assistant is introduced and steps into the cabinet. The door is closed and the spikes are forced downwards using handles that protrude through slots in the side of the cabinet. The implication is that the assistant must have been impaled by the spikes. However the door is opened to reveal the assistant alive and unharmed. 

There are several slight variations. Sometimes the assistant carries a string of inflated balloons when he or she steps into the cabinet. These are burst as the spikes descend to give an added audible dimension to the illusion. Another description has a small door opened to show the assistant alive when the spikes are at the bottom of the cabinet; the small door is then closed again and the spikes lifted to the top before the assistant is finally fully revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The illusion is thought to be the creation of Floyd Thayer, founder of the Thayer Magic Company. Blueprints for it appeared in the Thayer catalog #7 supplement, which dates it to the early 1930s.

'''''Dooly the Little Dinosaur''''' ({{lang-ko|아기공룡 둘리}}) is a 1987 South Korean cartoon and animated film created by [[Kim Soo-jung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=de5pBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=dolly+the+little+dinosaur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cqv5OAcRBC&amp;sig=EpUM854XERYB6pdV44ZrtLNCBA4&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrY-Tlp3TAhXLE5AKHT5pBZoQ6AEIdDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=dolly%20the%20little%20dinosaur&amp;f=false|title=K-Animation: Befriending Children All Over the World|last=Tourism|first=Korean Culture and Information Service Ministry of Culture, Sports and|last2=Hyung-suk|first2=Kim|date=2013-12-01|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973755813|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412062134/https://books.google.com.br/books?id=de5pBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=dolly+the+little+dinosaur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cqv5OAcRBC&amp;sig=EpUM854XERYB6pdV44ZrtLNCBA4&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrY-Tlp3TAhXLE5AKHT5pBZoQ6AEIdDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=dolly%20the%20little%20dinosaur&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dooly is one of the most respected and commercially successful characters of South Korean [[animation]]. Dooly became the first cartoon character to be featured on a [[postal stamp|stamp]]. It was printed in 1995 in [[South Korea]]. Dooly also has a resident registration card, which means he is a citizen of South Korea.

== History ==
Dooly ({{lang-ko|둘리}}) was first created when its creator [[Kim Soo-jung|Soo-Jung Kim]] issued the [[manhwa]] (cartoon in Korean) under the [[takubon|comic book]] named ''Bo-Mool Sum (Treasure Island)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/People/view?articleId=120343|title=Father of Dooly, comic artist Kim Soo-jung :: Korea.net : The official website of the Republic of Korea|last=(KOCIS)|first=Korean Culture and Information Service|access-date=2017-04-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831174851/http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/People/view?articleId=120343|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first shown in the first week of April 1983, and ended about ten years later. There are two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of the manhwa, one of which is still being published today.

The original animation and airing were done by South Korean [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]. When it was first broadcast in 1987, there were only six episodes, with seven more added later during the second season. A [[video cassette]] was released in 1989, and re-broadcasting was first done in 1990.

The show was rebroadcast in 1993, 1996 and 1998, but due to the choice of inappropriate broadcasting dates (usually on Sunday), its recognizance and the viewer rating were critically low. In October 1998, however, [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] noticed the increased viewership, and the broadcasting time was changed to 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Monday and Tuesday (known as the 'Golden Viewing Time') starting May 12 through June 23, 2003. With more people watching the show, its ratings improved. A new version of the TV series, which began broadcasting in 2009, is currently shown Monday through Friday, at 4:00 PM on the Korean Animation channel [[Tooniverse]], Korea's first all-anime/manhwa channel.

The cartoon was once reported to the officials as a bad example for children because of the use of Dooly's care-giver's name in a friendly fashion. Koreans usually speak to adults with respect and with the use of proper additions in speech done so specifically for adults by younger people. This was seen as hazardous for the basic thinking of the children who watch it.

Tooniverse also released an [[educational]] English dub in 1995, and a theatrical release came out in 1996 under [[Dooly Nara]] (Dooly Nation).

==Characters==
*'''Dooly''' is a baby [[dinosaur]] that was kidnapped by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, who had experimented to give him magical powers. When he returned to [[Earth]], he was trapped in an [[glacier|ice glacier]] causing him to faint during the [[Ice Age]]. About 100 million years later, one of the glaciers broke off and he came to [[Seoul]]. Standing 4 feet and 6 inches tall, Dooly is a ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' with an oversized head, meant to draw attention toward the character's facial expression, which he rarely changes. He has a tail as long as his height, and he sometimes uses it to make himself look taller than other characters, usually [[Ko Gildong|Kildong Go]]. He displays many human-like characteristics, including a habit of sticking out his tongue. His underside is full-white, as are his hands and feet. He has three toes per foot, and has five fingers on each hand, unlike a real ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' which has four. He also has shiny white teeth. He is like a typical kid who likes to eat and play all the time, but he can come across as being somewhat audacious, living the life of an orphan. Behind his thoughtful words, Dooly is just another baby dinosaur who misses his mother dinosaur. While in Seoul, he was found by a girl named ''Younghee'' ({{lang-ko|영희}}), and because she mistook Dooly for a dog she took him home with her and her elder brother ''Chulsoo'' (철수), and made him live with her as a pet. However, her father ''Kildong'' ({{lang-ko|고길동}}) hates Dooly and just beats Dooly up whenever he is annoying. Dooly has superpowers that he received from an extraterrestrial, but doesn't know why. He doesn't quite know how to use it deliberately but in times of danger, he somehow manages to use the power. He points his right finger and yells 'Hoihoi!' He is always biting his tongue and looking silly, but he is both mischievous and loyal. Once in a while, he'll resist, like when he turns Kildong into a dinosaur and sends him to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], but whenever he does, it always turns against him. Dooly's name, according to the cartoon, is a [[pun]]. His older sister - Dooly called her 'brother' because he confused that exact nominal - is named ''Hana'', meaning '''One''' or '''First''' while ''Dool'', or ''Dul'' mean '''Two''' in Korean and ''y'' or ''ei'' mean the same thing in [[hanja|Korean Traditional-Chinese]], making him the '''Second'''. This is mentioned around the end of then 2nd set of episodes, or the 6th episode, but it is not certain if this is true in manhwa [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] due to the [[manhwa|anime and manhwa]] having many storyline differences. While Dooly is having adventures in Seoul and having fun, he meets three friends who Kildong hates too and beats up, all except ''Heedong'' (희동).
*'''Go Heedong''' ({{lang-ko|고희동}}) came to live with Uncle Kildong after his parents went abroad to study. He misses his mom every day, but feels utterly entertained by Dooly the Brother. Thanks to the excessive amounts of time he spends with Dooly, he isn't afraid of anything. He is also really good at biting or scratching someone when they make him mad. He has broken Douner's Time Cosmos' [[spacecraft|Spaceship]].
*'''Douner''' ({{lang-ko|도우너}}) the Prince of [[Planet]] 'Kanttappia' makes an emergency landing on the planet [[Earth]] due to the malfunctioning of the 'Time Cosmos' Spaceship. His head may be really hard and his thoughts very simple, but the word "loyalty" was made for Douner. He can travel back and forth in time and space in the Time Cosmos Spaceship which looks like a [[violin]].
*'''Ddochi''' ({{lang-ko|또치}}), the [[Ostrich]] that successfully escaped from a [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] [[circus]] troop, always insists that she used to be a noble mistress from [[Africa]]. She is a little bit selfish, and a little bit shy, but Ddochi is the most softhearted ostrich that anyone will ever come across. She also insists on calling herself a girl. Ddochi has many talents she learned from the [[circus]].
*'''Michol''' ({{lang-ko|마이콜}}, pronounced as "Maikol") is an aspiring singer who lives next to Kildong, and feeds on his passion for dreaming, though he may lack the necessary talent. He is quite lost most of the time, but does know how to take care of himself. Although he is South Korean, his appearance is noticeable different. His surname is Ma. According to his name, his role model is [[Michael Jackson]]. Dooly once joined a band with Douner and Michol.

==Controversy==
When Dooly was first created as a [[TV]] animation, it received a lot of criticism from South Korean [[Catholics]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} South Korean citizens, and the [[government of South Korea|government]]. Reasons cited included the fact that the animation was a bit violent, which was suppressed by the South Korean government, and the adult general public was angered due to its character's attitude of disrespect towards elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB11016499|title=둘리도 금서가 될 뻔했다?…9월 첫 주 '금서읽기주간'|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was when [[freedom of speech]] was not seriously taken into account. Generally speaking, the younger generation has fond memories of this series and find that the violence is actually a quite realistic portrayal of family dynamics in contemporary South Korea.

The character "Michol" has also received criticism in more recent years due to the character's appearance being likened to blackface.

{{Original research|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Dymer.jpg|thumb|First edition]]

'''''Dymer''''' is a [[narrative poem]] by [[C. S. Lewis]]. He worked on this, his most important poem, as early as 1916—when still only 17 years old—and completed it in 1925. ''Dymer'' was his second published work;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cslewismadison.org/fiction.html]&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[J. M. Dent]] in 1926, under the pseudonym Clive Hamilton (the writer's actual first name followed by his mother's maiden name).

Lewis thought of himself as writing in the tradition of [[Homer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Wordsworth]], and others. [[George Sayer]]'s analysis suggests that the book is about the temptation of fantasies, "the fantasies of love, lust, and power."

''Dymer'' follows the adventures of its titular protagonist from his birth in a totalitarian state, mockingly referred to as 'The Perfect City', to the events leading to his death at the hands of a monster he begat.

From the opening, Dymer grows to the age of nineteen under the control of the state, until, under the influence of spring and the sight of a songbird, he rises in his lecture-hall and murders the aged lecturer before his class, then leaves the stunned civilians behind as he wanders outside The City.

Dymer casts off his clothing along with civilization, wandering in the forests until he comes upon an empty mansion with food prepared. After dressing himself again with finer clothing, and feasting alone at a banquet table, Dymer sleeps with an unseen female figure who comes to him in the darkness of the mansion. Upon awakening, Dymer steps outside of the palace and wanders blissfully in the woods. Returning to the palace in search of his lover, he finds every entry barred by a hideous old she-monster. After pleading with her to 'yield but one inch; once only from your law', Dymer approaches the woman with intent to fight his way past her. What happens at this point is uncertain, except that Dymer emerges wounded from the palace and limps into the woodlands.

It begins to rain that night in the woods, and Dymer encounters yet another person he cannot see in the dark, this time a wounded man. This man also hails from The Perfect City, and tells Dymer of what happened in his absence, specifically that a revolutionary named Bran used Dymer's actions and name to instill violent protest in the citizens, who then went on to sack and raze the city. Dymer is dumbfounded at this information, and stays silent in the night until the man's wounds prove fatal, then sets out again for the wilderness.

Dymer encounters another individual in the wilderness, a man who uses a liquid to put himself into an extended dreaming state. Convincing Dymer that the answer to his anguish is in the dreaming world, Dymer swallows a cup of the liquid. In his hallucination, Dymer encounters his former lover from the mansion, but realizes she is monstrous. Instead of accepting this as the truth, he flees the scene as demons rise to assault him. Upon awakening, Dymer is threatened by the dreaming man, and sets off into the wilderness again. Dymer later arrives at a cemetery where he encounters an angelic guardian, who tells Dymer of a horrible monster lurking about, who was conceived by a union between a divine being and a mortal. Realizing that the beast is his own offspring, Dymer states he must face his own son in battle. Donning the guardian's armor, he prepares to fight the monster, which ends in his own death and the beast becoming a god.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3205">[[File:Edmondo Zacchini and Hugo Zacchini 1960-1970 circa.jpg|thumb]]
'''Edmondo Zacchini''' (27 March 1894 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1981) was a circus entertainer credited with inventing the [[human cannonball]] act as one of the [[Zacchini Brothers]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Early life==
Edmondo Zacchini was the oldest son of [[Ildebrando Zacchini]], an [[Italy|Italian]] portrait [[artist]] and amateur [[gymnast]], and brother of [[Hugo Zacchini]].  Ildebrando brought his family up in a traveling [[circus]].  The family eventually formed their own [[circus]], and Edmondo became a gifted [[clown]], as well as doing acrobatics.  

==Pagnotta==
During [[World War I]], when food was hard to come by, Edmondo was walking through town when he was recognized by a townsman.  The man had enjoyed the act so much, that he gave Edmondo his [[pagnotta]], a small loaf of bread that was, at the time, rationed by the [[bakery]] to one loaf per person.  Others came up, and each gave him their bread in appreciation for the act.  From then on, when the townspeople saw him, they would say "There goes Pagnotta".  Edmondo adopted it as his stage name.  With this name, he became the most famous [[clown]] in [[Italy]] in the 1920s.

==Human Cannonball==

He developed his first [[human cannonball]] act in [[Cairo]] in 1922.  This cannon was a crude spring-powered contraption that hurled him 20 feet. The result of his first attempt was a broken leg.  He re-designed the device in a [[hospital]] in [[Cairo]]. Later successful versions used [[compressed air]]. 

Zacchini and his brother Vittorio were invited to the [[United States]] in 1930 by a circus promoter. The family, consisting of six brothers and two sisters, eventually settled in [[Florida]], becoming citizens of the [[United States]].

==Death ==
Zacchini died in a hospital at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edmondo Zacchini, Inventor Of Human Cannonball Act, 87  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2DE1239F934A35753C1A967948260 |quote= Edmondo Zacchini, credited with inventing the ''Human Cannonball'' circus act by firing himself out of a spring-powered cannon, died here in a hospital Saturday. He was 87 years old. Mr. Zacchini developed his act in Cairo in 1922 using a crude spring-powered cannon that hurled him 20 feet. He later developed one using compressed air. The first time he was shot from the cannon, he broke a leg and redesigned the device in the hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17084">{{other uses|Gameplay (disambiguation)}}
'''Emergent gameplay''' refers to complex situations in [[video game]]s, [[board game]]s, or table top [[role-playing game]]s that [[emergence|emerge]] from the interaction of relatively simple [[game mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Le Gameplay emergent (in French)  | publisher = jeuxvideo.com | date = 2006-01-19 | url = http://www.jeuxvideo.com/dossiers/00006203/le-gameplay-emergent.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing tools to players such as placing [[web browser]]s within the game engine (such as in ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[The Matrix Online]]''), providing [[XML]] integration tools and [[programming language]]s (''[[Second Life]]''), fixing exchange rates (''[[Entropia Universe]]''), and allowing a player to [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawn]] any object they desire to solve a puzzle (''[[Scribblenauts]]'').{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Intentional emergence==
Intentional emergence occurs when some creative uses of the game are intended by the game designers. Since the 1970s and 1980s board games and table top role playing games such as ''[[Cosmic Encounter]]'' or ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' have featured intentional emergence as a primary game function by supplying players with relatively simple rules or frameworks for play that intentionally encouraged them to explore creative strategies or interactions and exploit them toward victory or goal achievement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Creative solutions===
In games with complex physics and flexible object interaction it may be possible to complete in-game problems using solutions that the game designers did not foresee. ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' is often cited as a game responsible for promoting the idea of emergent gameplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.igda.org/articles/hsmith_future.php | title=Deus Ex designer Harvey Smith discusses emergent gameplay | publisher=IGDA}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; with players developing interesting solutions such as using wall-mounted mines as [[piton]]s for climbing walls.

Such emergence may also occur in games through [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended gameplay]] and sheer weight of simulated content, in ''[[Slaves to Armok II: Dwarf Fortress|Dwarf Fortress]]'' or [[Space Station 13]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/video-games/pc/articles/2471.aspx|title=Indie Treasures: Dwarf Fortress|author=Allen Tan|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-20|work=brighthub.com|quote=There's so much content that is simulated in the game that emergent gameplay finally has a meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergent narrative===
Some games do not use a pre-planned story structure, even non-linear.

In ''[[The Sims]]'', a story may emerge from the actions of the player. But the player is given so much control that they are more creating a story than interacting with a story.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rollings |first1=Andrew |author2=Ernest Adams |title=Fundamentals of Game Design |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2006 |url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html |pages=194–204 |isbn=0-13-168747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent narrative would only partially be created by the player. [[Warren Spector]], the designer of ''Deus Ex'', has argued that emergent narrative lacks the emotional impact of linear storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |title=GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative |publisher=Xbox.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' features a dynamic system for game dramatics, pacing, and difficulty called the Director. The way the Director works  is called "Procedural narrative": instead of having a difficulty which increases to a constant level, the [[artificial intelligence (video games)|A.I.]] analyzes how the players fared in the game so far, and tries to add subsequent events that would give them a sense of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/opinion/gabe-newell-writes-edge |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909153756/http://www.next-gen.biz/opinion/gabe-newell-writes-edge |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=Gabe Newell Writes for Edge |last=Newell |first=Gabe |date=2008-11-21 |quote=''The events are trying to give them a sense of narrative. We look at sequences of events and try to take what their actions are to generate new sequences. If they've been particularly challenged by one kind of creature then we can use that information to make decisions about how we use that creature in subsequent encounters. This is what makes procedural narrative more of a story-telling device than, say, a simple difficulty mechanism.'' |publisher=edge-online.com |accessdate=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dankline.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/procedural-narrative-left-4-dead/
|title=Procedural Narrative: Left 4 Dead |last=Kline|first=Dan |date=2009-01-03|quote=''The horror setting, the tight team dynamic and situations, the swaying difficulty, the orthogonally designed super-zombies, all compound to push the players alongside the pacing and set up dramatic conflict and hard, human choices.  As opposed to hard, systematic choices.  Even though there’s barely a traditional “narrative” at all in L4D, the mechanics and the experience manager seem to create a framework that allows the player’s to build their own unique story, but in a different way then the Sim and Civilization-likes designers refer to it.  This is player story built on structure, rather than player story built in a sandbox.  And we know from experience that structured storytelling creates something special''|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintentional emergence==
Unintentional emergence occurs when creative uses of the video game were not intended by the game designers.

===Using game glitches===
Emergent gameplay can arise from a [[artificial intelligence (video games)|game's AI]] performing actions or creating effects unexpected by even the software developers. This may be by either a software glitch, the game working normally but producing unexpected results when played in an abnormal way or software that allows for AI development; for example the unplanned genetic diseases that can occur in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/papers/sginterview.html "The Origin of CyberLife: An interview with Steve Grand by Sue Wilcox"] retrieved from biota.org, in which Grand discusses emergence.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glitch or quirk-based strategies===
{{See also|Glitch}}
In several games, especially [[first-person shooter]]s, game glitches or physics quirks can become viable strategies, or even spawn their own game types.  In [[id Software]]'s ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' series, [[rocket jumping]] and [[strafe-jumping]] are two such examples. In the game ''[[Halo 2]]'', pressing the melee attack button (B) quickly followed by the reload button (X) and the primary fire button (R trigger) would result in the player not having to wait for the gun to be back in position to shoot after a melée attack. Doing this has become known as "BXR-ing". 

''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' had a glitch in the physics engine which allowed players to "ski" up and down steep slopes by rapidly pressing the jump key, gaining substantial speed in the process. The exploitation of this glitch became central to the gameplay, supplanting the vehicles that had been originally envisioned by the designers as the primary means of traversing large maps.&lt;ref name="ign2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/554/554250p2.html|title=Tribes: Vengeance Review|author=Butts, Steve|work=IGN|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to a programming oversight by [[Capcom]], the ''combo'' (or ''[[combo (video gaming)#2-1 combo|2-1 combo]]'') notion was introduced with the fighting game ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for their opponents to recover, as long as they were timed correctly.&lt;ref name="1up_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-street-fighter-ii |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720141819/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-street-fighter-ii |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-20 |title=The Essential 50, Part 32: Street Fighter II |publisher=1up.com |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing game objectives===

In [[online game|online]] car [[racing game]]s, particularly ''[[Project Gotham Racing]]'', players came up with an alternate objective known as "Cat and Mouse".  The racers play on teams of at least two cars.  Each team picks one very slow car as the mouse, and their goal is to have their slow car cross the finish line first. Thus the team members in faster cars aim to push their slow car into the lead and ram their opposing teams' slow cars off the road.

Completing games without getting certain items or by skipping seemingly required portions of gameplay result in [[sequence breaking]], a technique that has developed its own dedicated community. Often, speed of completion and/or minimalist use of items are respectable achievements. This technique has long been used in the ''[[Metroid]]'' game series and has developed into a community devoted to [[speedrun]]s. [[NetHack]] has over time codified many such challenges as "[[NetHack#Conducts|conduct]]" and acknowledges players who manage to finish characters with unbroken pacifist or vegetarian disciplines, for example.  A comparable form of restricted gameplay has been implemented within ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', known as "Iron Man" leveling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wowchallenges.com/ WoW Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt;

A change in gameplay can be used to create a ''de facto'' [[minigame]], such as the "Green Demon Challenge" in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', where the object is to avoid collecting a [[1-up]] which chases the player, even passing through terrain, while the player attempts to collect all red coins on a level.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://kotaku.com/outrunning-a-1-up-mushroom-in-super-mario-64-is-a-great-1659802995 Outrunning A 1-Up Mushroom In Super Mario 64 Is A Great Tradition]", ''[[Kotaku]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other challenges have been built around reaching normally unreachable areas or items, sometimes using glitches or [[Tool-assisted speedrun|gameplaying tools]], or by completing a level without using an important game control, such as the 'jump' button or [[joystick]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-64-coin-that-took-18-years-to-collect-1617679248 The Super Mario 64 Coin That Took 18 Years To Collect]", ''[[Kotaku]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221 The Man Who Does The Impossible in Super Mario 64]", ''[[Kotaku]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Machinima]], the use of [[computer animation]] from video game engines to create films, began in 1996. The practice of recording [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]es in [[id Software]]'s 1996 computer game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was extended by adding a narrative, thus changing the objective from winning to creating a film.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowood|first=Henry|year=2005|title=Real-Time Performance: Machinima and Game Studies|url=http://www.idmaa.org/journal/pdf/iDMAa_Journal_Vol_2_No_1_screen.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823180823/http://www.idmaa.org/journal/pdf/iDMAa_Journal_Vol_2_No_1_screen.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-23|format=PDF|journal=The International Digital Media &amp; Arts Association Journal|volume=2|issue=1|issn=1554-0405|accessdate=2006-08-07|at=13|quote=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|year=2007|title=Let Me Take You to ''The Movies'': Productive Players, Commodification and Transformative Play|work=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1354856507081961 |page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, game developers provided increased support for creating machinima; for example, [[Lionhead Studios]]' 2005 game ''[[The Movies]]'', is tailored for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|year=2007|title=Let Me Take You to ''The Movies'': Productive Players, Commodification and Transformative Play|work=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=392–393 [383]|doi=10.1177/1354856507081961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real economy interaction===
{{Main|Virtual economy}}
Traders in MMOs with economic systems play purely to acquire virtual game objects or avatars which they then sell for real-world money on [[auction]] websites or game currency exchange sites. This results in the trader's play objective to make real money regardless of the original game designer's objectives.

Many games prohibit currency trading in the [[end-user license agreement|EULA]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/wow_eula.html World of Warcraft EULA]'', Blizzard.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/d3_eula.html Diablo III EULA]'', Blizzard.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.guildwars.com/support/rmt/rmt-en.php Guild Wars Real-Money Trading Policy]'', NC Interactive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-user-agreement/ Guild Wars 2 User Agreement]'', NCSOFT.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still a common practice.{{or|date=November 2013}}

Some players provide real world services (like website design, web hosting) paid for with in-game currency. This can influence the economy of the game, as players gain wealth/power in the game unrelated to game events. For example, this strategy is used in [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Gambling==
Gambling and lotteries may occur in online role-playing games such as ''EVE Online'' and ''Dark Age of Camelot''. The provision of gambling services in exchange for in-game currency can take the forms of a lottery, [[card game]]s, event betting, or any number of other variations, most often at least loosely based on established real-world games. Players typically establish a betting facility, lottery etc.  Players typically create a website for executing the gambling, then accept payment from gamblers using in-game currency to credit the gambler's website account. Winnings are then paid back to the gambler's account.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
Other forms of gambling are commonly used in Massively Multiplayer Online Games, such as betting on who will win a duel.

===Game financial institutions===
In games with no financial law game mechanism, players develop financial institutions. Forms include banks or investment schemes launched with an [[IPO]], typically based purely on trust.

The world's first [[MMORPG]] IPO was ''ISS Marginis''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eve-iss.com/marginis/index.asp |title=ISS Marginis, worlds first MMOG IPO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125040658/http://www.eve-iss.com/marginis/index.asp |archivedate=2006-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate ''(ISS)'' in Eve-Online, on 29 September 2005. This was for a dividend based on profitability. The ISS followed up with a series of IPOs, culminating in an IPO of the player guild itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eve-iss.com/isso |title=Interstellar Starbase Syndicate - Player Guild IPO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220110337/http://eve-iss.com/ISSO/ |archivedate=2006-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; promising a fixed return, like a [[Bond (finance)|bond]]. Eve Online has no game-mechanism for financial law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In games with rough economies like [[World of Warcraft]]'s Auction House system, some players make a living by buying items that are unusually low priced and reselling them at high prices, or by buying out all competition and creating a [[monopoly]].  In the MMO ''Runescape'', players can purchase many thousand units of an item then sell them later for a profit just like a normal commodity market.  This game includes price data on all items for the last 180 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/frontpage.ws RuneScape Grand Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Endless Night''''' is a [[crime fiction|crime novel]] by [[Agatha Christie]], first published in the UK by the [[Collins Crime Club]] on 30 October 1967&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 29 October 1927 (p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US by [[Dodd, Mead and Company]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;John Cooper and B.A. Pyke.

Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 15)&lt;/ref&gt; and the US edition at $4.95.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt; It was one of her favourites of her own works and received some of the warmest critical notices of her career upon publication.

==Etymology==
The title comes from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Auguries of Innocence]]'':

: Every night and every morn,
: Some to misery are born,
: Every morn and every night,
: Some are born to sweet delight.
: Some are born to sweet delight,
: Some are born to endless night.

==Plot summary==
Michael Rogers, a footloose, seemingly nonchalant, working-class dabbler, narrates the story. He has a close relationship with his friend, Rudolf Santonix, a famous but ailing architect with an interest in one day building a house for Michael. While walking along a village road, Michael meets Fenella "Ellie" Guteman, a wealthy [[Inheritance|heiress]], who yearns for a life outside of her judgmental and pompous inner circle of relatives and advisers. Ellie and Michael form a romantic relationship and decide to marry.

Excited by the prospect of their new life, Ellie is able to fund the building of Gipsy's Acre, their new modern home near the place where they met. Michael requests Santonix build the house, to which he readily agrees. The couple come across locals, such as Major Phillpot, the village "God"; Claudia Hardcastle, a woman who shares Ellie's love of horse riding; and Miss Esther Lee, an elderly [[Gypsy (term)|gypsy]] who tells Ellie to leave the village or fate will curse her. Matters are made worse when Ellie invites her attractive [[secretary]]/[[Lady's companion|companion]] Greta Anderson to stay at the house, to the annoyance of Michael who eventually gets into a heated argument with her.

Ellie begins to become more worried about the dangers of Gipsy's Acre and more frightened of Miss Lee's increasing hostility towards her. Then, when she fails to return after embarking on a routine morning horse ride, Ellie's dead body is found in the woods. An inquest finds that a combination of a heart condition and being thrown from her horse was to blame. Michael visits Rudolf Santonix in hospital as he is close to death. Santonix, with his dying breath, screams "Why didn't you go the other way?" before dying in front of Michael. A melancholy Michael has to travel to America to attend Ellie's funeral and to receive the inheritance bequeathed to him in Ellie's will. While in America, Michael receives a letter from the village telling him that the bodies of Miss Lee and Claudia Hardcastle have been discovered, suggesting that Ellie's death was not an accident.

When he returns to the village, the true nature of Michael's intent is revealed: he had met Greta Anderson in Germany before meeting Ellie, and they had instantly fallen in love. Greedy for the good life, they had devised a plan in which Michael would marry Ellie to gain her inheritance, then murder her and marry Greta. Michael then murdered Ellie by poisoning the allergy capsule she took before riding her horse. The slow-acting cyanide killed her during the ride. Having paid Miss Lee to frighten Ellie to throw suspicion on the old gypsy, Michael eliminated her as a witness by pushing her into a quarry. The death of Claudia was an accident in that she had borrowed Ellie's allergy medicine to be able to ride her horse and so had died in the same way. Santonix had guessed Michael's intents previously, and his seemingly random outburst was in anger that Michael killed Ellie rather than living happily with her.

Even as Michael and Greta celebrate their triumph, Michael begins to break down in remorse and revulsion. He tells Greta of his vision of Ellie while on the road to Gipsy's Acre. Infuriated when Greta scolds him for his sudden weakness, he is further enraged by her disdain for Gipsy's Acre and his regret at the murder of Ellie. He viciously strangles her. At the end of the novel, Michael meekly awaits his fate as villagers discover Greta's murder and local officials interview him in his home.

==Characters==

The following details of the characters are based on the original novel. Backstories, backgrounds, and names vary with differing international adaptations, based on censorship, cultural norms, etc.

'''Fenella Rogers (née Guteman)''': Often called Ellie, she is a sweet heiress with a head for business

'''Michael Rogers''': A 'rolling stone', who shifts from job to job

'''Greta Andersen''': Ellie's Scandinavian, blonde companion with a penchant for arranging and often compared with a [[valkyrie]].

'''Claudia Hardcastle''': A young woman in the village who shares Ellie's passion for [[horse-riding]].

'''Cora Van Stuyvesant''': Ellie's stepmother, several times divorced, and a thoroughly unpleasant woman of roughly forty years of age who married Ellie's father for money.

'''Andrew Lipincott''': Ellie's guardian and trustee, a [[Boston]]ian with hardly a trace of accent, who resents Greta's 'influence' over Ellie.

'''Esther Lee''': The village gypsy, who enjoys frightening people, especially when money is involved

'''Stanford Lloyd''': Claudia Hardcastle's former husband and one of Ellie's trustees

'''Frank Barton''': The husband of Ellie's aunt, a man who borrows but doesn't return

'''Rudolf Santonix''': A perfectionist architect who 'looks through you' and 'sees right through the other side'. A personal friend of Michael's from the latter's time as a cab driver.

'''Major Phillpot''': The village 'god' who becomes a good friend of Michael

'''Mrs Rogers''': One of the few people who knows Michael well. She worked hard to get her son a proper education since her husband was often drunk.

==Literary significance and reception==
The novel - which recycles ploys and characters Christie had used in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' and ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' - is dedicated "To Nora Prichard from whom I first heard the legend of Gipsy's Acre." Nora Prichard was the paternal grandmother of  Mathew, Christie's only grandson. Gipsy's Acre was a field located on a Welsh moorland. ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 16 November 1967 said, "It really is bold of Agatha Christie to write in the ''persona'' of a working-class boy who marries a poor little rich girl, but in a pleasantly gothic story of gypsy warnings she brings it all off, together with a nicely melodramatic final twist."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Literary Supplement'' 16 November 1967 (p. 1092)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' carried a laudatory review in its issue of 10 November 1967 by Francis Iles ([[Anthony Berkeley Cox]]) who said, "The old maestrina of the crime-novel (or whatever is the female of 'maestro') pulls yet another out of her inexhaustible bag with ''Endless Night'', quite different in tone from her usual work. It is impossible to say much about the story without giving away vital secrets: sufficient to warn the reader that if he should think this is a romance he couldn't  be more mistaken, and the crashing, not to say horrific suspense at the end is perhaps the most devastating that this surpriseful author has ever brought off."&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian''. 10 November 1967 (p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Richardson in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 5 November 1967 began, "She changes her style again and makes a determined and quite suspenseful attempt to be with it." He finished, "I shan't give away who murders whom, but the suspense is kept up all the way and Miss Christie's new demi-tough, streamlined style really does come off. She'll be wearing black leather pants next, if she isn't already."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'' 5 November 1967 (p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt; The poet and novelist [[Stevie Smith]] chose the novel as one of her ''Books of the Year'' in the same newspaper's issue of 10 December 1967 when she said, "I mostly read Agatha Christie this year (and every year). I wish I could write more about what she does for one in the way of lifting the weight, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 10 December 1967 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Barnard]]: "The best of the late Christies, the plot a combination of patterns used in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd|Ackroyd]]'' and ''[[Death on the Nile|Nile]]'' (note similarities in treatment of heiress/heroine's American lawyers in ''Nile'' and here, suggesting she had been rereading). The murder occurs very late, and thus the central section seems desultory, even novelettish (poor little rich girl, gypsy's curse, etc.). But all is justified by the conclusion. A splendid late flowering."&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Robert. ''A Talent to Deceive – an appreciation of Agatha Christie'' – Revised edition (p. 193). Fontana Books, 1990; {{ISBN|0-00-637474-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

==="The Case of the Caretaker"===
A short story collection by Agatha Christie, titled ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'', published in October 1979, features a short story called "The Case of the Caretaker" whose overall plot is the same as ''Endless Night'', although the character names are different.

"‘The Case of the Caretaker’ was first published in Strand Magazine, January 1942, and then in the USA in Chicago Sunday Tribune, 5 July 1942." from "Miss Marple - Miss Marple and Mystery: The Complete Short Stories (Miss Marple)" by Agatha Christie

===''Endless Night'' (1972 Film)===
{{Main article|Endless Night (1972 film)}}

A 1972 film was made, starring [[Hayley Mills]], [[Britt Ekland]], [[Per Oscarsson]], [[Hywel Bennett]] and [[George Sanders]] (who committed suicide before the film's release). Christie reportedly had some reservations about the use of sex scenes to enliven the plot (there is only one in the finished film, with very brief nudity from Ms Ekland).

===Saturday Theatre (BBC Radio 4)===
''Endless Night'' was presented as a one-hour radio play in the ''Saturday Theatre'' strand on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 30 August 2008 at 2.30{{nbsp}}pm. The play's recording took place at [[Broadcasting House]] and had an original score composed by Nicolai Abrahamsen.

===Graphic novel adaptation===
''Endless Night'' was released by [[HarperCollins]] as a [[graphic novel]] adaptation on 3 November 2008, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq ({{ISBN|0-00-727533-1}}).

===''Agatha Christie's Marple'' adaptation===
Although the book did not feature Miss Marple, it is part of the [[List of Agatha Christie's Marple episodes#Series Six .282013.29|sixth series of ''Agatha Christie's Marple'']], starring [[Julia McKenzie]]. It aired first on Argentina's Film&amp;Arts on Wednesday 20 November, Australia's ABC on Sunday 22 December 2013, and aired on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on Sunday 29 December 2013. This adaptation by Kevin Elyot remains fairly faithful to the book, although, in addition to adding Miss Marple, it identifies the boyhood friend murdered for his wristwatch by Rogers with the architect's brother, who does not appear in the original novel. The architect (named Robbie Hayman in this TV adaption) ends up burning down the house he has designed for Rogers after discovering his brother's watch in Rogers' desk drawer.

The [[United States]] '''Family Entertainment Protection Act (FEPA)''' was a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced by Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY), and co-sponsored by Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] (D-CT), [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] (D-SD) and [[Evan Bayh]] (D-IN) on November 29, 2005. The bill called for a federal mandate enforcement of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) ratings system for [[video games]] in order to protect children from inappropriate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senators Clinton, Lieberman Announce Federal Legislation to Protect Children from Inappropriate Video Games |url=http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=249368&amp;&amp; |accessdate=December 18, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731213523/http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=249368&amp;&amp; |archivedate=July 31, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FEPA would have imposed fines of US$1000 or 100 hours of community service for a first time offense of selling a "Mature" or "Adult-Only" rated video game to a minor, and $5000 or 500 hours for each subsequent offense. The bill also called for a [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] investigation into the ESRB to ascertain whether they have been properly rating games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game-restriction bill submitted to congress |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6141410.html |accessdate=December 18, 2005 |author=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219163842/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6141410.html |archivedate=December 19, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar bills have been passed in some [[U.S. state]]s such as [[California]], [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]], but were ruled to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = It’s All Fun And Games Until Someone Gets Hurt: The Effectiveness Of Proposed Video-Game Legislation On Reducing Violence In Children | url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf | author=Patrick R. Byrd}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n]]'', 564 U.S. 08–1448 (2011). 

This bill did not become law; it was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] and expired at the end of the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] without further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-2126 |title=S. 2126 &lt;nowiki&gt;[109th]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: Family Entertainment Protection Act|author=Govtrack.us |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Proposals==

===I. Prohibition on Selling Mature and Adults Only video games to minors===

The centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen. On-site store managers would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense; $5,000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense. This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) system. That’s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system. Similar prohibitions had become law in the last several months in California, Michigan, and Illinois, but were later overturned.

===II. Annual Analysis of the Ratings System===

Since the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors, this bill requires an annual, independent analysis of game ratings. This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time.

===III. Authority for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to Investigate Misleading Ratings===

Part of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' had included, through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public, [[Hot Coffee mod|sexually explicit content]] inconsistent with the game’s Mature rating. This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with ''GTA: San Andreas'' is a pervasive problem. It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem.

===IV. Authority to Register Complaints===

This bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress.

===V. Annual Retailer Audit===

This bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual, random audit of retailers – sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey – to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress.

Gambling is an activity undertaken by many Australians. Over 80% of Australian adults engage in gambling of some kind, which is the highest rate of gambling in the world.&lt;ref name="bbc070130"&gt;Bryant, Nick  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6313083.stm "Australia in thrall of gambling mania"], ''[[BBC]]'', 30 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This number includes some 4% of the adult population who play the [[slot machine|pokies]] once a week, accounting for some 62% of locals’ annual gambling spend.&lt;ref name="Australian Gambling Habits"&gt;[http://www.casinotropez.com/australian-gambling-habits Australian Gambling Habits]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambling is a significant public health issue, with around 80,000 to 160,000 (or 0.5 - 1.0%) of Australian adults experiencing significant problems from gambling and a further 250,000 to 350,000 (or 1.4 - 2.1% of adults) experiencing moderate risks that may make them vulnerable to problem gambling.&lt;ref name=Productivitycommission&gt;{{cite web|last1=Productivity|first1=Commission|title=Productivity Commission Inquiry Report|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/gambling-2009/report|website=pc.gov.au/|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revenue==
In 2015-16, gambling revenue made up 7.7% of state and territory taxation revenue. The rate was lowest in Western Australia (2.5%) and highest in the Northern Territory (12.0%). Gambling revenue made up 2.5% of total state revenue when other revenue sources were taken into account. The rate was lowest in WA (0.9%) and highest in Victoria (3.2%). Gambling revenue as a portion of state taxation revenue has fallen for all states and territories between 2006-07 and 2015-16.&lt;ref name="SEIS4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fourth social and economic impact study of gambling in Tasmania (2017), Volume 1: Industry trends and impacts|publisher=ACIL Allen Consulting|pages=57-60|url=http://www.treasury.tas.gov.au/Documents/Vol%201%20-%20SEIS%202017%20-%2022%20DECEMBER%202017%20-%20FINAL.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total Australian gambling revenue in 2008-09 was just over $19 billion and the share of household consumption was 3.1%&lt;ref name=Productivitycommission /&gt;

==New South Wales==
New South Wales has a long history of gambling; Australia’s first official horse racing meeting occurred in 1810 at Hyde Park in Sydney; the first official Australian lottery occurred in 1881 at the Sydney Cup; and registered clubs operated the first legal poker machines in Australia from 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Australian Institute of Gambling Research|title=Australian Gambling Comparative History and Analysis|url=https://www.vcgr.vic.gov.au/CA256F800017E8D4/WebObj/BA5F52C5B3108318CA2570290029161B/$File/Project_1999AGCHA.pdf|website=www.vcgr.vic.gov.au|publisher=Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory authorities==
Since the introduction of new gambling services, including online gambling, the Commonwealth has taken a more active role in the regulation of gambling, but the Australian gambling industry is also regulated by State and Territory authorities:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/sp/gambling_ebrief.htm Parliament Library: Gambling Policy and Regulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online gambling==
The Interactive Gambling Act (2001) was passed by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament on 28 June 2001.&lt;ref name = "Assent"&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/478/interactive-gambling-act-receives-assent.aspx Interactive Gambling Act Receives Assent]&lt;/ref&gt; It received assent on 11 July 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00851 Interactive Gambling Act 2001: Compilation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is targeted at online gambling operators, making it an offense for them to offer ‘real-money’ online interactive gambling to residents of Australia. It also makes it illegal for online gambling operators to advertise ‘real-money’ interactive gambling services (such as online poker and casino) to Australian citizens.&lt;ref name = "Assent" /&gt;
That being said, the amount spent on online gaming by Australians reached some $800 million by 2010, according to the official 2010 Productivity Report of the Australian Government.&lt;ref name="Australian Gambling Habits"/&gt;

Accessing and using the interactive gambling services is not an offence. It is also allowed to companies based in Australia to offer their gambling services to gamblers located outside Australia with the exception of those countries that were called 'designated countries'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/research/review-interactive-gambling-act-2001 Review of the Interactive Gaming Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxation laws on gambling in Australia ==
Gamblers' winnings in Australia are not taxed{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. There are 3 main reasons for that:
*Gambling is not considered a profession, it's treated as a hobby or recreational activity.
*The Australian government views gains from gambling activities not as income, but as a result of good luck. Even if someone wins big, they also lose a lot in other gambling sessions.
*The government taxes gambling operators instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu-librarian.com/00_afts_final_report_consolidated.pdf Australia’s future tax system - Report to the Treasurer 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation of gambling operators in Australia differs from state to state and different gambling services are taxed in a different way. There are taxes on the turnover, on player loss and net profit. As gambling operators need to obtain a license to offer their services, certain fees must also be paid at this stage of gambling business development.&lt;ref name ="gambling taxes" /&gt;

The use of different tax rates and tax bases makes it difficult to compare taxes across states. For example, the ACT's keno tax rate of 2.53% of turnover is equivalent to a tax rate on gross profits of 10.12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joint Select Committee on Future Gaming Markets: Final Report|publisher=Parliament of Tasmania|pages=146|url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/Joint/FutureGamingMarkets.htm|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lacrosse in England''' is an amateur sport played mainly by community based clubs and university teams. [[Lacrosse]] was introduced to England in 1876 by [[William George Beers]] and other Canadians who toured the country playing exhibition matches. A second tour was arranged in 1883; by then England had 60 clubs playing regular fixtures in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FIL World Championships Preview: Blue Division - England|url=http://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/fil-world-championships-preview-blue-division-england/8305|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=Inside Lacrosse|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national governing body for the men's game, the '''English Lacrosse Union''', was formed in 1892. A '''Ladies' Lacrosse Association''' followed in 1912, and the separate men's and women's organisations merged in 1996 to form the [[English Lacrosse Association]] (ELA). The ELA oversees both the [[England men's national lacrosse team|men's]] and [[England women's national lacrosse team|women's]] national teams.

==Men's lacrosse==
[[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] have held Varsity Matches in lacrosse since 1903, playing every year besides the world wars. Oxford leads the series 56-40-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lacrosse in Britain|url=https://activityworkshop.net/lacrosse/britain.html|website=Activity Workshop|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Grant|title=101st Varsity Match approaches for Oxford University Lacrosse Club|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2017/02/26/101st-varsity-match-approaches-oxford-university-lacrosse-club/|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=The Oxford Student Newspaper|date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Club [[field lacrosse|men's lacrosse]] in Britain is divided into northern and southern leagues, with Flags competitions at the end of each winter season. In addition to the regular 10-a-side season there are other tournaments, such as those at Stockport and Bath, which use a 6-a-side or 8-a-side format and shorter games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laxallstars.com/london-calling-growing-english-lacrosse/|title=London Calling: Growing English Lacrosse - Lacrosse All Stars|first=Henning|last=Schmidt|date=8 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern clubs are governed by North of England Men's Lacrosse Association (NEMLA), which was formed in 1897 when 10 clubs began playing regular fixtures. NEMLA now comprises a Premiership and four further Senior Divisions. Southern clubs are governed by South of England Men's Lacrosse Association (SEMLA) and comprises a Premier Division, two West Divisions (including South Wales), and three East Divisions.

The main focus of men's lacrosse popularity in Britain is the North-West of England, around the [[Greater Manchester]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8811000/8811519.stm|title=BBC - How Manchester took sport of lacrosse to its heart|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater Manchester has hosted the [[World Lacrosse Championship]] in [[1978 World Lacrosse Championship|1978]], [[1994 World Lacrosse Championship|1994]], and [[2010 World Lacrosse Championship|2010]]. A second centre is in the South of England, especially around the London area.

Men's lacrosse is a common minority sport in universities, which along with club-based youth programs, provide the majority of newcomers with their first experiences of the sport. In 2008, a men's [[British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport|BUCS]] league was introduced, providing greater support and recognition to the men's university teams.

==Women's lacrosse==
McCrone credits lacrosse's limited popularity with Victorian men for its adoption by many girls' [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="McCrone"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCrone |first1=Kathleen |title=Sport and the Physical Emancipation of Women, 1870-1914 |date=1988 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=041500358X |pages=137–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 former students from [[Wycombe Abbey]], [[Roedean School|Roedean]] and [[Prior's Field School|Prior's Field]] schools formed the first women's lacrosse club in England, the Southern Ladies' Lacrosse Club. The club played against sides from public schools and was captained by [[Audrey Beaton]], an Old Roedeanian.&lt;ref name="McCrone" /&gt; In 1912 Beaton led the establishment of the Ladies' Lacrosse Association, which included school teams; Beaton became honorary secretary and [[Roedean School#History|Penelope Lawrence]], Roedean headmistress, was its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doughan |first1=David |last2=Gordon |first2=Peter |title=Women, Clubs and Associations in Britain |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=113420437X |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LLA expanded rapidly and established a national team in March 1913.&lt;ref name="McCrone" /&gt; A rivalry with [[Field hockey in England|hockey]] developed when some girls' schools replaced hockey with lacrosse, but lacrosse remained a more minor sport.&lt;ref name="McCrone" /&gt;

A close relationship between the LLA and the men's English Lacrosse Union&lt;ref name="McCrone" /&gt; was consolidated with a merger in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association. Today, club [[women's lacrosse]] is governed by the South East Women's Lacrosse Association (SEWLA), South West Women's Lacrosse Association (SWWLA), and North Women's Lacrosse Association (NWLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixtures &amp; Results|url=http://www.englishlacrosse.co.uk/lacrosse-talk/results-fixtures/|publisher=English Lacrosse Association|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Lacrosse%20in%20England&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iau5n0X_QT&amp;sig=pDijkVB3t2PdrYGSL5C646v1s6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lacrosse%20in%20England&amp;f=false|title=Lacrosse: A History of the Game|first=Donald M.|last=Fisher|date=14 March 2002|publisher=JHU Press|accessdate=9 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Jeu d'Adam''''' (Latin: ''Ordo representacionis Adae'', English: ''The Play of Adam'') is a twelfth-century [[liturgical drama]] written in the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo Norman]] dialect of Medieval [[French language|French]]. While choral texts and stage directions are in [[Latin]], the spoken text of the play is in the vernacular, which makes the Adam the oldest extant play written in any old French dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Studer, Paul. Le Mystere d'Adam, An Anglo-Norman Drama of the Twelfth Century. p.xxii. Manchester University Press, 1928. https://archive.org/stream/lemystredadama00stud#page/n25/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dramatic representation of the temptation and fall of [[Adam and Eve]], the story of [[Cain and Abel]], and a series of prophets including  [[Isaiah]] and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. It is part of the medieval tradition of [[mystery play]]s, which developed from dramatic elements in the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and includes choral music.

The opening statement of the piece describes part of the set:
:Let paradise be constructed in a prominently high place [''constituatus paradisus loco eminentori'']; let curtain and silken hangings be placed around it at such a height that those persons who will be in paradise can be seen from the shoulders upwards; let sweet-smelling flowers and foliage be planted; within let there be various trees, and fruits hanging on them, so that the place may seem as delightful as possible [''ut amoenissimus locus videatur''].&lt;ref name="kobialka"&gt;{{cite book |title=This Is My Body: Representational Practices in the Early Middle Ages |last=Kobialka |first=Michal |year=1999 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=978-0-472-08938-3 |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3AN-z5_m8wC&amp;pg=PA183 |accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The play was to be presented outside the church, possibly with Paradise being located at the top of the stairs to the west door, such that the church doors would stand in for the gates of Heaven.&lt;ref name="kobialka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="broadview"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Volume 1: The Medieval Period |year=2009 |publisher=Broadview Press |location=Peterborough, ON |isbn=978-0-472-08938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of this play is unknown, although we can assume from his knowledge of Latin that he was in a religious position.&lt;ref name="broadview" /&gt;

== Modern performances ==
The 2009 English translation of the play by [[Carol Symes]] in ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'' was staged at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [[The Cloisters|Cloisters Museum]] in New York City in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/met-live-arts/2016/play-of-adam-met-cloisters|title=Presenting The Play of Adam at The Met Cloisters|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; That production, directed by Kyle A.

''[[Animaniacs]]'' is a children's animated television program that ran from 1993 to 1998.  Over the show's course, several VHS collections were released, and DVD box sets were released as well.

==VHS==
Several VHS videos were released in the [[United States]], in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].  All of these videos are out of print, but are still available at some online sellers.  The episodes in the VHS "volumes" were generally jumbled at random and are in no particular order with the series.  The other videotapes (with the exception of Animaniacs Stew) feature episodes that had focused on one general subject. Each video featured four to five skits each and was accompanied by a handful of skit intros, with a running time of about 45 minutes.

[[File:Indra deva.jpg|thumb|[[Indra]], the Indian/ Hindu god of thunder.]]
[[Polytheism|Polytheistic]] peoples of many cultures have postulated a '''thunder god''', the personification or source of the forces of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]]; a lightning god does not have a typical depiction, and will vary based on the culture. In many cultures, the thunder god is frequently known as the chief or king of the gods, e.g. [[Indra]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Zeus]] in [[Greek mythology]], and [[Perun]] in ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] religion; or a close relation thereof, e.g. [[Thor]], son of [[Odin]], in [[Norse mythology]]. This is also true of [[Shango]] in [[Yoruba religion]] and in the syncretic religions of the African Diaspora, such as [[Santería]] (Cuba, Puerto Rico, United States) and [[Candomblé]] (Brazil).

==In Literature==
The Hindu God Indra was the chief deity and at his prime during the [[Vedic period]], where he was considered to be the supreme God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=Edward Delavan|date=1885|title=Indra in the Rig-Veda|jstor=592191|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=11|pages=117–208|doi=10.2307/592191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rigveda: The Oldest Literature of the Indians|last=Kaegi|first=Adolf|publisher=Boston: Ginn and Company|year=1886|isbn=978-1428626676|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=85WR0ae1WRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra was initially recorded in the [[Rigveda]], the first of the religious scriptures that comprise the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rigveda: The Oldest Literature of the Indians|last=Kaegi|first=Adolf|publisher=Boston: Ginn and Company|year=1886|isbn=978-1428626676|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=85WR0ae1WRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra continued to play a prominent role throughout the evolution of Hinduism and played a pivotal role in the two Sanskrit epics that comprise the [[Itihasa]]s, appearing in both the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Although the importance of Indra has since been subsided in favor of other Gods in contemporary Hinduism, he is still venerated and worshipped.

In [[Greek mythology]], the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]], or the Elysian Plains, was the final resting places of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous, evolved from a designation of a place or person [[Thunderbolt|struck by lightning]], ''enelysion, enelysios.''&lt;ref name="burkert1982"&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'', 1985. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a reference to [[Zeus]], the god of lightning, so "lightning-struck" could be saying that the person was blessed (struck) by Zeus (/lightning/fortune). Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]] has also suggested that Greek ''Elysion'' may have instead been derived from the [[Ancient Egyptian Language|Egyptian]] term ''[[Aaru|ialu]]'' (older ''iaru''), meaning "reeds," with specific reference to the "[[Reed fields]]" (Egyptian: ''[[Aaru|sekhet iaru]]'' / ''ialu''), a paradisiacal land of plenty where the dead hoped to spend eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, Jan (2001). ''Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt''. Cornell University Press. p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

'''METIS''' is a software package for [[graph partitioning]] that implements various [[Graph partition#Multi-level methods|multilevel algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |author1=George Karypis |author2=Vipin Kumar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=METIS - Unstructured Graph Partitioning and Sparse Matrix Ordering System, Version 2.0 |year=1995 |url=ftp://ftp.cs.umn.edu/dept/users/kumar/metis/manual.ps }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs |author1=Karypis, G. |author2=Kumar, V. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=359 |year=1999 |doi=10.1137/S1064827595287997 |citeseerx=10.1.1.39.3415}}&lt;/ref&gt; METIS' multilevel approach has three phases and comes with several algorithms for each phase:
# Coarsen the graph by generating a sequence of graphs G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, where G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the original graph and for each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N, the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Compute a partition of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
# Project the partition back through the sequence in the order of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, refining it with respect to each graph.
The final partition computed during the third phase (the refined partition projected onto G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a partition of the original graph.

A '''''Makura-Nage''''' ({{lang-ja|枕投げ, まくらなげ}}) is a [[game]] from [[Japan]] in which [[Child|children]] throw [[pillow]]s at each other. A typical occasion to play it is after the ''[[futon]]'' are prepared (especially after the official lights-off time) in [[summer camp]].

While a [[pillow fight]] mainly takes the form of beating each other with pillows, Japanese Makura-Nage is a game in which players mainly throw pillows to each other. The word "''makura''" means "pillow", "''nage''" means "throwing".

There were no rules for Makura-Nage, but today some Japanese [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] hold Makura-Nage Games (まくら投げ大会) for advertisement.

In many [[anime]] and [[manga]], a Makura-Nage scene creates a nostalgic atmosphere when describing children.

'''''Moruchi Mavshi''''' ([[Devanagari]]:मोरूची मावशी) is a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] play written by playwright [[Pralhad Keshav Atre]] based on the English play [[Charley's Aunt]]. The play is a light hearted comedy. It is best known for [[Vijay Chavan|Vijay Chavan's]] iconic role in this famous Marathi Stage drama where he regaled in the title role of Moru's aunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moruchi Mavshi is back|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2001/apr/9506.htm|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Set in the post-Independence era when different sansthans (princely states) of India were being demolished, the play deals with three college friends Moru ([[Prashant Damle]]), Bhaiyya ([[Pradeep Patwardhan]]) and Bandya ([[Vijay Chavan]]). Moru and Bhaiyya are sharing a bungalow they have rented. Moru's aunt, the queen of Kanda Sansthan, is coming visiting. So Moru and Bhaiyya call their girlfriends from their neighborhood to give her company but at the last minute the aunt's visit is cancelled and Bandya, who is playing a female part for a theatre group is coaxed by his two friends to become Moru's aunt. What follows is a fun-filled drama with Bhaiyya's uncle and the girls' uncle proposing to mavshi and the arrival of the real mavshi and her niece who happens to be Bandya's girlfriend.

==Style==
Singing and dancing are used here to good effect laced with comedy. The main highlight of the play was 'Tang ting tinga', a song from the play where Chavan is at his best - dancing, jumping, playing games in a sari.

==Original cast and crew==

*[[Pradeep Patwardhan]] : Bhaiya

He focuses on the art and quality of NOC's operations, while Sylvia Chan focuses on the business aspect of NOC's operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tham|first1=Raymond|title=Q&amp;A with Night Owl Cinematics’ Ryan and Sylvia|url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/celebrity/qa-night-owl-cinematics-ryan-and-sylvia|work=Today|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokkien]] and [[Singlish]] colloquialisms are freqeuntly used in their videos, offering glimpses into Singaporean culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singaporean YouTube stars make their mark online and offline|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/singaporean-youtube-stars-make-their-mark-online-and-offline|work=The Straits Times|date=13 April 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Frequently, they also use [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] for foreign people and Chinese people to know easier. English subtitles are also provided on their videos for reference.

Their channel became a success on YouTube and they are now one of the most famous YouTubers in Singapore and Southeast Asia.

The office of Night Owl Cinematics has been relocated to the heart of [[Yishun]] in November 2017 but mail address remained the same at [[Kent Ridge]].

''NOW'' was launched in late 1996 as a less serious, more gossip-oriented magazine aimed at women. A series of high-profile celebrity relationships, such as between [[David Beckham|David]] and [[Victoria Beckham]], and [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Brad Pitt]] provided ample material, while reality shows such as ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Pop Idol]]'' grew popular at just the right time to help fill pages. ''NOW'' is published by [[TI Media]].

It is a mix of celebrity news, gossip and fashion and is primarily aimed at women. It also features movie and music reviews, real-life stories, shopping and style feature together with major celebrity interviews.

The magazine had a circulation of 196,726 copies in the second part of 2013.&lt;ref name=Circ/&gt; Now's circulation fell to 126,921 in the second half of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/full-2015-mag-abcs-breakdown-cosmopolitan-bucks-trend-uk-magazines-decline-average-4-cent&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Performance art]] in China''' has been growing since the 1970s as a response to the very traditional nature of Chinese state-run [[art schools]]. It is becoming more and more popular in spite of the fact that it is currently outlawed. In 1999 the importance of contemporary [[China|Chinese]] art was recognized by the inclusion of 19 contemporary [[Chinese artist]]s in the [[Venice Biennale]]. In recent years many of these artists have made performances specifically for photography or film. 

==Examples==
Some of the more extreme examples of Chinese performance art have become notorious in the West. In 2000, [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]], a painter and performance artist from Cheng Du, created a scandal by taking a number of photographs of himself, supposedly eating a [[foetus]] as a protest against state [[abortion]]s as a means of population control. [[Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu|Peng Yu and Sun Yuan]] have also worked with human body parts as well as with live animals and are equally notorious. Some younger performance artists who have exhibited widely in the west in 2005-6 are [[Shu Yang]], the organiser  of the Dadao Live Art Festival in Beijing, [[Yang Zhichao]], famous for having his identity card number branded on his back and [[Wang Chuyu]] who went on hunger strike as part of an exhibition called [[Fuck Off (art exhibition)|Fuck Off]] that took place in Shanghai in 2000 in opposition to the Shanghai Biennale. They acknowledge a debt to older performance artist and curator [[Ai Weiwei]]. Other well-known artists are [[Ma Liuming]], [[Zhu Ming]], and [[He Yunchang]].

The 1996 film ''[[Frozen (1997 film)|Frozen]]'' (Chinese title: Jidu Hanleng; 极度寒冷) by Chinese director [[Wang Xiaoshuai]], made under the pseudonym Wu Ming, has as its protagonists a group of Chinese performance artists, who are shown engaging in several street performances in the film.

'''''Phantom of Chinatown''''' is a 1940 American [[mystery film]] directed by [[Phil Rosen]] starring [[Keye Luke]].  This is the last of the [[Mr. Wong (James Lee Wong)|Mr. Wong]] films and the only one to star Luke in the role originated by [[Boris Karloff]].

==Plot==
After participating in an extensive archaeological expedition in the Mongolian desert, Dr. John Benton is in San Francisco to hold a presentation of the findings to his colleagues. The film material shows how the archaeological team discovered the long sought ancient tomb of an Emperor of the Ming dynasty.

In the tomb, the team found a scroll, telling of a secret Temple of Eternal Fire. The temple is believed to be hiding a previously unknown oil reserve, and would be of great financial importance to the Chinese people were it to be discovered.

During the expedition, when the tomb was opened, a forceful hurricane took the life of Mason, the co-pilot. The storm was predicted by an ancient curse guarding the tomb. Unfortunately, as Benton is about to reveal the contents of the scroll during the presentation, he starts choking and ultimately dies from suffocation.

After the presentation, it turns out that the scroll is missing from Benton's safe in his office, and his secretary, Win Len, claims she has no knowledge of its whereabouts. One of Benton's students, James Lee Wong, does his own investigation into the death of his professor, and finds out that Benton must have been poisoned with what another man, Street, identifies as an oriental vegetable poison. James finds a pitcher and a glass cup containing traces of this poison. 
Another member of the expedition team, camera man Charles Fraser, is attacked in his home, and is found injured by James and Street. They also find Lotus tied up and gagged at the house, having been attacked after entering the house. They are both unaware of that Mason faked his own death at the tomb, and that he and Benton's butler, Jonas, are planning to lay their hands on all artifacts found in the tomb.

Street manage to trace Fraser's attacker to a hideout near the waterfront, where both Mason and Jonas are hiding. Mason escapes through a secret door, but James and Street find an artifact identifiable from the tomb. They also find Jonas' dead body in a coffin, and it turns out he has been poisoned, then stabbed.

The two amateur sleuths manage to get an article published in the paper, saying Jonas is sick with yellow fever in a hospital, to lure the killer there. James wears a wire and impersonates Mason at the hospital. Mason himself turns up at the hospital, and also Fraser. James and Mason fight each other, but Street and the police interrupt them.

It turns out Fraser has worked together with Mason, but tried to double-cross him and break into Benton's safe to steal the scroll. Fraser also killed Benton to keep the secret of the oil reserve to himself. He later kill Jonas.

The original scroll has now been destroyed by Fraser, but there is still a photo of it left. After Fraser is arrested, the photo is given to the Chinese government so that they can try to find the oil reserve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17705/Phantom-of-Chinatown/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Popeye the Sailor''' is a cartoon [[character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Crisler Segar]].&lt;ref name="EBA"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066592/Elzie-Segar Segar, Elzie (Crisler) – Encyclopædia Britannica Article]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;[[Ron Goulart|Goulart, Ron]], "Popeye", ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture''. Detroit: St. James Press, 2000. (Volume 4, pp. 87-8).{{ISBN|9781558624047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;Walker, Brian. ''The Comics: The Complete Collection''. New York: Abrams ComicArts, 2011. (pp. 188-9,191, 238-243) {{ISBN|9780810995956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character first appeared in the daily [[King Features]] [[comic strip]], '''''Thimble Theatre''''', on January 17, 1929, and '''''Popeye''''' became the strip's title in later years; Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television [[animated cartoon]]s.&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt;

Segar's ''Thimble Theatre'' strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut, but the one-eyed (left) sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip, and ''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular properties during the 1930s. After Segar's death in 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was continued by several [[comics artist|writers and artists]], most notably Segar's assistant [[Bud Sagendorf]]. The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its [[Sunday strip|Sunday edition]], written and drawn by [[Hy Eisman]]. The daily strips are [[reprint]]s of old Sagendorf stories.&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt;

In 1933, [[Max Fleischer]] adapted the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters into a series of ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' theatrical cartoon shorts for [[Paramount Pictures]]. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and Fleischer—and later Paramount's own [[Famous Studios]]—continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by [[Turner Entertainment]] and distributed by its sister company [[Warner Bros.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/%E2%80%9Cpopeye%E2%80%9D-comes-dvd-warner-home-video/|title="Popeye comes to DVD from Warner Home Video"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in [[comic book]]s, [[cartoon series|television cartoons]], [[arcade game|arcade]] and [[video game]]s, hundreds of [[advertisements]],&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; and peripheral products (ranging from [[spinach]] to [[candy cigarettes]]), and the [[Popeye (film)|1980 live-action film]] directed by [[Robert Altman]], starring comedian [[Robin Williams]] as Popeye.

In an interview, [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] said "''Popeye'' was a great favorite of mine...I think ''Popeye'' was a perfect comic strip, consistent in drawing and humor".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, Lee and Schulz, Charles M., ''Charlie Brown and Charlie Schulz: in celebration of the 20th anniversary of "Peanuts"''. New York: New American Library, 1971. (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Popeye #20 on its "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character and story==
Popeye's story and characterization vary depending on the medium. Originally, Popeye got "luck" from rubbing the head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting "strength" from eating spinach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/popeye-facts/|title=13 Interesting Popeye the Sailorman Facts|date=December 3, 2012|work=todayifoundout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swee'Pea is definitively Popeye's ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to [[Olive Oyl]] in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature members of Popeye's family who have never appeared in the strip, notably his lookalike nephews Peepeye, Pupeye, Pipeye, and Poopeye.

There is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of [[manners]] and uneducated, yet he is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or, most importantly, the [[scientific community]]. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed [[Sherlock Holmes]]-like investigative prowess (determining, for instance, that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a "spinach-drive" [[spacecraft]]), or oversimplified (yet successful) [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] arguments (by presenting his own existence—and superhuman strength—as the only true guarantee of world peace at diplomatic conferences). Popeye's pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and, of course, a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. Popeye also on occasion eats [[spinach]] through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can itself along with the contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt;

Popeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the [[love triangle]] among Popeye, Olive, and [[Bluto]], and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character that Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, Popeye usually uncovers villainous plots by accidentally sneaking up on the antagonists as they brag about or lay out their schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==''Thimble Theatre'' and ''Popeye'' comic strips==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}

''Thimble Theatre'' was cartoonist [[E.&amp;nbsp;C. Segar]]'s third published strip when it first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal]]'' on December 19, 1919. The paper's owner [[William Randolph Hearst]] also owned [[King Features Syndicate]], which syndicated the strip. ''Thimble Theatre'' was intended as a replacement for ''Midget Movies'' by [[Ed Wheelan]] (Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features).&lt;ref name="alc"&gt;Clark, Alan and Laurel, ''Comics: An Illustrated History''.London, Green Wood Publishing, 1992. {{ISBN|9781872532554}} (p.54)&lt;/ref&gt; It did not attract a large audience at first, and at the end of its first decade appeared in only half a dozen newspapers.

In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in [[theatre|theatrical]] style (hence the strip's name). It could be classified as a [[gag-a-day]] comic in those days.&lt;ref name="alc" /&gt;

''Thimble Theatre's'' first main characters were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend [[Harold Hamgravy]]. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-[[adventure film|adventure]] style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother [[Castor Oyl]]. Olive's parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances.

Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen. Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip but, due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alc" /&gt;

The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result. Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, but she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham Gravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually, he settled down as a [[detective]] and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.

In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named "[[Swee'Pea]]." Other regular characters in the strip were [[J. Wellington Wimpy]], a [[hamburger]]-loving moocher who would "gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers were nicknamed "Wimpys" after the character); [[George W. Geezil]], a local [[shoemaking|cobbler]] who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and [[Eugene the Jeep]], a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with [[magic in fiction|magical]] powers. In addition, the strip featured the [[Sea Hag]], a terrible [[pirate]], as well as the last [[witch]] on earth (her even more terrible sister excepted); [[Alice the Goon]], a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's [[babysitter]]; and Toar, a caveman.

Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and [[Bluto]] made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a [[cigar]], due to his last name being a [[homophone]] of "cigar" (pronounced SEE-gar). The success of the strip meant Segar was earning $100,000 a year at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt;

''Thimble Theatre'' became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s. A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April 1937 issue of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine voted ''Popeye'' their second favourite comic strip (after ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'').&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt; By 1938, ''Thimble Theatre'' was running in 500 newspapers, and over 600 licensed "Popeye" products were on sale.&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt; Following an eventual name change to ''Popeye'' in the 1970s, the comic remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. After Mussolini came to power in Italy, he banned all American comic strips, but Popeye was so popular the Italians made him bring it back. The strip carried on after Segar's death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip was established, called ''Popeye the Sailorman''.

===Artists after Segar===
[[File:Thimbledecem11951.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Tom Sims and Bill Zaboly's ''Thimble Theatre'' (December 2, 1951)]]
After Segar's death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. [[Tom Sims (artist)|Tom Sims]], the son of a [[Coosa River]] channel-boat captain, continued writing ''Thimble Theatre'' strips and established the ''Popeye the Sailorman'' spin-off. [[Doc Winner]] and [[Bela Zaboly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lambiek comic shop and studio in Amsterdam, The Netherlands |url=http://lambiek.net/artists/z/zaboly_bill.htm |title=Comic creator: Bill Zaboly |publisher=Lambiek.net |date=June 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; successively, handled the artwork during Sims's run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by [[Bud Sagendorf]] in 1959.

Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the [[Sunday strip]] until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar's assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar's classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O.G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf's new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf's daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.

From 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by [[Bobby London]], who, after some [[controversy]], was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm Bobby London Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125142108/http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm |date=January 25, 2010 }}. comic-art.com. Retrieved on March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; London's strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar's original. One classic storyline, titled "The Return of Bluto", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by [[Hy Eisman]], who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf's strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.

On January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar's character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, [[theme music]] and other media based on him) became [[public domain]]&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/popeye-grey-owl-and-robert-service-join-the-public-domain-1.840389 CBC News, "Popeye, Grey Owl and Robert Service join the public domain," January 12, 2009]. Cbc.ca (January 12, 2009). Retrieved on March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in most countries, but remains under [[copyright]] in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company's ''Thimble Theatre'' strip, Popeye is treated as a [[work for hire]] under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929, and all U.S. copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends, Popeye will enter the public domain in the U.S. on January 1, 2025, assuming no amendments to U.S. copyright law before that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipwatchdog.com/2009/01/05/popeye-falls-into-public-domain-in-europe/id=1345/ |title=Popeye Falls into Public Domain in Europe |first=Gene |last=Quinn |publisher=''IPWatchdog.com'' |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==
[[File:Popeye-comic-book-cover.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Bud Sagendorf]]'s cover of ''Popeye'' #50 (Oct.–Dec. 1959) shows Popeye with his [[corncob pipe]], single good eye and girlfriend [[Olive Oyl]].]]

There have been a number of Popeye comic books, from [[Dell (publisher)|Dell]], [[King Comics]], [[Gold Key Comics]], [[Charlton Comics]] and others, originally written and illustrated by [[Bud Sagendorf]]. In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto's criminal activities. The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs, who were all identical.

Popeye appeared in the British "[[TV Comic]]" series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by "Chick" Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye's only nemesis throughout the entire run.

A variety of artists have created ''Popeye'' comic book stories since then; for example, [[George Wildman]] drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by [[Bill Pearson (American writer)|Bill Pearson]], with some issues written by [[Nick Cuti]].

In 1988, Ocean Comics released the ''Popeye Special'' written by [[Ron Fortier]] with art by [[Ben Dunn]]. The story presented Popeye's origin story, including his given name of "Ugly Kidd"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling|first=Mike|title=I Sorta Do and Sorta Don't Want This to Be Officially Part of Popeye's Backstory|url=http://www.progressiveruin.com/2012/09/20/i-sorta-do-and-sorta-dont-want-this-to-be-officially-part-of-popeyes-backstory/|publisher=Progressive Ruin|accessdate=December 11, 2013|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer=Fortier, Ron| penciller=Dunn,| inker=Pearson, Bill| story=Borned to the Sea| title=Popeye Special | volume=1 | issue=1| date=June 1987| publisher=Ocean Comics | page=| panel= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer=Fortier, Ron| penciller=Dunn, Ben, [[Tom Grummett|Grummett, Tom]], Kato, Gary| inker=Barras, Dell| story=Double Trouble Down Under| title=Popeye Special | volume=1 | issue=2| date=September 1988| publisher=Ocean Comics | page=| panel= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an idea also used in the comic strip on December 28, 2008 and April 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;December 28, 2008 Popeye Cartoon; retrieved July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;April 5, 2009 Popeye Cartoon; retrieved July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, to celebrate Popeye's 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, entitled ''The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl'', written by [[Peter David]]. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.

In 1989, a special series of short ''Popeye'' comic books were included in specially marked boxes of [[Instant Quaker Oatmeal]], and Popeye also appeared in three TV commercials for [[Quaker Oatmeal]],&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Popeye snubs his spinach for oatmeal |date=1990-03-28 |publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] (retrieved via Google News) |page=22 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2a5RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;pg=6860%2C7668970 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a parrot delivering the tag line "Popeye wants a Quaker!" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee'Pea to a muscle-bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal.&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal" /&gt; (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, "I'm Popeye the Quaker Man!", which offended members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] or [[Quakers]].&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal_offense"&gt;{{cite web |title=Popeye's pugnacity steams up Quakers |date=1990-04-24 |publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] (retrieved via Google News) |author=Stieg, Bill |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UdY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nW4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;pg=6674%2C6694750 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using [[violence]] to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a "Quaker man" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their [[faith]] and religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal_offense" /&gt; In addition, the submissiveness of Olive Oyl went against the Quakers' emphasis on women's rights. The Quaker Oatmeal company apologized and removed the "Popeye the Quaker man" reference from commercials and future comic book printings.&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal_offense" /&gt;

In 2012, writer [[Roger Langridge]] teamed with cartoonists [[Bruce Ozella]], Ken Wheaton, and Tom Neely (among others) to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW's 12-issue comic book miniseries, ''Popeye'', Critic PS Hayes reviewed:
:Langridge writes a story with a ''lot'' of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it’s all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye’s whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn’t really need it. You’ll swear that you’re looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it’s better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/04/25/comic-review-popeye-1/ "Review: Popeye #1", Geeks of Doom, April 25, 2012]. Geeksofdoom.com (April 25, 2012). Retrieved on March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, IDW began reprinting the original 1940s–1950s Sagendorf Popeye comic books under the title of ''Classic Popeye''.

==Theatrical animated cartoons==
{{Main|Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)}}
[[File:Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936).webm|thumb|thumbtime=24|upright=1.5|''[[Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor]]'']]
In November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with [[Fleischer Studios]] to have Popeye and the other ''Thimble Theatre'' characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and ''Popeye'' cartoons, released by [[Paramount Pictures]], would remain a staple of Paramount's release schedule for nearly 25 years. [[William "Billy" Costello|William Costello]] was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that would be replicated by later performers, such as [[Jack Mercer]] and even [[Mae Questel]]. Many of the ''Thimble Theatre'' characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl's extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood's most popular cartoon character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|title=GAC Forums – Popeye's Popularity – Article from 1935|publisher=Forums.goldenagecartoons.com|date=|accessdate=November 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711104313/http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/awm2.4pages/2.4langerpopeye.html |title=Popeye From Strip To Screen |publisher=Awn.com |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach becomes available, and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents.  Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in ''[[The Man on the Flying Trapeze (1934 cartoon)|The Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'', where it gave him acrobatic skills. (When the antagonist is the Sea Hag, it is Olive who eats the spinach; Popeye can't hit a lady.)

[[File:Bride and Gloom.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=24|upright=1.5|''[[Bride and Gloom (1954 film)|Bride and Gloom]]'']]
In May 1942, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed [[Famous Studios]]. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] soldiers, most notably the 1942 short ''[[You're a Sap, Mr. Jap]]''. In late 1943, the ''Popeye'' series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with ''Her Honor the Mare.'' Famous/Paramount continued producing the ''Popeye'' series until 1957, with ''[[Spooky Swabs]]'' being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the ''Popeye'' film catalog to [[Associated Artists Productions]], which was bought out by [[United Artists]] in 1958. Through various mergers, the rights are currently controlled by [[WarnerMedia]]'s [[Turner Entertainment]].

In 2001, [[Cartoon Network]], under the supervision of animation historian [[Jerry Beck]], created a new incarnation of ''[[The Popeye Show]]''. The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 ''Popeye'' shorts over forty-five episodes, until March 2004. ''The Popeye Show'' continued to air on Cartoon Network's spin-off network [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

While many of the Paramount ''Popeye'' cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into [[public domain]] and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television ''[[Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoons, to which it retained the rights, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from [[CBS/Fox Video]] to [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] in 1986, and eventually to [[Warner Home Video]] in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the ''Popeye'' cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the Fleischer era and the beginnings of the Famous era. On December 11, 2018, the color Famous Studios cartoons will be made available for the first time officially on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] from Warner Home Video through the [[Warner Archive Collection]] starting with ''Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s Volume 1'' containing the first 14 Technicolor shorts from 1943-1945 all restored and remastered in HD from 4K scans of the original nitrate Technicolor negatives.

==Original television cartoons==
In 1960, [[King Features Syndicate]] commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled ''[[Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'', but this time for television syndication. [[Al Brodax]] served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. [[Jack Mercer]], [[Mae Questel]], and [[Jackson Beck]] returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including [[Jack Kinney|Jack Kinney Productions]], ''[[Rembrandt Films]]'' ([[William L. Snyder]] and [[Gene Deitch]]), [[Larry Harmon|Larry Harmon Productions]], [[Halas and Batchelor]], [[Paramount Cartoon Studios]] (formerly Famous Studios), and [[Southern Star Entertainment]] (formerly [[Southern Star Productions]]). The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these ''Popeye'' cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary ''Popeye'' boxed set in 2004.

For these cartoons, Bluto's name was changed to "Brutus", as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name "Bluto". Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences – as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ian |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mpopeye.html |title=The S Dope Mailbag: Is Popeye's nemesis named Bluto or Brutus? |publisher=Straightdope.com |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.

On September 9, 1978, ''[[The All New Popeye Hour]]'' debuted on the [[CBS]] Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]], which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while [[Marilyn Schreffler]] and [[Allan Melvin]] became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively. (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to recreate Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler.) ''The All New Popeye Hour'' ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled ''The Popeye and Olive Show''. It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer's death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired ''The Popeye Valentine's Day Special – Sweethearts at Sea'' on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of ''The All New Popeye Show'', from the early-1980s to 2004.

Popeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', another [[Hanna-Barbera]] series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach but eats it to boost his strength. [[Maurice LaMarche]] performed Popeye's voice; Mercer had died in 1984. The show lasted for one season.

[[File:lemonaidswalk3.jpg|thumb|right|Popeye as he appeared in ''[[Drawn Together]]'']]

In 2004, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] produced a [[computer animation|computer-animated]] television special, ''[[Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy]]'', which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] performed the voice of Popeye, describing the production as "the hardest job I ever did, ever" and the voice of Popeye as "like a buzzsaw on your throat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckKbQeVeAI|title=The many voices of Billy West|first=|last=Penn's Sunday School|date=August 9, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye's friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment re-released ''Popeye's Voyage'' on DVD with redesigned cover art.

Popeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:
* A typical Popeye style rescue was spoofed in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Jaws Wired Shut]]".
* In ''[[The Critic]]'', Jay Sherman's father Franklin flashes back to saving his wife Popeye style with alcohol instead of spinach.
* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "The Lemon-AIDS Walk", voiced by [[Billy West]].
* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives]]", Popeye's unique behavior and speech patterns are explained as being the result of a stroke, and his massive forearm muscles are actually cancerous tumors.
* Popeye co-stars in a short from ''[[Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy]]'' giving [[Bob Dylan]] a hard time about him not singing his hit song, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]".
* Popeye appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episodes "The Sack", "Squaw Bury Shortcake" and "Yancy the Yo-Yo Boy", voiced by [[Dave Coulier]] (which he was known to perform often during his co-starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Full House]]'').
* Popeye appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' "[[Imaginationland (disambiguation)|Imaginationland]]" three-parter as one of the members of the Council of Nine. Popeye's appearance in one scene evoked that of the character Karl in the movie ''[[Sling Blade]]'', as Popeye sharpened a blade, much as Karl sharpened a [[lawnmower]] blade near the end of ''Sling Blade''.


==Web series==
On December 2, 2018, a Popeye web series produced by the WildBrain studio was premiered on its official [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gene Gustines |first1=George |title=New Popeye Videos Show What 90 Years of Spinach Can Do for a Guy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/business/media/popeye-the-sailor-cartoon.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme song==
Popeye’s theme song, titled "'''I'm Popeye The Sailor Man'''", composed by [[Sammy Lerner]] in 1933 for Fleischer’s first [[Popeye the Sailor (film)|''Popeye the Sailor'' cartoon]],&lt;ref&gt;CD liner notes: ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'', 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt; has become forever associated with the sailor. "[[The Sailor's Hornpipe]]" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye's theme song.

A cover of the theme song, performed by [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits (album)|Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]]. A jazz version, performed by Ted Kooshian's Standard Orbit Quartet, appears on their 2009 Summit Records release ''Underdog and Other Stories''.

==Other media==
The success of Popeye as a comic-strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms. For more than 20 years, Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullecirclestuff.blogspot.com/2010/07/clean-shaven-man-popeye-conversation.html "A Clean Shaven Man", July 2010]. Fullecirclestuff.blogspot.com. Retrieved on March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
''Popeye'' was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938. Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute [[radio program]], ''Popeye the Sailor'', which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye along with most of the major supporting characters—Olive Oyl (Olive Lamoy), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto ([[Jackson Beck]]) and Swee'Pea ([[Mae Questel]]). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny (Jimmy Donnelly), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the [[NBC]] [[NBC#Red and Blue Networks|Red Network]] (87 episodes), initially sponsored by [[Wheatena]], a whole-wheat [[breakfast cereal]], which would routinely replace the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin's Cartoonland Band. Announcer [[Kelvin Keech]] sang (to composer Lerner's "Popeye" theme) "Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man." Wheatena paid [[King Features Syndicate]] $1,200 per week.

The show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and [[Miriam Wolfe]] portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, "Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old-time.com/commercials/Sounds/Popeye%20&amp;%20Wheatena.wma 1930s ''Popeye the Sailor'' Wheatena audio clip].&lt;/ref&gt;

The third series was sponsored by the maker of [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicle]]s three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15&amp;nbsp;pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938.

Of the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are known to be preserved.

Popeye was recently featured on the ''Brad and John: Mornings on KISM'' "When Animals Attack" segment.

====''Popeye'' (1980)====
[[File:Malta - Mellieha - Triq tal-Prajjet - Anchor Bay+Popeye Village 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Popeye Village]]]]
{{Main|Popeye (film)}}

Director [[Robert Altman]] used the character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'', a 1980 live-action musical feature film, starring [[Robin Williams]] as Popeye (his first starring movie role), [[Shelley Duvall]] as Olive Oyl, and [[Paul L. Smith]] as Bluto, with songs by [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]]. The script was by [[Jules Feiffer]], who adapted the 1971 [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]] book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Productions]], the movie was filmed almost entirely on [[Malta]], in the village of [[Mellieħa]] on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called [[Popeye Village]]. The US box office earnings were double the film's budget, making it a success.

The [[handheld electronic game|handheld game]] featured Popeye on a boat, and the aim was to catch [[bottle]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto's boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his [[mallet]] or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end.
* The Nintendo arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was originally conceived as a ''Popeye'' video game by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. But due to licensing disagreements with King Features, this idea was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. Wii – Mario Couldn't Jump At First |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_new_super_mario_bros_wii_16795_16846.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=July 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When ''Donkey Kong'' went on to enormous success, King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a [[Popeye (video game)|''Popeye'' arcade game]] in 1982. It was later ported to the [[Commodore 64]] [[home computer]] as well as various [[video game console|home game consoles]]: [[Intellivision]], [[Atari 2600]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], and [[Odyssey2|Odyssey&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. The goal was to avoid Bluto (referred to as "Brutus") and the Sea Hag while collecting items produced by Olive Oyl such as [[heart (symbol)|hearts]], [[musical note]]s, or the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in the word "help" (depending on the level). Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus. Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee' Pea appeared in the game but did not greatly affect gameplay. A [[board game]] based on the video game was released by [[Parker Brothers]].
* A table top Game &amp; Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983, which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto.
* Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom, ''[[Popeye no Eigo Asobi]]'', in 1983. This was an educational game designed to teach Japanese children English words.
* A different ''Popeye'' game was developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Don Priestley]] and first released by [[DK'Tronics]] in 1985. The game achieved critical success due to its huge, colourful sprites; amongst the largest seen on the Spectrum platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/20/popeye.htm ''Popeye'' review] from CRASH issue 20, September 1985; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr19/yr19_41.htm ''Popeye'' review] from ''Your Spectrum'' issue 19, October 1985&lt;/ref&gt; This distinct graphical style was due to King Features' insistence that any game had to include fair representations of the central cartoon characters. The game was ported to [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986. After releasing the budget version of this game, [[Alternative Software]] developed another two licensed games, ''Popeye 2'' (1991) and ''Popeye 3: Wrestle Crazy'' (1992) on the same platforms.
* Two Popeye games published by [[Sigma Enterprises]] were spawned for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]]. The first Game Boy ''[[Popeye (Game Boy)|Popeye]]'' game, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1990, and ''[[Popeye 2]]'' in 1991. ''Popeye 2'' was also released in North America (1993) and Europe (1994) by [[Activision]].
* In 1994, [[Technos Japan]] released ''[[Popeye: Beach Volleyball]]'' for the [[Game Gear]], and ''Popeye: Volume of the Malicious Witch Seahag'' (''[[Popeye: Ijiwaru Majo Shihaggu no Maki]]'') for the Japanese [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. A side scrolling adventure game that was mixed with a board game, the game never saw US release. It featured many characters from the ''Thimble Theatre'' series as well. In the game, Popeye had to recover [[magic in fiction|magical]] hearts scattered across the level to restore his frozen friends as part of a spell cast upon them by the Sea Hag in order to get revenge on Popeye.
* [[Midway Games|Midway]] (under the ''[[Bally Technologies|Bally]]'' label) released ''[[Popeye Saves the Earth]]'', a [[SuperPin]] [[pinball]] game, in 1994.
* In 2003, Nova Productions released a strength tester called ''Popeye Strength Tester''.
* In 2005, [[Bandai Namco]] released a [[Game Boy Advance]] video game called ''[[Popeye: Rush for Spinach]]''.
* Released June 2007, the video game ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' featured [[television set|televisions]] that played full-length films and television shows that had expired copyrights. Most of the cartoons viewable on the "Toon TV" channel are Famous Studios ''Popeye'' shorts.
* In fall 2007, Namco Networks released the original Nintendo ''Popeye'' arcade game for mobile phones with new features including enhanced graphics and new levels.

===Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements===
From early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to [[razor blade]]s to spinach was available with Popeye's likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced.

;Games and toys
* [[Mezco Toyz]] makes classic-style Popeye [[action figure|figures]] in two sizes.
* KellyToys produces plush [[stuffed toy|stuffed]] Popeye characters.

;Restaurants
* [[Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen]] (aka Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits), a [[fast food restaurant]] chain, is not named after Popeye the Sailor but after the character [[Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle|"Popeye" Doyle]] from the film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), who was in turn named after real [[police detective]] [[Eddie Egan]], who was called "Pop Eye" because of his keen observational skills. The restaurant chain would later obtain a license for use of the cartoon character and advertise the name as ''Popeye's'' after Popeye the Sailor, causing some confusion as to the source of the name. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations in [[Puerto Rico]] make extensive use of Popeye the Sailor and associated characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-culture/popeyes-in-puerto-rico |title=Leading the Animation Conversation » Popeyes in Puerto Rico |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029213106/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-culture/popeyes-in-puerto-rico |archivedate=October 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Retail foods and beverages
* [[Alma, Arkansas|Allen Canning Company]] produces its own line of spinach, called "Popeye Spinach", in various canned varieties. The cartoon Popeye serves as the [[mascot]] on the can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popeyespinach.com/ |title= Popeye Spinach|publisher= Popeye Spinach |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1961, Buitoni Pasta marketed Popeye-shaped spinach [[macaroni]].
* Popeye appeared in a 1979 [[Dr Pepper]] commercial during the "Be a Pepper" campaign (possibly as a [[Popeye (film)|tie-in for the movie]], going so far as to modify his traditional [[catchphrase]] to "I'm Popeye the '''Pepper'''-man").
* Since 1989, "Popeye's Supplements" has been a chain of Canadian Sports Nutrition Stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeyescanada.com/history.html|title=Popeye's Supplements Canada ~ Over 120 Locations Across Canada! - History|work=popeyescanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1989, Popeye endorsed Instant Quaker Oatmeal, citing it as a better food than spinach to provide strength.&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal" /&gt; The commercials had the tagline "Can the spinach, I wants me Quaker Oatmeal!" The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as the Quakers) was offended by the promotion given the physical aggression from "Popeye the Quaker man" and also the excessive submissiveness of Olive Oyl.&lt;ref name="popeye_oatmeal_offense" /&gt;
* In 2001, Popeye (along with Bluto, Olive, and twin Wimpys) appeared in a television commercial for [[Minute Maid]] [[Orange juice]]. The commercial, produced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Co]], showed Popeye and Bluto as friends (and neglecting Olive Oyl) due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning. The ad agency's intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice, but some, including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute, felt the commercial's intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship—even so, it is a suggestion that Minute Maid denies. Knight was interviewed by [[Stephen Colbert]] on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' about this issue.
* World Candies Inc. produced Popeye-branded "[[candy cigarette]]s", which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate a flame. They were sold in a small box, similar to a cigarette pack. The company still produces the item, but has since changed the name to "Popeye Candy Sticks" and has ceased putting the red dye at the end.
* In 2013, McLean Design produced a packaging design using licensed characters and artwork for a Popeye branded energy drink. The drink is launching in the US with two flavors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ Punchy packaging for Popeye energy drink | Food And Beverage News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112121/http://fandbnews.com/punchy-packaging-for-popeye-energy-drink/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}.

;Sports
* Starting in 1940, Popeye became the mascot of [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] (Rio de Janeiro – Brazil), the most popular soccer team with almost 50 million fans around the world.

==Cultural origins and impact==
[[File:Frank “Rocky” Fiegel (January 27, 1868 - March 24, 1947) "Popeye" The Sailor.jpg|thumb|Frank “Rocky” Fiegel (January 27, 1868 - March 24, 1947) was said to be the real life inspiration for E. C. Segar's character "Popeye" The Sailor.]]
Local folklore in Chester, Illinois, Segar's hometown, claims that Frank “Rocky” Fiegel (b. in Poland, January 27, 1868) was the real-life inspiration for the character Popeye. He had a prominent chin, sinewy physique, characteristic pipe, and a propensity and agile skill for fist-fighting.&lt;ref name="Grandinetti_p4"&gt;Grandinetti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3XCHkn64cYkC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=frank+rocky+fiegel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m4wdTqqoDobQgAf3uNCfBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=frank%20rocky%20fiegel&amp;f=false p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/18/national/where-they-really-knew-popeye-and-co.html |title=“Where They Really Knew Popeye and Co.“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://mom.me/lifestyle/9673-real-people-behind-famous-childrens-characters/item/frank-rocky-fiegel-popeye/ |title=“The Real People Behind Famous Children’s Characters“}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiegel died on March 24, 1947 never having married. His gravestone has the image of Popeye engraved on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31875462 |title=“Frank “Rocky” Fiegel Find-a-Grave“}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Chester erected a statue of Popeye in Fiegel’s honor, which still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2657 |title=“Roadside America - Popeye Statue“}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Popeye historian Michael Brooks, Segar regularly sent money to Fiegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://popeye.org/popeye |title=“Popeye the Sailor Man Fan Site“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Ted|title=Popeye's home fussin', fightin' A Downstate town that gave birth 75 years ago to the spinach-chompin' sailor is in a Bluto-type of brawl|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-01-17/news/0401170170_1_olive-oyl-25th-festival-statue/2|accessdate=6 October 2016|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=17 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate hometown residents of Chester also are claimed to have served as inspiration for two other Segar characters including Dora Pascal, an uncommonly tall, angular lady who ran a general store in town. She even donned a hair bun close to her neckline. William “Windy Bill” Schuchert, a rather rotund man who owned the local opera house, was the seed for the character J. Wellington Wimpy. He would even send out his employees to purchase hamburgers for him between performances at a local tavern named Wiebusch’s, the same tavern that Fiegal would frequent and engage in fistfights.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://orrec.com/real-life-inspirations-for-famous-cartoon-characters |title="Real Life Inspirations For Famous Cartoon Characters"}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, businessman Greg Morena refuted the claim that Popeye originated in Chester, Illinois. Instead, he stated that [[Santa Monica, California]] was the birthplace of the character and that a Norwegian sailor by the name of Olaf “cap” Olsen served as the impetus for the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smdp.com/popeye-born-santa-monica/145324 |title="Was ‘Popeye’ born in Santa Monica?”}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research presented in Jim Harris’ 2009 “Santa Monica Pier: A Century of the Last Great Pleasure Pier” raised the idea that while living in Santa Monica, Segar based the physical attributes on Olsen; even though Harris never made a definitive claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Book |date=2009 |title=Santa Monica Pier: A Century of the Last Great Pleasure Pier|url= |location=USA |publisher=Angel City Press |page= |isbn=9781883318826 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cultural influences===
[[File:Polikarpov I-16-Mosca.jpg|thumb|Popeye on a [[Spanish Republican Air Force]] [[Polikarpov I-16]]. ''Museo del Aire'']]
Culturally,&lt;ref&gt;''Popeye: The First Fifty Years''. New York: Workman Publishing. Pages 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; many consider Popeye a precursor to the [[superhero]]es who would eventually come to dominate US [[comic book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blackbeard, Bill, "The First (arf, arf!) Superhero of Them All". In Dick Lupoff &amp; Don Thompson, ed., ''All In Color For A Dime'' Arlington House, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such has been Popeye's cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the [[biceps]] bulge [[symptom]]atic of a [[tendon]] rupture as the "Popeye muscle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980215ap/fongemie.html |title=Management of Shoulder Impingement Syndrome and Rotator Cuff Tears – February&amp;nbsp;15, 1998 – American Family Physician |publisher=Aafp.org |date=February 15, 1998 |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=3694 |title=Guideline not published |publisher=Guideline.gov |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145605/http://guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=3694 |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that under normal (non-spinach-influenced) conditions, Popeye has pronounced muscles of the ''[[forearm]]'', not of the biceps.

In 1973, [[Cary Bates]] created [[Captain Strong]], a takeoff of Popeye, for [[DC Comics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oddballcomics.com/article.php?story=archive2003-01-06 Action Comics #421]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at OddballComics.com.&lt;/ref&gt; as a way of having two cultural icons – [[Superman]] and (a proxy of) Popeye – meet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/niven/142/recycleb/rb19.html Superman and Cap'n Strong] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410214516/http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/niven/142/recycleb/rb19.html |date=April 10, 2010 }} at the Quarter Bin.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1981 [[Nintendo]] videogame [[Donkey Kong]], which introduced  [[Donkey Kong (character)|its eponymous character]] and Nintendo's unofficial company mascot [[Mario]] to the world, was originally planned to be a Popeye game.  Mario (then known as Jumpman) was originally supposed to be Popeye, Donkey Kong was originally [[Bluto]], and the character Pauline was originally [[Olive Oyl]], but when Nintendo was unable to acquire the rights to use the actual franchise characters, it decided to create original characters instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=East |first=Tom |title=Donkey Kong Was Originally A Popeye Game |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/13484/donkey-kong-was-originally-a-popeye-game/ |work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] |publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine |date=November 25, 2009 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |quote=Miyamoto says Nintendo's main monkey might not have existed. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110045437/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/13484/donkey-kong-was-originally-a-popeye-game/ |archivedate=November 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1988 Walt Disney/Touchstone Pictures film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a cameo role planned for the film. However, since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic strip, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA. MGM/UA's pre-May 1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye's cameo was dropped from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54379/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/overview |title=Who Framed Roger Rabbit – Trailer – Cast – Showtimes – NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Popeye Dance===
The Popeye was a popular dance in the [[dance craze]] era of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Originating in [[New Orleans]] around 1962, the Popeye was performed by shuffling and moving one's arms, placing one arm behind and one arm in front and alternating them, going through the motion of raising a pipe up to the mouth, and alternate sliding or pushing one foot back in the manner of ice skating, similar to motions exhibited by the cartoon character. According to music historian Robert Pruter, the Popeye was even more popular than [[Twist (dance)|The Twist]] in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Chicago Soul|author=Robert Pruter|page=196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance was associated with and/or referenced to in several songs, including [[Eddie Bo]]'s "Check Mr. Popeye," [[Chris Kenner]]'s "Something You Got" and "[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]," [[Frankie Ford]]'s "You Talk Too Much," [[Ernie K-Doe]]'s "Popeye Joe," [[Huey "Piano" Smith]]'s "Popeye," and [[Harvey Fuqua]]'s "Any Way You Wanta." A compilation of 23 Popeye dance songs was released in 1996 under the title "New Orleans Popeye Party." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/new-orleans-popeye-party-mw0000185678 |title=Various Artists - New Orleans Popeye Party |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinach===
Initially Popeye's chief superhuman characteristic was his indestructibility, rather than super strength, which was attributed to his having rubbed the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen numerous times after being shot. Popeye later attributed his strength to spinach.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Blackbeard, "The First (arf, arf) Superhero of Them All". In ''All in Color for a Dime'', ed. by Dick Lupoff and Don Thompson, Ace, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes cowls and the creation of comic book culture|author1=Glen Weldon|author2=Michael Kantor|page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Popeye helped boost [[spinach]] sales. Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work; a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Katie (August 16, 2010) [http://m.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/how-to-win-the-kid-v-veggies-battle/article4267723/?service=mobile How to win the kids v. veggies battle], ''Toronto Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The spinach-growing community of [[Crystal City, Texas]], erected a [[statue]] of the character in recognition of Popeye's positive effects on the spinach industry. There is another Popeye statue in Segar's hometown, [[Chester, Illinois]], and statues in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]] and [[Alma, Arkansas]] (which claims to be "The Spinach Capital of the World"), at canning plants of [https://web.archive.org/web/20120623200654/http://www.allencanning.com/ Allen Canning], which markets Popeye-branded canned spinach. In addition to Allen Canning's Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with ''[[E. coli]]'' was [[2006 North American E. coli outbreak|accidentally sold to the public]], many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cagle.com/news/Spinach/main.asp |title=No Eats Me Spinach! |publisher=Cagle.com |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer's choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content.

===Word coinages===
The strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word "[[wikt:goon|goon]]" (meaning a thug or lackey); goons in Popeye's world were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye's nemesis, the [[Sea Hag]]. One particular goon, the aforementioned female named Alice, was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts, but she was usually a fairly nice character.

Eugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13, 1936. Two years later the term "jeep wagons" was in use, later shortened to simply "[[jeep]]" with widespread World War II usage and then trademarked by [[Willys-Overland]] as "Jeep".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/372/ Jeep]. wordorigins.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events and honors===
The Popeye Picnic is held every year in [[Chester, Illinois]] on the weekend after [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]]. Popeye fans attend from across the globe, including a visit by a [[film crew]] from South Korea in 2004. The one-eyed sailor's hometown strives to entertain devotees of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popeyepicnic.com |title=Chester, Illinois: Official Website |publisher=Popeye Picnic |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of Popeye’s 75th anniversary, the [[Empire State Building]] illuminated its notable tower lights green the weekend of January 16–18, 2004 as a tribute to the icon’s love of spinach. This special lighting marked the only time the Empire State Building ever celebrated the anniversary/birthday of a comic strip character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingfeatures.com |title=Welcome to King Features Syndicate |publisher=Kingfeatures.com |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5722">'''RadioDNS''' is a method for a hybrid radio receiver, meaning one receiving the broadcast radio signal and connected to the Internet, to find the Internet address of the interactive service corresponding to the radio station actually tuned. 

It uses the existing [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) to allow the connected radio receiver to look up web resources based on their broadcast parameters, such as the station identifier received within the broadcast signal. Every initial DNS lookup requires inquiring the DNS server belonging to RadioDNS Ltd. Having a station listed on this DNS server costs $10 a year. At the moment (2018) the fee is waived.&lt;ref name="DNSfee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Register a Station with RadioDNS |url=https://radiodns.org/get-involved/broadcasters/register-a-station/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is an open standard, initially created by a series of broadcasters and manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiodns.org/about-radiodns/ About RadioDNS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303015545/http://radiodns.org/about-radiodns/ |date=2010-03-03 }}, radiodns.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RadioDNS was originally created as a collaborative project between [[Global Radio]] (at that time called [[GCap Media]]) and the [[BBC]], to investigate creating a mechanism for linking Broadcast Radio and IP delivered webservices.

The concept was first presented to the [[WorldDMB]] Technical Committee in Munich in May 2008. Interest in the project grew, to the extent where it was necessary to formalise the project.

The First General Meeting of RadioDNS was hosted by the European Broadcasting Union in Geneva in October 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/Jahia/site/tech/cache/offonce/news/radiodns-gets-formal-in-geneva-30oct09 EBU Technical Journal - RadioDNS Gets Formal In Geneva], tech.ebu.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second General Meeting of RadioDNS (held on 16 February 2010 in Geneva) adopted the Statutes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiodns.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/statutes_v1.pdf RadioDNS Statutes], radiodns.org&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual Rights Policy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiodns.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ipr_policy_v1.pdf RadioDNS Intellectual Property Rights Policy], radiodns.org&lt;/ref&gt; Trust Model&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiodns.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/trust_model_v1.pdf RadioDNS Trust Model], radiodns.org&lt;/ref&gt; and Membership Process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiodns.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/membership_application_process_v1.pdf RadioDNS Membership Application Process], radiodns.org&lt;/ref&gt; and thus effectively established RadioDNS as a not-for-profit organisation.

==Details==
The standard supports several radio bearers including [[FM broadcasting|VHF/FM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] and [[Amplitude modulation signalling system|AMSS]]. Using a standardised format, a [[fully qualified domain name]] (FQDN) is constructed and queried. This returns a [[CNAME record]] known as the "authoritative FQDN", which is a domain that represents the requested radio service. From this domain, [[SRV record]] lookups can be performed to verify the availability and location of various other applications that utilise RadioDNS.

For example, an FM radio service is identified by its [[Radio Data System|RDS]] parameters. To identify a radio service on &lt;tt&gt;95.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;/tt&gt; with a country code of &lt;tt&gt;E1&lt;/tt&gt; and the [[Programme identification|PI code]] &lt;tt&gt;C479&lt;/tt&gt;, the following FQDN is constructed:
 09580.c479.ce1.fm.radiodns.org
Querying this domain returns a CNAME record:
 09580.c479.ce1.fm.radiodns.org    canonical name = rdns.musicradio.com.
This CNAME record can then be used to look up SRV records that advertise the availability of applications based upon RadioDNS (in this example an application identified by the name &lt;tt&gt;radiovis&lt;/tt&gt;):
 _radiovis._tcp.rdns.musicradio.com    service = 0 100 80 vis.musicradio.com.

==Possibilities==

The linking of broadcast media with IP, as RadioDNS enables, allows additional functionality on receivers.

One example is [[RadioVIS]], which is an open standard for accompanying visuals for radio broadcasts. The Sensia, manufactured by [[Pure Digital|PURE]], is an example of a receiver with this functionality built-in. Demonstrations have also been made of RadioVIS running on a mobile phone.

Other examples being worked on by the RadioDNS project include RadioEPG, a way of obtaining additional station and programme information; and RadioTAG, a way for a listener to request more information, or simply bookmark a place, in a live broadcast.

==Alternative==

RadioText+ (RT+) in [[Radio Data System | RDS]] (FM) and DynamicLabel Plus (DL+) in DAB already provide content type ''Programme.PROGRAMME.HOMEPAGE'' (and possibly ''Info.INFO.URL'') which allows radio stations to pass along their website address to receivers without the need for an additional parallel -- and in the future potentially paid&lt;ref name="DNSfee" /&gt; -- listing on the DNS server of RadioDNS Limited.

'''''SkyDrift''''' is a 2011 airplane racing video game developed by [[Digital Reality]]. It was self-published by the developer on the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 3]] platforms. The [[Xbox 360]] version was published by [[Bandai Namco Partners]].

The game features multiple game modes which are primarily focused on combat racing. Two downloadable content packs have been released which add additional planes and two new game modes. The game was well received, with aggregate scores ranging in the mid-to-high 70% range. Critics generally felt that the gameplay was strong, that the controls were responsive, and that the online multiplayer was excellent, though multiple reviewers cited disappointment in the lack of any local multiplayer.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Skydrift gameplay.png|thumb|left|''SkyDrift'' is an airplane racing game with a heavy emphasis on combat.]]
In ''SkyDrift'' players pilot one of several [[airplane]]s in a fictional racing competition. Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as [[Plane Crazy (video game)|''Plane Crazy'']] and the flight mode of ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''. The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, [[dogfight]]s play a large part in some of ''SkyDrift''{{'}}s game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, low to the ground, or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate [[Livery|liveries]] are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche.&lt;ref name="dev diary 1"&gt;{{cite web |author=SkydriftGame |date=August 3, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZlmKXgx7M |title=SkyDrift - Official Development Diary part 1 (HD) |publisher=[[Digital Reality]] via [[YouTube]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three game modes are included with the game, with two more available via [[downloadable content]]. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities.&lt;ref name="dev diary 3"&gt;{{cite web |author=SkydriftGame |date=November 22, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2y38Ju8ryY |title=SkyDrift - Official Development Diary part 3 (HD) |publisher=Digital Reality via YouTube |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP blast]]. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank at the end of a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.&lt;ref name="dev diary 3" /&gt;

The third mode included with the game is known as Survivor. Gameplay is similar to Power Race, however after a given time the racer in last place is eliminated.&lt;ref name="dev diary 3" /&gt; Powerups are included in this mode and can be used to increase one's place, thus avoiding elimination. The race is over when all human players are eliminated or a human player is takes first place. The two downloadable modes, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, are focused solely on dogfights with other players. These modes are played in three new arenas and are limited to online gameplay.&lt;ref name="gladiator"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Gladiator-Pack/81a7d569-1cff-4c06-bb1c-1ca46222979f |title=Gladiator Pack |publisher=Xbox.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101100314/http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Gladiator-Pack/81a7d569-1cff-4c06-bb1c-1ca46222979f |archivedate=January 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and marketing==
The developers stated that they wanted to keep a certain amount of realism to the setting of their game. "It's not science fiction, it's like racing on the most beautiful places on earth" stated Senior Game Designer Peter Petrekovits.&lt;ref name="dev diary 1" /&gt; Development began with low polygon versions of the game's three settings to hone gameplay, which were later upgraded with details created from primitive shapes. Artists then took these settings and provided finalized environments while course designers laid out the specific elements to each race. Multiple routes were created in each setting allowing for several course configurations.&lt;ref name="dev diary 1" /&gt; Some of the plane designs were inspired from real-world fighter planes, but each were evolved from initial concept art into their current designs. Petrekovits elaborated on their design. "These planes are not real life models. You might see some part[s] of them [that are] familiar, but these are whole new concepts".&lt;ref name="dev diary 2"&gt;{{cite web |author=SkydriftGame |date=August 30, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZn3MxUW4U |title=SkyDrift - Official Development Diary part 2 (HD) |publisher=Digital Reality via YouTube |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrekovits further clarified that though the planes can be equipped with weaponry via powerups, they "are not military planes whatsoever, [they] are racing planes." Two members of the game's development team were graduate airplane technicians.&lt;ref name="dev diary 2" /&gt;

Two downloadable content packs have been released, both of which are actually included in the main game but require premium unlock keys to be accessed. The first, entitled ''Extreme Fighters Pack'', was released on September 21, 2011 and adds three additional planes, the Vanguard, Sparrow X1 and Triwing Vintage. The first two planes feature a design similar to modern day fighter jets, while the latter focuses on older, [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]]-style planes such as the [[triplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Extreme-Fighters-Pack/871dfa9f-3eaa-4408-bc64-b1fac233d7e7 |title=Extreme Fighters Pack |publisher=Xbox.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827065725/http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Extreme-Fighters-Pack/871dfa9f-3eaa-4408-bc64-b1fac233d7e7 |archivedate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second pack, entitled ''Gladiator Pack'' brings six new combat arenas into the game. These new levels have a focus entirely on dogfights, and have all racing aspects removed.&lt;ref name="gladiator" /&gt;

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of ''SkyDrift'' received "generally favorable reviews", while the PC version received "average" reviews, according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc pc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mc ps3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mc 360" /&gt; According to [[Gamasutra]]'s analysis ''SkyDrift'' moved over 5,100 units on the Xbox 360 and 4,700 units on the PlayStation 3 during the month of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langley |first=Ryan |date=October 25, 2011 |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/38100/InDepth_Xbox_Live_Arcade_Sales_Analysis_September_2011.php |title=In-Depth: Xbox Live Arcade Sales Analysis, September 2011 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langley |first=Ryan |date=October 26, 2011 |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/38102/InDepth_PlayStation_Network_Analysis_September_2011.php |title=In-Depth: PlayStation Network Sales Analysis, September 2011 |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox 360 version moved over 7,500 units as of year-end 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langley |first=Ryan |date=January 20, 2012 |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/39713/Xbox_Live_Arcde_by_the_numbers__the_2011_year_in_review.php |title=Xbox Live Arcade by the numbers - the 2011 year in review |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's visuals were well received by critics. [[IGN]] reviewer Stephanie Lee lauded the visuals. She stated that the graphics are "beautiful detail and [have] a warm color palette".&lt;ref name="ign review" /&gt; Robert Workman of GameZone also gave high marks for ''SkyDrift''{{'}}s graphics. He felt that the planes were well modeled and that the environments provided "a smooth looking package."&lt;ref name="gamezone review" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Sean Evans called the graphics "visually striking, with impressive levels of detail." He did cite occasional issues with locating powerups, which he attributed to "overly saturated lighting effects".&lt;ref name="gamespot review" /&gt; The game's soundtrack was a point of mediocrity among critics. IGN's Lee stated that ''SkyDrift''{{'}}s soundtrack "doesn't stand out nor does it detract from the overall experience,"&lt;ref name="ign review" /&gt; a sentiment shared with GameZone's Workman.&lt;ref name="gamezone review" /&gt;

Gameplay was also well received. ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Kristan Reed noted that the Xbox 360 version's "controls are spot-on, and it's easy to pick up". Reed, however, felt that the game can lose its luster for some players quickly due to the repeated environments used throughout the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; Terry Terrones of ''[[GamePro]]'' stated that the game was "the definition of easy to play and tough to master".&lt;ref name="gamepro review" /&gt; GameSpot's Evans noted that the game's online multiplayer was "lag free" and was the game's "shining jewel", however he expressed disappointment with the fact that it did not feature a local multiplayer.&lt;ref name="gamespot review" /&gt; IGN's Lee also praised the online multiplayer, but was disappointed in the lack of local play. She did concede, however, that during single player events "the A.I. still knows how to throw down."&lt;ref name="ign review" /&gt;

{{Literature}}
The '''sociology of literature''' is a subfield of the [[sociology of culture]]. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s 1992  ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996).

==Classical sociology==

None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[ideology]] has been directed at literature by [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Max Weber]]'s theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by [[Frankfurt School]] writers such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. [[Emile Durkheim]]'s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by [[Robert Escarpit]]. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim

==Lukács and the theory of the novel==

An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'', first published in German in 1916, in the ''Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft''. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. ''The Theory of the Novel'' argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay of the Forms of Great Epic Literature'', trans. A. Bostock, London: Merlin Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. 

Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was ''The Historical Novel'', written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.

Lukács was an important influence on [[Lucien Goldmann]]'s ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'', Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's ''The Sociology of Literature'' and [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Signs Taken for Wonders''.

==The Frankfurt School==

Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Löwenthal]]. Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'', Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' and Löwentahl's ''Literature and the Image of Man'' were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.

Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'' is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the [[commodification]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of modern life, citing [[Goethe]] and [[Baudelaire]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1991). ''Notes to Literature'', Vol. 1, trans. S.W. Nicholson, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 37-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.    

Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'' was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

==The sociology of the avant-garde==

Peter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His ''Theorie der Avantgarde'' was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.

==The sociology of the book trade==

Robert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included ''The Sociology of Literature'', published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and ''The Book Revolution'', published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by [[Lewis Coser]] in the United States and [[Peter H. Mann]] in Britain.

[[Lucien Febvre]] and Henri-Jean Martin's ''L'Apparition du livre'', first published in French 1958 and in English translation as ''The Coming of the Book'' in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the ''Annales'' School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - ''Annales'' history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).

==Genetic structuralism==

Lucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, L. (1970). ''The Human Sciences and Philosophy'', trans. H.V. White and R. Anchor, London: Jonathan Cape, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. 

Goldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. ''Le Dieu caché'', his study of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jean Racine]], was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as ''The Hidden God'' in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's ''Pensées'' and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.

In 1964 Goldmann published ''Pour une Sociologie du Roman'' translated by Alan Sheridan as ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'' in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is [[André Malraux]]. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the ''nouveau roman'' of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Nathalie Sarraute]].  

[[Andrew Milner]]'s ''John Milton and the English Revolution'' (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.

==Sociocriticism==

Goldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.

==Neo-Marxian ideology critique==

Marx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. and F. Engels (1970). ''The German Ideology'', Part 1, trans. W. Lough, C. dutt and C.P. Magill, London: Lawrence and Wishart, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). 'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Towards and Investigation' in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'', trans. B. Brewster, London: New Left Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's ''Criticism and Ideology'' was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, T. (1976). ''Criticism and Ideology'', London: New Left Books, pp. 64-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's ''The Political Unconscious'' argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, F. (1981), ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', London: Methuen, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and [[utopia]].

Macherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.

==Bourdieu==

Bourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was ''La Distinction'', published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rules of Art'' is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of [[Gustave Flaubert]] for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1996). ''The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'', trans. S. Emanuel, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's distinctive achievement in ''L'Éducation sentimentale'' was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.

==The rise of the novel==

One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paradigmatic instances are [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural materialism==

Raymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1980). ''Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays'', London: Verso, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as ''The Sociology of Culture'' and in Britain as ''Culture'', a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. 

In ''The Long Revolution'' (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'' (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1974). ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'', London: Chatto and Windus, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Country and the City'' (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1973). ''The Country and the City'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Marxism and Literature'' (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system.   

[[Alan Sinfield]]'s ''Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading'' (1992) and ''Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain'' (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's ''Literature, Culture and Society'' (2005).

==World-systems theory==

Franco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, ''Signs Taken for Wonders'' (1983) was subtitled ''Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms'' and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. 

Applying [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s [[world-systems theory]] to literature, Moretti argued, in ''Atlas of the European Novel'' (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, pp. 174, 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; London and Paris 'rule the entire continent for over a century', he concluded, publishing half or more of all European novels.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection ''Debating World Literature'' (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his ''Distant Reading'' (2013).

==Recent developments==

Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recovering Morality: Pragmatic Sociology and Literary Studies | journal = New Literary History | first1 = S. M. | last1 = Dromi | first2 = E. | last2 = Illouz | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–369| id = | accessdate = 2011-03-09 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/v041/41.2.dromi.html | doi=10.1353/nlh.2010.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing a clearer understanding of how literature is and is not like other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent Moves in the Sociology of Literature | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | last = Griswold | first = W. | volume = 19 | pages = 455–467| id = | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.19.080193.002323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The World Republic of Letters |last1= Casanova |first1= Pascale |year= 2004 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/toc/nlh.41.2.html New Literary History] devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.

'''Tankred Dorst''' (19 December 1925 – 1 June 2017) was a [[Germany|German]] [[playwright]] and [[storytelling|storyteller]].&lt;ref name="Sheppard1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=Richard|title=Tankred Dorst's Toller: a case-study in reception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_85bAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=1989-03-01|publisher=Lochee Publications|isbn=978-0-947584-93-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sebald1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebald|first=Winfried Georg|title=A Radical stage: theatre in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvVbAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=1988|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85496-038-5|pages=64–|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorst lived and worked in [[Munich]]. His farces, parables, one-act-plays and adaptations were inspired by the theatre of the absurd and the works of [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]], [[Jean Giraudoux|Giraudoux]] and [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]. His monumental drama ''Merlin oder das wüste Land'', which was premiered in 1981 in [[Düsseldorf]], has been compared to [[Goethe]]'s ''Faust''. Some critics see it as the first major drama of the 1980s. In his tribute to Tankred Dorst on the occasion of the conferment of the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1990, [[Georg Hensel]] remarked that Dorst's plays all have a direct connection to the present: "For 30 years Dorst's plays have responded to the great transformations. He has always been a companion to the times."

Dorst first directed the ''[[Ring of the Nibelung]]'' in [[Bayreuth]] in 2006.

==Biography==
Tankred Dorst was born in [[Oberlind]] near [[Sonneberg]], [[Thuringia]].&lt;ref name="ZeitObit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zeit.de/kultur/literatur/2017-06/schriftsteller-tankred-dorst-ist-tot |title=Tankred Dorst ist tot |publisher=Die Zeit |date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscripted into the German army as a pupil at the age of 17, he was soon captured and incarcerated as a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name="ZeitObit"/&gt; Until 1947 he remained in British and American hands. By the time he was released from war captivity, his birthplace had become part of the Soviet sector of Germany. He met his family in West Germany and completed his schooling. In 1950 he began studying German literature, art history and theatre in [[Bamberg]] and Munich. Together with composer [[Wilhelm Killmayer]] he founded the [[marionette theatre]] ''Das kleine Spiel'', for which he wrote his first plays. After breaking off his studies, he worked in various capacities in film, radio and publishing houses.

His first major plays were performed in 1960 in [[Lübeck]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Heidelberg]]. Since then, his plays have been performed in the whole world. Dorst's work has been recognized with many prizes and distinctions, including the [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] Prize (1964), Prize of the City of [[Florence]] (1970), Literature Prize of the Bayerische Akademie der Künste (1983), [[Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis]] (1989), [[Georg Büchner]] Prize (1990), [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] Prize (1996) and the city of [[Zurich]]'s [[Max Frisch]] Prize (1998). In 2006, he was awarded the [[Samuel Bogumil Linde]] Prize. He was awarded the [[European Prize for Literature]] (2008). Dorst held visiting professorships at universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

Dorst died on June 1, 2017.

'''Tek Jansen''' is a [[fictional character]] featured on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and in a comic book series published by [[Oni Press]]. Jansen originated as a recurring joke in the form of a supposed self-published science fiction novel on the ''Report'', reportedly as a parody of [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s 1998 novel, ''[[Those Who Trespass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Annie (July 26, 2006). [http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/07/26/stephen-colberts-comic-book-adventures/ Stephen Colbert's comic book adventures]. ''TV Squad''. Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The character later appeared on the show in a series of animated shorts entitled ''Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure'', with Jansen voiced by [[Stephen Colbert]], and in 2007 became the protagonist of a five-part comic series.

An agent for the elite Alpha Squad 7, Jansen is portrayed as heroic, powerful and irresistible to women: essentially, he is an idealized version of the ''Report'''s [[Stephen Colbert (character)|host]], who supposedly created him.

==Appearances==

===Novel===
Jansen was introduced on ''The Colbert Report'' on the October 26, 2005 episode as the protagonist of Stephen Colbert's fictitious self-published 1,800-page novel, ''Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: Lady Nocturne: A Tek Jansen Adventure''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]''. [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=676 Episode 1007].  October 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel became a recurring joke, with Colbert occasionally discussing the manuscript and reading passages while lamenting that no publisher has distributed the book yet.  Although a copy of the novel was seen on the show and at the Stephen Colbert Museum and Gift Shop in [[Tuscumbia, Alabama|Tuscumbia]], [[Colbert County, Alabama]], the former copy is actually "The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia Of Rock &amp; Roll" with a new cover glued over the original, and the latter copy was merely blank pages. A number of chapters were made available on the show's official website, [http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/tekjansen.php ColbertNation.com]. In the show's April 3, 2008 episode, Colbert claimed that a total of twenty publishers had turned down the novel.

===Animated series===
[[Image:Tek Jansen Book.jpg|thumb|right|''Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: Lady Nocturne: A Tek Jansen Adventure''.]]
On August 8, 2006, the ''Report'' debuted a series of three to four-minute-long [[Animated cartoon|animated shorts]] entitled ''Stephen Colbert Presents: Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: The New Tek Jansen Adventures'', allegedly in response to a lack of publisher interest in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Colbert Report''. [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=676 Episode 2012].  August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen is voiced by Colbert himself.

====Season one====
The first six episodes were designed, animated, and produced by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions and producer Samantha Scharff.&lt;ref name="Animation"&gt;Bynum, Aaron (October 1, 2007). [http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1506 FlickerLab Works on "Tek Jansen" Animation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224185811/http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1506 |date=December 24, 2007 }}. ''Animation Insider''. Retrieved on October 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  They tend to be formulaic in nature, regularly working in Jansen's signature exclamations (such as "Solar Plexus!" and "Parum-pum!") and reference to his having had "hundreds of [[girlfriend]]s".  Jansen typically both saves the day and seduces every woman in the story, villains included, and the episode invariably ends on a [[cliffhanger]] with a naked Jansen in mortal danger.

The entire first season was included in a bonus disc accompanying copies of ''[[The Best of The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=2599 A word on the "Best of The Colbert Report" bonus disc]. ''No Fact Zone''.  Retrieved on December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season two====
On September 12, 2007, the ''Report'' debuted the first of a projected eight new Tek Jansen episodes.  This second series, which was being produced by FlickerLab, covers the early history of Jansen, from his humble beginnings as a young, physically awkward space dog vendor.&lt;ref name="Animation" /&gt;  Unlike Series One, which has little to no continuity between episodes, Series Two followed a continuous narrative.  Though projected as an eight-part series, no new episodes were completed after episode 3 debuted in January, 2009.

====Cameos====
Tek Jansen made a brief cameo appearance in Colbert's [[music video]] of [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]", aired on August 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert: Get Lucky Dance Party (Video)|url=http://dailypicksandflicks.com/2013/08/07/stephen-colbert-get-lucky-dance-party-video/|work=Daily Picks and Flicks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Colbert, the video was produced in anticipation of Daft Punk's appearance on that evening's show; however, the band was forced to cancel at the last minute due to a conflict with the [[MTV]] [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Awards]].  [[Robin Thicke]] performed instead, but Colbert aired the video as originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arellano|first=Jennifer|title=Best of 2013 (Behind the Scenes): Stephen Colbert on how he got 'lucky' with his celeb-studded Daft Punk dance video|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/03/stephen-colbert-daft-punk-get-lucky-video/|accessdate=9 December 2013|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tek Jansen made a final cameo appearance on [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|the very last episode]] of ''The Colbert Report'' on December 18, 2014, as part of a montage of a number of celebrities singing "[[We'll Meet Again]]". Jansen sings it in a stilted way reminiscent of [[William Shatner]]'s famous 1977 [[spoken word]] performance of "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]".

On June 24, 2006, [[Comedy Central]] announced that [[Oni Press]] would publish a five-part comic book adaptation of the Tek Jansen novel as ''Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen Adventures'', a multi-part series of comics.&lt;ref&gt;Comedy Central Insider, [http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/cc_insider/2006/07/hey_kids_colber.html "Hey Kids, Colbert Comics!"] July 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oni Press Buzz, [http://www.onipress.com/buzz/?p=96/ "Oni to publish Stephen Colbert's TEK JANSEN &amp; ALPHA SQUAD 7 comics!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129193732/http://www.onipress.com/buzz/?p=96%2F |date=November 29, 2006 }}, August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was published on July 11, 2007. The second had been scheduled for a December 26, 2007 release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onipress.com/display.php?type=bk&amp;id=301 OniPress.com: Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen, issue 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004223305/http://www.onipress.com/display.php?type=bk&amp;id=301 |date=October 4, 2007 }}.  Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=2921 More “Tek Jansen” comic news, and EXCLUSIVE sneak pics!]. ''No Fact Zone.'' Retrieved on January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally released on July 2, 2008. Issue 3 was released on August 3, 2008. Issues 4 and 5 were released in 2009. On August 12, 2009, the five issues were collected into a 136-page graphic novel.

Each comic has two stories, the first one—written by [[John Layman]] and [[Tom Peyer]], with art by [[Scott Chantler]]—part of an ongoing serialized story, and the second one—written by [[Jim Massey]] with art by [[Robbi Rodriguez]]—a stand-alone "backup story".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onipress.com/display.php?type=se&amp;id=29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707051241/http://www.onipress.com/display.php?type=se&amp;id=29 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 7, 2007 |title=Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen Adventures (Series) |accessdate=September 24, 2007 |publisher=[[Oni Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert and his staff were very involved in guiding the style of both the writing and the artwork. Artist Scott Chantler recalls that it was assumed the comics would follow the "animated" look of the cartoons, however Colbert wanted a more serious dramatic tone "that played it as straight as he does on the show", and the artwork was toned down to suit this theme.  Chantler describes the style as similar to that of a space adventure comic from the early 1960s: "heroic and dramatic, but still appealing and fun, and funny in spite of itself. The theory I'm going on is that this is a cool old comic of which the animated segments are silly Saturday morning versions (even though the reverse is actually true)".&lt;ref&gt;Chantler, Scott (April 3, 2007). [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1260 EXCLUSIVE! Interview with Scott Chantler (Illustrator, “Tek Jansen” miniseries), Part 2]. ''No Fact Zone''. Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers John Layman and Tom Peyer also recall having to tone down Jansen's character, whom they initially wrote as "Stephen Colbert in space", with "a robot eagle sidekick and he was going after alien bears". Of Colbert's contributions, Jim Massey says the most influential was his desire that the comics not contain any reference to present-day Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bierly, Mandi. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043846,00.html First Look: 'Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen']. ''[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]]''. Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of several of the Tek Jansen comic issues are briefly shown in the September 17, 2014 episode of ''The Colbert Report'' during the segment depicting Colbert's "Prince Hawkcat" character at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].

==Fictional biography==
In his youth, Tek Jansen was a shy and physically awkward space-dog vendor who worked at sport and political venues and had never even had a single girlfriend. However, after inadvertently learning of his future nemesis Thurmond Chang's sinister plans to take over the universe and witnessing the murder of the Alpha Squad agent sent to stop him, Jansen found himself unexpectedly plunged into a new adventure.  In his dying moments, the Alpha Squad agent handed Tek his nano fiche with instructions to deliver it to Alpha Squad headquarters, thus setting him on a new path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Beginning's First Dawn: A Tek Jansen Adventure | series = Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure | airdate = September 12, 2007 | season = 2 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From these humble beginnings, Jansen has become an elite agent who has had hundreds of girlfriends.  He has wrestled with numerous villains, and continues to face off against Thurmond Chang and "those affiliated with the Thurmond Chang Gang".  He also appears at one point to have had a [[sidekick]], Porpy the Porpoise a "zany" space [[porpoise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Operation: Heart of The Phoenix - Dead or Alive: A Tek Jansen Adventure | series = Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure | airdate = August 8, 2006 | season = 1 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[sidekick]], Porpy the Porpoise, is described as a "''zany''" space [[porpoise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Operation: Heart of The Phoenix - Dead or Alive: A Tek Jansen Adventure | series = Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure | airdate = 2006-08-08 | season = 1 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his appearances on the television series have petered out somewhat, his involvement in the graphic novel is ongoing and is included in almost all of the comics. Porpy was prominently featured in "Porpy's story", a short [[side-story]] in which Porpy's background is alluded to by Tek, but not told fully, as Tek becomes distracted by an adventure and forgets about Porpy altogether. In the television show Porpy is voiced by stock porpoise sounds and bubbles.

==Characteristics==
Described by some reviewers as a "[[Mary Sue]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33366#6 Review: Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen #1 (of 5)]. ''Ain't It Cool News''.  Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen is essentially an idealized version of Colbert's character.  The cover of the fictitious novel depicts Colbert (wearing a space suit) as Jansen, and Colbert also provides the character's voice in the animated series.  The animated series frequently mentions the fact that Jansen has "obviously had hundreds of girlfriends", and he invariably seduces and beds every woman he encounters, including his enemies.  The theme song, which debuted on November 8, 2006, describes Jansen as a "super awesome spectacular ultra-spy", and further notes that his "exciting exploits would sell millions of books".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]''. [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=676 Episode 2141].  November 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantler says he attempts to draw Jansen "as if he were the most confident man in the universe" and that "this is a character who's convinced he's right about everything".  Although his behavior is regularly a source of comedy, Jansen has no sense of humor about himself and is rarely seen to smile in either the animated series or the comics.&lt;ref&gt;Chantler, Scott (April 5, 2007). [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1261 EXCLUSIVE! Interview with Scott Chantler (Illustrator, “Tek Jansen” miniseries), Part 3]. ''No Fact Zone''. Retrieved on December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception in the animated series was a two-second laugh with a pair of Jansen's subordinates in the second episode of the first series, with a comically abrupt ending.

The '''Bear''' is a fictional character who originated in the British adult sketch comedy, [[Bo' Selecta!]]. He is a rude teddy bear who is a social outcast and engages in cursing and womanizing. He like berries and always wears black glasses. He had a sidekick, a squirrel named Steven, whom he had a love-hate relationship with. 

The character was popular enough to receive his own show, ''[[A Bear's Tail]]'', derived from the Christmas pilot. Since the end of ''A Bear's Tail'', the Bear has featured in [[Bo' Selecta!#Series four|Bo' in the USA]]. He is played by [[Leigh Francis]].

==Personality==
The Bear often flirts with women, who guest-star on the show. In an episode of ''Bo' Selecta!'', it was revealed that he used to have a problem, which caused him to shout out bad words at anyone. He has, however, broke the habit by thinking of women to take his mind off of it. After fantasizing about women, his [[Penis|tail]] will [[Erection|pop out]]. He gets it to "go away" by saying, "[[Christine Hamilton]].", three times, as seen in an episode, in which Christine Hamilton, herself guest starred in. However, when Christine guest-starred in an episode, the Bear had to say it in his mind.

==Friends and Family==
The Bear often speaks about his parents, who left him behind and went to [[Alaska]]. They did appear in an episode of [[A Bear's Tail]] and wanted him back. They soon saw how well he was getting on in his new home and let him stay. The only other relative is his uncle, who is a dancing bear. The Bear stated that he was chained up by his nose and once tried to escape and ripped half his nose off and had to have it stitched up.

The Bear's only seen friend was a red squirrel named Steven. Steven would communicate via squeaks and would usually say something rude, to which he would be told off by the Bear.

==Bedtime with the Bear==
For the first series of ''Bo' Selecta!'', the Bear had a talk show in his treehouse on [[Hampstead Heath]] called ''Bedtime with the Bear'', which featured women, who he would ask rude questions to. The format changed slightly for series 2, which featured him still hosting a talk show, but with one difference: A bedtime story. Bedtime stories feature the Bear, spotting something rude, that the guests are doing to the guest's surprise. This usually gives him an erection.

As of series 3 of ''Bo' Selecta!'', the Bear had his own part on Avid Merrion's talk show. He would speak to guests as usual in the same dirty manner, except it featured him on an actual talk show set.
He has interviewed the likes of [[Kerry Katona]], [[Jennifer Ellison]], [[Liberty X]], [[Edith Bowman]], [[Christine Hamilton]], [[Vernon Kay]], [[Jonathan Ross]], Catalina Guirado, [[Tess Daley]], and [[Melanie Blatt]] in Bedtime With The Bear.

==A Bear's Tail==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: 
A bears tail is on the end of its arse [[Image:beartail.jpg|thumb|right|The DVD cover of [[A Bear's Tail]]. ]] --&gt;
In his own spin-off series, the Bear was adopted by the Hennersons after they ran him over in their car at Christmas. The mother of the family was played by [[Patsy Kensit]], who adored the Bear. The father though, who was played by [[Sean Pertwee]], hated the Bear after he thought that the Bear was stealing his wife. There was also a stroppy teenage daughter, [[Lillian Hennerson]], who would argue with the Bear.

The series only lasted for one year, as Leigh Francis decided to bring back ''Bo' Selecta!'', but in America.

==Bo' in the United States==
Leigh Francis brought ''Bo' Selecta!'' back as "''Bo'''" in the United States of America, in which it featured the whole series in America, instead of Britain. The Bear (and many other celebrities) are staying at the Merrion Hotel. The Bear is currently friends with [[Verne Troyer]], who played Mini-Me in [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]. Verne wants to revamp the Bear's show, because he thought that [[A Bear's Tail]] was rubbish, along with many other characters.

==Keith Lemon - Coming In America==
The Bear made his television comeback in the 2018 ITV2 series ''Keith Lemon - Coming In America''. He appears in the third episode where he meets the Urban Fox, who like the Bear, had moved to America. In the same episode, it is revealed by the Bear that Steven got attacked by four grey squirrel and had his back legs chewed off. As he was in pain, the Bear put him out of his misery.

==Whatever I Want==
The Bear was previously portrayed before ''Bo Selecta!'', on a short lived programme entitled "''Whatever I Want''", shown on ''London Weekend Television''. He, however, was not a bear, but a man named Barry Gibson. The character is almost exactly the same, except he is in human form. There is an episode of this programme available to view on [[YouTube]].

'''''Youm7''''' ({{lang-ar|اليوم السابع}}&lt;!--ى as written in Egypt--&gt;, {{IPA-arz|iljoːm issaːbiʕ|IPA}}, meaning ''The Seventh Day'') is an Egyptian privately owned [[daily newspaper]].

== History ==

===Founding and profile===
''Youm7'' was first published as a weekly paper in October 2008 and has been published daily since 31 May 2011.&lt;ref name="youm7"/&gt; Editor Khaled Salah said shortly after the paper's expansion to daily publication that ''Youm7'' "supports the popular need for a civil state and will strive to present facts to readers without political bias and with credible representation of diverse views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ahmed Ziada|url=http://www.mediainegypt.com/2011/05/youm7-newspaper-is-today-daily.html|title=youm7 newspaper is today a daily newspaper May 31st, and expansion after the English and the radio and TV version|work=Media in Egypt|date=30 May 2011|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to internet information service [[Alexa Internet]], 59% of visitors to ''Youm7's'' website come from Egypt, and compared to internet users overall they are disproportionately higher-income college graduates and women browsing from home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youm7.com|title=Statistics Summary for youm7.com|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the paper's online version was the sixth most-visited website in Egypt based on the Alexa data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Omar Halawa|title=Indebted and overstaffed, how can state-owned papers survive?|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/indebted-and-overstaffed-how-can-state-owned-papers-survive|accessdate=6 October 2014|work=Egypt Independent|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the paper launched a new website, ''Photo7'' , which is a portal for pictures in Egypt and the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Situation in Egypt: Tenth report for the period January and February 2014|url=http://asahnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MM-11-En-1.pdf|publisher=Al Sawt Al Hurr|accessdate=6 October 2014|format=Report|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cairo Post===
On 6 October 2013 ''Youm7'' launched an English-language website called ''The Cairo Post,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecairopost.com|title=Cairo Post|work=Cairo Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Sallie Pisch, who also directed the organization's short-lived 'Youm7 English Edition' in 2011 (see below).

In an article published on the day the website launched, Pisch wrote that the goal for The Cairo Post was for it "to become the news outlet to most faithfully portray Egypt, in all her intricacies, to all those who watch her and want to understand."&lt;ref&gt;http://thecairopost.youm7.com/news/13322/op/our-dream-for-the-cairo-post&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2013, the website was publishing roughly 200 stories daily,{{weasel-inline|date=April 2016}} a combination of original content, articles translated from Youm7's Arabic news website, and wire services.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

===''Youm7'' English Edition===
On 8 August 2011, managing director Sallie Pisch announced the launch of ''Youm7 English Edition'', stating that the English-language paper aimed to fill the gap in "quality, understandable news coverage coming out of Egypt in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sallie Pisch|url=http://www.masress.com/en/youm7en/339729|title=Welcome to Youm7 English Edition|work=Masress|date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Youm7 English Edition'' also managed an Egypt [[Wiki]] that "aims to provide background info on Egyptian politicians, public figures and organizations in one location."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://islamopediaonline.org/websites-institutions/youm7|title=Youm7|work=[[Islamopedia Online]]|date=|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2 May 2012, the Youm7 English Edition appears to no longer be functioning, as the link to the English Edition homepage redirects to the ''Youm7'' Arabic site. On 13 December 2012, the English Edition Twitter profile tweeted "Dear followers, we are currently having a problem with our website. We hope to get it figured out and back online soon!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Youm7_EE/status/146766311811330048|title=Twitter|work=twitter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2 May  2012, the Youm7 English Edition Twitter profile's last tweet was published on 21 December 2012.

===Political Coverage===
The paper's politicized coverage since the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] has led to calls for its boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/Notoyoum7|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121129231215/http://www.facebook.com/Notoyoum7|archive-date=2012-11-29|title=Facebook|work=facebook.com|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online activists in Egypt also accused the paper of fabricating news and spreading misinformation, and at one point urged [[Twitter]] users to unfollow any profiles associated with the paper. The paper's English-language website was also hacked in July 2011, taking it offline.&lt;ref name="Bikya Masr"/&gt; In May, 2012, ''Youm7'' was again accused of fabricating the news after publishing a report alleging that the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] had organized medical convoys to provide free [[female genital mutilation]] operations to girls. The Ministry of Health immediately announced an investigation, however no other media outlet was able to confirm the allegations. The Freedom and Justice Party denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2012/05/regarding-brotherhood-and-fgm.html|title=Regarding the brotherhood and #FGM|work=Egyptian Chronicles|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
