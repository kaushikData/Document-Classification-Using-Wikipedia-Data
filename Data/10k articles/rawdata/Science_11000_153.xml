The '''International Academy of Sport Science and Technology''' (French: ''Académie internationale des sciences et techniques du sport'', '''AISTS''') is a non-profit foundation based in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]], the Olympic Capital. Each year the AISTS delivers over 900 hours of continuing education, workshops, seminars and projects to the sports industry. The AISTS is committed to professionalising sports management through continuing education, applied research and an engaging platform for industry connections and is ranked the number 1 sports management programme in the world (Eduniversal 2015/16).

==About AISTS==
The International Academy of Sports Science and Technology is focused on [[sport management]] worldwide by offering sports management programs through sports management graduate programs, continuing professional education, and applied research in sport.

The AISTS mission is to apply knowledge to the study of sports, incorporating the disciplines of [[management]], [[economics]], [[technology]], [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[law]], [[logistics]], [[sociology]], and [[ethics]]. The AISTS supports sport innovation, [[technology transfer]] and [[business development]].

The academy’s activities are built upon three pillars:
* [[Postgraduate education]]
* [[Continuing education]]
* [[Research]]

The main service offered by the academy is its Master of Advanced Studies in Sport Administration and Technology (MAS); a 15 month postgraduate master’s programme training sport executives.

In addition, continuing education seminars for sports management worldwide are organized under the lead of the academy including the “Sport Event Management and Organisation Seminar” (SEMOS), and the “Sustainable Sport and Events Open Module” (SSE).  In addition the AISTS offers Risk Management Conferences on various topics including Security Risks at Sport Events and Sport Concussion for International Sport Governing Bodies.

The AISTS is incorporated as a foundation (Art 80ss, Swiss law), which forms a network of the following founding members:
* [[International Olympic Committee]]
* [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD)
* [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)]]
* [[University of Lausanne]]
* [[University of Geneva]]
* [[École hôtelière de Lausanne|Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne]] (EHL)
* Canton of Vaud

==History==
AISTS was founded in 2000 by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne]] (EPFL), the [[International Institute for Management Development]], the [[University of Lausanne]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration|Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration (IDHEAP)]], the [[École hôtelière de Lausanne]] (EHL), the City of [[Lausanne]] and the [[Canton of Vaud]].

== Sports management programmes ==
AISTS has the support of the International Olympic Committee for sports management worldwide, and has strong links to the worldwide Olympic Movement.

===Sports management applied research===
AISTS delivers knowledge from [[human sciences]], [[life sciences]] and [[engineering]] [[sciences]]. AISTS acts as an advisor and manager to sporting and non-sporting organizations such as the International Olympic Committee, international sports federations (Ski, Volleyball, Basketball, etc.), and national sports federations.

===Sports management educational programmes===
AISTS provides sports management graduate programs by the Master of Advanced Studies in Sport Administration and Technology (MAS)

====Master of Advanced Studies in Sport Administration and Technology (MAS) ====
The AISTS MAS (Master of Advanced Studies) in Sports Administration and Technology is a sports management graduate program in sports management.  Training is offered in Sports Management &amp; Economics, Technology, Law, Sociology, and sports Medicine.  A multidisciplinary master's degree co-signed by the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne]], the University of Geneva and the [[University of Lausanne]]. Every year, it attracts graduate students and professionals from all continents (85% of the students are not Swiss). '''MAS - [http://aists.org Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration and Technology]'''

===Sports management program seminars===

====Sustainable Sport and Event Open Module ====
Over two days, the Sustainable Sport &amp; Events Learning Module provides an understanding of the current challenges and opportunities of sustainability in sport. This understanding will be reinforced through a number of case studies, which offer concrete examples of what leading sports organisations, such as FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Automobile Federation are achieving in this area. Participants will also gain insight into the best practices adopted by the American major leagues such as the NFL, NBA and MLB. Throughout both days, group work and discussions will challenge the existing ideas of sustainability in sport, with a particular focus on the business case for sustainability while simultaneously addressing the demands of multiple stakeholders.

====SEMOS (Sport Event Management and Organisation Seminar)====
The AISTS SEMOS module offers an overview of the key tasks that sports managers need to successfully plan, communicate and operate when organising sport events, providing a 360° view and behind the scenes look at the mechanics of sport events.  Bringing together leaders of International Sport Federations and other experts of the AISTS network, including the International Olympic Committee and sport event organisers, AISTS SEMOS is both pertinent and practical, and recognises the increased expectations of spectators, media and sponsors at major events.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AOS-prinzip.png|thumb|240px|principle of an Acousto Optical Spectrometer]] --&gt;
An '''acousto-optical spectrometer''' (AOS) is based on the [[Ultrasonic grating|diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves]]. A [[piezoelectric]] [[transducer]], driven by the [[RF signal]] (from the [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]), generates an [[Acoustics|acoustic]] wave in a [[crystal]] (the so-called [[Acousto-optic modulator|Bragg-cell]]). This acoustic wave modulates the [[refractive index]] and induces a [[phase (waves)|phase]] [[grating]]. The Bragg-cell is illuminated by a collimated [[laser]] beam. The angular dispersion of the diffracted light represents a true image of the IF-[[spectrum]] according to the [[amplitude]] and [[wavelengths]] of the acoustic waves in the crystal. The spectrum is detected by using a single linear [[diode]] array ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]), which is placed in the [[focal plane]] of an imaging optics. Depending on the crystal and the focal length of the imaging optics, the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of this type of spectrometer can be varied.

Hardy was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father had a small advertising agency and her mother, Ruth H. Ewing, was a high school math teacher and homemaker. Hardy was the eldest of five children in a conservative [[History of Methodism in the United States|Methodist]] family. She grew up in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=ComputerHistoryMuseum-OralHistory-2016 /&gt;

In 1951, Hardy graduated from [[Evanston Township High School]].&lt;ref name=ETHS-Class-of-1951&gt;{{cite web|title=Reunion Roundup: Class of 1951 in San Diego|url=https://www.eths.k12.il.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=1026&amp;dataid=2483&amp;FileName=The%20KIT%20fall%202013.pdf|website=The KIT|publisher=[[Evanston Township High School]] (ETHS) Alumni Association|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Hardy graduated from [[Pomona College]] with a degree in [[physical education]]. She chose physical education because it was the only degree program which allowed her to take math and science courses after her desire to major in chemistry was stymied by the chemistry department head who was opposed to having women in the lab. Following her graduation, she took chemistry classes at [[Columbia University]], but ultimately decided that a career in physical therapy had little appeal. On the advice of a friend working for [[IBM]], she took the company's Programmer Aptitude Test when searching for a job.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardy|first1=Ann|last2=Abbate|first2=Janet|title=Oral-History: Ann Hardy – Interview #599|url=http://ethw.org/Oral-History:Ann_Hardy|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] History Center|format=Includes transcript|date=15 July 2002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1956, Hardy entered the programming field after taking IBM's Programmer Aptitude Test. Her official title was System Service Girl, which is equivalent to the position of a current day system engineer. Hardy then switched to programming and worked in IBM Research, which was in [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]], and then in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. She worked at IBM for five years.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002 /&gt;

A job on the [[IBM 7030 Stretch|STRETCH]] supercomputer project led to an offer to work at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=MakingITWork-2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yost|first1=Jeffrey R.|title=Making IT Work: A History of the Computer Services Industry|date=2017|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03672-6|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/making-it-work-a-history-of-the-computer-services-industry/oclc/978286108/viewport|oclc=978286108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy was one of a team of five who worked on the Livermore STRETCH's [[Fortran]] compiler from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref name=ComputerHistory-NormHardy-Interview-1994&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardy|first1=Norman|last2=Michael|first2=George|title=An Interview with Norman Hardy|url=http://www.computer-history.info/Page1.dir/pages/Hardy.html|website=Computer-History.info|date=23 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1966, after her husband got a job at IBM in the Bay Area, Hardy got a job at [[Tymshare]], a newly formed time-sharing company in [[Los Altos, California]]. She worked for Tymshare from 1966 to 1985.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002 /&gt;

Hardy worked on some of the first time-sharing systems and computer networks, used by a variety of corporations and government agencies. In 1968 she, with her husband Norm Hardy and LaRoy Tymes, first used minicomputers to log onto mainframe computers.&lt;ref name=FreeForAll-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Elliot|last2=Jarvis|first2=Jeff (foreword by)|title=Free for All: The Internet's Transformation of Journalism|date=2010|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, IL|isbn=978-0-810-12328-1|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/free-for-all-the-internets-transformation-of-journalism/oclc/933291566/viewport|page=77|oclc=933291566}}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually rose to vice-president, the first woman in that role.&lt;ref name=SoftwareHistory-Leadership-Bio-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership – Software History: Software Industry SIG. Ann Hardy, Co-chair|url=http://www.softwarehistory.org/leadership/|website=SoftwareHistory.org|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hardy was solely responsible for the writing the code for Tymshare's time-sharing product, many of her male colleagues assumed her husband had written the OS. It wasn't until she was in the hospital giving birth to her first child, and her coworkers encountered problems that they did not know how to fix, that they began to defer to her as the expert on the system she had written.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum-Tymshare-Tymnet-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brock|first1=David C.|title=Someone Else's Computer: The Prehistory of Cloud Computing|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/someone-elses-computer-the-prehistory-of-cloud-computing|date=31 August 2017|work=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tymshare was acquired by [[McDonnell Douglas]] in 1984,&lt;ref name=SoftwareHistory-Leadership-Bio-2015 /&gt; she left to found [[KeyLogic]], which sold the timesharing hardware and software developed at Tymshare, under a licensing arrangement, until changing market conditions forced its closure in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002 /&gt; She subsequently co-founded Agorics, which focuses on web-based marketplace applications.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cap-lore.com/Agorics/About/corpbio.html|title=Meet Agorics' Staff|website=www.cap-lore.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy's experiences are representative of the state of gendered labor in the field of computing during the mid to late 20th century: despite having technical skills and proving their value as workers, women in computing were continually undervalued as the field rose in power and importance. While at IBM, at one point Hardy learned that she was being paid less than one-half of the salary lowest ranked man who reported to her.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum-Tymshare-Tymnet-2017 /&gt; As historians like Nathan Ensmenger,&lt;ref name=ComputerBoysTakeOver-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ensmenger|first1=Nathan|title=The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of Technical Expertise|date=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-28935-1|url=https://wdn.ipublishcentral.com/mit/viewinsidehtml/275811057867127|oclc=763135270}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Abbate]],&lt;ref name=RecodingGender-2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-30546-4|url=https://wdn.ipublishcentral.com/mit/viewinsidehtml/4120646743409|oclc=929618639}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marie Hicks&lt;ref name=ProgrammedInequality-2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Marie|title=Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03554-5|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/programmed-inequality-how-britain-discarded-women-technologists-and-lost-its-edge-in-computing/oclc/954037938/viewport|oclc=954037938}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown, women programmers were denied credit for their work and historically submerged, leading to an inaccurate view of men's and women's roles in the field.

In 2004, Hardy retired. She currently serves as co-chair of the Software Industry Special Interest Group at the [[Computer History Museum]].&lt;ref name=SoftwareHistory-Leadership-Bio-2015 /&gt;

==Personal life==
Hardy married, and later divorced, Norman Hardy, also an alumnus of IBM and Tymshare. She has two daughters, born in 1968 and 1970; one became an environmentalist and the other a costume designer.&lt;ref name=IEEE-OralHistory-2002 /&gt;

'''Araroba powder''' is a drug occurring in the form of a yellowish-brown powder, varying considerably in tint, which derives an alternative name, '''Goa powder''', from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Goa]], where it appears to have been introduced about the year 1852,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Araroba Powder|volume=2|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as Bahia powder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/andira-arar.html Araroba.—Goa Powder. | Henriette's Herbal Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree which yields it is the ''[[Andira]] Araroba'' of the natural order ''[[Leguminosae]]''. It is met with in great abundance in certain forests in the province of [[Bahia]], preferring as a rule low and humid spots. The tree is from 80 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft. high and has large imparipinnate leaves, the leaflets of which are oblong, about 12 in. long and 1 in. broad, and somewhat truncate at the apex. The flowers are papilionaceous, of a purple color and arranged in panicles.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The Goa powder or araroba is contained in the trunk, filling crevices in the heartwood. It is a morbid product in the tree, and yields to hot chloroform 50% of a substance known officially as [[chrysarobin]]. It occurs as a micro-[[crystalline]], odorless, tasteless powder, very slightly soluble in either water or alcohol; it also occurs in [[rhubarb]] root. This complex mixture contains pure chrysarobin, di-chrysarobin methylether, di-chrysarobin. Chrysarobin is a [[methyl trioxyanthracene]] and exists as a [[glucoside]] in the plant, but is gradually [[oxidize]]d to [[chrysophanic acid]] (a dioxy-methyl [[Natural anthraquinone|anthraquinone]]) and [[glucose]]. This strikes a blood-red color in [[alkaline]] solutions, and may therefore cause much alarm if administered to a patient whose urine is alkaline. The British pharmacopoeia had an ointment containing one part of chrysarobin and 24 of [[benzoate]]d [[lard]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Both internally and externally the drug is a powerful irritant. The general practice amongst modern dermatologists is to use only chrysophanic acid, which may be applied externally and given by the mouth in doses of about one grain in cases of [[psoriasis]] and chronic [[eczema]]. The drug is a feeble [[antiparasitic]], and has been used locally in the treatment of [[ringworm]]. It stains the skin and linen a deep yellow or brown, a coloration which may be removed by caustic alkali in weak solution.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

This page contains tables of [[azeotrope]] data for various binary and ternary mixtures of solvents. The data include the composition of a mixture by weight (in binary azeotropes, when only one fraction is given, it is the fraction of the second component), the [[boiling point]] ('''b.p.''') of a component, the boiling point of a mixture, and the [[specific gravity]] of the mixture. Boiling points are reported at a pressure of 760&amp;nbsp;mm Hg unless otherwise stated. Where the mixture separates into layers, values are shown for upper ('''U''') and lower ('''L''') layers.

The data were obtained from Lange's 10th edition&lt;ref name="Langes"&gt;''Lange's Handbook of Chemistry'', 10th ed. pp1496-1505&lt;/ref&gt; and CRC 44th edition&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 44th ed. pp 2143-2184&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise noted (see color code table).

A list of 15825 binary and ternary mixtures was collated and published by the ACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lee H. Horsley|title=Azeotropic Data—III|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841201668|series=Advances in Chemistry Series No. 166|date=1 June 1973|publisher=AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY|isbn=9780841201668}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An azeotrope databank is also available online through Edinburgh University&lt;ref&gt;http://ecosse.org/jack/newWork/Chemeng/azeotrope/hetero.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "computational" refers to the computational level of analysis as put forth by [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Philosophy and the Approach|last = Marr|first = David|publisher = |year = 1971|isbn = |location = |pages = |work = Vision|url = http://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209a/ReadingsByDate/01_07/Marr82Philosophy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work often consists of testing the hypothesis that cognitive systems behave like rational Bayesian agents in particular types of tasks. Past work has applied this idea to [[categorization]], language, [[motor control]], [[sequence learning]], [[reinforcement learning]] and [[theory of mind]]. At other times, Bayesian rationality is ''assumed'', and the goal is to infer the knowledge that agents have, and the mental representations that they use.

It is important to contrast this with the ordinary use of [[Bayesian inference]] in cognitive science, which is independent of rational modeling (see e.g. [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~mdlee/bgm.html Michael Lee's work]).

== The Effect==
When two consistent, unlubricated surfaces slide against each other, there is a specific, predictable amount of friction that occurs. This amount increases as velocity does, but only up to a certain point. That increase generally follows what is known as a [[Stribeck curve]], after [[Richard Stribeck]]. On the other hand, if the two surfaces are completely lubricated, there is no direct friction or rubbing at all. In real life, though, there is often a situation where the surfaces are not completely dry, but also not so lubricated that they do not touch.

This "boundary friction" produces various effects, like an increase in lubrication through the generation of [[shearing force]]s, or an oscillation effect during motion, as the friction increases and decreases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1947RSPSA.189...88B Kinetic Boundary Friction]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, one can experience vibration when trying to brake on a partially damp road, or a cold glass that is slowly condensing moisture can be lifted until it spontaneously slides across the surface it is resting on.

'''Bureau-shaping''' is a [[rational choice]] model of [[bureaucracy]] and a response to the [[budget-maximization model]]. It argues that rational officials will not want to maximize their [[budget]]s, but instead to shape their agency so as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance, bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, [[elite]] agencies close to political [[Power centre (retail)|power centre]]s and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other public sector bodies (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme) or off-loading functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work fields, officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the community'. The model was developed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]] from the [[London School of Economics]] in ''Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice'' (London:  Pearson Education, 1991, reissued 2001).

It was propounded in response to William Niskanen's harsh criticism of Public Bureaucracies in his Budget Maximising Model. The Niskanen model predicts that in representative democracies, public bureaucracies will not only generate allocative inefficiency (by '''oversupplying''' public goods) but also x-inefficiency (by producing public goods inefficiently). It is evident that the Niskanen model is heavily reliant on an American institutional milieu. Patrick Dunleavy, a British political scientist who set out to demolish the public choice arguments on bureaucracy, came instead in the end to develop a public choice model of bureaucratic behaviour which combines elements of Peacock’s insight with the original American model. The Dunleavy (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;300) model of public bureaucracy is built on six basic assumptions. The first three are consistent with Niskanen’s model:

(i) bureau policies are set by bureaucrats interacting with the government;

(ii) governments largely depend on information from bureaus about the costs and value of producing within given ranges of output; and

(iii) bureaucrats maximise their personal utilities (by satisfying "self-regarding, relatively hard-edged preferences") when making official decisions.

Added to these are two 4 assumptions which greatly weaken the budget-maximising conclusion. These are that a bureau’s aggregate policy behaviour is set by some combination of individual decisions made by its officials, although the actual combination that results may be an outcome desired by no bureau member; and that, within broad limits, officials’ influence on bureau policy is always correlated with rank and those nearest the top of bureaus are the most influential. Dunleavy therefore discards Niskanen’s assumption that a bureau’s behaviour will be wholly in line with the preferences of a single senior bureaucrat. In a bureau, where no individual has complete hegemony, budget maximisation is a collective, not an individual good. Rational utility maximising individuals will thus tend to favour strategies that directly advance their personal interests ahead of strategies that advance the collective good. The interaction of the maximising activities of individuals within a bureau will not necessarily lead to budget maximizing.

A '''cognitive bias''' is a systematic pattern of deviation from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]] or rationality in judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haselton, M.

An individual's construction of social reality, not the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] input, may dictate their [[behaviour]] in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bless, H. |author2=Fiedler, K. |author3=Strack, F.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Social cognition: How individuals construct social reality|year=2004|publisher=Hove and New York: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called [[irrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=D. |last2=Tversky |first2=A. |year=1972 |title=Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=430–454 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3| url=http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kahneman-Tversky-1972.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, J.

Some cognitive [[bias]]es are presumably adaptive.

A continually evolving [[list of cognitive biases]] has been identified over the last six decades of research on human judgment and decision-making in [[cognitive science]], [[social psychology]], and [[behavioral economics]]. Kahneman and Tversky (1996) argue that cognitive biases have efficient practical implications for areas including clinical judgment, entrepreneurship, finance, and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kahneman, D. |author2=Tversky, A.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=On the reality of cognitive illusions|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=582–591|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.582|pmid=8759048|url=http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/KahnemanTversky1996PsychRev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S.X.

==Overview==

Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include

* information-processing shortcuts ([[heuristics]])&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D., Slovic, P., &amp; Tversky, A. (1982). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases (1st ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* noisy information processing (distortions in the process of storage in and retrieval from memory)&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"/&gt;
* the brain's limited information processing capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = H.

* emotional and moral motivations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfister | first1 = H.-R. | last2 = Böhm | first2 = G. | year = 2008 | title = The multiplicity of emotions: A framework of emotional functions in decision making | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 5–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[social influence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = X. T. | last2 = Simons | first2 = F. | last3 = Brédart | first3 = S. | year = 2001 | title = Social cues and verbal framing in risky choice | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–15 | doi = 10.1002/1099-0771(200101)14:1&lt;1::AID-BDM361&gt;3.0.CO;2-N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of cognitive biases was introduced by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 1972&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Shane Frederick |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=51–52 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew out of their experience of people's ''[[Numeracy#Innumeracy|innumeracy]]'', or inability to reason intuitively with the greater [[orders of magnitude]]. Tversky, Kahneman and colleagues demonstrated several [[reproducibility|replicable]] ways in which human judgments and decisions differ from [[rational choice theory]]. Tversky and Kahneman explained human differences in judgement and decision making in terms of heuristics. Heuristics involve mental shortcuts which provide swift estimates about the possibility of uncertain occurrences.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2/&gt; Heuristics are simple for the brain to compute but sometimes introduce "severe and systematic errors."&lt;ref name="Tversky.1974"/&gt;

For example, the representativeness heuristic is defined as the tendency to "judge the frequency or likelihood" of an occurrence by the extent of which the event "resembles the typical case".&lt;ref name=Baumeister2&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baumeister, R. F.  |author2=Bushman, B. J.|title=Social psychology and human nature: International Edition|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, USA|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Linda Problem" illustrates the representativeness heuristic (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tversky, A. |author2=Kahneman, D.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgement|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4  |pages=293–315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293|url=http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/TverskyKahneman1983PsychRev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Participants were given a description of "Linda" that suggests Linda might well be a feminist (e.g., she is said to be concerned about discrimination and social justice issues). They were then asked whether they thought Linda was more likely to be a "(a) bank teller" or a "(b) bank teller and active in the feminist movement". A majority chose answer (b). This error (mathematically, answer (b) cannot be more likely than answer (a)) is an example of the "[[conjunction fallacy]]"; Tversky and Kahneman argued that respondents chose (b) because it seemed more "representative" or typical of persons who might fit the description of Linda. The representativeness heuristic may lead to errors such as activating stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of others (Haselton et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;726).

Alternatively, critics of Kahneman and Tversky such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] argue that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases, but rather to conceive rationality as an adaptive tool that is not identical to the rules of [[formal logic]] or the [[probability calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gigerenzer |first=G. |chapter=Bounded and Rational |editor-first=R. J. |editor-last=Stainton |title=Contemporary Debates in Cognitive Science |location= |publisher=Blackwell |year=2006 |page=129 |isbn=1-4051-1304-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, experiments such as the "Linda problem" grew into the heuristics and biases research program which spread beyond academic psychology into other disciplines including medicine and political science.

==Types==
Biases can be distinguished on a number of dimensions. 
For example,
* there are biases specific to ''groups'' (such as the [[Group polarization#Risky shift|risky shift]]) as well as biases at the individual level. 
* Some biases affect [[decision-making]], where the ''desirability'' of options has to be considered (e.g., [[sunk costs]] fallacy).  
* Others such as [[illusory correlation]] affect judgment of how likely something is, or of whether one thing is the cause of another.  
* A distinctive class of biases affect memory,&lt;ref name="Schacter.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Schacter, D.L. |year=1999 |title=The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=182–203 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182 |pmid=10199218 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as consistency bias (remembering one's past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one's present attitudes).
Some biases reflect a subject's ''motivation'',&lt;ref name=Kunda1990&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Kunda, Z. |year=1990 |title=The Case for Motivated Reasoning |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages= 480–498 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480 |pmid=2270237 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|url=http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/kunda90_psychol_bulletin_the-case-for-motivated-reasoning.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the desire for a positive self-image leading to [[egocentric bias]] and the avoidance of unpleasant [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=Hoorens1993&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hoorens, V. |year=1993 |contribution=Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison |title=European Review of Social Psychology 4 |editor=[[Wolfgang Stroebe|Stroebe, W.]] |editor2=Hewstone, Miles |publisher=Wiley |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other biases are due to the particular way the brain perceives, forms memories and makes judgments. This distinction is sometimes described as "[[hot cognition]]" versus "cold cognition", as [[motivated reasoning]] can involve a state of [[arousal]].

Among the "cold" biases,

* some are due to ''ignoring relevant information'' (e.g., [[neglect of probability]]).
* some involve a decision or judgement being ''affected by irrelevant information'' (for example the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]] where the same problem receives different responses depending on how it is described; or the [[distinction bias]] where choices presented together have different outcomes than those presented separately).
* others give ''excessive weight'' to an unimportant but salient feature of the problem (e.g., [[anchoring]]).

The fact that some biases reflect motivation, and in particular the motivation to have positive attitudes to oneself&lt;ref name="Hoorens1993"/&gt; accounts for the fact that many biases are self-serving or self-directed (e.g., [[illusion of asymmetric insight]], [[self-serving bias]]). There are also biases in how subjects evaluate in-groups or out-groups; evaluating in-groups as more diverse and "better" in many respects, even when those groups are arbitrarily-defined ([[ingroup bias]], [[outgroup homogeneity bias]]).

Some cognitive biases belong to the subgroup of [[attentional bias]]es which refer to the paying of increased attention to certain stimuli. It has been shown, for example, that people addicted to alcohol and other drugs pay more attention to drug-related stimuli. Common psychological tests to measure those biases are the [[Stroop effect|Stroop task]]&lt;ref name="pmid5328883"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jensen AR, Rohwer WD |title=The Stroop color-word test: a review |journal=Acta psychologica |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=36–93 |year=1966 |pmid=5328883 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(66)90004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacLeod CM |title=Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=163–203 |date=March 1991 |pmid=2034749 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/109/2/163 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dot-probe paradigm|dot probe task]].

Individuals' susceptibility to some types of cognitive biases can be measured by the [[Cognitive reflection test|Cognitive Reflection Test]] (CRT) developed by Frederick (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Shane|date=2005|title=Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533005775196732|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=25–42|doi=10.1257/089533005775196732|issn=0895-3309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oechssler|first=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|date=2009|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List===
{{main|List of cognitive biases}}
The following is a list of the more commonly studied cognitive biases:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name
! Description
|-
| [[Fundamental attribution error]] (FAE)
| Also known as the correspondence bias &lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt; is the tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviours observed in others. At the same time, individuals under-emphasize the role and power of situational influences on the same behaviour. Jones and Harris' (1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones, E. E. |author2=Harris, V. A  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The attribution of attitudes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=3|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; classic study illustrates the FAE. Despite being made aware that the target's speech direction (pro-Castro/anti-Castro) was assigned to the writer, participants ignored the situational pressures and attributed pro-Castro attitudes to the writer when the speech represented such attitudes.
|-
| [[Confirmation bias]]
| The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. In addition, individuals may discredit information that does not support their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahoney, M. J.|title=Publication prejudices: An experimental study of confirmatory bias in the peer review system|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|year=1977|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1007/bf01173636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confirmation bias is related to the concept of [[cognitive dissonance]]. Whereby, individuals may reduce inconsistency by searching for information which re-confirms their views (Jermias, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;146).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jermias, J.|title=Cognitive dissonance and resistance to change: The influence of commitment confirmation and feedback on judgement usefulness of accounting systems|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|year=2001|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141–160|doi=10.1016/s0361-3682(00)00008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Self-serving bias]]
| The tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests.
|-
| [[Belief bias]]
| When one's evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is biased by their belief in the truth or falsity of the conclusion.
|-
| [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]
| Using a too-narrow approach and description of the situation or issue.
|-
| [[Hindsight bias]]
| Sometimes called the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect, is the inclination to see past events as being predictable.
|}

A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article suggests that at least 8 seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;Martin Hilbert (2012) ''[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001 "Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making"]''" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 138(2), 211–237; free access to the study here: martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown that noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions) can produce [[List of cognitive biases#Decision-making, belief and behavioral biases|regressive conservatism]], the [[Conservatism (belief revision)|belief revision]] (Bayesian conservatism), [[illusory correlation]]s, [[illusory superiority]] (better-than-average effect) and [[worse-than-average effect]], [[subadditivity effect]], [[List of cognitive biases#Decision-making, belief and behavioral biases|exaggerated expectation]], [[overconfidence]], and the [[hard–easy effect]].

==Practical significance==
{{further|Confirmation bias#Consequences}}

Many social institutions rely on individuals to make rational judgments.

The securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons. In truth, actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.

A fair [[jury trial]], for example, requires that the jury ignore irrelevant features of the case, weigh the relevant features appropriately, consider different possibilities open-mindedly and resist [[fallacies]] such as [[appeal to emotion]]. The various biases demonstrated in these psychological experiments suggest that people will frequently fail to do all these things.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Stuart (2007) ''Irrationality: The Enemy Within'' Second Edition (First Edition 1994) Pinter &amp; Martin. {{ISBN|978-1-905177-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they fail to do so in systematic, directional ways that are predictable.&lt;ref name="Ariely.2008"/&gt;

Cognitive biases are also related to the persistence of superstition, to large social issues such as prejudice, and they also work as a hindrance in the acceptance of scientific non-intuitive knowledge by the public.&lt;ref name=mot&gt;{{cite book|title=Motivation in language: studies in honor of Günter Radden|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qzhJ3KpLpQUC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;cd=3&amp;q=essentialism%20definition|author1=Günter Radden |author2=H. Cuyckens |publisher=[[John Benjamins]]|year=2003|page=275 | isbn=978-1-58811-426-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some academic disciplines, the study of bias is very popular. For instance, bias is a wide spread phenomenon and well studied, because most decisions that concern the minds and hearts of entrepreneurs are computationally intractable&lt;ref name="S.X. Zhang and J. Cueto 2015"/&gt;

==Reducing==
Similar to Gigerenzer (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gigerenzer, G.|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky (1996)|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.103.3.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haselton et al. (2005) state the content and direction of cognitive biases are not "arbitrary" (p.&amp;nbsp;730).&lt;ref name="Haselton, M. G., Nettle, D., &amp; Andrews, P. W. 2005 724–746"/&gt; Moreover, cognitive biases can be controlled. [[Debiasing]] is a technique which aims to decrease biases by encouraging individuals to use controlled processing compared to automatic processing.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baumeister, R. F.  |author2=Bushman, B. J.|title=Social psychology and human nature: International Edition|year=2010|publisher=Belmont, USA: Wadsworth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to reducing the FAE, monetary incentives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vonk, R.|title=Effects of outcome dependency on correspondence bias|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=382–389|doi=10.1177/0146167299025003009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and informing participants they will be held accountable for their attributions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tetlock, P. E.|title=Accountability: A social check on the fundamental attribution error|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1985|volume=48|issue=3|pages=227–236|doi=10.2307/3033683|jstor=3033683}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been linked to the increase of accurate attributions. Training has also shown to reduce cognitive bias. Morewedge and colleagues (2015) found that research participants exposed to one-shot training interventions, such as educational videos and debiasing games that taught mitigating strategies, exhibited significant reductions in their commission of six cognitive biases immediately and up to 3 months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Debiasing Decisions Improved Decision Making With a Single Training Intervention|url = http://bbs.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/08/12/2372732215600886|journal = Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2015-08-13|issn = 2372-7322|pages = 2372732215600886|doi = 10.1177/2372732215600886|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Haewon|last2 = Yoon|first3 = Irene|last3 = Scopelliti|first4 = Carl W.|last4 = Symborski|first5 = James H.|last5 = Korris|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive bias modification]] refers to the process of modifying cognitive biases in healthy people and also refers to a growing area of psychological (non-pharmaceutical) therapies for anxiety, depression and addiction called cognitive bias modification therapy (CBMT). CBMT is sub-group of therapies within a growing area of psychological therapies based on modifying cognitive processes with or without accompanying medication and talk therapy, sometimes referred to as applied cognitive processing therapies (ACPT). Although cognitive bias modification can refer to modifying cognitive processes in healthy individuals, CBMT is a growing area of evidence-based psychological therapy, in which cognitive processes are modified to relieve suffering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacLeod | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathews | first2 = A. | last3 = Tata | first3 = P. | year = 1986 | title = Attentional Bias in Emotional Disorders | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 15–20 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.95.1.15 | pmid=3700842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bar-Haim | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lamy | first2 = D. | last3 = Pergamin | first3 = L. | last4 = Bakermans-Kranenburg | first4 = M.

==Criticisms==
There are criticisms against theories of cognitive biases based on the fact that both sides in a [[debate]] often claim each other's thoughts to be in [[human nature]] and the result of cognitive bias, while claiming their own viewpoint as being the correct way to "overcome" cognitive bias. This is not due simply to debate misconduct but is a more fundamental problem that stems from psychology's making up of multiple opposed cognitive bias theories that can be [[falsifiability|non-falsifiably]] used to explain away any viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}{{verify source|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character, 1985, Richard Feynman&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}{{verify source|date=April 2017}}

Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] and how [[economy|economies]] work. [[Microeconomics]] analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and [[markets]], their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. [[Macroeconomics]] analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).  See [[glossary of economics]].

Other broad distinctions within economics include those between [[positive economics]], describing "what is", and [[normative economics]], advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and [[applied economics]]; between [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and [[behavioural economics]]; and between [[mainstream economics]] and [[heterodox economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last1=Caplin |editor-first2=Andrew |editor-last2=Schotter |title=The Foundations of Positive and Normative Economics: A Handbook |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-532831-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2d8SFFyeNEC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term and its various definitions==
The discipline was renamed in the late 19th century, primarily due to [[Alfred Marshall]], from "[[political economy]]" to "economics" as a shorter term for "economic science". At that time, it became more open to rigorous thinking and made increased use of mathematics, which helped support efforts to have it accepted as a science and as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.{{efn|The term ''economics'' is derived from ''economic science'', and the word ''economic'' is perhaps shortened from ''economical'' or derived from the French word ''économique'' or directly from the Latin word ''oeconomicus'' "of domestic economy". This in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκονομικός}} (''oikonomikos''), "practiced in the management of a household or family" and therefore "frugal, thrifty", which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἰκονομία|οἰκονομία]]}} (''oikonomia'') "household management" which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος|οἶκος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|oikos}}'' "house") and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|nomos}}'', "custom" or "law").&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Economy |date=February 2007 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economic |accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Free2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Free|editor-first=Rhona C. |title=21st Century Economics: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRFadIRMaMsC&amp;pg=PA8 |volume=Volume 1 |year=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-6142-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarshallMarshall1888"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=Alfred |authorlink1=Alfred Marshall |last2=Marshall |first2=Mary Paley |authorlink2=Mary Paley Marshall |title=The Economics of Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFc4yr9xfqAC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1888 |publisher=Macmillan |page=2|orig-year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jevons1879"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |authorlink=William Stanley Jevons |title=The Theory of Political Economy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR14 |edition=second |year=1879 |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of modern [[definitions of economics]]; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists.&lt;ref name="Backhouse"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link1=Roger E.

{{quote|text=a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people&amp;nbsp;... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.&lt;ref name="Groenwegen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Smith |date=1776 |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|title-link=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations }} and Book IV, as quoted in {{cite encyclopedia |first=Peter |last=Groenwegen |date=2008 |title=Political Economy  |pages=476–480 |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume  |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000114 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1300|chapter='political economy' |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1803), distinguishing the subject from its [[public policy|public-policy]] uses, defines it as the science ''of'' production, distribution, and consumption of [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Say1803"&gt;{{cite book|last=Say|first=Jean Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Say|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|year=1803|publisher=Grigg and Elliot|ref=harv|title-link=Say's Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[satirical]] side, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1849) coined "[[the dismal science]]" as an [[Epithet#Alternative contemporary usage|epithet]] for [[classical economics]], in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of [[Malthus]] (1798).&lt;ref name="Dismal"&gt;• {{cite magazine |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Carlyle |date=1849 |title=[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]] |magazine=[[Fraser's Magazine]] }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas Robert |author-link=Thomas Robert Malthus |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

{{quote|text=The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TxQqkP40fYC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo|isbn=978-1-60206-978-7|chapter=On the Definition of Political Economy; and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It|orig-year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alfred Marshall]] provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890) that extends analysis beyond [[Economic wealth|wealth]] and from the [[societal]] to the [[microeconomic]] level:

{{quote|text=Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Alfred|authorlink=Alfred Marshall|title=Principles of Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bykoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=1890|publisher=Macmillan and Company|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Lionel Robbins]] (1932) developed implications of what has been termed "[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject":&lt;ref name="BackhouseMedema2009"/&gt;

{{quote |text=Economics is a science which studies [[human behaviour]] as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2007|orig-year=1932|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-039-1|page=15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robbins describes the definition as not ''classificatory'' in "pick[ing] out certain ''kinds'' of behaviour" but rather ''analytical'' in "focus[ing] attention on a particular ''aspect'' of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of [[scarcity]]."{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow.{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|pp=4-7}} But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus.  This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after '''end'''), generates both cost and benefits; and, '''resources''' (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal.  If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding '''actors''' (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a '''decision''') but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end).

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and [[rational choice|rational-choice]] modelling [[Economic imperialism (economics)|expanded the domain]] of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields.&lt;ref name="Backhouse2009Stigler"&gt;• {{cite journal |last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E. |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |date=October 2009 |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |volume=76 |issue=s1 |pages=805–820 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |author-link=George J.

[[Gary Becker]], a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favours as "combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable [[preference (economics)|preferences]], and [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]], used relentlessly and unflinchingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|title=The Economic Approach to Human Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-04112-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the "choice process and the type of [[social interaction]] that [such] analysis involves." The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.&lt;ref name=BackhouseMedema2009/&gt;

==Microeconomics==
{{Main|Microeconomics}}

===Markets===
{{Main|Markets}}
[[File:Ballard Farmers' Market - vegetables.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Economists study trade, production and consumption decisions, such as those that occur in a traditional [[marketplace]].|alt=A vegetable vendor in a marketplace.]]
[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Electronic trading]] brings together buyers and sellers through an [[electronic trading platform]] and network to create virtual market places. Pictured: [[São Paulo Stock Exchange]], Brazil.|alt=Two men sit at computer monitors with financial information.]]
Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a [[market structure]], interact within a [[Market (economics)|market]] to create a [[market system]]. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light [[government regulation]].{{clarify|date=July 2017}} The item traded may be a tangible [[product (business)|product]] such as apples or a [[Service (economics)|service]] such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.

In theory, in a [[free market]] the [[Aggregation problem|aggregates]] (sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers may reach [[economic equilibrium]] over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be [[Equity (economics)|morally equitable]]. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by [[exogenous|external factors]], the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.

Various market structures exist. In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive markets]], no participants are large enough to have the [[market power]] to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a "price taker" as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience [[imperfect competition]].

Forms include [[monopoly]] (in which there is only one seller of a good), [[duopoly]] (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), [[monopolistic competition]] (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), [[monopsony]] (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and [[oligopsony]] (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.

Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as [[supply and demand|partial-equilibrium]] analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. [[General equilibrium|General-equilibrium]] theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Blaug|2017|pp=347–349}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hal R.

===Production, cost, and efficiency===
{{Main|Production theory basics|Opportunity cost|Economic efficiency|Production–possibility frontier}}
In microeconomics, [[Production (economics)|production]] is the conversion of [[factor of production|inputs]] into [[Output (economics)|outputs]]. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a [[good (economics)|commodity]] or a service for [[trade|exchange]] or direct use. Production is a [[Stock and flow|flow]] and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment goods]] (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), [[public good]]s (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or [[private good]]s (new computers, bananas, etc.), and [[Guns versus butter model|"guns" vs "butter"]].

[[Opportunity cost]] is the [[economic cost]] of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet [[mutually exclusive]] actions. It has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[choice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James M. Buchanan |last=Buchanan |first=James M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001612 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3206|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Opportunity cost }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning, then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead.  Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.  The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|output forgone]], [[leisure]], or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ([[utility]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[The Economist]] Economics A-Z |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST |title=Opportunity Cost |access-date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inputs used in the production process include such primary [[factors of production]] as [[Labour (economics)|labour services]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and [[Land (economics)|land]] (including natural resources). Other inputs may include [[intermediate good]]s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.

[[Economic efficiency]] measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available [[technology]]. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of "waste" is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is [[Pareto efficiency]], which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|An example [[production–possibility frontier]] with illustrative points marked.]]
The [[production–possibility frontier]] (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an [[economy]] can produce just two goods (say "guns" and "butter"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows [[Potential output|potential total output]] for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.

[[Scarcity]] is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montani |first=Guido |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001949 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3485|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Scarcity }}&lt;/ref&gt; If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an [[inverse relationship]]. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.

The [[slope]] of the curve at a point on it gives the [[trade-off#Examples from common life|trade-off]] between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a [[market economy]], movement along the curve may indicate that the [[utility|choice]] of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.

By construction, each point on the curve shows ''[[productive efficiency]]'' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high [[unemployment]] during a [[business cycle|business-cycle]] [[recession]] or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy [[allocative efficiency]] (also called [[Pareto efficiency]]) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.

Much [[applied economics]] in [[public policy]] is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the "essence of economics", where the subject "makes its unique contribution."{{sfnp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc= ch. 1, p. 5 (quotation) and sect. C,"The Production-Possibility Frontier", pp. 9–15; ch. 2, "Efficiency" sect.; ch. 8, sect. D, "The Concept of Efficiency}}

===Specialization===
{{Main|Division of labour|Comparative advantage|Gains from trade}}

[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|A map showing the main [[trade route]]s for goods within [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]].]]
Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and [[empirical]] considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in [[stock and flow|stocks]] of [[human capital]] per worker or [[capital (economics)|capital]]/[[labor force|labour]] ratios. According to theory, this may give a [[comparative advantage]] in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input.

Even if one region has an [[absolute advantage]] as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.

It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of [[Returns to scale|scale]] and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration]] to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite journal |author-link=Paul Krugman |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=December 1980 |title=Scale Economies, Product Differentiation, and the Pattern of Trade |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pp=950–999 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/scale_econ.pdf |jstor=1805774}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |first=William C. |last=Strange |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000064 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1769|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=533–536 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Urban agglomeration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, [[Service (economics)|service]] providers, and [[economy|economies]].

An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.

Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market [[price]]s of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|low-cost]] inputs go to producing low-cost outputs.

===Supply and demand===
{{Main|Supply and demand}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase (that is, right-shift) in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).|alt=A graph depicting Quantity on the X-axis and Price on the Y-axis]]

[[Prices and quantities]] have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brody |first=A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics  |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001748 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3325|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Prices and quantities }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In [[microeconomics]], it applies to price and output determination for a market with [[perfect competition]], which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [[market power|power]].

For a given market of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|commodity]], ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). [[consumer theory|Demand theory]] describes individual consumers as [[rational choice theory|rationally]] choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is "constrained utility maximization" (with income and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as the [[budget constraint|constraints]] on demand). Here, [[utility]] refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.

The [[law of demand]] states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things [[ceteris paribus|unchanged]]). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [[substitution effect]]). In addition, [[purchasing power]] from the price decline increases ability to buy (the [[income effect]]). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.

''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.

That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The "Law of Supply" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.

[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.

For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or [[marginal utility]], to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=William Baumol |last=Baumol |first=William J. |date=28 April 2016 |title=Utility and Value |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/utility-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding point on the supply curve measures [[marginal cost]], the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;{{cite book |title=Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |authorlink=John Hicks|orig-year=1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=second |date=2001 |location=London |isbn=978-0-19-828269-3|title-link=Value and Capital }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) ''variable'' in the [[short run]], which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively ''fixed'', such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the [[long run]], all inputs may be adjusted by [[management]]. These distinctions translate to differences in the [[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity]] (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.

[[marginalism|Marginalist theory]], such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to [[Income#Meaning in economics and use in economic theory|income]] and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares [[marginal revenue]] (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the [[marginal cost]] of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change "at the margin": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.

Other applications of demand and supply include the [[Distribution (economics)|distribution of income]] among the [[factors of production]], including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive [[labour market]] for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model&amp;nbsp;— Demand|demand for labour]] (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers). [[Labour economics]] examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, [[labour mobility]], and (un)employment, productivity through [[human capital]], and related public-policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Richard B.

Demand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behaviour of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the [[economy]], for example, total output (estimated as [[real GDP]]) and the general [[price level]], as studied in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Olivier Blanchard |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier |date=2006 |edition=4th |title=Macroeconomics |chapter=Chapter 7: Putting All Markets Together: The AS–AD Model |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-1318-6026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing the [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in [[applied economics]].

===Firms===
{{Main|Theory of the firm|Industrial organization|Business economics|Managerial economics}}

People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through ''firms''. The most obvious kinds of firms are [[corporation]]s, [[partnerships]] and [[trusts]]. According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald | author-link=Ronald Coase |year=1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=[[Economica]] |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=386–405 |jstor=2626876 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|title-link=The Nature of the Firm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater [[economies of scale]] (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. [[Industrial organization]] generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schmalensee |first=Richard |author-link=Richard L.

[[Managerial economics]] applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as [[operations research]] and programming and from statistical methods such as [[regression analysis]] in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] business decisions, including unit-cost minimization and profit maximization, given the firm's objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author=&lt;!-- Staff Writers --&gt; |date=5 May 2013 |title=Managerial Economics |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/managerial-economics}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Hughes |first=Alan |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics  |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001379 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3017|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Managerial capitalism }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] that considers [[Strategy#Strategies in game theory|strategic interactions]] between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical [[microfoundation|foundation]] of [[industrial organization]], discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in an solipsistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining]], [[Contract theory|contract design]], and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. In [[behavioural economics]], it has been used to model the strategies [[Agent (economics)|agents]] choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 11, "Uncertainty and Game Theory" and [end] Glossary of Terms, "Economics of information", "Game theory", and "Regulation"}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Camerer |first=Colin F. |author-link=Colin F.

In this, it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the [[supply and demand]] model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].

[[Risk aversion]] may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for [[insurance]], commodity [[futures market|futures contracts]], and [[financial instruments]].

Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on [[George Akerlof]]'s "[[Market for Lemons]]" article, the [[paradigm]] example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a "lemon" depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |date=August 1970 |title=The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=488–500 |jstor=1879431 |doi=10.2307/1879431 |url=http://hydrogen.its.ucdavis.edu/eec/education/EEC-classes/eeclimate/class-readings/akerlof-the%20market%20for%20lemons.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818045155/http://hydrogen.its.ucdavis.edu/eec/education/EEC-classes/eeclimate/class-readings/akerlof-the%20market%20for%20lemons.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information asymmetry]] arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are [[adverse selection]], such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and [[moral hazard]], such that insurance results in riskier behaviour (say more reckless driving).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Lippman |first1=S.S. |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences |pages=7480–7486 |first2=J.J. |last2=McCall |date=2001 |work=[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]] |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02244-0|isbn=9780080430768 |chapter=Information, Economics of }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market ("[[incomplete markets]]"). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard.

===Market failure===
{{Main|Market failure|Government failure|Information economics|Environmental economics|Agricultural economics}}
[[File:Smokestack in Detroit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Pollution]] can be a simple example of market failure. If [[costs of production]] are not borne by producers but are by the environment, accident victims or others, then prices are distorted.|alt=A smokestack releasing smoke]]

The term "[[market failure]]" encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.{{efn|Compare with [[Nicholas Barr]] (2004), whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions, which are (1) producers as price takers (i.e. presence of oligopoly or monopoly; but why is this not a product of the following?) (2) equal power of consumers (what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power) (3) complete markets (4) public goods (5) external effects (i.e. externalities?) (6) increasing returns to scale (i.e. practical monopoly) (7) perfect information (in {{cite book |title=The Economics of the Welfare State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWxfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926497-1 |pages=72–79}}).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (2015) classifies market failures as from failure of competition (including [[natural monopoly]]), [[information asymmetries]], [[incomplete markets]], [[externalities]], [[public good]] situations, and [[macroeconomic]] disturbances (in {{cite book |title=Economics of the Public Sector: Fourth International Student Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miPeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2015 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-93709-1 |pages=81–100 |chapter=Chapter 4: Market Failure}}).}}

[[Information asymmetries]] and [[incomplete markets]] may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.

[[Natural monopoly]], or the overlapping concepts of "practical" and "technical" monopoly, is an extreme case of ''failure of competition'' as a restraint on producers. Extreme [[economies of scale]] are one possible cause.

[[Public goods]] are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.

[[Externalities]] occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price [[distortions (economics)|distortions]] caused by these externalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Jean-Jacques Laffont |last=Laffont |first=J.J. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=263–265 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000773 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2520|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Externalities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.{{sfn|Blaug|2017|p=347}}

In many areas, some form of [[price stickiness]] is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the [[business cycle]] in [[macroeconomics]]. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets [[Imperfect competition|deviating]] from [[perfect competition]].

Some specialized fields of economics deal in market failure more than others. The [[economics of the public sector]] is one example. Much [[environmental economics]] concerns externalities or "[[public bad]]s".

[[Policy]] options include regulations that reflect [[cost-benefit analysis]] or market solutions that change incentives, such as [[Emissions trading|emission fees]] or redefinition of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Kneese |first1=Allen K. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |first2=Clifford S. |last2=Russell |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=159–164 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000715 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2480|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Environmental economics }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 18, "Protecting the Environment."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector===
{{Main|Economics of the public sector|Public finance}}
{{See also|Welfare economics}}
Public finance is the field of economics that deals with [[budget]]ing the revenues and expenditures of a [[public sector]] entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as [[tax incidence]] (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]] of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of [[public choice theory]], models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Musgrave |first1=Richard A. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |author-link=Richard Musgrave (economist) |pp=1055–1060 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001795 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3360|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Public finance }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of economics is [[positive economics|positive]], seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. [[Normative economics]] seeks to identify what economies ''ought'' to be like.

Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] techniques to simultaneously determine the [[allocative efficiency]] within an economy and the income [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] associated with it. It attempts to measure [[social welfare]] by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Feldman |first1=Allan M. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=889–095 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X002306 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3785|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Welfare economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomics==
[[File:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Circular flow of income|The circulation of money in an economy]] in a macroeconomic model.]]
{{Main|Macroeconomics}}

Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions "top down", that is, using a simplified form of [[General equilibrium|general-equilibrium]] theory.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=345}} Such aggregates include [[measures of national income and output|national income and output]], the [[unemployment rate]], and price [[inflation]] and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]].

Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to [[microfoundations|micro-based]] modelling of sectors, including [[rational expectations|rationality]] of players, [[Efficient market hypothesis|efficient use]] of market information, and [[imperfect competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Business Confidence and Depression Prevention: A Mesoeconomic Perspective |last=Ng |first=Yew-Kwang |authorlink=Yew-Kwang Ng |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=82 |issue=2 |date=May 1992 |pages=365–371 |jstor=2117429}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Howitt |first=Peter M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=  273–276 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001367 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3008|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Macroeconomics: Relations with microeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and [[economic growth|growth]] of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, [[Technological progress|technological change]] and [[labour force]] growth.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=349}}

===Growth===
{{Main|Economic growth}}

''Growth economics'' studies factors that explain [[economic growth]]&amp;nbsp;– the increase in output ''[[per capita]]'' of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the ''level'' of output ''per capita'' ''between'' countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries [[catch-up effect|converge]] at the same rates of growth.

Much-studied factors include the rate of [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment]], [[population growth]], and [[Technological progress|technological change]]. These are represented in theoretical and [[empirical]] forms (as in the [[neoclassical growth model|neoclassical]] and [[endogenous growth model|endogenous]] growth models) and in [[growth accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 27, "The Process of Economic Growth"}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hirofumi Uzawa |last=Uzawa |first=H. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=483–489 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001477 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3097|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Models of growth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycle===
{{Main|Business cycle}}
{{See also|Circular flow of income|Aggregate supply|Aggregate demand|Unemployment}}

[[File:Economic cycle.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|A basic illustration of [[Business cycle|economic/business cycles]].]]

The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of "macroeconomics" as a separate discipline field of study. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] authored a book entitled ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' outlining the key theories of [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes contended that [[aggregate demand]] for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.

He therefore advocated active policy responses by the [[public sector]], including [[monetary policy]] actions by the [[central bank]] and [[fiscal policy]] actions by the government to stabilize output over the [[business cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003  |page=396 |isbn=978-0-13-063085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards [[full employment]] levels. [[John Hicks]]' [[IS/LM]] model has been the most influential interpretation of ''The General Theory''.

Over the years, understanding of the [[business cycle]] has branched into various [[research program]]mes, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The [[neoclassical synthesis]] refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with [[neoclassical economics]], stating that Keynesianism is correct in the [[short run]] but qualified by neoclassical-like considerations in the intermediate and [[long run]].&lt;ref name="Blanchard2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Olivier J. Blanchard |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier Jean |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000041 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1172|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=896–899 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Neoclassical synthesis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New classical macroeconomics]], as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits [[market clearing]] with [[imperfect information]]. It includes Friedman's [[permanent income hypothesis]] on consumption and "[[rational expectations]]" theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist.pdf |title=The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer |first=N. Gregory |last=Mankiw |publisher=Harvard University |date=May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118103900/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], and [[real business cycle theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Stanley Fischer |last=Fischer |first=Stanley |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000056 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1180|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=17–22 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=New classical macroeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[New Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of [[market failures]]. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are "[[Sticky (economics)|sticky]]", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Dixon2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Dixon |first=Huw David |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000166 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1184|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=40–45 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=New Keynesian macroeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the "long run" may be very long.

=== Unemployment ===
{{Main|Unemployment}}
[[File:US employment 1995-2012.png|thumb|upright=2.05|The percentage of the [[Unemployment in the United States|US population employed]], 1995–2012.]]
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or [[discouraged worker|discouraged from seeking work]] by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dwivedi|first=D. N.|title=Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1eFyp9Iku8C&amp;pg=PP1|year=2005|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-058841-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443/&gt;

[[Structural unemployment]] covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Freeman |first=C. |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |date=2008 |edition=second|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000311 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1641|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=64–66 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Structural unemployment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=444–445}}

While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. [[Okun's law]] represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=445–446}} The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neely |first=Christopher J. |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1004.pdf |title=Okun's Law: Output and Unemployment |journal=Economic Synopses |volume=Number 4 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and monetary policy===
{{Main|Inflation|Monetary policy}}
{{See also|Money|Quantity theory of money|History of money}}

[[Money]] is a ''means of final payment'' for goods in most [[price system]] economies, and is the [[unit of account]] in which prices are typically stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. In the words of [[Francis Amasa Walker]], a well-known 19th-century economist, "Money is what money does" ("Money is ''that'' money does" in the original).&lt;ref name="Walker1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Amasa Walker|authorlink=Francis Amasa Walker|title=Money|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MJYSvaRqcwC|accessdate=5 November 2017|year=1878|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[medium of exchange]], money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with [[barter]] (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate [[double coincidence of wants]] as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the [[transaction cost]] of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James Tobin |last=Tobin |first=James |date=1992 |title=Money (Money as a Social Institution and Public Good) |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Finance and Money |volume=Volume 2 |editor-first1=Peter K. |editor-last1=Newman |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=John |editor-last3=Eatwell |pp=770–771 |isbn=978-1-5615-9041-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0UOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of an [[economy]], [[quantity theory of money|theory]] and evidence are consistent with a [[positive relationship]] running from the total [[money supply]] to the [[nominal value]] of total output and to the general [[price level]]. For this reason, management of the [[money supply]] is a key aspect of [[monetary policy]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Friedman |first=Milton |author-link=Milton Friedman |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell  |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter K. |editor-last3=Newman

===Fiscal policy===
{{Main|Fiscal policy|Government spending|Taxation}}

Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an [[output gap]] where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government.

For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have [[Fiscal multiplier|multiplier effects]] where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.

Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of [[Ricardian equivalence]]. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes.

==Development economics==

The distinct field of ''[[development economics]]'' examines economic aspects of the [[economic development]] process in relatively [[developing countries|low-income countries]] focusing on [[structural change]], [[poverty]], and [[economic growth]].

==Economic systems==
{{Main|Economic system}}

Economic systems is the [[JEL classification codes#Economic systems JEL: P Subcategories|branch]] of economics that studies the methods and [[institutions]] by which societies determine the ownership, direction, and allocation of economic resources. An ''economic system'' of a society is the unit of analysis.

Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are [[Planned economy|socialist systems]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]], in which most production occurs in respectively state-run and private enterprises. In between are [[mixed economies]]. A common element is the interaction of economic and political influences, broadly described as [[Political economy#Current approaches|political economy]]. ''[[Comparative economic systems]]'' studies the relative performance and behaviour of different economies or systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Robert L.

==Practice==
{{Main|Economic methodology|Mathematical economics|Schools of economics}}
Contemporary economics uses mathematics. Economists draw on the tools of [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[statistics]], [[game theory]], and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Gérard Debreu |last=Debreu |first=Gérard |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=401–403 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001428 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3059|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Mathematical economics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools, while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods.

===Theory===
Mainstream economic theory relies upon ''[[wikt:a priori|a priori]]'' quantitative [[model (economics)|economic models]], which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration. When creating theories, the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Milton |date=1953 |chapter=[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]] |title=Essays in Positive Economics |publisher=University of Chicago Press |p=10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as [[General equilibrium theory|methodological framework]], economic theory can also take the form of other [[Schools of economic thought|schools of thought]] such as in [[heterodox economics|heterodox economic theories]].

In [[microeconomics]], principal concepts include [[supply and demand]], [[marginalism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[opportunity cost]], [[budget constraint]]s, [[utility]], and the [[theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=455–458 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001456 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3083|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Methodology }}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |title=Consensus and Dissension among Economists: An Empirical Inquiry |last1=Frey |first1=Bruno S. |last2=Pommerehne |first2=Werner W. |last3=Schneider |first3=Friedrich |last4=Gilbert |first4=Guy |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=74 |issue=5 |date=December 1984 |pages=986–994 |jstor=557 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[macroeconomic]] models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including [[new Keynesian]]s, reformulated their models in [[microfoundations]].&lt;ref name="Dixon2008"/&gt;

The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models&amp;nbsp;– for instance, in [[monetary theory]], the [[quantity theory of money]] predicts that increases in the growth rate of the [[money supply]] increase [[inflation]], and inflation is assumed to be influenced by [[rational expectations]]. In [[development economics]], slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the [[Four Asian Tigers]]. Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only ''[[qualitative economics|qualitative]]'', not ''quantitative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Quirk |first=James |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=IV |pp=1–3 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001811 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3369|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Qualitative economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, [[Paul Samuelson]]'s treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947) used mathematical methods beyond graphs to represent the theory, particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called ''operationally meaningful theorems'' in economics, which are [[theorem]]s that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data.&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundations of Economic Analysis, Enlarged Edition |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |origyear=1947 |year=1983 |page=4 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-674-31301-9|title-link=Foundations of Economic Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empirical investigation===
{{Main|Econometrics|Experimental economics}}
Economic theories are frequently tested [[empirical]]ly, largely through the use of [[econometrics]] using [[economic data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hashem |first=M. Pesaren |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=II |p=8 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000646 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2430|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Econometrics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controlled experiments common to the [[physical science]]s are difficult and uncommon in economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keuzenkamp|first=Hugo A.|authorlink=Hugo A. Keuzenkamp|title=Probability, Econometrics and Truth: The Methodology of Econometrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3to_1Z2zo-IC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55359-9|page=13|quote=...in economics, controlled experiments are rare and reproducible controlled experiments even more so...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead broad data is [[observational study|observationally studied]]; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of [[experimental economics]] is growing, and increasing use is being made of [[natural experiments]].

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]] such as [[regression analysis]] are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and [[statistical significance]] ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, [[data set]]s, and prior beliefs.

Criticisms based on professional standards and non-[[Replication (statistics)|replicability]] of results serve as further checks against bias, errors, and over-generalization,{{sfnp|Frey|Pommerehne|Schneider|Gilbert|1984|pages=986–994}}{{Sfnp|Blaug|2017|page=247}} although much economic research has been accused of being non-replicable, and prestigious journals have been accused of not facilitating replication through the provision of the code and data.&lt;ref name=McCullough2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCullough |first=B.D. |date=September 2007 |title=Got Replicability?

In applied economics, [[input-output model]]s employing [[linear programming]] methods are quite common. Large amounts of data are run through computer programs to analyse the impact of certain policies; [[Minnesota IMPLAN Group|IMPLAN]] is one well-known example.

[[Experimental economics]] has promoted the use of [[Scientific control|scientifically controlled]] [[experiment]]s. This has reduced the long-noted distinction of economics from [[natural science]]s because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Bastable |first=C.F. |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=II |page=241 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000762 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2512|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |year=2008 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Experimental methods in economics (i) }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Vernon L.

In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including [[banking]] and [[finance]]. Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national [[Treasury]], [[Central Bank]] or [[Bureau of Statistics]].

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics) is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field.

Two groups, later called "mercantilists" and "physiocrats", more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of [[economic nationalism]] and [[History of capitalism#Merchant capitalism and mercantilism|modern capitalism]] in Europe. [[Mercantilism]] was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Mercantilism |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=26 August 2016 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mercantilism}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physiocrats]], a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a [[circular flow]] of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Physiocrat|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=7 March 2014 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physiocrat}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=Economic Theory in Retrospect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nd6alor2goC&amp;pg=PA24|edition=fifth|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57701-4|pages=24–29, 82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, has been described as "the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline."{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=343}} The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation's wealth, as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive.

Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by [[division of labour]], including increased [[labour productivity]] and [[gains from trade]], whether between town and country or across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Alan Deardorff |last=Deardorff |first=Alan V. |date=2016 |title=Division of labor |website=Deardorffs'  Glossary of International Economics |publisher=University of Michigan |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/d.html#DivisionOfLabor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "theorem" that "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market" has been described as the "core of a [[Theory of the firm|theory of the functions of firm]] and [[industrial organization|industry]]" and a "fundamental principle of economic organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George J.

In an argument that includes "one of the most famous passages in all economics,"{{sfnp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|p=30|loc=ch. 2, "Markets and Government in a Modern Economy", The Invisible Hand}} Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage, not that of the society,{{efn|"Capital" in Smith's usage includes [[fixed capital]] and [[circulating capital]].

By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.{{sfnp|Smith|1776|loc=Bk. IV: Of Systems of political Œconomy, ch.

The [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1798) used the concept of [[diminishing returns]] to explain low living standards. [[Human population]], he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income, [[David Ricardo]] (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of [[comparative advantage]], according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower ''relative'' cost of production, rather relying only on its own production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Ricardo |date=1817 |title=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation |publisher=John Murray|title-link=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been termed a "fundamental analytical explanation" for [[gains from trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ronald Findlay |first=Ronald |last=Findlay |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0274|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=28–33 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Comparative advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1848 |title=Principles of Political Economy |publisher=John W. Parker Publisher|title-link=Principles of Political Economy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the "real price of every thing&amp;nbsp;... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it". Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity.{{sfnp|Smith|1776|loc=Bk. 1, Ch. 5, 6}} Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the '[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]'. Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a [[Steady-state economy#The stationary state in classical economics|final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size]].

Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics. It derives from the work of [[Karl Marx]]. The first volume of Marx's major work, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the [[labour theory of value]] and the [[theory of surplus value]] which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=John Roemer |last=Roemer |first=J.E. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |p=383 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001420 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3052|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marxian value analysis }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ernest Mandel |last=Mandel |first=Ernest |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=372, 376 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001419 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3051|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–1883) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.&lt;ref name="THOMAS FULLER"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/asia/18laos.html |work=The New York Times|first=Thomas |last=Fuller|title=Communism and Capitalism Are Mixing in Laos|date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economics===
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}

At the dawn as a social science, '''economics''' was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his ''Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth'' (1803). These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution.{{efn|"This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive, where whatever is gained by one is lost by another, and where it is profitable to all; it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes, but simply in their results, at which it stops. Besides this knowledge, the merchant must also understand the processes of his art. He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals, their qualities and defects, the countries from which they are derived, their markets, the means of their transportation, the values to be given for them in exchange, and the method of keeping accounts. The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist, to the manufacturer, and to the practical man of business; to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon, the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all; and to become expert in his particular pursuit, each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes." {{harv|Say|1803|page=XVI}} }} Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word "wealth" for "goods and services" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]] noticed that this definition no longer sufficed,{{efn|"And when we submit the definition in question to this test, it is seen to possess deficiencies which, so far from being marginal and subsidiary, amount to nothing less than a complete failure to exhibit either the scope or the significance of the most central generalisations of all."{{harv|Robbins|2007|p=5}} }} because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity,{{efn|"The conception we have adopted may be described as analytical. It does not attempt to pick out certain kinds of behaviour, but focuses attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity. {{harv|Robbins|2007|p=17}} }} which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science."

Citing Robbins: "Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Defining Economics: the Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |first1=Roger E. |last1=Backhouse |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |work=Lionel Robbins's essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 75th anniversary conference proceedings |date=10 December 2007 |pp=209–230 |url=http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/LionelRobbinsConferenceProveedingsVolume.pdf#page=213 |ref=harv}} also published in {{cite journal |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |date=October 2009 |volume=76 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=805–820 |jstor=40268907 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x|last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E |last2=Medema |first2=Steve G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition.{{sfnp|Backhouse|Medema|2007|page=223|ps=: "There remained division over whether economics was defined by a method or a subject matter but both sides in that debate could increasingly accept some version of the Robbins definition."}} Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.

A body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[Marginalist Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier "[[political economy]]".&lt;ref name="MarshallMarshall1888"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jevons1879"/&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Barry |title=Political Economy: A Comparative Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wpiDzS45PsC&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1998 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-95869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics systematized [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] inherited from classical economics in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Campos |first=Antonietta |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |volume=III |p=320 |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001393 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3031|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marginalist economics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of [[ordinal utility]], which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=R.D. Collison |last=Black |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000047 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1781|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=577–581 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Utility }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping [[decision making]]. An immediate example of this is the [[consumer theory]] of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt; In [[macroeconomics]] it is reflected in an early and lasting [[neoclassical synthesis]] with Keynesian macroeconomics.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=John Hicks |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |date=April 1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the "Classics": A Suggested Interpretation |journal=Econometrica |volume=5 |issue=2 |jstor=1907242 |pp=147–159 |doi=10.2307/1907242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as ''orthodox economics'' whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern [[mainstream economics]] builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as [[econometrics]], [[game theory]], analysis of [[market failure]] and [[imperfect competition]], and the [[neoclassical model]] of [[economic growth]] for analysing long-run variables affecting [[national income]].

Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of [[individual]]s, [[household]]s, and [[organization]]s (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use [[Scarcity|scarce]] resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a [[Decision theory|decision]] (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics: Growing Economies from the Bottom Up |journal=[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]] |date=Winter 2002 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=55–82 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acealife.pdf |pmid=12020421 |doi=10.1162/106454602753694765|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.4605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the focus of economic analysis.{{efn|See [[Agent-based computational economics]]}}

An approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows:

The continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent).{{efn|Interest payments are considered a form of rent on credit money.}} Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.{{efn|See [[Complex adaptive system]] and [[Dynamic network analysis]]}}

[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] (right), was a key theorist in economics.]]

Keynesian economics has two successors. [[Post-Keynesian economics]] also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]] and the work of [[Joan Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harcourt |first=G.C. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=47–50 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001728 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3307|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Post-Keynesian economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New-Keynesian economics]] is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.

===Chicago school of economics===
{{Main|Chicago school of economics}}
The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to [[Milton Friedman]] and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. [[Ben Bernanke]], former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|date=8 November 2002|first=Ben |last=Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the 13 September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times Magazine'', in which he claims that the social responsibility of business should be "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits&amp;nbsp;... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=13 September 1970 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other schools and approaches===
{{Main|Schools of economics}}
Other well-known schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the [[Austrian School]], the [[Freiburg School]], the [[School of Lausanne]], [[post-Keynesian economics]] and the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]]. Contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] and [[West coast of the United States|Western]] coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago-school approach.

Within macroeconomics there is, in general order of their appearance in the literature; [[classical economics]], [[Keynesian economics]], the neoclassical synthesis, [[post-Keynesian economics]], [[monetarism]], [[new classical economics]], and [[supply-side economics]]. Alternative developments include [[ecological economics]], [[constitutional economics]], [[institutional economics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[dependency theory]], [[structuralist economics]], [[world systems theory]], [[econophysics]], [[feminist economics]] and [[biophysical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |first=Nathanial |last=Greenwolde |date=23 October 2009 |title=New School of Thought Brings Energy to 'the Dismal Science' |work=[[The New York Times]]  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/10/23/23greenwire-new-school-of-thought-brings-energy-to-the-dis-63367.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===
"[[The dismal science]]" is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname "the dismal science" as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on [[slavery]], in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it.&lt;ref name="Dismal"/&gt;

Some economists, like John Stuart Mill or [[Léon Walras]], have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routh |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Routh |title=The Origin of Economic Ideas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2KwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1989 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-20169-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Wealth of Nations'', Adam Smith addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smith's day, these were referred to as [[Political faction|factions]], but are now more commonly called [[special interests]], a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies, monopolies, [[trade union]]s and other groups.{{efn|See {{cite web |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |author-link=Noam Chomsky |website=Understanding Power |title=Ruling the World |url=http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014032025/http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 October 2008 |date=14 October 2008}} on Smith's emphasis on class conflict in the Wealth of Nations.}}

Economics ''per se'', as a social science, is independent of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization; however, many [[policymaker]]s or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and [[rhetoric]] as vehicles to legitimize [[Political agenda|agendas]] and [[value systems]], and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="dismal science to get real"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sara |last1=Ledwith |first2=Antonella |last2=Ciancio |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-europe-economics-teaching-idUSBRE86207O20120703 |title=Special Report: Crisis Forces "Dismal Science" to get Real |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close relation of economic theory and practice with [[politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sirkku K. |last=Hellsten |chapter=Ethics, Rhetoric and Politics of Post-conflict Reconstruction How Can the Concept of Social Contract Help Us in Understanding How to Make Peace Work? |chapter-url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/rp2006-148.pdf |title=Making Peace Work |editor-first1=Tony |editor-last1=Addison |editor-first2=Tilman |editor-last2=Brück |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pp=75–100 |isbn=978-0-230-59519-4 |doi=10.1057/9780230595194|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hahn |first=Dan F. |title=Political Communication: Rhetoric, Government, and Citizens |url=http://www.stratapub.com/Hahn/preface.htm |edition=second |year=2003 |publisher=Strata |isbn=978-1-891136-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals have increased their efforts to gauge the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Often there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in one survey of [[American Economic Association]] economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.{{sfnp|Whaples|2009}}

In ''Steady State Economics'' 1977, leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Daly1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daly|first=Herman E.|authorlink=Herman Daly|title=Steady-State Economics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmp5mPdJ474C&amp;pg=PA98|edition=second|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-872-1|pages=98–128|chapter=The Catechism of Growth Fallacies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of assumptions===
Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified assumptions, in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions. Examples of such assumptions include [[perfect information]], [[profit maximization]] and [[rational choice theory|rational choices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |date=28 July 1996 |title=Abstraction and Unrealistic Assumptions in Economics |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=215–236 |doi=10.1080/13501789600000016}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |title=Models and Reality in Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lmCa_pgyhUC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=1998 |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=978-1-85898-575-6 |chapter=Chapter 6: Economic Models}}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Friedman|1953|pages=14–15, 22, 31}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000231 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0067|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=267–270 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Assumptions controversy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[information economics]] includes both mathematical-economical research and also [[behavioural economics]], akin to studies in [[behavioural psychology]].&lt;ref name=Hodgson2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=Geoffrey M. |date=December 2007 |title=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics as the New Mainstream |journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=7–25 |doi=10.14441/eier.4.7|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keynes |first=J. M. |title=Alfred Marshall 1842–1924 |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=34 |issue=135 |pages=311–72 |date=September 1924 |jstor=2222645 |doi=10.2307/2222645}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on oligopoly research, [[Paul Joskow]] pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use "informal models" based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were "trotted out ''[[ex post]]''". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behaviour, was neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joskow |first=Paul |title=Firm Decision-making Policy and Oligopoly Theory |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=65 |issue=2, Papers and Proceedings of the Eighty–seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |pages=270–279, esp. 271 |date=May 1975 |jstor=1818864 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of [[feminist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=England |first=Paula |date=1993 |chapter=The Separative Self: Androcentric Bias in Neoclassical Assumptions |editor-last1=Ferber|editor-first1=Marianne A.|editor-last2=Nelson|editor-first2=Julie A. |title=Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ba9PmAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24201-9 |pages=37–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a [[positive economics|positive]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferber |first1=Marianne A. |last2=Nelson |first2=Julie A. |chapter=Introduction: ''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later |title=Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeWgyqLvmfsC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors ([[homo economicus]]); exogenous tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of [[unpaid work]]; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. [[Feminist economics]] developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. In 1988, [[Marilyn Waring]] published the book ''[[If Women Counted]]'', in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores [[women's work|women's unpaid work]] and the value of [[nature]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marilyn |last=Waring |date=1988 |title=If Women Counted |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-250933-8|title-link=If Women Counted }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Julie A. Nelson]], ''If Women Counted'' "showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within [[national accounts|national accounting systems]]" and "issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological [[sustainability]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=Julie A. |chapter=Foreword |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sbh8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first =Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first =Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay |title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |year=2014 |publisher=Demeter Press |isbn=978-1-9273-3527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnholt and McKay argue that the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=Margunn  |last2=McKay |first2=Ailsa |author2-link=Ailsa McKay |editor1-last=Bjørnholt |editor1-first =Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt |editor2-last=McKay |editor2-first=Ailsa |editor2-link=Ailsa McKay |title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |chapter-url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=Demeter Press |pages=7–20 |chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis |isbn=978-1-9273-3527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Michael Perelman]] are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics.

[[Image:El Peru Cover Page.jpg|thumb|Title page of a 1929 edition of ''El Perú'']]

'''''El Perú: Itinerarios de Viajes''''' is an expansive written work covering a variety of topics in the [[natural history]] of [[Peru]], written by the prominent Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist [[Antonio Raimondi]] in the latter half of the 19th century.  The work was compiled from extensive and detailed notes Raimondi took while criss-crossing the country, studying the nation's geography, geology, meteorology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and archaeology; ''El Perú'' focuses to some extent on each of these topics and others.  The first volume was published in 1874; several more volumes were published both before Raimondi's death and posthumously from his notes, the last being released in 1913, making a five volume set.  The volumes are a classic example of exploration scholarship, and form one of the earliest and broadest scientific reviews of Peru's natural and cultural heritage.

The son of Nicola Cavolini, a Neapolitan lawyer, and Angela Auriemma, Filippo Cavolini left a legal career to devote himself to natural history. He became the Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Naples]] and Director of the [[Zoological Museum of Naples|Zoological Museum]].
His research style, similar to that of [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], led to important results in the arena of marine biology and botany (''Memorie per servire alla storia de' polipi marini'' -1785- ''Memoria per servire alla generazione dei pesci e dei granchi'' - 1787).
He died following an assault by a soldier while he was researching by boat in the [[Gulf of Naples]]: he fell into the sea and died a few days later from [[pneumonia]].
The opisthobranch family [[Cavoliniidae]] honours his name.

'''Global Health and Vaccination Research''' (GLOBVAC) is a programme of the [[Research Council of Norway]]. Its primary objective is to support high-quality research with potential for high impact that can contribute to sustainable improvements in health and health equity for poor people in low- and lower-middle income countries (LMIC). Norwegians institutions may apply for grants in collaboration with researchers in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forskningsradet.no/prognett-globvac/Home_page/1224697869238] About the GlobVac programme Retrieved 12 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As all programmes of the [[Research Council of Norway]] it is led by a programme board appointed by the Division Board for Society and Health at the Research Council. The programme board for the period 2011 - 2014 is chaired by [[Peter Smith (epidemiologist)]]. Other members include Prof. [[Nelson Sewankambo]] and Prof. [[Rifat Atun]]

It prioritizes projects in the following thematic areas:
 
# Prevention and treatment of, and diagnostics for, communicable diseases with particular relevance for low and lower-middle income countries. 
 
#Family planning, reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child and youth health.  
#Health systems and health policy research: that is production and application of knowledge to improve how societies organize themselves in order to achieve health goals.  
# Implementation research: research on the promotion of uptake of research findings into public health programmes, and to expand knowledge on strategies for implementation and wider scaling-up of effective health interventions and health services.  
# Innovation in technology and methods development for maternal and child health in settings where appropriate technologies are not available or non-existing.

* '''[[Absolute electrode potential]]''' –in [[electrochemistry]], according to an [[IUPAC]] definition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00022.html IUPAC Gold Book - absolute electrode potential&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[electrode potential]] of a [[metal]] measured with respect to a universal reference system (without any additional metal–solution interface)
* '''[[Absolute pressure]]''' – is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an [[absolute scale]], so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.
* '''[[Absolute zero]]''' – is the lower limit of the [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale, a state at which the [[enthalpy]] and [[entropy]] of a cooled [[ideal gas]] reach their minimum value, taken as 0. Absolute zero is the point at which the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, [[zero-point energy]]-induced particle motion.  The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the [[ideal gas law]]; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the [[Celsius]] scale ([[International System of Units]]),&lt;ref name=sib2115&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin) |work=SI Brochure, 8th edition |at=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/kelvin.html |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |date=13 March 2010 |origyear=1967 |access-date=20 June 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053944/http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/kelvin.html |archivedate=7 October 2014 }} '''Note''': The triple point of water is 0.01 °C, not 0 °C; thus 0 K is −273.15 °C, not −273.16 °C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arora"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics|first1=C.

* '''[[Absorbance]]''' – In [[chemistry]], '''absorbance''' or '''decadic absorbance''' is the ''[[common logarithm]]'' of the ratio of incident to ''transmitted'' [[radiant power]] through a material, and '''spectral absorbance''' or '''spectral decadic absorbance''' is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to ''transmitted'' [[Radiant power|spectral radiant power]] through a material.&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Absorbance|file=A00028|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Acceleration]]''' – In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
* '''Access chamber''' –
* '''[[Acid]]''' – An '''acid''' is a [[molecule]] or [[ion]] capable of donating a [[Hydron (chemistry)|hydron]] (proton or hydrogen ion H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), or, alternatively, capable of forming a [[covalent bond]] with an [[electron pair]] (a Lewis acid).&lt;ref name="IUPAC_acid"&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00071.html IUPAC Gold Book - acid]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Acid-base reaction]]''' – is a [[chemical reaction]] that occurs between an [[acid]] and a [[base (chemistry)|base]], which can be used to determine [[pH]]. Several [[theory|theoretical]] frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the  acid–base theories, for example, [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory]].
* '''[[Acid strength]]''' – refers to the tendency of an [[acid]], symbolised by the [[chemical formula]] HA, to dissociate into a [[hydron (chemistry)|proton]], H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and an [[anion]], A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.
* '''[[Acoustics]]''' – is the branch of [[physics]] that deals with the study of all [[mechanical wave]]s in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as [[vibration]], [[sound]], [[ultrasound]] and [[infrasound]].
* '''[[Acre]]''' – is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of land area used in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units#Units of area|US customary]] systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one [[Chain (unit)|chain]] by one [[furlong]] (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square [[Chain (unit)|chains]], {{frac|1|640}} of a square mile, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 40% of a [[hectare]].
* '''[[Acrow prop]]''' – or '''BS prop''' is a piece of [[construction]] equipment. It is a telescopic tubular steel prop, used as a temporary support. A '''[[jackscrew]]''' is similar but not as long and not telescopic. Outside the [[UK]] an Acrow prop may be known as a '''[[jack post]]''',  '''adjustable post''', '''telescoping prop''' or '''... post''', '''screw jack''', '''adjustable steel column''', '''adjustable steel prop''' or '''... post''', '''adjustable metal prop''' or '''... post''', as well as an '''adjustable shoring post''' or '''shore post'''.
* '''[[Activated sludge]]''' – The '''activated sludge''' process is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] process for treating [[sewage]] or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewaters]] using [[aeration]] and a biological floc composed of bacteria and [[protozoa]].
* '''[[Activated sludge model]]''' – is a generic name for a group of mathematical methods to model [[activated sludge]] systems. The research in this area is coordinated by a task group of the [[International Water Association]] (IWA). Activated sludge models are used in scientific research to study biological processes in hypothetical systems. They can also be applied on full scale wastewater treatment plants for optimisation, when carefully calibrated with reference data for sludge production and nutrients in the effluent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7988">'''Graham's law of effusion''' (also called '''Graham's law of [[diffusion]]''') was formulated by Scottish physical chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler]] and John M. Meiser, ''Physical Chemistry'' (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Graham found experimentally that the rate of [[effusion]] of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; This formula can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;{\mbox{Rate}_1 \over \mbox{Rate}_2}=\sqrt{M_2 \over M_1}&lt;/math&gt;,
where:
:Rate&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate of effusion for the first gas. (volume or number of moles per unit time).
:Rate&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate of effusion for the second gas. 
:''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[molar mass]] of gas 1
:''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the molar mass of gas 2.

Graham's law states that the rate of diffusion or of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other (heavier gases diffuse more slowly). A complete theoretical explanation of Graham's law was provided years later by the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. Graham's law provides a basis for separating [[isotopes]] by diffusion&amp;mdash;a method that came to play a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="Petrucci"&gt;R.H. Petrucci, W.S. Harwood and F.G. Herring, ''General Chemistry'' (8th ed., Prentice-Hall 2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;206–08 {{ISBN|0-13-014329-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham's law is most accurate for molecular effusion which involves the movement of one gas at a time through a hole. It is only approximate for diffusion of one gas in another or in air, as these processes involve the movement of more than one gas.&lt;ref name="Petrucci"/&gt;

In the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the molar mass is proportional to the mass density. Therefore the rate of diffusion of different gases is inversely proportional to the square root of their mass densities.

:&lt;math&gt;{\mbox{r}} \propto {\mbox{1}\over\sqrt{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
Let gas 1 be H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and gas 2 be O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (This example is solving for the ratio between the rates of the two gases)

:&lt;math&gt;{\mbox{Rate H}_2 \over \mbox{Rate O}_2}={\sqrt{32} \over \sqrt{2}}={\sqrt{16} \over \sqrt{1}}= \frac{4}{ 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, hydrogen molecules effuse four times faster than those of oxygen.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;

Using the formula of gaseous diffusion, the ratio of rate of diffusion of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  and HCl gas was obtained practically as 1.46 +_ 0.01.

Graham's Law can also be used to find the approximate molecular weight of a gas if one gas is a known species, and if there is a specific ratio between the rates of two gases (such as in the previous example).  The equation can be solved for the unknown molecular weight.

:&lt;math&gt;{M_2}={M_1 \mbox{Rate}_1^2 \over \mbox{Rate}_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Graham's law was the [[Gaseous diffusion|basis]] for separating &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U from &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U found in natural [[uraninite]] (uranium ore) during the [[Manhattan Project]] to build the first atomic bomb. The United States government built a gaseous diffusion plant in [[Clinton, Tennessee]] at the cost of $100 million (~$7.7 billion in 2014 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Measuring Worth - Result in Table|url = http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/result.php?NOMINALGDP&amp;year_source=1944&amp;amount=100000000&amp;year_result=2014|website = Measuring Worth|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In this plant, [[uranium]] from uranium ore was first converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]] and then forced repeatedly to diffuse through porous barriers, each time becoming a little more enriched in the slightly lighter &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;

==History==
Graham's research on the diffusion of gases was triggered by his reading about the observation of [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Johann Döbereiner]] that hydrogen gas diffused out of a small crack in a glass bottle faster than the surrounding air diffused in to replace it. Graham measured the rate of diffusion of gases through plaster plugs, through very fine tubes, and through small orifices. In this way he slowed down the process so that it could be studied quantitatively. He first stated in 1831 that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, and later in 1848 showed that this rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; Graham went on to study the diffusion of substances in solution and in the process made the discovery that some apparent solutions actually are [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of particles too large to pass through a parchment filter. He termed these materials [[colloid]]s, a term that has come to denote an important class of finely divided materials.&lt;ref&gt;Laidler and Meiser p.795&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time Graham did his work, the concept of molecular weight was being established largely through the measurements of gases. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] suggested in 1738 in his book [[Hydrodynamica]] that heat increases in proportion to the velocity, and thus kinetic energy, of gas particles. Italian physicist [[Amedeo Avogadro]] also suggested in 1811 that equal volumes of different gases contain equal numbers of molecules. Thus, the relative molecular weights of two gases are equal to the ratio of weights of equal volumes of the gases. Avogadro's insight together with other studies of gas behaviour provided a basis for later theoretical work by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] to explain the properties of gases as collections of small particles moving through largely empty space.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;See:
*  Maxwell, J.C. (1860) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-YU7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part I.  On the motions and collisions of perfectly elastic spheres,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', 4th series, '''19''' :  19–32. 
*  Maxwell, J.C. (1860) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DIc7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases. Part II.  On the process of diffusion of two or more kinds of moving particles among one another,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', 4th series, '''20''' :  21–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the greatest success of the kinetic theory of gases, as it came to be called, was the discovery that for gases, the temperature as measured on the [[Kelvin]] (absolute) temperature scale is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Graham's law for diffusion could thus be understood as a consequence of the molecular kinetic energies being equal at the same temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch4/kinetic4.html |title=The Kinetic Molecular Theory |website=Chemed.chem.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale of the above can be summed up as follows:

Kinetic energy of each type of particle (in this example, Hydrogen and Oxygen, as above) within the system is equal, as defined by [[thermodynamic temperature]]:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}m_{\rm H_{2}}v^{2}_{\rm H_{2}}=\frac{1}{2}m_{\rm O_{2}}v^{2}_{\rm O_{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be simplified and rearranged to:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{v^{2}_{\rm H_{2}}}{v^{2}_{\rm O_{2}}} = \frac{m_{\rm O_{2}}}{m_{\rm H_{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;

or:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{v_{\rm H_{2}}}{v_{\rm O_{2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm O_{2}}}{m_{\rm H_{2}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

Ergo, when constraining the system to the passage of particles through an area, Graham's Law appears as written at the start of this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16007">The H-500 project is an outline planning scheme in accordance with the Planning and Building Law for South [[Holon]], [[Israel]]. The area of the project is approximately 4,080 dunams and it is the largest, undeveloped land reserve remaining in Holon. The scheme is bounded in the north by Sderot Yerushalayim and the Kiryat Sharet and Kiryat Pinhas Ayalon neighbourhoods, in the east by Highway no. 4, in the south by the border with the city of [[Rishon LeZion]] and in the west by [[Highway 20 (Israel)]] (the Ayalon Highway).

== General Background ==
The scheme (Holon H-500) adapts the land zoning, and the deployment and height of construction, to the restrictions deriving from NOPS 2/4 (the National Outline Planning Scheme for the development of [[Ben Gurion Airport]]), which fixed the location of the flight paths adjacent to and above the site of the H-500 scheme. The restrictions deriving from the Airport's activity are expressed in a limit of the final height of the buildings in the project (a maximum of 22 stories), height limits for masts and antennas and also restrictions relating to the erection of cranes during construction. In addition, the use of acoustic elements for noise insulation is prescribed, as are provisions intended to minimise the hazards deriving from flying birds that might endanger passing aircraft.

According to the scheme, in the version that has been deposited (Holon H-500), a green area of 1,200 dunams or thereabouts is planned for the development of a metropolitan sand dune park at the centre of the site. The centre of the park, which is called the "preserved heart", will include an area of not less than 400 dunams of natural sand dunes in order to preserve the unique ecology that includes a wide range of rare plants, the like of which is not to be found elsewhere along the coast. The ring around the "preserved heart" will form the outer envelope of the park and will be zoned for municipal recreation and leisure activity.

Further to the hearing of oppositions to the deposited version of the scheme (Holon H-500), the district planning and building committee decided to extend the "preserved heart" of the park at the expense of the area for future planning. The 1,500 dwelling units that were allotted in an area for future planning according to the deposited version of the scheme were moved by the district committee's decision to the residential domains, so that their allotment will not be dependent on changes to the Airport flight paths.

== Milestones in the Holon H-500 scheme approval proceedings ==
* Notice of the scheme's preparation and the conditions for the issue of building permits during the interim three-year period according to sections 77 and 78 of the Planning and Building Law was first published in the press on August 10–11, 2006 and in Government Notices no. 5562 of August 2, 2006.
* Notice of an extension of the time for the issue of conditional building permits during the interim period, for one year or until the scheme's deposit, according to section 78 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6080 of April 28, 2010.
* Notice of the scheme's deposit in accordance with section 89 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6444 of July 11, 2012.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the Holon H-500 scheme was made on February 18, 2013.
* The decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council to approve the scheme was made on May 14, 2014.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the scheme, subject to technical modifications and transitional provisions to permit the existing uses until the preparation of detailed plans, was made on October 12, 2015.

== Building rights – quantitative data of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* 1,300 low-rise dwelling units
* 12,400 high-rise dwelling units (including 1,500 dwelling units that were moved from the area for future planning that was cancelled in order to increase the size of the sand dune park), of which 2,000 are small dwelling units of 80 m² each, including safe room, for eligible persons.
* 13,700 dwelling units in total (including 800 for encouragement and assistance in the elimination of nuisances and the removal of squatters).
* 930,000 m² (principal area) for employment of various types, including commercial and multipurpose zoning.
* 175,000 m² (principal area) for public buildings.

== The main provisions of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* A condition for the approval of an initial detailed plan will be the approval of a scheme incorporating division into different domains for consolidation and partition or a plan including such partition as part of, or contemporaneously with, the initial detailed plan ("the domains scheme").
* The domains scheme will prescribe the division of building rights between the domains, the conditions for realisation of the rights in each individual domain and provisions for consolidation and partition that will include reference to the division of public areas.
* The domains scheme will amongst other things prescribe the area of the park that will be included in the various different detailed plans, with reference to the part of the park located in each domain, provided that complete development of the whole park is ensured.

== History ==
The sand dunes of South Holon have been a focus of real estate activity since the beginning of the last century. At that time, before the establishment of the Holon Local Council, the area was defined as being under galilee jurisdiction, that is to say that it was not under the jurisdiction of any local authority, adjacent to the Arab village of Yazur. The first outline scheme that was prepared for the area by the planning agencies during the British Mandate was called the "Agrobank And Neighbourhood Regional Outline Road Scheme".

The scheme was provisionally approved on October 30, 1939 and finally on January 14, 1942 (its approval was published in the Official Gazette, no. 1164). The purpose of the scheme was to delineate the road network for the new neighbourhoods that were to be built around the Agrobank neighbourhood, situated to the north, adjacent to [[Mikveh Israel]].

In the 1930s private individuals and commercial companies started buying large tracts of land totalling hundreds of dunams from the Arab landowners. Parcellation plans were prepared in accordance with the Mandatory City Building Ordinance, which divided the large tracts of land into small parcels of between 300 and 500 m² each, creating neighbourhoods that incorporated roads and plots for public purposes, in conformity with the Mandatory outline scheme for Holon, R/128, the preparation of which began in the early 1940s

The parcels resulting from the parcellation plans were entered in the Land Registers and came to be traded on the open market in Israel and also abroad. At that time great importance was attached to the redemption of the land and for that reason many parcels were bought by the Jews of Europe, USA and South Africa, with the assistance of public leaders who were harnessed to the task on visiting Jewish communities abroad. Thus, for example, Dr Haim Kugel, who went on to become the first Mayor of Holon, helped in the land redemption when he visited the Jewish community in South Africa. For that reason there are still many owners (the heirs of the original owners) of land within the boundaries of the scheme who are non-residents.

The following are examples of the historical parcellation of land in South Holon:

* The creation of blocks 6747, 6748, 6749 and 6750 by the Agricultural and Building Bank for Palestine Ltd
* The partition of parcel 690 in block 6043 by the Land and Loan Company Ltd.

The first outline planning scheme for the City of Holon, H/1, dating from 1958, cancelled all the Mandatory plans for the construction of new residential neighbourhoods in South Holon and zoned the whole area for planning again as an "area for reparcellation" (fresh consolidation and partition). The H-500 scheme is the third and most recent of the outline planning schemes (following H/1 and Amendment no. 3 to H/1) and it proposes a new planning scheme for the whole area.

== The Moledet Neighbourhood ==
The Moledet neighbourhood is included within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. The neighbourhood was established in 1930 as the first residential suburb of South Holon and it is one of the first five neighbourhoods (together with Agrobank, Greene, Kiryat Avoda and Am) that combined into the Holon Local Council in 1940.

The Moledet land was purchased by a company called Hamizrach, headed by the engineer, Alexander Hissin. The centre of the neighbourhood was the Water Tower. The first residents were eight immigrant families from Yemen but by the end of 1934, just four years later, the population of the neighbourhood had reached about 100 families.

Because of Moledet's remoteness from other Jewish settlements and its proximity to the Arab villages of Yazur and Bayt Dajan, the neighbourhood was attacked by Arabs from Jaffa in the great Arab revolt between 1936 and 1939 and almost completely abandoned. Its residents went to live temporarily at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School.

The Security Road, which was paved in 1948 as an alternative to the Jaffa – Jerusalem Road (now Highway no. 44), with the object of connecting Tel Aviv to the settlements of the South and Jerusalem, ran through Moledet.

Dozens of families now live in Moledet, alongside a few businesses and workshops. All the buildings in the neighbourhood, apart from the Water Tower and Security Road that have been zoned for preservation, are to be cleared according to the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Givat Holon Neighborhood ==
Givat Holon is located within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. This small suburb is located to the south of Kiryat Sharet in the heart of the sand dune area, alongside the road leading to the site of the municipal abattoir.

Givat Holon includes several dozen homes. The buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 1940s and remain in their original format. Although according to outline scheme H/1 (Amendment no. 3), which was approved in 1978, the area was zoned as residential, in order to enlarge construction in the area it was necessary to prepare a detailed plan. Because of the limitations deriving from the neighbourhood's location in the area affected by the Airport, it was not possible to develop the neighborhood and it has therefore remained in its original state, without modern infrastructure.

The residents of Givat Holon took legal proceedings against Holon Municipality and in June 2014 they were awarded judgement requiring the Municipality to grant them proper municipal services, like garbage removal and the provision of refuse bins, and the installation of lampposts and street signs.

Givat Holon is due to be cleared as part of the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Abattoir ==
The Abattoir tract is a 254 dunam piece of land that is included in the H-500 scheme. The land was expropriated from private owners in 1961 further to authority obtained by the Mayor of Holon in accordance with the Land Ordinance for the establishment of a regional abattoir and associated industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/b3858e_9a8d0aa430ce481eb5324ac8322f97d0.pdf/ |title=A letter of the mayor of Holon written on Feb. 14, 1960, regarding getting permission to expropriate land for the making of the regional Abattoir|publisher=Joseph Raiten, The Holon H-500 Trade Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end a joint company was established by the Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities (80% Tel Aviv and 20% Holon) in order to promote the venture and bear its costs, including the compensation payable to the private landowners.

Further to the expropriation proceedings, in 1966 a town planning scheme (H-142) for the construction of an abattoir and associated industries was approved. According to the scheme it was permitted to build an abattoir and meat processing facilities.

The aforegoing might today sound like a figment of the imagination: to expropriate 250 dunams of land for an abattoir in the sandhills of South Holon, big enough to serve the whole Middle East. Nevertheless, at that time, the venture did appear to justify such a large-scale expropriation. Not one of the private landowners objected to the venture and even had anyone objected, it is doubtful whether he would have had any chance of succeeding against Holon's then legendary mayor, Pinchas Ayalon.

In fact, apart from one building that was constructed at the end of the 1960s, which served as a municipal abattoir until the beginning of the 1990s, the rest of the land remained empty and undeveloped. The abattoir building was blown up in June 2015 as part of an exercise by the Home Front Command.

The landowners in the abattoir domain, Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities, are expected to obtain rights in the scope of the H-500 scheme for the clearance of the abattoir (section 2.2.4 of the scheme regulations).

== The Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet ==
The H-500 scheme lays down directions for the preservation of the Security Road and the historic sites associated with it in accordance with the municipal preservation plan. The scheme nevertheless prescribes the clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet because of the limitations of using the area, which is affected by the flight paths according to the Ben Gurion Airport national outline scheme. After clearance, the neighborhoods will become part of the municipal sand dune park.

The deposited plan contains merely general provisions for the compensation of the residents of Moledet, the clearance to be financed from building rights that have been allotted specifically for the purpose, totalling 800 dwelling units (designated for the clearance of three centres: the refuse site, the abattoir and Moledet). The scheme further provides that the total compensation will be determined by a real estate appraiser to be appointed by the local planning and building committee.

Further to appeals that were filed against the district planning and building committee's decision (which the residents of Givat Holon also joined), which culminated in the decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council of May 15, 2014, several operative decisions were made in respect of the clearance of Givat Holon (from which inferences may be drawn in respect of the clearance of Moledet) as follows:

* The clearance of the existing residents will be effected in consolidation and partition proceedings in accordance with the detailed plan, in which the area will be zoned for the park. The residents will be allotted other land in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.
* Until the clearance of Givat Holon it will be possible to continue using the existing lawful buildings for residential purposes.
* So long as residential use continues in Givat Holon, the issue of building permits for the renovation (not including extension) of existing buildings will be permitted by virtue of existing permits.
* The residents will obtain their rights in the scope of the first plan that is approved by virtue of the H-500 scheme.
* Clearance will only be effected when the implementation of the first detailed plan commences or at such other time as it prescribes.

'''Henry Bolingbroke Woodward''' (24 November 1832 &amp;ndash; 6 September 1921) was an [[England|English]] [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] known for his research on fossil [[crustacean]]s and other [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name="ObitGeologicalMagazine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary. Henry Woodward|journal=The Geological Magazine|date=Nov 1921|volume= 58|issue= 11|pages=481–484|url=https://archive.org/stream/geologicalmagazi581921wood#page/n558/mode/1up|doi=10.1017/s0016756800105023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward was born [[Norwich, England]] on 24 November 1832 and was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]].

He became assistant in the geological department of the [[British Museum (Natural History)|British Museum]] in 1858, and in 1880 keeper of that department. He became [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1873, [[LL.D]] (St Andrews) in 1878, president of the [[Geological Society of London]] (1894–1896). He was awarded the [[Murchison Medal]] in 1884 and [[Wollaston Medal]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="ObitGeologicalMagazine"/&gt; Woodward was president of the [[Geologists' Association]] for the years 1873 and 1874, president of the [[Malacological Society of London|Malacological Society]] in 1893–1895, president of the [[Museums Association]] for the year 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=WOODWARD, Henry|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1932|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and president of the [[Palaeontographical Society]] from 1895 (upon the death of incumbent president [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T. H. Huxley]]) to his own death in 1921.

He published a ''Monograph of the British Fossil Crustacea, Order Merostomata'' ([[Palaeontographical Society|Palaeontograph. Soc.]] 1866-1878); ''A Monograph of Carboniferous Trilobites'' (Pal. Soc. 1883-1884), and many articles in scientific journals. He was editor of the ''[[Geological Magazine]]'' from its commencement in 1864 and sole editor from July 1865 until the end of 1918.&lt;ref name="ObitGeologicalMagazine"/&gt; Woodward's collection of shells, manuscripts and casts of fossil vertebrates can be found in the archives of the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge University Museum of Zoology: Histories &amp; Archives|url=http://131.111.101.189/fmi/iwp/cgi?-db=UMZC%20Catalogues%20(Web)&amp;-loadframes|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Henry's father, [[Samuel Woodward]], was a noted geologist and antiquary. Henry's brother [[Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward]] became a noted librarian and antiquary while his brother [[Samuel Pickworth Woodward]] became a professor of geology and natural history. His nephews were [[Bernard Barham Woodward]], a British [[malacologist]] and a member of staff at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and [[Horace Bolingbroke Woodward]], who was Vice-president of the [[Geological Society]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].

Henry Woodward had two sons, both of whom died before he did; the eldest, [[Henry Page Woodward]] was also a noted geologist who worked in Australia. Henry's second son, Martin- a student of [[T. H. Huxley]] alongside [[H. G. Wells]]&lt;ref&gt;Experiment in Autobiography. Discoveries and Conclusions of a Very Ordinary Brain, H. G. Wells, 1934, pg 163&lt;/ref&gt;- was a promising zoologist killed in a boating accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Martin F.

'''Jack Sarfatti''' (born September 14, 1939) is an American [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]]. Working largely outside academia, most of Sarfatti's publications revolve around [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]].{{refn|group=n|[[David Kaiser]], 2011: "From [Eugene] Wigner and [John] Wheeler, Sarfatti took the point that everyone's consciousness participates in shaping quantum processes, both by deciding which observations to make and by collapsing the multiplying possibilities into definite outcomes. Sarfatti recast Wigner's main argument in terms of action and reaction. Surely matter can affect consciousness&amp;nbsp;... so why not posit an equal and opposite reaction of consciousness on matter?"&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kaiser]], ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt;{{paragraph break}}
David Hodgson, 2005: "[P]hysicist Jack Sarfatti has devised a theory of consciousness and free will based upon Bohm's version of QM [quantum mechanics], or post-QM. Sarfatti's unorthodox work does not yet appear in any book or published article, but it can be found on the internet&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;David Hodgson, "Quantum Physics, Consciousness and Free Will," in [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W340Q1LzR5AC&amp;pg=PA110 110], n.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He argues for [[retrocausality]], that [[mind]] is crucial to the structure of matter, and that physics—which he calls the "[[conceptual art]] of the late 20th Century"—has replaced philosophy as the unifying force between science and art.{{refn|group=n|[[Paavo Pylkkänen|Paavo T. I. Pylkkänen]], 2006: "The physicist Jack Sarfatti, in particular, has emphasized the need for an explanation of how the individual particle influences its own field and has proposed mechanisms for such 'back-action,' also emphasizing, in a very interesting way, its importance in understanding the mind-matter relationship and how consciousness arises (see, for example, Sarfatti (1997)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paavo Pylkkänen|Paavo T. I. Pylkkänen]], ''Mind, Matter and the Implicate Order'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_HbrvcEpXeQC&amp;pg=PA37 37].&lt;/ref&gt;{{paragraph break}}
[[Steven M. Rosen]], 1994: "A major theme of Tobin, Sarfatti, and Wolf's exposition is that 'all is consciousness.' At every level of organization in the hierarchy of space-time domains, singularities or holes develop at the fringes, destroying the continuity that prevailed in the middle regions. Consciousness is identified as the 'hidden variable' that creates the holes and then fills them, restoring continuity. In the process, the next level of hierarchy is produced. Thus the secret thread with which plural realities are sewn together is consciousness.&amp;nbsp;... Therefore, in his opening statement, Sarfatti offers 'the idea that consciousness is at the root of the material universe' (Toben, Sarfatti, and Wolf 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;126)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven M. Rosen]], ''Science, Paradox, and the Moebius Principle'', State University of New York Press, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mCwh4h5bKaQC&amp;pg=PA143 143].&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;65; [[Michael Talbot (author)|Michael Talbot]], ''Mysticism and the New Physics'', Penguin, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;2, 65.{{paragraph break}}

Sarfatti was a leading member of the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]], an informal group of physicists in California in the 1970s who, according to historian of science [[David Kaiser]], helped to inspire some of the investigations into quantum physics that underly parts of [[quantum information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;xxiiiff; [[David Kaiser]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc "Lecture: How the Hippies Saved Physics"], WGBH PBS, April 28, 2010 (hereafter Kaiser 2010), from 04:00 mins, particularly from 11:00 mins.{{paragraph break}}

==Background==

===Education===
Sarfatti was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Hyman and Millie Sarfatti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeLiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hyman+Sarfatti ''Technology Review''], Association of Alumni and Alumnae of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;1; Jack Sarfatti, ''Destiny Matrix''. AuthorHouse, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was born in [[Kastoria]], Greece, and moved to New York as a child with his family.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman Sarfatti, [http://scigod.com/index.php/sgj/article/download/342/387 "My Story: Cosmic Consciousness &amp; Me"], ''Scientific GOD Journal'', 5(8), October 2014 (pp. 660–682), pp.&amp;nbsp;660, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised in the [[Midwood]] neighborhood, Sarfatti attended [[Midwood High School]] where he was in the All City Chorus and Math Club, graduating in 1956.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Alex Burns, [http://www.21cmagazine.com/383372/Jack-Sarfatti-Weird-Science "Jack Sarfatti: Weird Science"], 21C magazine, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Destiny Matrix'' (2002), Sarfatti wrote that, when he was 13, he received at least one telephone call from a voice that said it was a conscious computer on a spaceship. The voice said he had been identified as "one of 400 bright young receptive minds," and that he would be picked up shortly from his building's fire escape. He and several friends waited, he wrote, but nothing happened.&lt;ref&gt;Sarfatti, ''Destiny Matrix'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27, 95; Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberger"&gt;Sharon Weinberger, [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120321-searching-for-a-starship "100 Year Starship: An interstellar leap for mankind?"], BBC, March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarfatti has also alleged that numismatist and convicted [[child sex offender]] [[Walter H. Breen]] (who later offered guest workshops sponsored by Sarfatti at meetings of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group at the [[Esalen Institute]] in 1976) secured his admission to [[Cornell University]] while coordinating [[Sandia National Laboratories]]-funded [[parapsychological]] research studies of New York City [[gifted]] children (so-called "superkids," including Sarfatti and Robert Bashlow) in [[William Herbert Sheldon]]'s Constitutional Laboratory at [[Columbia Medical School]] from 1953 to 1956.&lt;ref name="praxisforlife.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446 |title=Coming Soon |publisher=Praxisforlife.org |accessdate=2014-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226135736/http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446 |archive-date=December 26, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies allegedly included immersion in New York [[science fiction fandom]], a connection facilitated by Breen.&lt;ref name="praxisforlife.org"/&gt;

In 1960, he obtained his [[B.A]] in physics from Cornell University, where he was also a lead tenor in the [https://cornellsavoyards.blogspot.com/2012/12/princess-ida-1958.html?showComment=1528053976780#c8831579714163883531 "Cornell Savoyards"]. Three years later, he published his first paper, "Quantum-Mechanical Correlation Theory of Electromagnetic Fields," in ''Nuovo Cimento'', the journal of the Italian Physical Society. Following graduate studies at Cornell and [[Brandeis University]], he obtained an [[M.S.]] in physics in 1967 from the [[University of California, San Diego]] before receiving a [[Ph.D.]] in the discipline in 1969 from the [[University of California, Riverside]], where he studied under [[Fred Cummings]]; his dissertation was "Gauge Invariance in the Theory of Superfluidity."&lt;ref&gt;For the MS, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/08/17/SC46892.DTL&amp;ao=5 Schwartz 1997], p.&amp;nbsp;5; for the PhD, Jack Sarfatt[i], [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969PhDT.......175S "Gauge Invariance in the Theory of Superfluidity"], The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Cummings co-wrote a paper, "Beyond the Hartree-Fock Theory in Superfluid Helium," published in ''Physica Scripta'' in 1970.&lt;ref name=Schwartz5/&gt;

===Academic career===
From 1967 to 1971, Sarfatti was an [[assistant professor]] of physics at [[San Diego State University]]. During the 1971–1972 academic year, he held a research fellowship at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], where he worked with [[David Bohm]].&lt;ref name=Schwartz5/&gt; He also studied at the Cornell Space Science Center, the UK [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], and the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; In 1973–1974 he conducted research into [[mini black holes]] at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] in [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;"If the beer don't get you, then the black holes must," ''New Scientist'', October 18, 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWRmXO0ut6YC&amp;pg=PA165 165].{{paragraph break}}
For a paper he wrote in Trieste, Jack Sarfatti, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p741r4251125l674/ "Toward a Unified Field Theory of Gravitation and Strong Interactions"], ''Foundations of Physics'', 5(2), 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time he decided to leave academia, seeing it as too sterile.

===Politics===

According to Kaiser, Sarfatti's politics have leaned to the right since the early 1980s, when he became dependent on a cadre of "politically conservative thinkers who were drawn to certain [[New Age]] ideas" for research funding following the dissolution of his relationship with [[Werner Erhard]]. He endorses the [[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory]] and perceives the majority of faculty at American universities as constituting "the enemy within." In the 1980s, he worked with Lawry Chickering at the [[Institute for Contemporary Studies]], a [[neoconservative]] think tank. For over forty years, Sarfatti has maintained a close friendship with conservative talk show host and medical anthropologist [[Michael Savage]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental Fysiks Group==

[[File:Sarfatti-Wolf.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=photograph|Sarfatti ''(left)'' with physicist [[Fred Alan Wolf]] in Paris, 1973]]

Sarfatti became a leading member of the Fundamental Fysiks Group, an informal group of physicists that conducted weekly discussions at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Collins and T. J. Pinch, ''Frames of Meaning: The Social Construction of Extraordinary Science'', Routledge, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmmZDF8nepUC&amp;pg=PA189 189], n.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc Kaiser 2010], from 24:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumtantra.com/reunion.html "25th reunion of the Fundamental Physics Group"], quantumtantra.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The group—"very smart and very playful," according to David Kaiser—was founded by [[Elizabeth Rauscher]] and included [[Henry Stapp]], [[Fred Alan Wolf]], [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[John Clauser]], Philippe Eberhard, Saul-Paul Sirag and George Weissman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc Kaiser 2010], from 23:22 mins; for Capra's membership, from 45:00 mins, and Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several held academic posts, but others had been left unemployed when the post-war boom in physics ended in 1968–1972. Physics, too, had changed; students were taught little or no philosophy and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fundamental Fysiks Group, with PhDs in theoretical physics, made names for themselves writing about consciousness, metaphysics and [[quantum mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Heirich, [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/66669/10.1177_000276427601900602.pdf?sequence=2 "Cultural Breakthroughs"], "American Behavioral Scientist", 19(6), July/August 1976 (pp.&amp;nbsp;685–702), pp.&amp;nbsp;696–699.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KaiserHippies/&gt;
 
Quantum theory—particularly [[Bell's theorem]] and the concept of [[quantum entanglement]]—had raised questions about [[parapsychology]] and [[telepathy]].&lt;ref name=KaiserHippies&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc Kaiser 2010], from 23:22 mins.{{paragraph break}}

Jack Sarfatti, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1979/sep/27/the-superluminal-1/ "The Superluminal"], ''The New York Review of Books'', September 27, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiser argues that Sarfatti and the group kept several of these apparently fringe ideas alive. For example, they believed they could develop faster-than-light communication, discussions that led to the [[no-cloning theorem]], which became part of [[quantum cryptography]].{{refn|group=n|[[David Kaiser]] 2011: "The hippie physicists' concerted push on Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement instigated major breakthroughs&amp;nbsp;... The most important became known as the "[[no-cloning theorem]]," a new insight into quantum theory that emerged from spirited efforts to wrestle with hypothetical machines dreamed up by members of the Fundamental Fysiks Group."&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;xiii–xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The group similarly kept Bell's theorem alive, which eventually led to [[quantum information science]]. According to historian [[Robert P. Crease]] and physicist Alfred Scharff Goldhaber, apart from one brief mention in 1966, Bell's theorem "did not enter mainstream physics textbooks until after the Fundamental Fysiks Group had left its impact."{{refn|group=n|[[Robert P. Crease]], Alfred Scharff Goldhaber, 2014: "The textbook that briefly mentioned Bell's theorem was Kurt Gottfried, ''Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals'' (W. A. Benjamin, 1966). The first quantum mechanics textbook that Kaiser has found that devotes any attention to Bell's theorem was Sakurai's 1985 textbook ''Modern Quantum Mechanics'', i.e. Bell's theorem did not enter mainstream physics textbooks until after the Fundamental Fysiks Group had left its impact."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert P. Crease]], Alfred Scharff Goldhaber, ''The Quantum Moment: How Planck, Bohr, Einstein, and Heisenberg Taught Us to Love Uncertainty'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;263–264, 304, n.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kaiser writes that there was significant government interest in telepathy and [[remote viewing]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] set up a program called ESPionage, financing research conducted by the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI), where Sarfatti and the Fundamental Fysiks Group became what Kaiser calls its "house theorists."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc Kaiser 2010], around 28 mins.{{paragraph break}}

The spread included a photograph of Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Fred Alan Wolf and Nick Herbert, and discussed them "going into trances, working at telepathy, [and] dipping into their subconscious in experiments toward psychic mobility."&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Sarfatti was featured on the cover of ''North Beach Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;xviii; Sarfatti, ''Destiny Matrix'', p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfBqFB_hdoA] Sarfatti with Russell Targ on CIA experiments in remote viewing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into Uri Geller==

Sarfatti and Fred Wolf helped to organize a series of tests at [[Birkbeck College]], London, led by [[John Hasted]].&lt;ref name=SarfattiGeller/&gt; On June 21 and 22, 1974, Hasted and Sarfatti joined [[David Bohm]], [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and two of Geller's associates, [[Ted Bastin]] and Brendan O'Regan, to watch Geller appear to bend four brass [[Yale key]]s and a 1&amp;nbsp;cm disk, affect a [[Geiger counter]] and deflect a [[compass needle]]. Hanlon wrote that any good magician could have bent the keys, no matter how closely the observers believed they were watching.&lt;ref name=Hanlon1974/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hasted|J. B.

==Physics–Consciousness Research Group==
Outside government, groups within the [[human potential movement]] were also interested in quantum theory. Werner Erhard, founder of [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST), moved to the Bay Area and came into contact with Sarfatti and Fred Alan Wolf. In January 1975 Erhard and the physicists formally set up a non-profit think tank, the Physics–Consciousness Research Group, with Sarfatti as president and Saul-Paul Sirag vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 298, n.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by Erhard, they held lectures, published pamphlets, and staged an opera in a Bay Area park about quantum physics and the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 28:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erhard introduced Sarfatti to [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]] of the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[Big Sur]], California. In January 1976 Sarfatti and the Physics–Consciousness Research Group gathered there for a month-long conference on physics and consciousness. Sarfatti was the conference's intellectual director, and wrote to major figures asking them to address it. [[Gary Zukav]]'s best-selling ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]'' (1979) was organized around his attendance at this conference; he and Sarfatti were roommates in North Beach at the time. The conference apart, the Esalen group held regular workshops on quantum theory, with physicists mixing lectures with yoga and sessions in the hot tubs.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;114; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 33:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Epistemological Letters''==
{{further|Epistemological Letters}}
The new ideas were not invariably welcome within mainstream academic physics. According to Kaiser, [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit|Samuel Goudsmit]], editor of the prestigious ''[[Physical Review]]'', formally banned discussion of the interpretation of quantum mechanics, drawing up special instructions to referees to reject material that even hinted at the philosophical debate. The new material was distributed instead in alternative media. One such publication was a hand-typed newsletter called ''Epistemological Letters'', published by a Swiss Foundation. Several eminent physicists and philosophers published their material there—including the Irish physicist [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], the originator of [[Bell's theorem]]—as well as Sarfatti and other members of the Physics-Consciousness Research Group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc Kaiser 2010], from 38:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John William Money''' (8 July 1921 – 7 July 2006) was a [[Psychology|psychologist]], [[Sexology|sexologist]] and author, specializing in research into [[sexual identity]] and [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|biology of gender]].  He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of "gender" affect an individual. Recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of [[David Reimer]]&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Diamond M, Sigmundson HK (1997).

==Biography==
Born in [[Morrinsville]], New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualhealth.umn.edu/education/john-money/bio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204551/http://www.sexualhealth.umn.edu/education/john-money/bio |archivedate=24 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Money initially studied [[psychology]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]],&lt;ref name="nzhobit"&gt;(10 July 2006) [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=204&amp;ObjectID=10390550 Kiwi sexologist dies in US hospital], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Money, PhD|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/John+Money,+Ph.D.-a0168586760|publisher=Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality|accessdate=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the [[University of Otago]] in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children.

Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including [[gender identity]], [[gender role]],&lt;ref name="diamond2"&gt;Diamond, Milton. (2004). "Sex, gender, and identity over the years: a changing perspective", ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America''. 13: 591–607. {{PMID|15183375}} [http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm Full text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203153327/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gender-identity/role, and [[lovemap]]. He coined the term ''paraphilia'' (appearing in the [[DSM-III]]) to replace ''perversions'' and introduced the term ''sexual orientation'' in place of ''sexual preference'', arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice.&lt;ref name="John Money, Ph.D"/&gt; 
Money was a professor of [[pediatrics]] and [[medical psychology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with [[Claude Migeon]] who was the head of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Sex Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullough|first1=Vern|title=The Contributions of John Money: A Personal View|publisher=Taylor and Francis, Ltd.|jstor=3813317}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. He received the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]] in 2002 from the [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]].

Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author [[Janet Frame]]. In 2002, as his [[Parkinson's disease]] worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the [[Eastern Southland Art Gallery]] in [[Gore, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="sunobit"&gt;Brewington, Kelly (9 July 2006).

==Sexological books==
Money was the co-editor of a 1969 book "Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment", which helped bring more acceptance to [[sexual reassignment surgery]] and [[transgender]] individuals.

===Sexual identity, gender identity and gender roles===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
{{further|Sexual identity|Gender identity|Gender role}}
Money introduced numerous definitions related to gender in journal articles in the 1950s, many of them as a result of his studies of Hermaphroditism.

Money's definition of [[gender]] is based on his understanding of sex differences among human beings. According to Money, the fact that one sex produces [[ovum|ova]] and the other sex produces [[sperm]] is the irreducible criterion of sex difference. However, there are other ''sex-derivative differences'' that follow in the wake of this primary dichotomy.

These differences involve the way [[urine]] is expelled from the human body and other questions of [[sexual dimorphism]]. According to Money's theory, ''sex-adjunctive differences'' are typified by the smaller size of females and their problems in moving around while [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] infants. This then makes it more likely that the males do the roaming and hunting.

''Sex-arbitrary differences'' are those that are purely conventional: for example, color selection (baby blue for boys, [[Pink#The 20th century|pink for girls]]).  Some of the latter differences apply to life activities, such as career opportunities for men versus women.

Finally, Money created the now-common term ''[[gender role]]'' which he differentiated from the concept of the more traditional terminology ''sex role''.  This grew out of his studies of hermaphrodites.  According to Money, the genitalia and erotic sexual roles were now, by his definition, to be included under the more general term "gender role" including all the non-genital and non-erotic activities that are defined by the conventions of society to apply to males or to females.

In his studies of hermaphrodites, Money found that there are six variables that define sex.  While in the average person all six would line up unequivocally as either all "male" or "female", in hermaphrodites any one or more than one of these could be inconsistent with the others, leading to various kinds of anomalies. In his seminal 1955 paper he defined these factors as:&lt;ref name=MHH-1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# assigned sex and sex of rearing
# external genital morphology
# internal reproductive structures
# hormonal and secondary sex characteristics
# gonadal sex
# chromosomal sex

and added, {{quote|"Patients showing various combinations and permutations of these six sexual variables may be appraised with respect to a seventh variable:
7. Gender role and orientation as male or female, established while growing up."&lt;ref name=MHH-1955 /&gt;}}

He then defined gender role as {{quote|"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.  It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism.  Gender role is appraised in relation to the following:  general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor; play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices, and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry."&lt;ref name=MHH-1955 /&gt;}}

Money made the concept of ''gender'' a broader, more inclusive concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one's status as a man or a woman, but was also a matter of personal recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.

In 1972, Money presented his theories in ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', a college-level, mainstream textbook. The book featured David Reimer (see below) as an example of gender reassignment.

===''Gay, Straight and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation''===
{{format footnotes|date=March 2015}}
{{Confusing section|reason=there are terms in this section that require explanation as they are technical jargon used in Money's theoretical conceptualizing and do not have broad understanding|date=March 2016}}
In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of '[[bodymind]],' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between [[nature versus nurture]], innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term "bodymind", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.

Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114–119) a view of "Concepts of Determinism," which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication.

Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) – the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior – is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. "It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback)." (Oxford 1988: 116)

==Controversies==

===Sex reassignment of David Reimer===
{{Main|David Reimer}}
During his professional life, Money was respected as an expert on sexual behavior, especially known for his views that gender was learned rather than innate. However, it was later revealed that his most famous case of [[David Reimer]] was fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref name="Dr. Money And The Boy With No Penis"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/health/dr-money-and-the-boy-with-no-penis/ Dr. Money And The Boy With No Penis] Retrieved 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, a botched [[circumcision]] left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby's parents that [[sex reassignment surgery]] would be in Reimer's best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an [[orchidectomy]], in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and given the name Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful.

For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case", describing apparently successful female gender development and using this case to support the feasibility of [[Sex reassignment therapy|sex reassignment]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgical reconstruction]] even in non-[[intersex]] cases. Notes by a former student at Money's laboratory state that, during the yearly follow-up visits, Reimer's parents routinely lied to staff about the success of the procedure. Reimer's twin brother, Brian, later developed [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="bbc-horizon-tv-followup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml |title=Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis |date=2005 |website=BBC |series=Horizon |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Reimer's case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to [[Milton Diamond]], an academic [[sexology|sexologist]] who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly.&lt;ref name=PCSS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|author2=Sigmundson, HK|title=Sex reassignment at birth.

On July 1, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/16482516|title=Brian Henry Reimer (1965 - 2002) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian was found dead from an overdose of antidepressants. On May 4, 2004, after suffering years of severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]], financial instability, and marital troubles,&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/david-reimer-38-subject-of-the-john-joan-case.html |title=David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case |date=May 12, 2004 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; David committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] at the age of 38. Reimer's parents have stated that Money's methodology was responsible for the deaths of both of their sons.&lt;ref&gt;"Born a Boy, Raised as a Girl" Documentary, The Learning Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

Money argued that media response to the exposé was due to right-wing [[media bias]] and "the antifeminist movement". He said his detractors believed "masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the kitchen".&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (24 May 2004).

===Pedophilia opinions===
John Money was critical in debates on [[chronophilia]]s, especially [[pedophilia]]. He stated that both sexual researchers and the public do not make distinctions between affectional pedophilia and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] pedophilia. Money asserted that affectional pedophilia was about love and not sex.

{{quote|If I were to see the case of a boy aged ten or eleven who's intensely erotically attracted toward a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally mutual, and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual ... then I would not call it pathological in any way.&lt;ref name="paidika"&gt;Interview: John Money. ''PAIDIKA: The Journal of {{Not a typo|Paedophilia}}'', Spring&amp;nbsp;1991, vol.&amp;nbsp;2, no.&amp;nbsp;3, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Story of John / Joan"&gt;Cited online in John Colapinto,[http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/yoonh/psy3135/articles/Colapinto_1997_part2.pdf 'The True Story of John / Joan',] ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' December&amp;nbsp;1997: 54–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money held the view that affectional pedophilia is caused by a surplus of parental love that became erotic, and is not a behavioral disorder. Rather, he took the position that [[heterosexuality]] is another example of a societal and therefore superficial, ideological concept.&lt;ref name="paidika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Story of John / Joan"/&gt;

'''Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR)''' is an organization in [[Kuwait]] which engages in scientific and applied research for several purposes, including preserving the environment, serving the economy, advising the government of scientific issues, and others.

==History==
KISR was established in 1967 by the [[Saudi Aramco|Arabian Oil Company]].&lt;ref name=nira&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR)|url=http://www.nira.or.jp/past/ice/nwdtt/2005/DAT/1209.html|publisher=NIRA|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was founded to carry out applied research in [[petroleum]], [[arid-zone agriculture]] and [[marine biology]]. In 1973, an [[amiri decree]] was made by [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] to organize KISR under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers. The objectives of KISR were also reorganized.  Another amiri decree was made in 1981 to establish KISR as an independent public institution although it was launched as a semi-official entity.&lt;ref name=nira/&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Petroleum Research and Studies Center (PRSC) of the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) was established in 2000. The Center was originally a division of KISR under the name “Division of Petroleum, Petrochemicals and Materials”. The Petroleum Division had been providing services and research studies for Kuwait and the regional petroleum industry for over 25 years. The Division was established in 1967 with the main aim of conducting research and providing consultancy and technical support to the local industry.

The main goal of PRSC is to become an R&amp;D arm for the petroleum industry in the State of Kuwait. PRSC provides applied research projects and technical services for the Petroleum Industry. PRSC also works to acquire new technologies for the oil industry in order to enhance the overall development in Kuwait. The Center is a source of information and provides technical on-job formal training for its research staff as well as oil sector staff. The PRSC is staffed with personnel in a wide spectrum of technical fields related to oil production, petroleum refining, corrosion and petrochemicals.

'''The PRSC focuses its research work and technical studies on:'''

* Petroleum Production
* Petroleum Refining
* Polymer and Petrochemicals
* Corrosion and Materials Science
* Health, Safety &amp; Environment

PRSC is located in the city of Ahmadi with sixteen research facilities and two large halls for pilot plants. The PRSC has also managed KOC’s Central Core Store Laboratories since 1997. In addition, PRSC manages several field and mobile laboratories.

== Stevens's typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article titled "On the theory of scales of measurement".&lt;ref name="Stevens 1946"/&gt; In that article, Stevens claimed that all [[measurement]] in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called "nominal," "ordinal," "interval," and "ratio," unifying both "[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]" (which are described by his "nominal" type) and "[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]" (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and [[R. Duncan Luce]] (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;395) wrote:
{{quote|S. S. Stevens (1946, 1951, 1975) claimed that what counted was having an interval or ratio scale. Subsequent research has given meaning to this assertion, but given his attempts to invoke scale type ideas it is doubtful if he understood it himself&amp;nbsp;... no measurement theorist I know accepts Stevens's broad definition of measurement&amp;nbsp;... in our view, the only sensible meaning for 'rule' is empirically testable laws about the attribute.}}

==== Comparison ====
To give a better overview the values in 'Mathematical Operators', 'Advanced operations' and 'Central tendency' are only the ones this level of measurement introduces. The complete list includes the values of previous levels. This is inverted for the 'Measure property'.

=== Nominal level ===
The nominal type differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the [[Constructivist epistemology|construction of classifications]] as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship:  for example, a [[globally unique identifier]].

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Nominal measures are based on sets and  depend on categories, a la Aristotle: {{cite web |url=http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/gmartin/geog476/Lecture/BeySt.htm |title=Beyond Stevens: A revised approach to measurement for geographic information |first=Nicholas |last=Chrisman |date=March 1995 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", – pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-63-032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example. Other concrete examples are 
* in [[grammar]], the [[parts of speech]]: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, [[power projection]]: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the [[taxonomic rank]]s below domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
* in [[software engineering]], type of [[Trap (computing)|faults]]: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. The numbers in nominal measurement are assigned as labels and have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level  used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[set membership]], are the only [[non-trivial]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], i.e. the ''most common'' item, is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]] for the nominal type. On the other hand, the [[median]], i.e. the ''middle-ranked'' item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manikandan|first1=S.|title=Measures of central tendency: Median and mode|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–5|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.83300|pmc=3157145|pmid=21897729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinal scale===
{{anchor |Ordinal scale}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[IQ classification]] and other articles --&gt;
{{further|Ordinal data}}

The ordinal type allows for [[rank order]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative ''degree of difference'' between them. Examples include, on one hand, '''dichotomous''' data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring [[truth value]], and, on the other hand, '''non-dichotomous''' data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring [[opinion]].

; Central tendency
The [[median]], i.e. ''middle-ranked'', item is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]]; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of [[central tendency]] is not allowed. The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no [[Validity (logic)|validity]], but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve [[operationalization]] of variables used in [[questionnaire]]s. Most psychological data collected by [[psychometric]] instruments and tests, measuring [[cognitive]] and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |title=Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores |last1=Lord |first1=Frederic M. |last2=Novick |first2=Melvin R. |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Allan |year=1968 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading (MA) |lccn=68011394 |laysummary=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1162101 |laydate=24 June 2013 |page=21 |quote=Although, formally speaking, interval measurement can always be obtained by specification, such specification is theoretically meaningful only if it is implied by the theory and model relevant to the measurement procedure. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures |last=Sheskin |first=David J. |year=2007 |edition=Fourth |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton (FL) |isbn=978-1-58488-814-7 |page=3 |laysummary=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781584888147 |laydate=27 July 2010 |quote=Although in practice IQ and most other human characteristics measured by psychological tests (such as anxiety, introversion, self esteem, etc.) are treated as interval scales, many researchers would argue that they are more appropriately categorized as ordinal scales.

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for the ''degree of difference'' between items, but not the ratio between them. Examples include ''temperature'' with the [[degree Celsius|Celsius scale]], which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, ''date'' when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), ''percentage'' such as a percentage return on a [[stock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Ken | chapter = Introduction | title = Business Statistics: Contemporary Decision Making | publisher = Wiley | edition = 6th | date = 2010 | location = Hoboken, NJ | pages = 2–135 | isbn = 0-470-40901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''location'' in Cartesian coordinates, and ''direction'' measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20&amp;nbsp;°C cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10&amp;nbsp;°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ''ratios of differences'' can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called "scaled variables", but the formal mathematical term is an [[affine space]] (in this case an [[affine line]]).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], and [[arithmetic mean]] are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[standard deviation]]. Since one can only divide by ''differences'', one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as &lt;!--- the studentized range or. --- Error: studentized range is a ratio of a difference (range) to a root-mean-square difference (standard DEVIATION from the mean ---&gt; the [[coefficient of variation]]. More subtly, while one can define [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define [[Standardized_moment|standardized moments]], since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include [[mass]], [[length]], [[Time|duration]], [[plane angle]], [[energy]] and [[electric charge]]. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has "twice the length."  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying "how much" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or "how many" (a count). The [[Kelvin]] temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called [[absolute zero]].  &lt;!-- The zero point of the Celsius scale is at 273.15 kelvins, so Celsius is not a ratio scale. --&gt;

; Central tendency and statistical dispersion
The [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]] are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The [[studentized range]] and the [[coefficient of variation]] are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens's typology ==
While Stevens's typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986).&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Leland |journal=The American Statistician | title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |volume=47 | number=1 | year = 1993 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.2307/2684788 |publisher=American Statistical Association | jstor=2684788 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan (1986) objected to the use of the word ''measurement'' in relation to the nominal type, but Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that "the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule". However, so-called nominal measurement involves arbitrary assignment, and the "permissible transformation" is any number for any other. This is one of the points made in Lord's (1953) satirical paper ''On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1= Frederic M. |journal=American Psychologist |title = On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers |volume=8 |number=12 |date=December 1953  | pages=750–751 |doi=10.1037/h0063675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens's typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data, anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

[[L. L. Thurstone]] made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the [[law of comparative judgment]]. A common application of the law is the [[analytic hierarchy process]]. Further progress was made by [[Georg Rasch]] (1960), who developed the probabilistic [[Rasch model]] that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens's typology has been proposed. For instance, [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]] (1977), Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey&lt;ref name="Mosteller"/&gt; noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller-Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens’s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993" /&gt;

==== Chrisman's typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman &lt;ref name="Chrisman"/&gt; introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,&lt;ref name = "Wolman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement and meaningfulness in conservation science |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2006 |last=Wolman |first=Abel G |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens's "operational theory of measurement" ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens's "operational theory of measurement", which was to become definitive within psychology and the [[behavioral sciences]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the ''Ferguson committee'', published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;245) in which Stevens's [[sone]] scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

{{quote | …any law purporting to express a quantitative relation between sensation intensity and stimulus intensity is not merely false but is in fact meaningless unless and until a meaning can be given to the concept of addition as applied to sensation.}}

That is, if Stevens's ''[[sone]]'' scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of ''additive structure'' – a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] dominated the Ferguson committee's deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of [[concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

{{quote|Paraphrasing N. R. Campbell (Final Report, p.340), we may say that measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects and events according to rules (Stevens, 1946, p.677).}}

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Percy Bridgman]] (1927), whose doctrine of ''operationism'' Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens's definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Hardcastle, 1995; Michell, 1999; Moyer, 1981a,b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist [[William Rozeboom]] (1966) was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens's theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/nominal_ordinal_interval.htm|title=What is the difference between categorical, ordinal and interval variables?|work=Institute for Digital Research and Education|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as [[colorimetry]]. Hue is an interval level variable.

They also operate a common webpage, ''For The Media'', that provides free access to news releases about the latest research published in AMA journals to credentialed journalists prior to official publication dates (pre-[[News embargo|embargo]] content), as well as access to all related pre-embargo (pre-publication) news releases and video news release scripts.

Before they were rebranded as the JAMA Network in 2013, the AMA's stable of journals were referred to as ''JAMA and the Archives journals'' (for example, this is how the AMA Manual of Style formerly referred to them), because the specialty journals used to have titles on the pattern of ''Archives of [Specialty]''. 

JAMA Network recently created three new journals: ''JAMA Oncology'' in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Disis|first=Mary L.|date=April 2015|title=Announcing ''JAMA Oncology''|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2108846|journal=JAMA Oncology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.1001/jamaoncol.2014.239|issn=2374-2437|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''JAMA Cardiology'' in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonow|first=Robert O.|date=April 2016|title=''JAMA Cardiology'': A New Cardiovascular Journal|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2492413|journal=JAMA Cardiology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2015.0358|issn=2380-6583|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''JAMA Network Open'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rivara|first=Frederick P.|last2=Fihn|first2=Stephan D.|date=May 18, 2018|title=Introducing ''JAMA Network Open''|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2680413|journal=JAMA Netw Open|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=e180268|doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0268|issn=2574-3805|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Piciformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Piciformes have had their numbers quantified.

==Synopsis==
Herzog narrates over footage of the University of California at Los Angeles, "the birthplace of the Internet," then comes to the first piece of Internet equipment ever to be installed. From here, the film explores the beneficial opportunities the Internet has afforded humans.
Herzog interviews a family that has been harassed online after the death of their daughter. They express their grief.
An institute where no electronic equipment is allowed within a 3-mile radius is examined and the society of people living in this area expresses their experience. Eventually, the film comes to a group of people that are afflicted with an electromagnetism sensitivity condition who begrudgingly have to live in this area.
Then the film comes to Elon Musk and his quest to send humans to Mars. Artificial intelligence is touched upon and the film comes to focus on how robots could become replacements for human interaction in the future.

At the end of the film, Herzog poses the question to multiple interviewees, "Can the Internet dream of itself?"

'''Mittelwerk''' (German for "Central Works") was a German [[World War II]] factory built underground in the [[Kohnstein]] to avoid Allied bombing. It used slave labor from the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp to produce [[V-2]] ballistic missiles, [[V-1 flying bomb]]s, and other weapons.

==Mittelwerk GmbH==
On the night of 17/18 August 1943, RAF bombers carried out [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]] where V-2 development and production was being carried out.

On 19 October 1943, the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|German limited company]] [[:de:Mittelwerk GmbH|Mittelwerk GmbH]] was issued War Contract No. 0011-5565/43 by [[General of the Artillery (Germany)|General]] [[Emil Leeb]], head of the Army Weapons Office,&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book |last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era|year=1995|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|pages=209, 227, 267}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 12,000 [[Aggregate series#A4|A-4]] missiles at 40,000 Reichsmarks each.&lt;ref name="Garliński"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!--Initially [[V-2]] rockets were shipped to depots for storage prior to use, but faults from short-term aging required 500 partially-defective V-2s to be cannibalised, with parts returned to the Nordhausen plant.&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|227}} One such defect was that the bearing bushings of the servomechanisms swelled during storage due to moisture.

Logistic changes under the code name ''warme semmel'' ({{lang-en |warm bread}}) resulted in movement of V-2 trains directly from the Nordhausen plant to firing-unit railheads for field storage until operational batteries needed to be  resupplied.&lt;ref name="Dornberger" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A post-war German claim was that V-2 supply trains "were camouflaged so well that no one ever suspected what they were. Throughout the whole war, we never lost an entire load, though we were attacked by fighters that occasionally did some damage."&lt;ref name="Ordway" /&gt;{{Rp|221}} However, in late November 1944, Allied fighters attacked two trains carrying a total of 40 V-2s from the Nordhausen plant, and all 40 rockets were shipped back to Germany as scrap.&lt;ref name="Johnson" &gt;{{cite book

In July 1944, [[Hans Kammler]] ordered the North Works (''Nordwerke'') to use cross-tunnels 1-20 for a [[Junkers (Aircraft)#World War II|Junkers]] jet and piston engine factory, leaving cross-tunnels 21-46 for Mittelwerk GmbH. During February–April 1945, the Nordhausen plant built [[Taifun (rocket)|Taifun]] anti-aircraft missiles and [[Heinkel He 162]] jet fighters and put into operation a [[liquid oxygen]] plant.&lt;ref name=Beon/&gt; The plant was the ''Eber'' project and used equipment evacuated from the [[Blockhaus d'Éperlecques|Watten bunker]] and elsewhere to build [[The Linde Group#History|Heylandt]] liquid oxygen generators; the 15 generators were nearly complete when the site was captured.  The Mittelwerk also contained [[Oil Campaign of World War II (Targets)|equipment for producing jet fuel]],&lt;ref name=Meeting450206/&gt; and in an emergency 1944 decentralization program (named ''Geilenbergprogramm'' after [[Edmund Geilenberg]]) started the "Cuckoo" project, an underground oil plant to be "carved out of the [[:de:Himmelsburg|Himmelsburg]]" North of the Mittelwerk.&lt;ref name=Meeting450206&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date=6 February 1945 |title=Minutes of Meeting No. 45/6 |url=http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Tom%20Reels/Linked/B1870/B1870-0073-0208%20Item%204.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Enemy Oil Intelligence Committee |accessdate=22 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821144535/http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Tom%20Reels/Linked/B1870/B1870-0073-0208%20Item%204.pdf |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional plans for [[V-2 rocket]] plants (the [[Operation Bellicose|Southern Works near Friedrichshafen]] and the [[Kaiserwald concentration camp|Eastern]] [[Salaspils#World War II|Works]] near [[Riga]]) were never fulfilled.{{Rp|300}}

Although there has long been speculation about other "exotic" weaponry being constructed or stored at Mittelwerk, evidence of this is scarce. For example, [[Richard Overy]] notes in ''The Bombing War - Europe 1939-1945'' (2013): "There is some evidence that small spherical bombs containing radioactive waste were stored in the Mittelbau-Dora works [...], but it is not conclusive."&lt;ref name="Overy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Overy|first=Richard|title=The Bombing War - Europe 1939-1945|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2013|isbn=978-0-713-99561-9| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123}}

==Evacuation==
In late February 1945, the Allied Chiefs of Staff discussed a proposed attack on the Nordhausen plant with a [[napalm|highly flammable petroleum-soap mixture]]&lt;ref name=Garlinski/&gt;{{Rp|188}} that had been used in the Pacific theatre to deeply penetrate buried strongpoints and scourge them with intense heat.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
The area was attacked with conventional bombs by [[RAF Bomber Command]] on the 3 &amp; 4 April. What were believed to be barracks were attacked on 3 April but they actually contained forced labor workers. The attack of 4 April hit the barracks and the town of Nordhausen. The [[Mittelbau-Dora]] [[forced labor]] was evacuated on 4 April,&lt;ref name=Beon/&gt; and scientists evacuated to the [[National redoubt#Nazi Germany|''Alpenfestung'']] ({{lang-en|Alpine Fortress}}).  Hitler had made an order, the [[Nero Decree|"Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree"]], which ordered the destruction of any infrastructure that might be of use to the Allies&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt; but it was deliberately ignored by Speer and the Nordhausen plant was evacuated without damage.&lt;ref name=Garlinski/&gt;

==Aftermath==

|title=[[Roy Fedden|Fedden]] Mission
|quote=The Mission had been told that Nordhausen was a large underground factory, and that they would see extraordinary production methods, but they had no idea that they would be brought face-to-face with such an undertaking.  The reaction of the Mission to this visit ... was one of the utmost revulsion and disgust.  This factory is the epitome of [[megalomania]]c production and robot efficiency and layout.  Everything was ruthlessly executed with utter disregard for humanitarian considerations.  The record of Nordhausen is a most unenviable one, and we were told that 250 of the slave workers perished every day, due to overwork and malnutrition.  Some of the Mission visited a slave workers' encampment, talked to a Dutch doctor who had been there throughout the war, and saw many of the wretched inmates, who were in an apalling state, although receiving every medical attention now.  They also saw stretchers heavily saturated in blood, a room in which there was a slab on which the bodies were drained of blood, and the incinerators in which the bodies were burnt.  These are all facts which require to be seen to be fully appreciated.  This terrible and devilish place has now passed into Russian hands and it is sincerely hoped that our allies will deal with it in a proper and adequate manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee |title=The Fedden Mission to Germany |page=75 |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been warned to "expect something a little unusual in the Nordhausen area", and after previously entering the Nordhausen plant from the North through the Junkers Nordwerke, [[U.S. 3rd Armored Division]] and [[104th Division (United States)|104th Infantry Divisions]] reached the city of Nordhausen on 11 April 1945 and discovered the dead and sick of the [[Mittelbau-Dora|Boelcke Kaserne]]&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;{{Rp|264}} barracks.&lt;ref name=McGovern&gt;

===Special Mission V-2===

On 22 May 1945,&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt; US Army [[Operation Paperclip#Similar operations|Special Mission V-2]] shipped the first trainload of rocket parts for use in projects such as [[Operation Sandy]], [[Operation Blossom]] and, at the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]], the [[Hermes project]].
The [[Nordhausen]] area was to become part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet zone of occupation]], and Soviet Army officers arrived to tour the Nordhausen plant on 26 May 1945.&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;  In June 1945, the US Army left the Nordhausen plant as required by [[Morgenthau Plan#JCS 1067|JCS Directive 1067/14]], with parts, machine tools, and documents (including blueprints for the projected [[Aggregate series#A9|A-9]]/A-10 intercontinental missile) left for the Soviets.&lt;ref name=McGovern/&gt;  The [[Red Army]] occupied the Mittelwerk on 5 July 1945&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt; and demolished both of the entrances of the tunnel system in mid-1948.&lt;ref name=Beon/&gt;

===The Dora War Crimes Trial===
{{Main|Dora Trial}}

[[File:Dora-defendants.jpeg|thumb|180px|16 of the 19 Dora Defendants in 1947]]
The 1947 [[Dora Trial]] convicted [[SS]] Officers and [[Kapo (concentration camp)|concentration camp kapos]], while 3 scientists of the [[V-2]] rocket program were implicated (2 after the trial) and exonerated of [[List of Nazi war criminals|Nazi war crimes]] at the Mittelwerk.  On 19 May 1947, the former head of the Mittelwerk facility, [[Georg Rickhey]], was extradited to Germany from [[Wright Field]] in the U.S. and acquitted of war crimes at the [[Dora Trial]].  [[Arthur Rudolph]], after immigrating to the U.S. and playing key roles in the Pershing missile and Apollo programs, was forced to renounce his U.S. citizenship and return to Germany; the West German government, citing the statute of limitations, never charged him and eventually granted him citizenship. [[Wernher von Braun]], the Technical Director of a separate facility at [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]], visited the Mittelwerk on 25 January 1944,&lt;ref name=Garlinski&gt;{{cite book |last=Garliński|first=Józef|authorlink=Józef Garliński|title=Hitler's Last Weapons: The Underground War against the V1 and V2|year=1978|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|pages=109, 194}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1991 author alleged he witnessed Mittelwerk and [[Buchenwald]] war crimes.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

===Ruins===
After a new entrance tunnel had been dug to former rail Tunnel A in 1995, 710 meters of the tunnel system were opened for visitors.  Large parts of the system are flooded by ground water, while other parts have collapsed.  After the [[reunification of Germany]] the tunnels were frequently looted by treasure seekers who gained access via the private mine in the north of the [[Kohnstein]].

[[Willi Kramer]], a German archaeologist and scientist who dived in the tunnel system in 1992 and 1998, estimated that 70 tons of material was stolen. Access through these entrances was not secured until 2004, when the mine went into insolvency.&lt;ref name=Christ&gt;{{cite web |first=Sebastian |last=Christian |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fspiegelspecial%2F0%2C1518%2C415087%2C00.html&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8 |title=Überreste eines Mordregimes |language=German |work=Science |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=March 2006 |quote=google translate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nahal Amud''' ({{lang-he|נחל עמוד}}), also known as the [[Wadi]] Amud, is a [[stream]] in the [[Upper Galilee]] region of [[Israel]] that flows into the [[Sea of Galilee]].
==History==
[[File:Nahal Amud pillar.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The namesake pillar of Nahal Amud]]
The source of the stream, Ramat Dalton, is located 800 meters above sea level. Its [[drainage basin]] includes the peaks of [[Birya Fortress|Mount Canaan]] (955 meters) and [[Mount Meron]] (1,204 meters) and flows south through eastern Galilee to the northwest part of the Sea of Galilee – a height of less than 200 meters below [[sea level]].

The stream is named after a [[Column|pillar]] that rises high above ground and is located near a channel of the stream near Kibbutz [[Hukok]]. The gorge that forms the channel at this point holds many caves once inhabited by ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and later by [[Neanderthal Man]] such as the cave at [[Zuttiyeh]] and the [[Amud cave]]. They were the object of the first [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropological]] excavations in [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1925–1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1974_num_2_1_4180 Excavations in the Wadi Amud]&lt;/ref&gt; The caves contained [[hominin]] remains as well as [[Mousterian]] and [[Acheulean]] artifacts.

Most of Nahal Amud (8923 [[dunam]]s) was declared a nature reserve in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of National Parks and Nature Reserves|url=http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|language=Hebrew|publisher=Israel Nature and Parks Authority|accessdate=2010-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007095221/http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], a '''nonlocal Lagrangian''' is a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], a type of [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}[\phi(x)] &lt;/math&gt; containing terms that are ''nonlocal'' in the fields &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. not polynomials or functions of the fields or their derivatives evaluated at a single point in the space of dynamical parameters (e.g. [[space-time]]). Examples of such nonlocal Lagrangians might be:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_x \phi(x))^2 - \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi(x)^2 + \phi(x) \int{\frac{\phi(y)}{(x - y)^2} \,d^ny}.&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}(1 + \frac{m^2}{\partial^2})\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;S = \int dt \,d^dx \left[\psi^*(i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mu)\psi - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla \psi^*\cdot \nabla \psi\right] - \frac{1}{2}\int dt \,d^dx \,d^dy \, V(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{x}) \psi^*(\mathbf{x}) \psi(\mathbf{x}) \psi^*(\mathbf{y}) \psi(\mathbf{y}).&lt;/math&gt;
*The [[Wess–Zumino–Witten model|Wess–Zumino–Witten action]].

[[Action (physics)|Actions]] obtained from nonlocal Lagrangians are called ''nonlocal actions''. The actions appearing in the fundamental theories of physics, such as the [[Standard Model]], are local actions; nonlocal actions play a part in theories that attempt to go beyond the Standard Model and also in some [[effective field theory|effective field theories]]. Nonlocalization of a local action is also an essential aspect of some [[regularization (physics)|regularization]] procedures. [[Noncommutative quantum field theory]] also gives rise to nonlocal actions.

'''Online consultations''' or e-consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the [[Internet]].  They are one form of [[online deliberation]]. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants.  Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a [[policy]] is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities.  This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.

As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy.  The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as [[e-democracy]], referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and [[eGovernment]], pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online.  Online consultation is an extension of these concepts.  Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.

The [[California Report Card]] (CRC) facilitates online consultation, working to support collaboration between citizens and the government though the Internet. [[Gavin Newsom]], Lt. Governor of California, and the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] jointly launched the CRC in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Ken|last2=Newsom|first2=Gavin|title=Let's amplify California's collective intelligence|url=http://citris-uc.org/lets-amplify-californias-collective-intelligence-op-ed-ken-goldberg-gavin-newsom-california-report-card/|website=citris-uc.org|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC allows for Californians to vote online on six timely issues. The site then redirects users to an electronic "cafe" using [[Principal Component Analysis]]. In the "cafe", participants can textually submit their own suggestions and assess the ideas of other users. The CRC offers a means of connecting the public to the California government. 

While this definition is framed in the [[Canada|Canadian]] context, other countries like the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Denmark]], [[Scotland]], and [[Australia]] can also be considered leaders in the field.  These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The [[European Union]] also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the [[United Nations]] and its Specialized Agencies. [[FAO|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN]] hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.

==Channels==
Online consultations and engagement activities can utilize: 
*[[Website]]s, [[discussion board]]s, and [[electronic mailing list]]s, which have the ability to aid in policy development by providing the public with pertinent information and engaging them in order to extract feedback on issues. 
*[[Weblog]]s and real time [[online chat]] that can often put the public in direct contact with government officials, such as their MP, deputy or other political figure with whom they can share opinion and concerns

'''Protoscholastic writing''' re-introduced [[Space (punctuation)|space]] between words into the punctuation of western languages. It replaced [[Liturgy|liturgical]] models starting in the 7th century and by the 14th century it was the standard. The protoscholastic mode of writing was primarily introduced for faster decoding of written texts for scholars, rather than for oral communication (the focus of liturgical models).&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul Henry.

'''Robert Joseph''' "'''Bob'''" '''Cenker''' (born November 5, 1948) is an American [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]] and [[electrical engineer]], aerospace systems consultant, and former astronaut. Cenker worked for 18 years at [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#RCA Astro Electronics|RCA Astro-Electronics]], and its successor company [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#GE Astro Space|GE Astro Space]], on a variety of spacecraft projects. He spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites, including the Satcom, Spacenet and GStar programs.

In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the twenty-fourth mission of [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Space Shuttle program]], the seventh flight of [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']], designated as mission [[STS-61-C]]. Cenker served as a [[Payload Specialist]],{{efn|name=Category}} representing [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#RCA Astro Electronics|RCA Astro-Electronics]]. This mission was the final flight before the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]], which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA's Payload Specialist program for even longer. As a result, Cenker's mission was called "The End of Innocence" for the Shuttle program. Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the commercial aerospace field. Since his flight,  he has made numerous public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle program, in the United States, as well as internationally.

==Early life and education==
Cenker was born on November 5, 1948, and raised near [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]].{{R|Facts}}{{R|JSC}} He started his education at St. Fidelis College Seminary in [[Herman, Pennsylvania]], leaving in 1962.{{R|Fidelis}} In 1970 Cenker enrolled at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]{{R|Pennlive}} where he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace Engineering]]. He continued his studies at Penn State and earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1973, also in Aerospace Engineering.{{R|Kennedy}}{{R|JSC}} Cenker earned a second Master of Science degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Rutgers University]] in 1977.{{R|Kennedy}}

==Pre-spaceflight career==
Cenker worked for 18 years at [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#RCA Astro Electronics|RCA Astro-Electronics]] and its successor company [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#GE Astro Space|GE Astro Space]]. Cenker worked on [[Hardware architecture|hardware design]] and [[systems design]] concerning [[satellite]] [[attitude control]]. He also worked on [[Orbit|in-orbit]] operations, as well as spacecraft [[ATLO|assembly, test, and pre-launch operations]]. He spent two years on the [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Satellite navigation|navigation satellite]] program, but spent most of his career working on commercial [[communications satellite]]s.{{R|JSC}}

Cenker's positions included integration and test manager for the [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom D and E]] spacecraft, where he was responsible for all launch site activities. He also served as [[Satellite bus|spacecraft bus]] manager on the [[Spacenet]]/GStar programs. He was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft could interface with multiple rockets, including the [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]], [[Space Shuttle]], and [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] [[launch vehicle]]s.{{R|JSC}}

As an incentive for a spacecraft owner to contract with NASA to use a Shuttle launch instead of an unmanned, commercial launch system, [[NASA]] permitted contracting companies to apply for a Payload Specialist seat on the same mission. When RCA contracted with NASA to launch Satcom Ku-1, [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems#RCA Astro Electronics|RCA Astro-Electronics']] manager of systems engineering for the Satcom-K program&lt;ref name="OMI-Pt1"/&gt; Bob Cenker, and his co-worker [[STS-61-C#Backup crew|Gerard Magilton]], were selected to train as [[Payload Specialist]]s so that one of the pair could accompany Satcom Ku-1 into space.{{R|61C}}{{R|GM}}{{R|BTR}} Cenker and Magilton trained with career astronauts as well as other Payload and Mission Specialists, including those scheduled for the next scheduled flight, that of the ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' mission, [[STS-51-L]].{{R|GM}}{{R|TIS}}

This flight of ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' was originally scheduled to occur in August 1985, but the timeline slipped. In July 1985 the payload was finalized to include the RCA satellite, and Cenker was assigned to the mission, now designated as [[STS-61-C]]. Magilton was assigned as the back-up.{{R|OMI-Pt1}}

Prior to its successful launch, ''Columbia'' had several aborted launch attempts, including one on January 6 which was "one of the most hazardous in the Shuttle’s operational history"&lt;ref name="OMI-Pt2"/&gt; to that point. As documented in Crewmember Bill Nelson's book "Mission: An American Congressman's Voyage to Space", and as reported in Spaceflight Insider, "The launch attempt on Jan. 6, 1986 was halted at T-31 seconds. The weather was perfect for the scheduled launch at dawn, but a failure of a liquid oxygen drain valve prevented it to close properly. The valve was then closed manually, but not quickly enough to prevent a low temperature in one fuel line." However, Nelson says that what really happened was that "the valve did not close because it was not commanded to close",{{R|Jacques}} and that it was later determined that the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]], investigating the series of mistakes that forced this second scrub, recognized that the problems were personnel-related, caused by fatigue from overwork: One potentially catastrophic human error occurred 4 minutes 55 seconds before the scheduled launch of mission 61-C on January 6, 1986. According to a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] Space Operations Company incident report, 18,000 pounds of [[liquid oxygen]] were inadvertently drained from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|Shuttle external fuel tank]] due to operator error. Fortunately, the liquid oxygen flow dropped the main engine inlet temperature below the acceptable limit causing a launch hold, but only 31 seconds before lift-off. As the report states, "Had the mission not been scrubbed, the ability of the orbiter to reach a defined orbit may have been significantly impacted.{{R|Jacques}}

There was another near-catastrophic launch abort three days later. Referring to the January 9 abort, pilot Charlie Bolden later stated that it "...would have been catastrophic, because the engine would have exploded had we launched.{{R|OMI-Pt2}} In all, it took a record eight attempts to get ''Columbia'' off the ground.{{R|Jacques}} ''Columbia'' finally launched and achieved orbit on January 12, 1986, with a full crew of seven. Along with Cenker, the crew included [[Robert L. Gibson|Robert L. "Hoot" Gibson]], future NASA Administrator [[Charles F. Bolden]], [[George D. Nelson]], [[Steven A. Hawley]], [[Franklin R. Chang-Diaz]], and [[US Representative]] [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]].{{R|Kit}}{{R|Impossible}}{{R|Impossible2}} Cenker and his crewmates traveled over 2.5 million miles in 98 [[Earth orbits|orbits]] aboard Columbia and logged over 146 hours in [[Outer space|space]].{{R|KSC}}[[File:STS-61-C SATCOM Ku-1 deployment.jpg|thumbnail|left|RCA SATCOM Ku-1 deployment]]
During the six-day mission, January 12–18, Cenker performed a variety of physiological tests, operated a primary experiment – an infrared imaging camera – and assisted with the deployment of [[SES Americom|RCA Americom's]] Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective.{{R|Kit}}{{R|KSC}}{{R|KU-1}} Satcom Ku-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its designated [[geostationary|geostationary orbital position]] at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the Space Shuttle program. In a 2014 video of the "Tell Me a Story" series titled "Close My Eyes &amp; Drift Away", posted to the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] [[YouTube]] channel, Cenker tells a humorous story regarding a [[Weightlessness|zero-g]] sleeping problem he faced on his mission.{{R|Story}}

The next Shuttle launch, ten days after the return of ''Columbia'', resulted in the destruction of the ''Challenger'' with the loss of all aboard, including Cenker's counterpart from [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]], civilian crew member and Payload Specialist [[Greg Jarvis]].{{R|51L}} Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission "The End of Innocence" for the Shuttle program.{{R|OMI-Pt1}}{{R|OMI-Pt2}}

Following the Challenger disaster, the Shuttle fleet was grounded until 1988.{{R|STS-26}} Even after Shuttle missions resumed, civilian Payload Specialists like Cenker were excluded until the Payload Specialist program was reinstated on December 2, 1990 when [[Samuel T. Durrance]], an [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] astrophysicist and [[Ronald A. Parise]], a [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] astronomer, flew aboard [[STS-35]].{{R|Delay}} By that time, RCA had been purchased by [[General Electric]], and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. Following two additional ownership transitions, the facility was closed in 1998. As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space.{{R|AstroRecords}}

NASA's Payload Specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard ''Challenger''), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and other civilians such as [[Teacher in Space Project|Teacher in Space]] [[Christa McAuliffe]] (also killed aboard ''Challenger''). Even the flight of former [[Mercury Seven|Mercury astronaut]] and US Senator [[John Glenn]] was questioned.{{R|Glenn}} The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.{{efn|name=Category|There was another Space Shuttle astronaut category sometimes confused with that of Payload Specialist: While Payload Specialists were non-NASA personnel selected for a single specific mission, [[Mission Specialist]]s were selected as astronauts first, and then subsequently assigned to flights as mission needs dictated.}}{{efn|A 1986 post-''Challenger'' article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reviewed the issue, reporting that as far back as 1982, NASA was concerned with finding reasonable justifications for flying civilians on the Shuttle as was directed by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration. The Post article says that "A review of records and interviews with past and present NASA and government officials shows the civilian program's controversial background, with different groups pushing for different approaches." The article continues: "Author [[Tom Wolfe]], who chronicled the early days of the space program in ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]],'' wrote after the ''Challenger'' explosion that support for the citizen program, and therefore McAuliffe's place aboard the shuttle, was part of an insiders' battle. NASA civilians, pitting themselves against the professional astronauts, used the program for the 'dismantling of Astropower,' which Wolfe described as 'the political grip the original breed of [[Fighter pilot|fighter-pilot]] [[Test pilot|test-pilot]] astronauts had on NASA.' "{{R|Pincus}}}}

==Post-spaceflight==

Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the civilian aerospace field. Cenker's last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an [[Terra (satellite)|EOS spacecraft]] program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding micro-gravity research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported [[systems engineering]] and [[systems architecture]] studies for various spacecraft projects, including [[Small satellite|smallsats]], military [[communications satellites]], and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for [[Motorola]] on [[Iridium]], and launch readiness for the [[Globalstar]] constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for [[INTELSAT]] on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for [[AT&amp;T]] on [[Telstar]] 401 and 402, for [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild-Matra]]  on SPAS III, for [[Martin Marietta]] on [[Astra 1B]], [[Yuri (satellite)|BS-3N]], [[STS-51#Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS)|ACTS]], and for the [[Lockheed Martin]] Series 7000 communications satellites.{{R|JSC}}

In 2017, Cenker's STS-61C crewmate former [[US Senator]] [[Bill Nelson]] spoke at a session of the [[US House of Representatives]]. In an address, titled "Mission to Mars and Space Shuttle Flight 30th Anniversary", he read into the [[Congressional Record]] the details of the mission of STS-61C, as well as the names and function of each crew member including Cenker.{{R|Congressional}}{{rp|page S45}}

Cenker continues to make periodic public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle astronaut program,{{R|VfS}}{{R|Patch}}{{R|WClub}}{{R|PressRelease}} including one at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in March 2017.{{R|Kennedy}} In June 2017, Cenker traveled to [[Scotland]] where he and astronaut [[Doug Wheelock]] gave a series of talks to children in [[Fife]] schools as part of the [[Careers Scotland Space School|Scottish Space School]].{{R|Scotsman}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">'''Rule induction''' is an area of [[machine learning]] in which formal rules are extracted from a set of observations.  The rules extracted may represent a full [[scientific model]] of the data, or merely represent local [[patterns]] in the data.

== Paradigms ==

Some major rule induction paradigms are:
*[[Association rule learning]] algorithms (e.g., Agrawal)
*[[Decision rules|Decision rule]] algorithms (e.g., Quinlan 1987)
*[[Hypothesis testing]] algorithms (e.g., RULEX)
*[[Horn clause]] induction
*[[Version spaces]]
*[[Rough set]] rules
*[[Inductive Logic Programming]]
*Boolean decomposition (Feldman)

== Algorithms ==

Some rule induction algorithms are:

The '''short-tailed chinchilla''' (''Chinchilla chinchilla'',&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonReeder2005&gt;Woods, C. A. and Kilpatrick, C. W. (2005). Infraorder ''Hystricognathi''. In: D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder (eds), Mammal Species of the World, pp. 1538-1599. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as ''Chinchilla brevicaudata''), also called the Bolivian, Peruvian, or royal chinchilla, is an [[endangered species]] of [[rodent]]. Their original range included the [[Andes Mountains]] of Argentina, Chile, [[Peru]], and Bolivia. The rodents were exploited for their luxurious fur, causing their numbers to dwindle greatly.

==Characteristics==
Chinchillas’ bodies measure between 28 and 49&amp;nbsp;cm long and weigh around 38 to 50 ounces.  They have short front legs and long, powerful hind legs that aid in climbing and jumping.  Short-tailed chinchillas have thicker necks and shoulders and have much shorter tails than their long-tailed relatives.&lt;ref name="Chinchillas"&gt;Animal-World. (2007) http://animal-world.com/encyclo/critters/chinchilla/chinchilla.php. accessed on April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
In the wild, chinchillas burrow under rocks or in the ground for shelter.  They mostly live in colder climates for which they are well adapted because of their dense fur. They mostly feed upon vegetation. They are social animals living in colonies or herds; chinchillas usually have litters of one or two offspring.

==Commercialization==
Many chinchillas are bred in captivity for their fur, which is very fine and dense, and is in high demand in the [[fur industry]].  Commercial hunting began in 1829 and increased every year, by about half a million skins annually, as fur and skin demand increased in the United States and Europe.  “The continuous and intense harvesting rate, however, was not sustainable and the number of chinchillas hunted declined until the resource was considered economically extinct by 1917".&lt;ref name="Jiménez"&gt;Jiménez, Jamie E. (1995) ''The Extirpation and Current Status of the Wild Chinchillas'' Chinchilla langigera ''and'' C. brevicaudata. Gainesville, FL. [http://www.chincare.com/HealthLifestyle/JEJ/JEJExtirpation1995.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunting chinchillas became illegal in 1929, but laws were not effectively enforced until 1983.&lt;ref name="Jiménez"/&gt;

==Conservation==
Because of the impending extinction of short-tailed chinchillas, conservation measures were implemented in the 1890s in Chile.  However, these measures were unregulated.  The 1910 treaty between Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Peru brought the first international efforts to ban hunting and commercialization of chinchillas.  Unfortunately, this effort led to great price increases, thus led to the further decline of the remaining populations.  The first successful protection law passed in Chile was not until 1929.  Today, both the short-tailed and [[long-tailed chinchilla]]s are listed as “endangered” both in Chile and by the IUCN.&lt;ref name="Jiménez2"&gt;Jiménez, J.E. 1995. ''Conservation of the last wild chinchilla (''Chinchilla lanigera'') archipelago: a metapopulation approach''. Vida Silvestre Neotropical 4:89-97.
&lt;/ref&gt;    Because of successful reproduction in captive environments, chinchillas are less hunted in the wild.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3786">In applied probability theory, the '''Simon model''' is a class of [[stochastic model]]s that results in a [[power-law]] distribution function.  It was proposed by [[Herbert A. Simon]]&lt;ref name=simon&gt;Simon, H. A., 1955, Biometrika 42, 425.&lt;/ref&gt; to account for the wide range of empirical [[Frequency distribution|distributions]] following a power-law. It models the dynamics of a system of elements with associated counters (e.g., words and their frequencies in texts, or nodes in a network and their connectivity &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;). In this model the dynamics of the system is based on constant growth via addition of new elements (new instances of words) as well as incrementing the counters (new occurrences of a word) at a rate proportional to their current values.

== Description ==
To model this type of network growth as described above, Bornholdt and Ebel&lt;ref name=BE&gt;Bornholdt, S. and H. Ebel, Phys. Rev. E 64 (2001) 035104(R).&lt;/ref&gt; considered a network with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and each node with connectivities &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. These nodes
form classes &lt;math&gt;[k]&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(k)&lt;/math&gt; nodes with identical connectivity &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
Repeat the following steps:

(i) With probability &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; add a new node and attach a link to it from an arbitrarily chosen node.

(ii) With probability &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; add one link from an arbitrary node to a node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of class &lt;math&gt;[k]&lt;/math&gt; chosen with a probability proportional to &lt;math&gt;k f(k)&lt;/math&gt;.

For this stochastic process, Simon found a stationary solution exhibiting [[power-law]] scaling, &lt;math&gt;P(k) \propto k^{- \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, with exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1 + \frac{1}{1- \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
(i) [[Barabási-Albert (BA) model]] can be mapped to the subclass &lt;math&gt;\alpha= 1/2&lt;/math&gt; of Simon's model, when using the simpler probability for a node being
connected to another node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with connectivity &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P(\mathrm{new\ link\ to\ } i) \propto k_i &lt;/math&gt; (same as the preferential attachment at [[BA model]]). In other words, the Simon model describes a general class of stochastic processes that can result in a [[scale-free network]], appropriate to capture [[Zipf's law|Pareto and Zipf's laws]].

(ii) The only free parameter of the model &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; reflects the relative
growth of number of nodes versus the number of links. In general &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has small values; therefore, the scaling exponents can be predicted to be &lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx 2&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, Bornholdt and Ebel&lt;ref name="BE"/&gt; studied the linking dynamics of World Wide Web, and predicted the scaling exponent as &lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx 2.1&lt;/math&gt;, which was consistent with observation.

(iii) The interest in the scale-free model comes from its ability to describe the topology of complex networks. The Simon model does not have an underlying network structure, as it was designed to describe events whose frequency follows a [[power-law]]. Thus network measures going beyond the [[degree distribution]] such
as the [[average path length]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070128124135/http://austria.phys.nd.edu/netwiki/index.php/Graph_Spectra spectral properties], and [[clustering coefficient]], cannot be obtained from this mapping.

The Simon model is related to [[generalized scale-free model]]s with growth and preferential attachment properties. For more reference, see.&lt;ref name=BA&gt;Barabási, A.-L., and R. Albert, Statistical mechanics of complex networks, Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol 74, page 47-97, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AM&gt;Amaral, L. A. N., A. Scala, M. Barthelemy, and H. E. Stanley, 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. '''97''', 11149.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Space Race''''' is a [[BBC]] [[docudrama]] series first shown in Britain on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] between 14 September and 5 October 2005, chronicling the major events and characters in the American/Soviet [[space race]] up to the first landing of a man on the moon. It focuses on [[Sergei Korolev]], the Soviet chief rocket designer, and [[Wernher von Braun]], his American counterpart. The series was a joint effort between British, German, American and Russian production teams.

==Reception==

===Awards===
*[[Royal Television Society]] 2006
**Nominated: [[RTS Television Award]] for Best Production Design (Drama): [[Alan Spalding]]
*[[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]] 2006
**Won: Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best Presentation (TV &amp; Radio)

==Episodes==

===Episode one: "Race For Rockets" (1944&amp;ndash;1949)===
We see the results of Wernher von Braun's work on the [[V-2]] for the [[Nazism|Nazis]] at [[Mittelwerk]] and [[Peenemünde]], and his final activities within Germany during the last years of the [[Second World War]], as both American and Soviet forces race to capture German rocket technology.  When the Americans gain the upper hand by recovering von Braun and most of his senior staff, along with all their technical documents and much other materiel, we see Sergei Korolev's release from the [[Gulag]] to act as the Soviets' rocketry expert alongside former colleague [[Valentin Glushko]], and how he is set to work bringing Soviet rocket technology up to date with that of von Braun, working with what material and personnel are left after von Braun's escape to the US.

===Episode two: "Race For Satellites" (1953&amp;ndash;1958)===
As the [[Cold War]] intensifies, Korolev is asked to build a rocket capable of carrying a five-ton [[warhead]] to America - he designs and constructs the [[R-7 Semyorka]], the first [[ICBM]], and is later allowed to use it to launch the first [[satellite]], [[Sputnik 1]], quickly following up with the rushed [[Sputnik 2]]. Meanwhile, von Braun struggles to persuade the US government to allow him to launch his own satellite - after Sputnik's launch and the failure of the US Navy to launch a [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard satellite]], he is finally allowed to launch the first American satellite, [[Explorer 1]].  Korolev announces that the Americans have evened the score and that they are in a space race, which they intend to win.  At the end of the episode, two men are shown walking down a corridor, one of them wearing a spacesuit.

===Episode three: "Race For Survival" (1959&amp;ndash;1961)===
Both the Americans and Soviets are planning manned space flight, and we see both sides preparing to do so with the development of the [[Vostok programme]] (USSR) and [[Project Mercury]] (USA).  As well as basic details about the capsules and their delivery vehicles, we also see some of the selection and training of the Russian cosmonauts, and rather less of that of their counterparts in the US. After difficulties and failures on both sides, including a side story about a catastrophic failure of one of the first Russian ballistic missiles, the Soviets succeed in putting [[Yuri Gagarin]] into space first, with the Americans putting [[Alan Shepard]] up shortly afterwards.

===Episode four: "Race For The Moon" (1964&amp;ndash;1969)===
Both sides now plan to put a man on the [[Moon]] - the Americans pull ahead in the space race with [[Project Gemini]], but then suffer a disaster with the [[Apollo 1]] fire.  Meanwhile, despite a few notable successes such as the first [[space walk]] by [[Alexei Leonov]], the Soviet space programme struggles to keep up amid internal strife.  Glushko and Korolev permanently fall out in an argument about fuel;  Korolev turns to [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] to develop engines instead.  Kuznetsov delivers the [[NK-33]], very efficient but much less powerful than the Americans' [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]].  The Soviet program suffers further blows when Korolev dies during surgery, Gagarin dies in a jet crash, [[Soyuz 1]] crashes and kills [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]], and the prototype booster for the moon shot, the [[N-1 rocket]], fails to successfully launch. In America, von Braun has continuing difficulties with the [[Saturn V]], especially combustion instability in the large F-1 engine, but these are ultimately overcome almost by brute force at great expense, and the rocket successfully launches the first manned lunar mission, [[Apollo 8]], and the first manned lunar landing, [[Apollo 11]].  The final episode finishes with brief textual summaries of the remaining careers of the various people involved.

==Production details==
BBC filmed the ''Space Race'' in and around the town of Sibiu, [[Transylvania]], a region of Romania. Romania has signed the EU co-production treaty which allows for EU co-productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romfilmpromotion.ro/publications.php#whychoose Romanian film promotion: why choose Romania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220005746/http://www.romfilmpromotion.ro/publications.php |date=20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other locations, Romania attracted BBC with unspoiled natural locations, experienced crews and moderately priced production facilities.

The series was filmed with the Panasonic SDX 900 [[DVCPRO#DVCPRO|DVCPro&amp;nbsp;50]] professional camcorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmi.tv/equipment/product-details/?pid=11 DVC Pro 50 Camcorder SDX-900] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230202412/http://www.vmi.tv/equipment/product-details/?pid=11 |date=30 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed keeping to the speedy shooting schedule and provided the ‘gritty’ look appropriate to the time period. Shot in widescreen 25fps progressive mode, the series deliver rich, filmic feel, which compares favourably with high definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmi.tv/HD-today/back-issues/HDTodayno5.pdf Rome wasn't shot in a day, it was shot in HDX!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227122236/http://www.vmi.tv/HD-today/back-issues/HDTodayno5.pdf |date=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaccuracies and errors==
Most of the historical and technological data presented in the series is heavily simplified, and sometimes contains outright untruths or errors.  The series would best be described and interpreted as giving a general impression of the subject matter, rather than rigorous factual account.

=== Factual errors ===
* An early scene shows Serov executing Polish resistance fighters who discovered a V-2. Nothing of the sort happened. A team of British and Polish soldiers and scientists formed a mission to retrieve a fallen V-2 near [[Blizna]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Rockets and People, by Boris Chertok&lt;/ref&gt;
* Footage showing early rocket club activity of von Braun actually shows Reinhold Tiling's rockets, a rival to the VfR club that von Braun belonged to.  The VfR rockets were crude engines attached to sticks.
* Key figures are entirely missing from the presented history. [[Andrei Tupolev]], [[Vladimir Chelomei]] and [[Mikhail Kuzmich Yangel'|Mikhail Yangel]] are also conspicuously absent, for example, even in the sequence depicting the [[Nedelin disaster|disastrous explosion]] of Yangel's prototype [[R-16 (missile)|R-16]] ICBM. In the series, Glushko is generally identified with all rocket projects competing with Korolev within the USSR, even those for which he had only partial responsibility or was a subcontractor.
* The narrator said twice that the Mercury-Redstone could put an astronaut into orbit. In reality, the best the [[Mercury-Redstone 3|Redstone]] rocket could do was putting an astronaut into a 15-minute "suborbital" ballistic trajectory, which peaked out around 120 miles up. The first orbital flight of an American astronaut did not occur until 20 February 1962, when the Mercury capsule was put into orbit with a more powerful [[Mercury-Atlas 6|Atlas]] rocket. Indeed, NASA report TMX-53107 called Mercury-Redstone "a prelude to an orbital flight program" (pg 1-2). However, at episode 3, "Race for Survival", is at pains to disclaim orbital capability. The narrator says (from 8'46" to 8' 51") only that the V-derived Redstone "has only a tenth of the power of Korolev's rocket. Barely enough to put a man into space." This of course is why ''Freedom 7'', Alan Shepard's Redstone-launched capsule, was suborbital.
*The narrator states that Gagarin flies "over a sleeping America" even though Vostok's flightpath did not take the craft anywhere near North America, except the Aleutian Islands. Gagarin did say "I'm over America", though. America, of course, includes South America and Vostok 1's flight path did just touch America in that sense. Gagarin spoke at night, while still over the Pacific, but only three minutes from the Straits of Magellan; a little earlier he was near Hawaii, which had become one of the United States of America less than two years earlier.
*Episode One features a map of Europe with wrongly indicated countries. Switzerland is labeled Austria, Austria is labeled Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic is labeled Hungary.
*Episode One featuring the capture of Wernher von Braun, he had a bad fracture of his arm, which was not depicted.
*In Episode Two the narrator states twice that the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket has 32 engines. This is not entirely correct. The R-7 and its [[R-7 (rocket family)|successors]] have four side boosters and a core booster. Each side booster has a single rocket engine with four combustion chambers, two vernier combustion chambers, and one set of turbopumps. The central core has a similar engine but with four vernier combustion chambers instead of two. This makes total of 32 chambers, not engines. In the scene where Glushko is supposedly testing the clustering scheme, only one engine is shown.
*One of the cosmonauts, after seeing the Vostok's cockpit for the first time (Episode Three), asks where the controls are. Also the Gagarin flight scene indicates that there were no controls inside. In fact controls were present on board the Vostoks, but they were blocked to prevent the cosmonauts from manipulating them. A set of codes was placed aboard, so that the cosmonaut could unlock the controls if necessary.
*When the Mission Control is shown for the first time in episode 3 it shows that all the flight controllers have a TV screen showing the launch pad.  In reality only the flight director had a TV screen.  The other consoles had only meters to measure the various systems.
*In Episode Four the narrator states that "if they ([[Apollo 8]]) fail to lock into the moon's orbit they will fly on, forever lost in space". In fact, Apollo 8 used a [[free return trajectory]] that would have taken them back to Earth had the engine performing lunar orbit injection failed.

=== Unconfirmed statements ===
The series repeats the claim Korolev was denounced by Glushko several times. There are no known documents substanitating this statement. Glushko had been imprisoned himself before Korolev was arrested and had been sentenced to eight years in a prison camp “for participating in sabotage organization.” He was retained to work for the [[NKVD]] to develop aircraft jet boosters. In 1942, at Glushko’s request, NKVD transferred Korolev from another prison to Glushko’s OKB.&lt;ref name="rockets_and_people"&gt;{{cite book | first = Boris | last = Chertok | editor = Asif A.

=== Filming inaccuracies ===
* Korolev's last name is often mispronounced despite Russian participation in the series.
* It is not explained why Glushko and Korolev, both civilian engineers, wore military uniform during their stay in Germany.
* Usage of period footage is inconsistent, in particular with regard to the R-7 and its variants.
* The scene that depicts transporting a V-2 missile to firing position uses a different missile pulled by the Soviet [[ZIL-157|ZiL-157]] truck.
* In the sequence with the train leaving the German station with scientists one can read "CFR" on the locomotive, which stands for [[Căile Ferate Române]] (Romanian Railways).
* The scene depicting a launch from Kapustin Yar, which is dated by 1948, includes vehicles that were not produced at that time, in particular the [[ZIL-157|ZiL-157]] (1958), the [[Zil-131|ZiL-131]] (1967) and the [[UAZ-469]] (1971).

A '''stasis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|s|ɪ|s}} or '''stasis field''', in [[science fiction]], is a confined area of space in which time has been stopped or the contents have been rendered motionless.

==Overview==
A stasis field is imagined to be a region in which a stasis process is in effect. Stasis fields in fictional settings often have several common characteristics. These include infinite or nearly infinite rigidity, making them "unbreakable objects" and a perfect or nearly-perfect reflective surface. Most science fiction plots rely on a physical device to establish this region. When the device is deactivated, the stasis field collapses, and the stasis effect ends.

Time is often suspended in stasis fields. Such fields thus have the additional property of protecting non-living materials from deterioration. This [[time dilation]] can be, from an in-universe perspective, absolute;  something thrown into the field, has the field triggered and then reactivated, would fly out as if nothing had happened. Storylines using such fields often have materials as well as living beings surviving thousands or millions of years beyond their normal lifetimes. The property also allows for such [[plot device]]s as [[booby trap]]s, containing, for instance, a [[nuclear bomb]].&lt;ref name="Forever War"&gt;{{cite book| last=Haldeman| first=Joe| title=[[The Forever War]]| year=1975| publisher=Eos (HarperCollins)| isbn=0-380-70821-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once out of the stasis field, the trap is sprung. In such a situation, to avoid the protagonist from seeing what is in the field, the story line would not allow normal beings to see something protected by a stasis field.

One use of stasis fields is as a form of [[suspended animation in fiction|suspended animation]]: to let passengers and cargoes (normally of spacecraft or [[sleeper ship|sleeper ships]]) avoid having to experience extremely long periods of time by "skipping over" large sections of it. They may also be used, such as in ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'', as protection against the effects of extreme acceleration.

There are real phenomena that cause time dilation similar that of a stasis field. Extremely high velocities approaching [[light speed]] or immensely powerful [[gravitational field| gravitational fields]] such as those existing near the event horizons of black holes will cause time to progress more slowly. However, there is no known theoretical way of causing such time dilation independently of such conditions.

==Examples==
The noted science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] used the concept of stasis fields and stasis boxes to a great extent directly or indirectly throughout his many novels and short stories set in the [[Known Space]] series. Niven's stasis fields followed conductive surfaces when established, and the resulting frozen space became a completely invulnerable and perfectly reflective object. They were often used as emergency protective devices. They could also be used to create a weapon called a variable sword, a length of extremely fine wire in a stasis field that makes it able to easily cut through normal matter. For more information, see [[Slaver stasis field]].

A more limited form of stasis field is the "bobble", found in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s [[Peace Authority]] setting. A bobble is always perfectly spherical and exists for a fixed period of time that is set when the bobble is first created. The duration of a bobble effect cannot be changed. Bobble generators were initially used as weapons, removing their targets from the field of combat.

Another example of a stasis field exists in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s ''[[The Forever War]]'',&lt;ref name="Forever War"/&gt; where stasis field generators are carried by troops to create conditions where melee weapons become the only viable means of combat. Inside the field, no object can travel faster than 16.3&amp;nbsp;m/s, which includes electrons, photons, and the field itself. Soldiers inside the field must be wearing suits with a special coating, or all electrical activity within their body would stop and the soldiers would die. In the novel, the main character defeats an enemy army, which has besieged a small remaining contingent of human troops on a moon, by arming a nuclear bomb inside the field and then moving the field away from the bomb. Once the bomb is revealed, its electrical activity resumes, and it promptly detonates. That vaporises the surrounding army, and a large chunk of the ground beneath the field. The soldiers emerge some days later to see if their trick worked and find themselves alone at the bottom of a large crater, their enemy destroyed.

In Peter F. Hamilton’s [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy|''The Night’s Dawn'' trilogy]] (1996-1999), “zero-tau pods” — powered containers inside which time halts — are an important narrative device.

In the computer strategy game ''[[StarCraft]]'', the Arbiter unit can, through a combination of Protoss technology and the Arbiter's psionic power, create a stasis field that traps all units in the affected area in blue "crystals" of stopped time, taking them out of the fight and rendering them invulnerable for 30 seconds, thus allowing both offensive and defensive applications.

The ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series has the main character Isaac Clarke carry a wrist-mounted [[tachyon]]-based stasis module, used to slow enemy Necromorphs to a crawl for a short period of time. He adapted its use to fight Necromorphs; it was used previously by technicians to slow down malfunctioning equipment that moves at dangerously high speeds, such as doors. Medical use of the technology is later seen in ''[[Dead Space 2]]'', with stasis beds; the [[protagonist]] had also been kept in stasis for the majority of the time between games.

The game ''[[Mass Effect]]'' has a [[Mass effect#Biotics|biotic power]] simply called "Stasis" that can trap an enemy in a stasis field rendering them immobile as well as invincible to all forms of damage. The duration of this effect is usually dependent on the user's skill level.

In the [[Star Wars]] [[Role-playing game|RPG]] series ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', [[Jedi]] who follow the path of the light are able to use "Stasis" powers, using the force to alter time and freeze an enemy in place. Unlike true stasis, this stasis allows external events to affect the victim so someone held by stasis can be killed while unable to retaliate. The original game also uses a similar effect when Dark Jedi trap party members to engage the player in a duel.

In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Cat and the Canary", [[Green Arrow]] uses a stunner to put himself into a form of stasis while fighting [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]. It was an attempt to end Wildcat's cage fighting career by falsely convincing him he killed Green Arrow during their fight.

In the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' episode "Walk For Your Lives", Zim creates a time stasis field and uses it on Dib as an experiment to show to the Tallest, as a result Dib can move only very slowly. Also produced is an explosion, which is also exploding very slowly, Zim decides to throw Dib into the explosion to cause it to speed up. The explosion then explodes at normal speed. 

The Space themed MMO ''[[Eve Online]]'' features a weapon called a stasis webifier. When activated against an enemy ship it reduces the target's speed, making them easier to hit and keep in range. The weapon affords no protection to its target, and multiple 'webs' can be used on a ship at once, effectively stopping it dead.

In ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half Life]]'', the protagonist Gordon Freeman is put into a state of Stasis after a brief discussion with the G-Man. A similar incidence happens to Adrian Shepherd at the end of ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Half Life: Opposing Force]]'', when the G-Man puts him into a state of stasis "for further evaluation".

In ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', Chell, the protagonist, is dragged away at the end of the game and put in stasis for many years, until she is awakened at the beginning of ''[[Portal 2]]''.

In ''[[Project Eden (video game)|Project Eden]]'' one character is frozen in stasis for 15 years. Stasis can also be used offensively to slow down enemies.

In the first episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', "The End", third-class technician of the mining ship "[[Red Dwarf spacecraft|Red Dwarf]]", [[Dave Lister]], is put into a stasis booth as punishment for not revealing the whereabouts of his unquarantined cat. However, during his time in stasis, lethal radiation leaks into the ship as a result of a malfunction, killing all the crew (aside from his cat, which was in the cargo hold). Lister is then revived three million years later by the ship's computer, Holly, when the high radiation levels have subsided.

In [[Catherine Asaro]]'s [[Saga of the Skolian Empire|Skolian Empire]] books, the Skolians use [[quasis]] to freeze time during [[interstellar travel]].

'''Swakopmund tracking station''' is a [[China|Chinese]] space tracking station in [[Swakopmund]], [[Namibia]], South-West Africa which is used for the [[Chinese space program|Chinese manned space programme]]. The full name of the station, according to the Namibian Ministry of Education, is '''China Telemetry, Tracking and Command Station'''.&lt;ref name="min_ed"/&gt; The station, which opened in 2001, tracks the re-entry of Chinese manned space vehicles.

The station was built as a result of an agreement signed in October 2000 between the Namibian and Chinese governments.&lt;ref name="globalsec-swak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="min_ed"/&gt; It was built by Windhoek Consulting Engineers at an estimated cost of $12 million Namibian dollars and opened in July 2001. The site is north of Swakopmund and is a 150m x 85m compound surrounded by a 2m high wall. There are two antennae for communicating with spacecraft, one 5m in diameter and the other 9m. The latter is 16m high.&lt;ref name="globalsec-swak"/&gt;

In March 2012 it was announced that it had participated in six launches.&lt;ref name="min_ed"/&gt; It was involved in the 29 June 2012 descent of [[Shenzhou 9]], the first manned craft to dock with Chinese space station [[Tiangong 1]], and the craft with the first Chinese woman in space, [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]. The [[ground track]] of the descending craft passed over the station on its way to land in [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="zarya"/&gt;

The station is part of the Chinese Tracking, Telemetry, Command and Communications System which uses [[S band]] communications. It is one of three overseas stations - the other two are in [[Karachi, Pakistan]] and [[Malindi, Kenya]]. The programme also uses [[Yuan Wang class tracking ship|Yuanwang]] tracking ships and [[Tianlian I|Tianlian]] relay satellites.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

:''Not to be confused with [[Klaus Riedel]] or '''Walther Riedel''', who were also Peenemünde engineers.''
'''Walter J H "Papa" Riedel''' was a German [[engineer]] who was the head of the Design Office of the [[Peenemünde|Army Research Centre Peenemünde]] and the Chief Designer of the A4 ([[V-2]]) ballistic rocket.&lt;ref name=WJHRiedelBiography&gt;{{cite book

==Biography==

Employed by the Heylandt Company from 27 February 1928, in December 1929 Riedel was assigned responsibility for the development of rocket motors using liquid propellants, initially in collaboration with Max Valier who had joined the company at that date.&lt;ref name=WJHRiedelBiography/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJHRiedelRocketDev&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=W.J.H |title=Rocket Developments With Liquid Propellants (1950), (Translated from the original by Dr J.

In March 1936, Wernher von Braun and Walter Riedel began consideration of much larger rockets than the A3 (under development at that time), which was merely a test vehicle and could not carry any payload.&lt;ref name=Dornberger&gt;{{cite book|last=Dornberger|first=Walter |title=V2 – Der Schuss ins Weltall, p. 55, Bechtle Verlag, Esslingen, 1952.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Walter Dornberger, plans were drawn up for a more suitable and better equipped test site for large rockets at Peememünde, to take the place of the rather confined Kummersdorf.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrdwayIII&gt;{{cite book|last=Ordway III|first=Frederick, I; Sharp, Mitchell, R|title=The Rocket Team|pp=30–33,123|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|isbn=978-0-434-55300-6|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 17 May 1937, following the transfer of the rocket activities from Kummersdorf to the Army’s new rocket establishment at Peenemünde, Riedel headed the Technical Design Office as Chief Designer of the A4 (V2) ballistic rocket &lt;ref name=WJHRiedelBiography/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrdwayIII/&gt; After the air raid by the British Royal Air Force (Operation Hydra) on Peenemünde in August 1943, the transfer of the development facility was ordered to a location giving better protection from air attack. The air raid had cost the lives of Dr Walter Thiel (Propulsion Chief) and Erich Walther (Chief of Maintenance for the workshops), two leading men at the Peenemünde Army facilities.&lt;ref name=OrdwayIII/&gt; In mid-September 1943, Riedel and two others surveyed the Austrian Alps for a new site for rocket development to replace that at Peenemünde. The chosen location was at Ebensee, on the southern end of the Traunsee, 100&amp;nbsp;km east of Salzburg.&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael, J|title=The Rocket and the Reich|p=204|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0-02-922895-1|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site consisted of a system of galleries driven into the mountains, and received the code name Zement (Cement). Work on the site started at the beginning of 1944 and was intended to be completed in October 1945.&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;{{cite book|last=Klee|first=Ernst; Merk, Otto|title=Damals in Peenemünde, p. 109, Gerhard Stalling Verlag, Oldenburg &amp; Hamburg, 1963.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 October 1943, Riedel was responsible for supervising the transfer, to Ebensee, of the Peenemünde development facility. From 29 May 1945 to 20 September 1945, following the end of World War II, Riedel was held in protective custody (Sicherheitshaft) at the US Third Army’s internment camp at Deggendorf (situated between Regensburg and Passau).&lt;ref name=WJHRiedelBiography/&gt; From 1 November 1945 to 10 March 1946 he was employed by the Ministry of Supply (MoS) Establishment at Altenwalde (near Cuxhaven), and from 11 March to 31 July 1946 at the MoS Establishment at Trauen (near Braunschweig).&lt;ref name=WJHRiedelBiography/&gt; After the Trauen Establishment was disbanded, Riedel emigrated to England, to work initially (from 1947) at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough and later (from 1948 until his death in 1968) at the MoS Rocket Propulsion Department (RPD) in Westcott (near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire). In 1957, Riedel became a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, W.H.J., "Rocket Development with Liquid Propellents", Rolls-Royce, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

An alleged CIA memorandum of February 9, 1953 places him in Los Angeles as a founding director of the California Committee for Saucer(UFOs) Investigation, unless there is another former Nazi rocket designer with the same name who worked at the Reich's Army Research Centre Peenemünde. In the CIA document, he tells the agent that he has been living in the US for a number of years as part of Operation Paper Clip, a program that helped Nazi scientists to resettle in the US in exchange for their research work. Werner Von Braun of NASA fame is the most well known of the Paperclip club.

The '''World Academy of Art and Science''' ('''WAAS''') is an international non-governmental scientific organization, a world [[Social network|network]] of more than 700 individual fellows from more than 80 [[countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=WAAS Newsletter|url=http://www.worldacademy.org/files/Newsletters/November_2013.pdf|journal=www.worldacademy.org|date = November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are elected for distinguished accomplishments in the [[sciences]], [[arts]] and the [[humanities]].  The Academy strives to promote [[the growth of knowledge]], enhance public awareness of the social consequences and policy implications of that growth, and provide "leadership in thought that leads to action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=XI International Colloquium|url=http://www.internationalcolloquium.org/sponsors.html|journal=www.internationalcolloquium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the academy can be expressed in the words of [[Albert Einstein]] "The creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=???|url=http://www.brunner.cl/?p=2047|journal=www.brunner.cl|date = 14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of founding the Academy and a set of world scientific and youth scientist and science journalist associations was proposed in an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on 1/10/1938 by philosopher and liberal-libertarian [[Etienne Gilson]] and during his tours of several scientific associations and universities in Europe and the Americas in the 1940s. He also proposed a world association of Liberal parties, what became www.liberal-international.org, to champion secular democracy and pave the way for better scientific communication and education in a time of growing totalitarianism.

The idea was echoed in the 1950s by leading scientists who were concerned about the potential for misuse of scientific discoveries. They included [[Albert Einstein]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], and [[Joseph Rotblat]] who had been involved in the development of the atomic bomb; [[Bertrand Russell]] philosopher and pacifist; [[Joseph Needham]], a co-founder of [[UNESCO]]; [[Lord Boyd Orr]], the First Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization; [[George Brock Chisholm]], the First Director General of the [[World Health Organization]]; John A. Fleming, former President of the International Council of Scientific Unions; as well as [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], [[Harold C. Urey]], [[Francis Perrin]], [[Panchanan Maheshwari]], [[Theodore Monod]], [[Detlev Bronk]], [[Harold Lasswell]] and other scholars and public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ivo Slaus president of the world academy of art &amp; science|url=http://english.republika.mk/?p=108568|journal=english.republika.mk|date = 24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was organized in December 1960 with the aim of creating an informal world association of the highest scientific and ethical norms and standards.

Originally established in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Academy of Art &amp; Science|url=http://www.mssresearch.org/?q=World_Academy|journal=www.mssresearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 WAAS incorporated as a non-profit organization in the State of California, USA. The Academy maintains offices in Napa, California; Zagreb, Croatia; Bucharest, Romania; and Pondicherry, India. It has a special division for [[SEED-WAAS|South Eastern Europe]].

==Members==
At present the Academy's membership consists of 730 Fellows, Associate Fellows and Junior Fellows from all parts of the world, representing virtually all fields of science, social sciences, arts and humanities, as well as educators, political leaders, diplomats and heads of leading international NGOs. Fellows are nominated by existing members and directly elected by the members. To be a Fellow of the Academy is to be a member of the global civil society, concerned for the welfare of the increasingly interconnected global civilization with a demonstrated commitment to addressing issues of global importance. Principal criteria for election include:
* Distinction or leadership in his or her profession
* Interdisciplinary interests or accomplishments
* Record of public service
* Global perspective
* The candidate must agree to be nominated and to participate in the Academy's work. A Fellow participates in the activities of the Plenum of the Academy, serves on its Committees, promotes its policies, participates in its projects, programs and fund-raising.

Election in the WAAS is considered as one of the highest honors that can be accorded a scientist. Fellows include leading artists, politicians, statesmen, former heads of various countries, heads of research institutes and international organizations, Nobel Prize winners and business leaders. Fellows of the Academy are entitled to use the post-nominal letters FWAAS.

==Reliable Knowledge==
[[File:Reliable knowledge.png|thumb|upright|alt= Concept of Reliable knowledge]]
In its approach to the challenges confronting humanity today, the Academy seeks to apply a comprehensive, integrated, human-centered conception of Reliable Knowledge encompassing seven dimensions. The framework is based on the premise that actions based on partial, piecemeal approaches are inadequate to address the pressing problems confronting humanity today and most often lead to unexpected side-effects generative of new and more complex problems.

==Programs==

The central objective of the Academy’s activities is to develop ideas, strategies and initiatives to promote a New Paradigm of Human Development appropriate to the needs of the 21st Century. WAAS’ current programming focuses on addressing challenges in the fields of democracy, economy and employment, ecology, education, global governance and rule of law, nuclear disarmament, peace and international security, scientific and technological development and application.
[[File:New Paradigm WAAS.png|thumb|upright|alt= Elements of a New Paradigm]]

Current programs of the Academy include specific initiatives focusing on
* Abolition of Nuclear Weapons—formulation of legal, public policy and social strategies for complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
* Global Employment Challenge—strategies to achieve full employment and to evolve a theory and global model for employment.
* New Economic Theory—formulation of a human-centered theory of economics
* Global Higher Education–conceptualization and design of a truly global, world-class system of higher education accessible and affordable to people everywhere.
* Evolution of Individuality—the role of formed individuals in guiding the development of creative intellectual and social processes as evidenced by creative artists, original thinkers, business and social entrepreneurs, discoverers, inventors and political leaders.
* Revolution in Human Affairs—inquiry into the relationship between rising expectations and rising levels of social unrest, violence, fundamentalism and terrorism.
* Limits to Rationality—analysis of limitations in the application of rationality to solve human problems and in the inherent limitations commonly associated with mind's quest for knowledge.
* Ways of Knowing—analysis of the inherent limitations and blindspots implicit in the prevailing fragmentary, rationalist, materialistic, mechanistic approach to understanding and solving human problems, including an exploration of new ways of knowing generated by the emerging sciences of systems theory, complexity, autopoiesis and recent discoveries in the physical, biological and social sciences.

== World University Consortium ==
The Academy’s founders intended that WAAS should function as "an informal World University at the highest scientific and ethical level, in which deep human understanding and fullest sense of responsibility will meet." Although some modest beginnings were made to establish a few regional centers of excellence, political conditions at the height of the Cold War, as well as limitations in transport and global communication, posed insurmountable obstacles to realize this vision at the time.  Rapid advances in telecommunications and educational technology over the past decade created the opportunity to realize the vision of WAAS Founders.

The World University Consortium in 2013 is a major initiative of the Academy to design a global system of higher education attuned to emerging opportunities and challenges.

Following a major international conference on Global Higher Education organized by the Academy at the University of California at Berkeley in October 2013, the World University Consortium was incorporated in California as a non-governmental organization to promote accessible, affordable, quality education at the global level founded on universal human values, relevant to the emerging needs of the 21st century, oriented to promote full employment, and capable of developing the full potential of each individual student for personal accomplishment and contribution to the collective progress of humanity.

WUC is intended to become a global network and umbrella group working to facilitate educational partnerships and linkages with interested stakeholders with shared goals, to explore creative solutions to enhance the reach, quality and relevance of higher education globally, to provide a platform for new ideas, trans-disciplinary perspectives and integrated courseware intended to address global opportunities and challenges, and to develop ways to draw upon the extensive knowledge and experience acquired by organizations outside the traditional field of academia which possess essential knowledge for addressing real-world problems.
