      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''Alois Kottmann Award''' is an international prize for "classical, cantando violin playing".&lt;ref name=KP&gt;[http://www.alois-kottmann.de/E/kottmann_preis.php Alois Kottmann Award]&lt;/ref&gt; It honours outstanding international violinists. The competition takes place annually in May and/or June during [[International Days of Music Hesse Main-Taunus Hofheim]] in [[Hofheim, Hesse|Hofheim am Taunus]], Hesse, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturportal-hessen.de/de/Spezial/Infothek/index.phtml?id=2240&amp;sparte=Musik&amp;kategorie=Förderung+%26+Preise Alois Kottmann Award] (German) Source: Culture Portal State of Hesse, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hofheim.de/Themen/Kultur/Kulturelle%20Angebote/Hofheimer%20Klassik-Konzerte/article_hofheim/Internationale_Musiktage.html "Internationale Musiktage Hessen Main-Taunus Hofheim"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719041558/http://www.hofheim.de/Themen/Kultur/Kulturelle%20Angebote/Hofheimer%20Klassik-Konzerte/article_hofheim/Internationale_Musiktage.html |date=2011-07-19 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; After the competition, the award is presented on a separate date through the Lord Mayor of the city of [[Frankfurt]] am Main in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Limpurg Hall|de|3=Alten Limpurg}} of the historic city hall [[Römer]].

== History ==
[[File:City hall Römer Frankfurt Hesse Germany.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Römer]] (city hall) in [[Frankfurt]] am Main, where the award ceremony takes place]]
The Alois Kottmann Award was founded and donated in 2001. It is named after its founder and benefactor, the German violinist and university professor [[Alois Kottmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultur.frankfurt.de/portal/de/Musik/AloisKottmann-Preis/46/0/178/mod112-details1/5.aspx "Alois Kottmann Award"] (German) kultur-frankfurt.de&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of the competition, only one participant received an award and special prizes were offered to honour further special talents or performances. This changed in 2005 when two participants received awards. In the years 2006 and 2007, special appreciation awards were introduced along the main award and the special prizes. In addition, the unparalleled "Bach Award of the city of Hofheim am Taunus" was presented in 2007 to Sabrina-Vivian Höpcker (Germany). In 2010, first and second places of the Alois Kottmann Award were created, along with the special prizes. In addition, the title "Laudatory Appreciation" was introduced.

== Aim ==
The award is meant to aid and encourage the Frankfurt-based tradition of [[Carl Flesch]] which has its most prominent exponents in [[Alma Moodie]] and [[Max Rostal]]. The jury will place special emphasis on classical discipline, on an artistic and stylistic understanding of the performed works as well as a ''singing'' (''[[wikt:cantando|cantando]]'') style which signifies and characterises the personality of the artist.&lt;ref name=KP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationale-musiktage.de/kottmann-preis.php ''Alois Kottmann Award''] (German) Source: internationale-musiktage.de&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Outstanding violinists can be recognized by their tone, but with the young ones this is often not possible anymore. What is heard from them is performed speciously but without personality. The violin was created because man is able to sing also with it."&lt;br /&gt;Professor h. c. Alois Kottmann (translated from German)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr-online.de/rhein-main/der-streiter-fuer-den-guten-ton/-/1472796/3268212/-/index.html "Der Streiter für den guten Ton"] by Kristiane Schengbier, ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'' (2 November 2009) {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions ==
The award consists of 3,000 euro, a silver medal and a certificate. In addition, one or more special prizes will be awarded if applicable.

The competition is open for violinists internationally. There is no age restriction. During the competition musical pieces are required to be performed which are published one year in advance and will change annually. Memorised play is not required nor specially rated. Closing date for applications is in April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miz.org/details_16556_814.html ''Alois Kottmann Award for classical canto-style play of the violin''] Source: miz.org (German Music Information Centre)&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the judging panel are [[Margit Neubauer]] (singer), university professor Alois Kottmann (violin, benefactor and patron of the award), and Boris Kottmann (violin).

'''''Andha Yug''''' ([[Hindi]]: अंधा युग, ''The Age of Blindness'' or ''The Blind Age'') is a [[1954 in literature|1954]] [[verse play]] written in [[Hindi]], by renowned novelist, poet, and playwright [[Dharamvir Bharati]] (1926-1997). It was the first important play of 20th century India. Set in the last day of the Great [[Mahabharat]] war, the five-act [[tragedy]] was written in the years following the 1947 [[partition of India]] atrocities, as [[allegory]] to its destruction of human lives and ethical values. It is a metaphoric meditation on the politics of violence and aggressive selfhood and that war dehumanized individuals and society. Thus both the victor and the vanquished lose eventually.&lt;ref name=Ru195&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 195]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anti-war]] play first created sensation as a radio play at [[Allahabad]] [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref name=Ru182/&gt; This led to its production by Mumbai-based theatre director, [[Satyadev Dubey]] (1962), and subsequent famous production by theatre doyen [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] against the backdrop of historical monuments in Delhi (like [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] and [[Purana Qila]]). It became "a national theatrical event"; his 1963 production was seen by then Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remarkable resurgence |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article600096.ece |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently staged by numerous directors and in many Indian languages.&lt;ref name=Ru182&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 182]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the "theatre of the roots" movement which started in [[Indian theatre]] in the 1950s, which tried to look into Indian epics and myths for form, inspiration and content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Epic play: The back-to-roots movement in theatre has directors turning to myths for inspiration, |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050508/spectrum/main3.htm |publisher=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]''|author=Chaman Ahuja |date=May 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Andha Yug'' is today recognised as the "play that heralded a new era in Indian theatre" and standard repertoire of [[Hindi theatre]].&lt;ref name=hin/&gt; Dharamvir Bharati wrote one play during his career&lt;ref name=Ru195/&gt; and was awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] in Playwriting (Hindi) in 1988, given by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees |publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727234019/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Andha Yug'' is based on the ancient [[Sanskrit]] epic, ''Mahabharata'' written by [[Ved Vyasa]]. The play begins on the eighteenth and last day of the Great Mahabharata War, which devastated the kingdom of [[Kaurava]]s, the feuding cousins of [[Pandava]]s, their capital the once-magnificent [[Hastinapur]] lay burning, in ruins, the battlefield of [[Kurukshetra]] was strewn with corpses, and skies filled with vultures and death laments. Fatalities were on both sides as cousins killed each other. The survivors were left grieving and enraged as they continued to blame each other for the destruction. No one was willing to view it as a consequence of their own moral choices.

[[Ashwatthama]], son of guru [[Dronacharya]], in one last-ditch act of revenge against the Pandavas, releases the ultimate weapon of destruction — the ''[[Brahmastra]]'', which promises to annihilate the world. No one comes forward to condemn it: Ethics and humanity have been the first casualties of the war.

[[Krishna]] who mediated between the cousins before war, remains the moral centre of the play. Even in his failure he presents options that are ethical and just and reminds us that a higher or sacred way is always accessible to human beings even in the worst of times. The play ends with the death of Krishna.&lt;ref name=Ru195/&gt;&lt;ref name=George220&gt;[[#Ge|George, p. 220]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play structure==
Bharati constructed the play using western drama tradition and early Indian drama, found in Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name=Ru195/&gt;

* Prologue
* Act One: The Kaurava Kingdom
* Act Two: The Making of a Beast
* Act Three: The Half-truth of Ashwatthama
* Interlude: Feathers, Wheels and Bandages
* Act Four: Gandhari's Curse
* Act Five: Victory and a Series of Suicides
* Epilogue: Death of the Lord

==Themes==

''Andha Yug'' highlights the perils of self-enchantment in an anti-war allegory. It explores human capacity for moral action, reconciliation, and goodness in times of atrocity and reveals what happens when individuals succumb to the cruelty and cynicism of a blind, dispirited age.

When a ruler, epitomized by a blind [[Dhritarashtra]] (physically and also by his ambition for his son [[Duryodhana]]), in an equally blind society fail its own side and that of their loved ones. It elaborates on the consequences, when a society fails to stop a cycle of revenge and instead choose a redemptive path, which is always available even in worst of scenarios. This is shown by Krishna's presence amid the mindlessness of fellow human beings. It was only when they collectively reject the voice of wisdom that denigration of war step upon them, leading to wide-scale bloodshed.

The story hints at the perils that await a society that turns away from its wisdom culture and instead succumb to the logic of the moment that can be easily swayed by emotions. Bharati uses the war of Mahabharat to make an anti-war statement and raises questions regarding moral uprightness in the wake of Partition-related atrocities, loss of faith and national identity.&lt;ref name=Ru195/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ru182/&gt;

Some directors have used it to bring out contemporary issues like the role of diplomacy of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Small talk |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/small-talk/398547/ |publisher=''Indian Express'' |date=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Quote box| width=20%|align=right|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
I suddenly understood
as if in a flash of revelation
that when a man
surrenders his selfhood
and challenges history
he can change the course
of the stars.

The lines of fate
are not carved in stone.
They can be drawn and redrawn
at every moment of time
by the will of man.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source= —excerpt from ''Andha Yug''|}}
Dharamvir Bharati (1926–1997), was a renowned Hindi novelist, poet, and playwright. His novels, ''[[Gunahon Ka Devta (novel)|Gunahon Ka Devta]]'' (The God of Sins, 1949) and ''[[The Sun's seventh horse (novel)|Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda]]'' (The Seventh Horse of the Sun, 1952), are classics of [[Hindi literature]]. The latter was adapted into [[Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda|a film]] by [[Shyam Benegal]] in 1992.

Originally written as a [[radio play]], the play was first broadcast by the [[All India Radio]] (public radio) and immediately drew attention.&lt;ref name=Ru182/&gt;

Playwright and theatre director [[Satyadev Dubey]] heard of the play and met Bharati when the latter had dropped in to see Dubey's Hindi adaptation of [[Albert Camus]]'s ''Cross Purposes'', as ''Sapne''. Recognizing its potential, Dubey walked around with the script for nearly 10 years trying to get it done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Fury And The Ecstacy |url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main40.asp?filename=hub151108the_fury.asp |publisher=''[[Tehelka]]'' |date= November 15, 2008|volume= Vol 5, Issue 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubey had been running 'Theatre Unit' (a theatre group started by [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] who moved to Delhi in 1962 as director of [[National School of Drama]], Delhi), After staging it himself in 1962, Dubey sent the script to Alkazi. Though many found the play lacking action, Alkazi believed, "action is not rushing around. It’s inward growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre is revelation (Interview) |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/02/24/stories/2008022450160500.htm |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=February 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkazi's production made history in modern [[Indian theatre]], when he staged first ''Andha Yug'' in 1963, first amidst the backdrop of the ruins of [[Feroz Shah Kotla]], Delhi and then [[Purana Quila]]'s tiered steps in the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A little peek into history |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/05/02/stories/2008050250120300.htm|publisher=''The Hindu'' |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought in a new paradigm in Indian theatres.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/11/25/stories/2007112550080200.htm Drama with a distinct vision] by [[Girish Karnad]], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 25 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Reaction matters to me’|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/11/16/stories/2008111650040200.htm |publisher=''The Hindu'' |date=November 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for this production was given by noted composer [[Vanraj Bhatia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalopus.com/cgi-bin/io.pl?mode=composer&amp;composer=10 Vanraj Bhatia profile] ''internationalopus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coming years, the play attracted many directors and was staged across the country,&lt;ref name=Ru195/&gt; including [[Mohan Maharishi]], [[Ram Gopal Bajaj]], and [[Bhanu Bharti]]. [[M.K. Raina]] staged the play in Berlin and the Festival of India in the USSR in 1987, [[Ratan Thiyam]] staged it in an open-air performance in Tonga, Japan, on 5 August 1994, a day before the 49th anniversary of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4to40.com/music/index.asp?p=Performance_Tradition_and_Modern_Theatre Modern Classics]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noted productions have been by directors [[Arvind Gaur]], [[Girish Tiwari (Girda)]], and Bijon Mondal (2010), who gave it a contemporary twist, accompanied by fusion band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Andha Yug brings history alive|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report_andha-yug-brings-history-alive_1353860 |publisher=''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'' |date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable production in 2010 at Feroze Shah Kotla ruins included a cast of Ashish Vidyarthi (Ashwatthama), Uttara Baokar (Gandhari), Mohan Maharishi (Dhritrashtra), Vasant Josalkar (Vidur), Ravi Jhankal (Vriddha Yachak), Om Puri (Krishna), Govind Namdev (Vyas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzintown.com/delhi/event--delhi-celebrates-andha-yug-play/id--259934.html Delhi Celebrates! : Andha Yug - Play]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was in development since 1994. The team consisted of only 2 people - Jakub Dvorský and Marek Floryán. Developers drew inspiration form games like ''[[Myst (series)|Myst]]'', ''[[Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (video game)|Elvira: Mistress of the Dark]]'' and ''[[Stonekeep]]''. ''Asmodeus'' also changed genre a few times during development. The game was originally a [[Text adventure games|text adventure game]] but changed in a [[point-and-click adventure]]. Action parts were added later and game become a [[dungeon crawl]] RPG mixed with adventure game. Team has grown as Dvorský and Floryán were later aided by three other members. The game was finished in 1996 and developers contacted Petr Vochozka a CEO of Vochozka Trading. Vochozka Trading released ''Asmodeus'' in 1997.&lt;ref name=interv&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taufman|first1=Karel|title=Interview.

==Story==
The game follows Mot. He is an apprentice of a Monk who decides to summon an ancient God Asmodeus to "save the world." Monk sends Mot to find three Eterons, magic stones needed to summon Asmodeus.

Mot searches for Eterons through Ruthaniol country. He completes the task but finds out that Asmodeus is not a god that will save the world but devil. Mot still takes Eterons to the Monk but tries to convince him to not summon Asmodeus. Monk reveals that he actually wants to use Asmodeus to rule the world. Mot stands up to his master but is quickly killed and Monk summons Asmodeus. The game ends as Asmodeus kills the Monk and leaves the cave.

==Gameplay==
''Asmodeus'' features a [[First person video games|First person view]]. Movement is similar to ''[[Myst (series)|Myst]]''. The game is played as a dungeon crawler RPG, while in underground tunnels that arefull of enemies. Player can kill these enemies with his weapon. He can improve his weapon and skills throughout the game so he can fight harder enemies. On the other hand, when the player is outside of tunnels, it becomes an adventure game. Player talks to NPCs, takes objects and uses the on the right place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asmodeus|journal=Score|date=1 October 1996|volume=34|page=24|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/score-34/page/24/|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pyongyang Film Studio mural detail.jpg|thumb|Mural at the [[Pyongyang Film Studio]]]]
Because of the isolated nature of the country, information—particularly unbiased information—on [[North Korea]]n [[Film industry|cinema]] is difficult to find. Outsider appraisal of North Korean cinema is often condescending, while statements from official North Korean sources include claims like, "In recent years our film art has created an unprecedented sensation in the world's filmdom... The revolutionary people of the world are unstinting in their praise of this feature film and other monumental works, calling them 'the first-class films by international standards', 'the most wonderful movies ever produced' and 'immortal revolutionary and popular films'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1974|title=Korean Review|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang, North Korea|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film studios==
North Korea's principal producer of feature films is the [[Korean Film Studio]], a state-run studio founded in 1947 and located outside of [[Pyongyang]]. Other North Korean film studios include the [[Korean Documentary Film Studio]] (founded in 1946), the [[April 25 Film Studio]] of the Korean People's Army (founded in 1959 and previously known as the February 8 Cinema Studio) and the [[SEK Studio|Korean Science and Educational Film Studio]] (founded in 1953 and also known as the April 26 Children's Film Production House, and Science Educational Korea, or SEK.)&lt;ref name="Schönherr-145"&gt;Schönherr, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt; These studios produce feature films, documentaries, [[animated films]], children's films and science films. According to a report from 1992, the Korean Feature Film Studio produced about forty films per year, while the other studios together accounted for another forty.&lt;ref name="Gluckman"/&gt;

In addition to animation for the North Korean domestic market, SEK has become a resource for international animation, including some well-known American animated films. Production costs in North Korea are very low, and the quality of animators is well perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Axis of animation|author=Susan Kitchens|journal=Forbes|date=March 3, 2003|url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2003/0303/014.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEK has done work on such productions as [[Mondo TV]]'s animated series ''[[Pocahontas (animation series)|Pocahontas]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondotv.it/Pocahontas_en.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220012958/http://www.mondotv.it/Pocahontas_en.php |archivedate=February 20, 2014 |df=mdy }} Pocahontas&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[King Lion Simba]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondotv.it/kingLionSimba.php King Lion Simba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232540/http://www.mondotv.it/kingLionSimba.php |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''not'' the Walt Disney feature films),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laughter -- a less lethal export from North Korea|author=Park Chan-Kyong

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] believed&lt;ref name="Schönherr-145"/&gt; in [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]: "Cinema is the most important of all arts." &lt;ref name="Lenin:Directives on the Film Business"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lenin:Directives on the Film Business|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|year=2003|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/jan/17.htm|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, since the country's division, North Korean films have often been used as vehicles for instilling government ideology into the people. A common theme is martyrdom for the nation. The film ''[[Fate of a Self-defence Corps Member]]'', based on a novel written by [[Kim Il-sung]] during the fight against the Japanese occupation reflects this theme, as does the highly regarded film, ''[[Sea of Blood]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200406/news06/19.htm |title=Past news |publisher=Kcna.co.jp |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter film comes from a novel telling the story of a woman farmer who becomes a national heroine by fighting the Japanese.

Another favorite theme is the happiness of the current society. This theme can be seen reflected in titles of feature films like ''[[A Family of Workers]]'', ''[[A Flowering Village]]'', ''[[Rolling Mill Workers]]'', ''[[When Apples Are Picked]]'' and ''[[Girls at a Port]]''. All of these films were awarded the People's Prize before 1974.

==Film production estimates==
The number of films produced in North Korea is difficult to determine. In 1992, ''[[Asiaweek]]'' reported that the country produced about 80 films annually,&lt;ref name="Gluckman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gluckman|first=Ron|title=Cinema Stupido|publisher=[[Asiaweek]]|date=September 1992|url=http://www.gluckman.com/NKfilm.html|accessdate=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a BBC report in 2001 indicated that North Korea was then producing about 60 films a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barron|first=Brian|title=West snubs North Korea movies|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|date=September 5, 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1526628.stm|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these claims, Johannes Schönherr, an attendee of the 2000 [[Pyongyang International Film Festival]], found little evidence for actual films or titles. He notes that the country offered only one domestic feature and one documentary at their most high-profile film festival, and suggests that the high number of reported films includes short films, cartoons, and short installments of long-running series. He also cites a 1998 North Korean pamphlet containing a list of films which had been made in the country up to 1998. This gives a total of 259 titles, and indicates that the 1980s were the most prolific decade with about 15 to 20 films made yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schönherr|first=Johannes|editor=Matthew Edwards|title=Film Out of Bounds; Essays and Interviews on Non-Mainstream Cinema Worldwide|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina, and London|isbn=978-0-7864-2970-7|pages=141–143|chapter=14. A Permanent State of War: A Short History of North Korean Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Film Institute]] [[Sight &amp; Sound]] magazine reported that an average of 20 films per year were made from the 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the economic hard times following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] film production reduced, and from 2000 to 2009 only about 5 films per year were made.&lt;ref name=bfi-200901&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/lonely-place-north-korea-s-pyongyang-international-film |title=In a lonely place: North Korea's Pyongyang International Film Festival |author=James Bell |work=Sight &amp; Sound |publisher=British Film Institute |date=January 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film history ==

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
After the [[division of Korea]] following the [[defeat of the Japanese Empire]] in [[WWII]], filmmakers in the North and the South sought to produce the first Korean film after the liberation in their respective half of the peninsula. Although South Koreans were first, with ''[[Viva Freedom!]]'' (1946), North Korea soon followed with ''[[My Home Village]]''.&lt;ref name="Fischer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Paul|title=A Kim Jong-Il Production: Kidnap, Torture, Murder... Making Movies North Korean-Style|year=2016|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-241-97000-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the secretive nature of the country as well as the lack of film exports, the exact number of feature films produced in North Korea is almost impossible to determine.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The Internet Movie Database ([[IMDb]]) lists only 165 films produced in North Korea; some of which include foreign co-productions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Countries/NorthKorea{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these were released in the years between the liberation from Japan and the outbreak of the Korean War, ''[[Our Construction]]'' (''Uri Geonseol'') (1946) and ''[[My Homeland (film)|My Homeland]]'' ({{korean|hangul=내 고향|mr=Nae gohyang|context=north}}) (1949). Five were released during the war, including ''[[Righteous War]]'' (1950), ''[[Boy Partisans]]'' (1951) and ''[[Again to the Front]]'' (1952). These titles suggest that film was used for ideological purposes from the beginning of North Korea's existence as a separate entity.

Nearly all studios and film archives were destroyed during the [[Korean War]], and after 1953 studios had to be rebuilt.&lt;ref name=bfi-200901/&gt;

Judging from the IMDB's entries,{{OR|date=November 2017}} {{cn span|the 1950s were a relatively productive time for North Korean cinema. Ten of the 165 films listed for the country were produced during this decade. Post Korean War titles seem to reflect a toning down in the militaristic themes, and a turning to more optimistic stories. Titles like ''[[The Road of Happiness]]'' (1956) and ''[[Love the Future (film)|Love the Future]]'' (1959) indicate that films were being used to rally the country into rebuilding after the devastation of the war.|date=November 2017}}

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
''[[A Spinner]]'' (1964) and ''[[Boidchi annun dchonson]]'' (1965) made in the 1960s. One of the most highly regarded films in North Korea, ''[[Sea of Blood]]'', was produced in 1969. The entrance hall to the Korean Feature Film Studio contains a mural of "Dear Leader" [[Kim Jong-il]] supervising the production of this film. This is a two-part, black and white film. The first part is 125 minutes in duration, and the second is 126 minutes.

Kim Il-sung made a famous call for ''[[Juche]]'' art in 1966, saying, "Our art should develop in a revolutionary way, reflecting the Socialist content with the national form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portal|first=Jane|year=2005|title=Art Under Control in North Korea|publisher=Reaktion Books, Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-86189-236-5|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1973 treatise on film entitled ''[[Theory of Cinematic Art]]'', Kim Jong-il further developed this idea of ''Juche'' art into the cinema, claiming that it is cinema's duty to help develop the people into "true communists", and as a means "to completely eradicate capitalist elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.3219.html |title=It ain't Hollywood, but North Korean cinema only has room for one star |publisher=ThingsAsian |date=April 4, 2005 |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology-heavy nature of North Korean cinema during the 1970s can be seen in titles such as ''[[The People Sing of the Fatherly Leader]]'' and ''[[The Rays of Juche Spread All Over the World|The Rays of ''Juche'' Spread All Over the World]]''.

Part of this ideological usage of the arts was a treating of the same subjects repeatedly through various art forms. Consequently, the most prominent films of the era took their stories and titles from pre-existing novels, ballets or operas. The film ''Sea of Blood'' was also an opera and a symphony, as well as the name of an opera company. Future Minister of Culture, Choe Ik-kyu's ''[[The Flower Girl]]''  (1972, 130 min.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykima.org/festival_4th/films_fg.htm |title=2006 San Francisco Korean American Film Festival |publisher=Mykima.org |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later was remade as a dance. This film won a special prize and special medal at the 18th International Film Festival, and is one of the more well-known North Korean films of the 1970s.

''[[Unsung Heroes (film)|Unsung Heroes]]'', a 20-part spy film about the [[Korean War]], was released between 1978 and 1981; it achieved notice outside of North Korea two decades later mainly because [[United States Forces Korea]] defector [[Charles Robert Jenkins]] played a role as a villain and the husband of one of the main characters.&lt;ref name="Kimsoft"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kimsoft.com/2004/UnsungHeroes.htm|year=2004|accessdate=June 18, 2007|last=Lee|first=Wha-rang|publisher=Korea Web Weekly|title=Film Review: The Unsung Heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980–present ===
With 14 listings, the 1980s is the best-represented decade for North Korea at IMDB. A possible turning to less didactic subjects is indicated with a 1986 production of the popular stories like ''[[Chunhyang-jon]]'' (1980 - 155 min.) and ''[[Hong kil dong]]'' ({{ko-hhrm|홍길동|context=north}}) (1986 - 115 min.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Timothy Savage |url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/nkcinema.html |title=The People's Cinema |publisher=Koreanfilm.org |date=December 23, 2000 |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most well-known North Korean film internationally is the giant-monster epic, ''[[Pulgasari]]'' ({{ko-hhrm|불가사리|context=north}}) (1985), directed by [[Abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee|kidnapped]] South Korean director [[Shin Sang-ok]]. Multi-part films promoting the ''Juche'' ideology, including ''[[Star of Korea]]'' and ''[[The Sun of the Nation]]'' were also produced in the 1980s. [[Korean animation|North Korean animation]] produced for domestic consumption is reportedly less politically dogmatic during this period, resulting in a large adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pyongyang watch: Axis of ... cute?|author=Aidan Foster-Carter
|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/DK13Dg03.html
|date=November 13, 2002|newspaper=Asia Times Online Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one international co-production has been filmed in North Korea, ''[[Ten Zan - Ultimate Mission]]'', directed by [[Italians|Italian]] director [[Ferdinando Baldi]] and starring American [[Frank Zagarino]].

IMDB lists only four North Korean films made in the 1990s. ''[[Nation and Destiny]]'' ({{korean|hangul=민족과 운명|mr=Minjokgwa ummyeong|context=north}}) is a 56-part series of movies produced from 1992–1999, on Korean subjects and people like General Choi Duk Shin (parts 1-4) and composer [[Yun I-sang]] (parts 5, 14-16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2001/200110/news10/07.htm |title=Past news |publisher=Kcna.co.jp |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000s appear to be reasonably productive for North Korean cinema, having five listings so far. In a sign of thawing relations, the animated film, ''[[Empress Chung]]'' (2005), is a co-production of South and North Korea. This film is said to be the first released simultaneously in both countries. Another recent North/South co-production is the 3-D animated television series ''[[Lazy Cat Dinga]]''.

The biggest weakness of the game is the single core support from the old gaming engine and the poor memory management that slowed the game down in large cities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The fan base has demanded a recompilation of the source code for years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The '''''Contest of Homer and Hesiod''''' (Greek: ''Ἀγὼν Oμήρου καὶ Ἡσιόδου'', Latin: ''Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi'' or simply '''''Certamen'''''&lt;ref&gt;Conventionally Greek works did not bear titles; the application of a Latin title to Greek works is an ancient tradition: this Latin title was applied in the Renaissance and is a shortened version of the title in the Greek: ''Concerning Homer and Hesiod and their descent and their contest''.&lt;!--does this Greek title appear on a manuscript?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Greek narrative that expands a remark made in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Works and Days'', lines 650−662&lt;/ref&gt; to construct an imagined poetical ''[[agon]]'' between [[Homer]] and Hesiod.  In ''Works and Days,'' Hesiod (without mentioning Homer) claims he won a poetry contest,  receiving as the prize a [[tripod]], which he dedicated to the [[Muses]] of [[Mount Helicon]]. A tripod, believed to be Hesiod's dedication-offering, was still being shown to tourists visiting Mount Helicon and its [[sacred grove]] of the Muses in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' day, but has since vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' ix.31.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Certamen'' itself is clearly of the second century A.D., for it mentions [[Hadrian]] (line 33). [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] deduced&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, "Die Florentinischer Tractat über Homer und Hesiod", in ''Rhetorica'' (Rheinisches museum für philologie)  '''25''' (1870:528-40) and '''28''' (1873:211-49).&lt;/ref&gt; that it must have an earlier precedent in some form, and argued that it derived from the sophist [[Alcidamas]]' ''Mouseion'', written in the fourth century B.C. Three fragmentary [[papyri]] discovered since have confirmed his view.&lt;ref&gt;Koniaris 1971, Renehan 1971, Mandilaras 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; One dates from the third century B.C.,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Flinders Petrie]], ''Papyri'', ed.  [[John Pentland Mahaffy|Mahaffy]], 1891, pl. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; one from the second century B.C. &lt;ref&gt;First published by B. Mandilaras,''Platon''  42 (1990) 45-51.&lt;/ref&gt; (both of these contain versions of the text largely agreeing with the Hadrianic version) and one, identified in a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] text as the ending of Alcidamas, ''On Homer'' (University of Michigan Pap. 2754)&lt;ref&gt;Winter, J. G., "A New Fragment on the Life of Homer' ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''56''' (1925) 120-129 [http://images.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?rgn1=apis_inv;op2=And;rgn2=ic_all;op3=And;rgn3=ic_all;c=apis;q1=2754;back=back1152510816;size=50;subview=detail;resnum=1;view=entry;lastview=reslist;cc=apis;entryid=x-1622;viewid=2754V.TIF]).&lt;/ref&gt; from the 2nd or 3rd century AD.
 
That the story derives in part from the classical period or earlier (and before the ''Mouseion'') has been shown most clearly&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for a 5th-century version of ''Certamen'' is summarised by N.J. Richardson, "The contest of Homer and Hesiod and Alcidamas' ''Mouseion''", ''The Classical Quarterly'' New Series  '''31''' (1981:1-10).&lt;/ref&gt; by two lines from its riddle passage that appear in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]''&lt;ref&gt;lines 1282-83.&lt;/ref&gt; "It does seem easier to suppose that Aristophanes was quoting a pre-existing text of the ''Certamen'' than that Alcidamas appropriated the lines from Aristophanes for a ''Certamen''-like story in his ''Mouseion''," R.M. Rosen observes.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Mark Rosen. "Aristophanes' ''Frogs'' and the ''Contest of Homer and Hesiod''", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''134'''.2, Autumn 2004:295-322. ([http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=classics_papers on-line text])&lt;/ref&gt; The more profound influences of some version of the ''Contest'' on [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs]]'' has been traced by Rosen, who notes the clearly traditional organising principle of the contest of wits (''sophias''), often involving [[Riddle|riddling tests]].

== Content ==

The site of the contest is [[Chalcis]], in [[Euboea]]. Hesiod tells (''Works and Days'' lines 650–662) that the only time he took passage in a ship was when he went from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] to Chalcis, to take part in the [[game|funeral games]] for [[Amphidamas]], a noble of Chalcis. Hesiod was victorious; he dedicated the prize, a bronze tripod, to the Muses at Helicon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Contest'' is adduced by Richard Hunter, (''The Shadow of Callimachus: Studies in the Reception of Hellenistic Poetry at Rome'' (Cambridge University Press) 2006:18) as an expression of the cultural conditions behind  the conspicuous absence of Homer at Helicon.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of Homer.

In ''Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi'' the winning passage that Hesiod selects is the passage from ''Works and Days'' that begins, "When the [[Pleiades]] arise..." The judge, who is the brother of the late Amphidamas, awards the prize to Hesiod. The relative value of Homer and Hesiod is established in the poem by the relative value of their subject matter to the ''[[polis]]'', the community: Hesiod's work on agriculture and peace is pronounced of more value than Homer's tales of war and slaughter.

The work also preserves 17 [[epigrams]] attributed to Homer.  Three of these epigrams (epigrams III, XIII and XVII) are also preserved in the Contest of Homer and Hesiod and epigram I is found in a few manuscripts of the [[Homeric Hymns]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod; Homer; Evelyn-White, Hugh G. (Hugh Gerard), d. 1924 ''Hesiod, the Homeric hymns, and Homerica'' London : W. Heinemann ; New York : Putnam p.467&lt;/ref&gt;

The short text&lt;ref&gt;approximately 338 lines.&lt;/ref&gt; begins with brief sketches of the poets' lives, including their parentage and birth.  It then describes the contest itself, which consists of challenges and riddles that Hesiod poses, to which Homer improvises masterfully, to the applause of the on-lookers, followed by their recitation of what they considered their best passage and the awarding of the tripod to Hesiod; this takes up about half the text and is followed by accounts of the circumstances of their deaths.

==Modern editions==
One modern edition of the Greek text is in volume 5 of T.W. Allen's ''Oxford Classical Text of Homer'' (1912). 

An edition with Greek text and English translation (on facing pages) by Hugh Evelyn-White was published in 1914 as part of the Loeb Classical Library volume titled ''Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica,'' and is now in the public domain and available online.&lt;ref&gt;See References section for links.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">'''Ding Huan''' (丁緩) was a Chinese engineer, inventor, and craftsman who lived in the first century BC during the [[Han dynasty]]. Among the inventions attributed to him is an air conditioning system based on [[Evaporative cooler#History|evaporative cooling]].&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Lance|editor-last1=Day|editor-first1=Lance|editor-last2=McNeil|editor-first2=Ian|title=Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8TsygLyfSMC&amp;pg=PA366|entry=Ding Huan (Ting Huan)|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-65020-0|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported invention of the zoetrope ==
In his multi-volume ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', the British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]] briefly describes several devices he classes as "... a variety of [[zoetrope]], which may well have originated in China".&lt;ref name="NeedhamIV-1"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1962). ''Science and Civilization in China'', vol. IV, part 1: ''Physics and Physical Technology''. Cambridge University Press. p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; The first example he offers used an umbrella-like canopy hung over an oil lamp and provided with a [[turbine|vaned]] opening at its top, so that heated air rising from the lamp would cause it to rotate. The lower part of the canopy was in the form of a cylinder and had translucent panes with paintings of animals or men. Sufficiently rapid rotation would "give an impression of movement" to the painted figures.&lt;ref name="NeedhamIV-1" /&gt; Several later writers have misreported Needham by crediting this particular device to Ding Huan.&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojas|first=Carlos|title=The Oxford Handbook of Chinese Cinemas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8F1pAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-998844-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only such invention Needham attributes to Ding Huan is "a 'nine-storied hill-censer' ... on which many strange birds and mysterious animals were attached. All ... moved quite naturally ... presumably as soon as the lamp was lit."&lt;ref name="NeedhamIV-1" /&gt;

Needham claims these devices "certainly embodied the principle of a rapid succession of images",&lt;ref name="NeedhamIV-1" /&gt; but it is not apparent from any of the descriptions provided that there was anything other than a ''procession'' of painted figures or carvings or cast shadows seen actually moving through space.&lt;ref name="Rojas" /&gt; By contrast, the invention for which the name "[[zoetrope]]" was coined in the 19th century is, like the [[flip book]], an [[animation]] device that creates an ''illusion'' of motion from a series of images showing successive phases of that motion, by rapidly presenting them to the viewer one after another in such a way that each abruptly replaces (or ''seems'' to abruptly replace) the previous one.

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2016}}

{{Nihongo|'''Domo'''|どーも  くん|Dōmo-[[Japanese honorifics|kun]]}} is the official [[mascot]] of [[Japan]]'s public broadcaster [[NHK]], appearing in several 30-second [[stop-motion]] [[Interstitial program|interstitial sketches]] shown as station identification during shows.

==DOMO==
Domo-kun first appeared in short stop-motion sketches on December 22, 1998 to mark the 10th anniversary of NHK's satellite broadcasting.
The name "Domo" was acquired during the second episode of his show, in which a TV announcer said {{Nihongo|"''dōmo, konnichiwa''"|どーも、こんにちは}}, which is a greeting that can be translated as "Well, hello there!", but which can also be interpreted as "Hello, Domo", and thus is a convenient pun (''[[dajare]]''). The [[Japanese honorifics#Kun|kun]] suffix on "Domo-kun", the name used to describe the character in the Japanese versions, is a [[Japanese honorific]] often used with young males.

==Development==
[[Tsuneo Gōda]] directs Domo episodes using [[stop motion]] animation. Gōda says that, by using this process, one can "create a work filled with feeling".&lt;ref name="Target0"&gt;Target (2008). "Halloween Costumes." ''[[Target Corporation]]''. Retrieved on September 14, 2008 from http://www.target.com/b/ref=sc_iw_l_1/602-5034031-3604655?node=15676801{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
'''Domo''', the main character, is a brown, furry and [[oviparous]] monster&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"&gt;Author unknown (date unknown). ''Domomode''. English page. Retrieved on February 5, 2009 from {{cite web|url=http://www.domomode.com/english.html |accessdate=November 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203060736/http://www.domomode.com/english.html |archivedate=December 3, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a large, sawtoothed mouth that is locked wide open. His favorite food is [[nikujaga]], a Japanese meat and potato [[stew]], and he strongly detests [[apple]]s for an unknown genetic reason. According to a [[Tokyopop]] press release of the Domo comic book, Domo "communicates [[sotto voce]] with a verve that only his friends can understand."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://assets.tokyopop.com/contestrules/Domo/DomoRelease.pdf TOKYOPOP PRESENTS: YEAR OF THE DOMO]." [[Tokyopop]]. Retrieved on February 5, 2009. {{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clint Bickham, the writer of the Domo comic book, said that to him Domo's expression is "a sort of cheery wonderment. Like when a kid wakes to a room full of presents on [[Christmas]] day." While Domo's face has variants, to Bickham most of his expressions have "an underlying sense of fascination."&lt;ref name="Bickhaminterview"/&gt; Domo is known to pass gas repeatedly when nervous or upset.&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt; He also sweats when nervous.

Domo lives in a cave with '''Mr. Usaji''',&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;"[http://domonation.com/pages/who Who?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122102928/http://domonation.com/pages/who |date=January 22, 2009 }}."

Mr. Usaji is a wise old rabbit who has lived in a cave for decades, loves to watch television and drink astringent green tea.&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt; Mr. Usaji is not into any "new" materials, and does not own a [[telephone]].&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt; In terms of fashion, Mr. Usaji focuses on materials instead of shapes. Mr. Usaji's favorite food is [[carrot]]s, and his least favorite food is "something that is meaningless."&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt;

Also in the cave live two bats, a mother named '''Maya'''&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt; ({{Nihongo|'''Shinobu'''|しのぶ|}} in the Japanese version) and her child '''Mario''' ({{Nihongo|'''Morio'''|もりお|}} in the Japanese version). Maya suffers from [[alcoholism]]; her favorite foods are seasonal while her least favorite food is alcohol. Mario's favorite food is Japanese-style tomato [[spaghetti]], while his least favorite food is [[shiitake mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

Tashanna, 17 years old, is a weasel who aspires to be a fashion stylist or model in [[Tokyo]] and is always using technology (televisions, mobile phones, and cameras). In English Tashanna has a {{Nihongo|"weaselly accent"|いたちなまり|''itachi namari''}} (bear in mind weasels in Japan are not associated with underhandedness) and ends her sentences with "[[y]]"s. In the Japanese version, she ends her sentences with "chi" (ち).&lt;ref name="DomoModeJapan"&gt;[http://www.domomode.com/japan.html Japanese page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124075401/http://www.domomode.com/japan.html |date=November 24, 2007 }}.

Tashanna's favorite food is [[apricot]] and [[mint (candy)|mint]] [[tart]]s, and her least favorite food is [[sea urchin]].&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt; The Japanese name originates from the word {{Nihongo|"multichannel"|多チャンネル|''tachanneru''}} of digital broadcasting.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Bear Boy''' ({{Nihongo|'''Kogumagorō'''|こぐまゴロー}}), also known as {{Nihongo|'''A Little Bear'''|くまのこ|''Kuma no ko''|literally "A bear cub"}}, is a [[Asian black bear|Moon Bear]] and one of Domo's friends from the neighborhood; the timid cub enjoys playing [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="DomoModeEnglish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

*A [[stop motion|stop-motion]] [[children's television series]] based on the character, titled '''''[[Domo TV]]''''', was co-produced by [[Nickelodeon]] and NHK.

Bickham said that writing the stories became entertaining when he "got into the Domo mindset." The writer said that Domo's thoughts do not need to be expressed in words as they are "always very simple and innocent." Bickham added that sometimes other characters speak for him. Bickham said that the ''Domo: the Manga'' stories "are driven by situations instead of dialogue." To prepare for writing the series, Bickham watched each episode multiple times; Bickham intended to "get a feel for the characters so that the jump from stop-motion to manga would be as seamless as possible." He added that "more than anything, I had to have fun doing it. I don't think you can create a good Domo story without fun."&lt;ref name="Bickhaminterview"/&gt;
*In September 2015, the first music compilation based on Domo, ''Domo Loves Chiptune'', was released on iTunes, Amazon, and all major music streaming services.&lt;ref name="Domo Loves Chiptune Promotional Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domo Loves Chiptune|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nwJkZTrKs|work=[[YouTube]].|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everybody Loves Chiptune &amp; So Do We"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everybody Loves Chiptune &amp; So Do We|url=http://www.dailyrindblog.com/domo-loves-chiptune/|work=[[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]].|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compilation features top artists in the [[Chiptune]] genre such [[Anamanaguchi]] and [[Disasterpeace]]. A Domo Loves Christmas compilation was released in November 2015.
*Domo became well known outside Japan through a mock [[public service announcement]] that circulated on the Internet depicting Domos chasing a kitten with the words stating: "[[Every time you masturbate... God kills a kitten]]." An article from ''[[ICv2]]'' stated: "This phony PSA is quite out of character with Domo's image in Japan."&lt;ref name="Animemated"&gt;"[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8608.html Nickelodeon Gets Anime-Mated]." ''[[ICv2]]''. May 4, 2006. Retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Domo has 5 video games on the DSiWare on the Nintendo DSi Shop application for the [[Nintendo DSi]].  The 5 games are Crash-Course Domo, [[Hard-Hat Domo]], Rock-n-Roll Domo, Pro-Putt Domo and White-Water Domo.&lt;ref name="Animemated"/&gt; The [[Game Boy Advance]] game [[Domo-kun no Fushigi Terebi]] also features Domo-kun.&lt;ref name="Domo-kun GBA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domo-kun no Fushigi Terebi|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/adoj/|work=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Facebook, Domo is featured in the social game Planet Domo.&lt;ref name="planetdomo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Domo|url=https://www.facebook.com/planetdomo|work=Planet Domo application on Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gardi Hutter''' (born 5 March 1953, in [[Altstätten]]) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Clown]]-comedian, author, actress and [[Cabaret]] artist and a clown of the classical rule.

== Life and career ==
Born on 5 March 1953 in Altstätten, Canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland, Gardi Hutter graduated at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zürich (''Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich'') from 1974 to 1977, where she absolved an induction and training in theatre education and [[theatre pedagogy]].  Gari Hutter gave lessons to the students, but she felt unhappy not to practice what she taught. At the ''Centro di ricerca per il teatro'' (CRT) in Milano Gardi Hutter graduated as ''maestros'' (master), being also her so-called ''Clownsgesellenzeit'' (literally: apprenticeship as a clown) of three years to become an approved member of the ''Clown community''. Gardi Hutter was taught by Mario Gonzales, ''[[Pantalone]]'' of the ''Théatre du Soleil'', Nani Colombaioni (''I Colombaioni'') and Ferruccio Cainero of the ''Teatro Ingenuo''.,&lt;ref name="gardihutter-curriculum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardihutter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=166&amp;lang=en|title=Curriculum|publisher=gardihutter.com|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Gardi_Hutter|title=Gardi Hutter|publisher=TLS|author=Corinna Hirrle|language=German|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the national "700-year anniversary" of Switzerland, Gardi Hutter played the women jester in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly Chamber]] of the Swiss Parliament in 1991. For the festival "700 years" of 1998 of her hometown, Gardi Hutter acted as co-writer.

The figures are based on [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] annual reports. As all financial data is given in [[US dollars]] annual rates of change for all countries other than the United States are heavily influenced by [[exchange rate]] fluctuations as well as by actual changes in revenue in local currency terms.

It is important to note that the information presented in this page only accounts for revenue generated from the recorded music industry (recorded music and auxiliary revenues generated by these recordings), and is not reflective of the entirety of the music industry including sectors such as publishing, live music, etc.

The '''Golden Mile''' (or, colloquially, "The Mile") is the popular stretch of [[beach]]front in the city of [[Durban]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]], including the [[promenade]] that runs along with it. It runs roughly from uShaka Beach (where the [[uShaka Marine World]] is located) in [[Point Waterfront]] to [[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]] in the north and now includes a route directly to Moses Mabhida Stadium. It abuts the central business district of the city to its west. 

It is one of the main tourist attractions in the Durban area. The wide stretch of golden sands, artificially separated by various [[piers]], provides excellent opportunities for sun-worshippers and swimmers to enjoy the sub-tropical sunshine and warm waters of the [[Indian Ocean]]. Most of the Mile's beaches are protected year-round by [[lifeguards]] and [[shark]] nets. The Mile is also a well-known [[surfing|surfer's]] haven. The South Beach end, in particular, is well known as a safe beach for neophyte surfers. The beachfront properties are a mix of residential [[apartments]] and tourist [[hotels]], development of which boomed in the 1970s, although remnants of Durban's [[art-deco]] architecture are still evident. Interspersed among the beachfront properties are several popular restaurants and nightclubs.

The Golden Mile has long been a popular [[domestic holiday]] destination and during the holiday seasons (June–July and December–January) 
South Africans from across the country, but in particular the [[Gauteng]] region, flock to enjoy its many attractions, which include:

*[[Blue Lagoon (Durban)|Blue Lagoon]], a popular hangout, picnic and fishing spot
*''Mini Town'' with a miniature replica of Durban, complete with a working miniature railway and airport.
*[[Moses Mabhida Stadium]]
*Traditional market vendors and other hawkers with a selection of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] art and crafts.
*An [[oceanway]] pavement along the beaches to encourage more people to enjoy walking and cycling.
*[[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]], a casino complex with a semi-private beach, restaurants, shops and public entertainment facilities.
*[[uShaka Marine World]] aquarium, water park, dolphinarium, containing a restaurant with the largest shark tank in the world.
*[[North Beach (Durban)|North Beach]], [[Dairy Beach]], the [[Bay of Plenty (Durban)|Bay of Plenty]], Snake Park, Pirates and Country Club beaches are popular [[surfing]] beaches separated by the piers.
*The Skate Park in front of the Bay of Plenty caters for skateboarders, roller bladers and BMX'ers.
*The Surfing Museum, a historical site cataloguing some of Durban's surfing history.

'''Heavy metal guitar''' (or simply '''metal guitar''') is the use of highly-[[guitar amplifier|amplified]] [[electric guitar]] in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), pp. 14, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metal guitar playing is rooted in the guitar playing styles developed in 1960s-era [[blues rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]],&lt;ref&gt;Fast (2005), pp. 89–91; Weinstein (2000), pp. 7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and it uses a massive sound, characterized by highly amplified [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], extended [[guitar solo]]s and overall loudness. The [[electric guitar]] and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.&lt;ref name=W23&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Robert (1993). ''Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music''. [[Wesleyan University Press]]. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8195-6260-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy metal bands often have two electric guitarists, with one guitarist playing [[rhythm guitar]] and one guitarist playing [[lead guitar]]. The rhythm guitar player is part of the [[rhythm section]] of the band, along with the [[electric bass|bass guitarist]] and the [[drum kit|drummer]]. The lead guitarist plays [[guitar solo]]s, instrumental melody lines and [[Fill (music)|melodic fill passages]]. In [[power trio]]s, which consist of a guitarist, bassist and drummer, with one or more members singing [[lead vocal]]s, the single guitarist will switch between rhythm guitar and lead guitar roles as needed.

==Rhythm guitar==
[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Children of Bodom - 08.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=A color photograph of two members of the group Children of Bodom standing on a stage with guitars, drums are visible in the background|The guitarists from [[Children of Bodom]], performing at the 2007 [[Masters of Rock (festival)|Masters of Rock]] festival]]
The rhythm guitar player is part of the [[rhythm section]] of the band, along with the [[electric bass|bass guitarist]] and [[drum kit|drummer]] (and in some bands, a keyboard player). The rhythm guitarist typically plays [[power chord]]s and [[riff]]s using an electric guitar that is plugged into a [[guitar amplifier]], with either the amplifier and/or a [[distortion (music)|distortion]] [[stompbox|effect pedal]] creating a thick, heavy, distorted sound. The rhythm guitar player plays chords and riffs that create, along with the bass and drums, the rhythmic sound of a metal song. The rhythm guitar also plays the [[chord progression]] of a song, along with the bass player (and, if the band has one, the [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player). 

In 1966, the British company [[Marshall Amplification]] began producing the Marshall 1963, a guitar amplifier capable of producing the distorted "crunch" that rock musicians were starting to seek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=A. J.|first1=Millard|title=The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUlt7Q71_ssC|year=2004|publisher=JHU Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Doyle|first=Michael|title=The History of Marshall: The Illustrated Story of "The Sound of Rock"|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=1993|pages=28–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E90tMBs9_FEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=marshall+amplifier+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JaPGTbf1M4WCsQPY6fnrAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=overdrive&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7935-2509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With rhythm guitar parts, the "heavy crunch sound in heavy metal...[is created by] [[palm muting]]" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshallamps.com/images/web%20tuition/lesson4.html "Lesson four- Power chords"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819035422/http://www.marshallamps.com/images/web%20tuition/lesson4.html |date=2007-08-19 }}. Marshall Amps.&lt;/ref&gt; Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.&lt;ref&gt;''Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity''. By Glenn Pillsbury. Routledge, 2013
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rhythm guitarists sing [[lead vocals]] or [[backup vocals]] simultaneously as they play guitar.

==Lead guitar==
[[File:Eddie Van Halan - 77 in New Haven.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Eddie Van Halen]] soloing in 1977]]
The lead guitarist plays [[guitar solo]]s, instrumental melody lines and [[Fill (music)|melodic fill passages]]. [[Guitar solo]]s are "...an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar" to the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Most heavy metal songs "... featur[e] at least one guitar solo",&lt;ref&gt;Walser, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; which is "... a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickinson |first=Kay |date=2003 |title=Movie Music, the Film Reader|url= |location= |publisher=Psychology Press |page=158 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is [[nu metal]] bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revolvermag.com/lists-2/final-six-the-six-best-worst-things-to-come-out-of-nu-metal.html |title=Final Six: The Six Best/Worst Things to Come out of Nu-Metal |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |last2= |first2= |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=Revolver magazine |access-date=21 September 2015|quote=The death of the guitar solo[:] In its efforts to tune down and simplify riffs, nu-metal effectively drove a stake through the heart of the guitar solo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shred guitar]] or "shredding" is a virtuoso lead guitar solo playing style for the electric guitar that is used in a number of metal genres. Shredding uses a range of fast playing techniques, such as "[[sweep picking|sweep-picked]] [[arpeggio]]s, diminished and harmonic minor scales, finger-[[tapping]],&lt;ref name="historydec2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house-o-rock.com/HouseofShred/features/shredhistory/history_1201.htm |title=History of Shred: Uli Jon Roth - December 2001 - The House of Shred |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006083532/http://house-o-rock.com/HouseofShred/features/shredhistory/history_1201.htm |archivedate=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fast scale and arpeggio runs and special effects such as [[tremolo bar]] "[[dive bomb]]s". Metal guitarists playing in a "shred" style use the electric guitar with a [[guitar amplifier]] and a range of [[effects unit|electronic effects]] such as [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], which create a more sustained guitar tone and facilitate [[audio feedback|guitar feedback]] effects.

In 1978, a "heretofore unknown guitarist named [[Eddie Van Halen]]" from Los Angeles released "'[[Eruption (song)|Eruption]]', a blistering aural assault of solo electric guitar" which featured rapid "[[tapping]]", which "had rarely been heard in a rock context before". Chris Yancik argues that it is this "record, above any other, that spawned the genre of Shred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house-o-rock.com/HouseofShred/features/shredhistory/history_1001.htm |title=History of Shred: Eddie Van Halen |publisher=House of Shred |last=Yancik|first=Chris |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006083521/http://house-o-rock.com/HouseofShred/features/shredhistory/history_1001.htm |archive-date=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lead guitarists sing [[lead vocals]] or [[backup vocals]] when they are not playing guitar solos.

===Equipment===

{{Listen|filename=Guitar Divebomb.ogg|title=Dive bomb effect|description=[[Dive bomb]] effect, a typical deep pitch bend using a whammy bar; followed by [[string noise]].|format=[[Ogg]]|image=[[Image:Jackson Randy Rhoads JS20-6.jpg|100px]]}}
Shred guitar players often use electric solidbody guitars such as [[Ibanez]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]], [[Kiesel Guitars|Kiesel/Carvin]], [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], [[Charvel]], [[Schecter Guitars|Schecter]] and [[ESP guitars|ESP]]. Some shred guitarists use elaborately-shaped models by [[B.C. Rich]] or [[Dean Guitars|Dean]], as well as modern versions of classic-radical designs like [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]'s [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]] and [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]] models. [[Tremolo bar]]s (also known as "whammy bars"), which are hinged bridges that can be bent down or up in pitch, are an important part of shred playing, as they permit the "dive bombing" effect and many sounds which are not possible with a fixed-bridge instrument.

Guitars with double-cutaways give performers easier access to the higher frets. Many guitar makers are now making a "scalloped cutaway" which was popularized by Irron R. Collins IV. This removes material on the backside of the "horn" allowing extended room for the fretting hand to get extended reach onto the higher notes of the fretboard. Some shred guitarists, such as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpion]]s' [[Ulrich Roth]], have used custom-made tremolo bars and developed modified instruments, such as Roth's "Sky Guitar, that would greatly expand his instrumental range, enabling him to reach notes previously reserved in the string world for cellos and violins."&lt;ref name="historydec2001" /&gt;

Some shred guitar players use [[seven string guitar|seven]] or [[eight string guitar|eight]] string guitars to allow a greater range of notes, such as [[Steve Vai]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Most shred guitar players use a range of [[effects unit|effects]] such as [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] and [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]] units, both of which increase sustain and facilitate the performance of shred techniques such as [[tapping]], [[hammer-on]]s, and [[pull-off]]s. These and other effects units, such as [[delay effect]]s are also used to create a unique tone. Shred-style guitarists often use high-[[distortion (guitar)|gain]] [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers such as [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Carvin Corporation|Carvin]], [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]], [[Mesa Boogie]], [[ENGL]], [[Laney Amplification|Laney]], [[Hughes &amp; Kettner]] and [[Randall Amplifiers|Randall]]. To facilitate the use of [[audio feedback]] effects with the guitar, shred guitarists use high gain settings, distortion pedals and high on-stage volume.

==Loudness==
[[File:MarshallStack Slayer.jpg|thumb|A 3×6 stack of [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] guitar cabinets for [[Jeff Hanneman]] of [[Slayer]]]]
Electric guitarists in metal use large, powerful [[guitar amplifier]]s, typically with multiple large [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinets]]. Some metal guitarists use 18 or more speaker cabinets, with each cabinet containing four 10" speakers. Following the lead set by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Who]], early heavy metal acts such as [[Blue Cheer]] set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's [[Dickie Peterson|Dick Peterson]] put it, "All we knew was we wanted more power."&lt;ref name=vdqxbw&gt;Walser (1993), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how "excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Sutcliffe quoted in Waksman, Steve. [http://www.echo.ucla.edu/volume6-issue2/waksman/waksman3.html "Metal, Punk, and Motörhead: Generic Crossover in the Heart of the Punk Explosion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618140351/http://www.echo.ucla.edu/volume6-issue2/waksman/waksman3.html |date=2007-06-18 }}. ''Echo: A Music-Centered Journal'' 6.2 (Fall 2004). Retrieved on November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein states that powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to "sweep the listener into the sound" and to provide a "shot of youthful vitality".&lt;ref name=W23/&gt;

In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that "[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male"&lt;ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake |first=Mike |editor1-last=Frith |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Goodwin |editor2-first=Andrew |title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word |publisher=Routledge |date=1990 |pages=87–91 |chapter=Heavy Metal Culture, Masculinity and Iconography |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...[a]t least until the mid-1980s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walser |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=Running with the Devil:Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |url= |location= |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=76 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from "... exceptions such as [[Girlschool]]".&lt;ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"/&gt; However, "...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Chuck |date=1 July 2011 |title=Women of Metal |journal=Spin |location= |publisher=SpinMedia Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kim |date=17 January 2013 |title=Queens of noise: heavy metal encourages heavy-hitting women |journal=The Telegraph|volume= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that most heavy metal musicians are male, most metal guitarists are male. Almost all of the most well-known metal guitarists in major bands are male.

Women have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the "... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;

Notable women metal guitarists include:
*[[Lita Ford]] (born 1958) is an American [[rock music|rock]] guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, who was the lead guitarist for [[The Runaways]] in the late 1970s before embarking on a solo career in the 1980s. In 1975, at age 16, Ford was recruited by recording [[impresario]] [[Kim Fowley]] to join the [[all-female rock band]] he was assembling called [[The Runaways]]. Ford's guitar playing was a key part of the band's sound. After The Runaways disbanded, Ford signed with [[RCA Records]] in the 1980s and developed a [[Glam metal|pop-metal]] sound.

[[Image:Jerusalem Modell BW 2.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Scale model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period, Israel Museum]]
The '''Holyland Model of Jerusalem''' is a 1:50 [[scale-model]] of the city of [[Jerusalem]] in the late [[Second Temple]] Period. The model was moved from its original location at the Holyland Hotel in [[Bayit VeGan]], Jerusalem, to a new site at the [[Israel Museum]] in June 2006.&lt;ref name='haaretz'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=732574 |title=Rock of our existence |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211063731/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=732574 |archivedate=February 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|thumb|200px|Herod's Temple model at Holyland Hotel in 1998]]
The model, measuring 2,000 square meters (21,520 square feet) was commissioned in 1966 by Hans Kroch, the owner of the Holyland Hotel, in memory of his son, Yaakov, an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldier who was killed in the [[Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948. The model was designed by Israeli [[historian]] and [[geographer]] [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] based on the writings of [[Flavius Josephus]] and other historical sources. The model includes a [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|replica of the Herodian Temple]]. From 1974, [[Yoram Tsafrir]] superintended the Holyland Model of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Wharton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wharton|first=Annabel Jane|title=Selling Jerusalem: Relics, Replicas, Theme Parks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1_BBK-LsesC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=15 August 2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89422-5|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the model was relocated to the southern edge of the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden at the [[Israel Museum]]. In preparation for the move, the model was sawn into 1,000 pieces and later reassembled. The Holyland Hotel spent $3.5 million on the move.&lt;ref name='haaretz' /&gt;

The '''Iron Jaw''' is a traditional aerial [[Circus#Acts|circus act]].
[[Image:Spelterini LeonaDare.JPG|thumb|100px|Newspaper advertisement for Leona Dare's ascents from Crystal Palace in London.]]

The act consists of a performer raised into the air by a cable, [[trapeze]] or other similar apparatus, supported only by a [[bit (horse)|bit]] clamped between her teeth.  Depending on the apparatus the bit is attached to, the performer can alternately swing in circles around the ring below or spin wildly in place, controlling speed by alternately extending her arms and legs out or bringing them in close to her body to speed up (known as the  [[conservation of angular momentum]] principle).

The act is frequently referred to as the '''Human Butterfly''' due to the removable wings which traditionally adorn the performer's costume.

It is also known as the 'Jaws of Life'.&lt;ref&gt;https://bookpage.com/interviews/22173-chloe-benjamin#.W2l58yOZORY&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Tiny Kilne, in a footnote to her memoir, describes Iron Jaw as:

"(a) holding one's grip by the teeth bulldog-fashion, suspended in the air; (b) lifting another person's weight; (c) juggling furniture or tugging an automobile- in short, any work involving teeth-power."

There are now only 5 Iron jaw artist in the world in the 21st century:

*Rebecca Ostroff has been performing iron jaw since 1993, she is still performing iron jaw she has been the Ring Master for Kelly Miller Circus from 2015-2017 USA

*Igor Zaripov still performs. He holds the Guinness world record 3 times for Iron Jaw. He is also an actor working all over the world in films and circuses. Zaripov  was born in Russia and now lives in the USA

[[Playing cards]] (''carte da gioco'') have been in [[Italy]] since the late 14th century. As Latin suited cards, they use swords (''spade''), cups (''coppe''), coins (''denari''), and clubs (''bastoni''). All Italian suited decks have three [[face cards]] per suit: the ''fante'' ([[Jack (playing card)|Knave]]), ''cavallo'' ([[Knight (playing card)|Knight]]), and ''re'' ([[King (playing card)|King]]), unless it is a [[Tarot card games|tarocchi]] deck in which case a ''donna'' or ''regina'' ([[Queen (playing card)|Queen]]) is inserted between the ''cavallo'' and ''re''. Italian suited cards normally only refer to cards originating from northeastern Italy around the former [[Republic of Venice]] as the rest of Italy uses [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish suits]], [[French playing cards|French suits]] or [[German playing cards|German suits]]. Until the late 19th century, Italy was composed of many smaller independent states or under foreign occupation which led to the development of various regional patterns. Italian suited cards are largely confined to northern Italy, parts of [[Switzerland]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bay of Kotor|southern]] [[Montenegro]]. Popular games include [[Scopa]], [[Briscola]], [[Tressette]], [[Bestia (game)|Bestia]], and [[Sette e mezzo]].

==History==
[[File:Tarot-cary-collection-ita-sheet-3s-c1500..jpg|thumb|Milanese tarocchi c. 1500|left|180px]]
Playing cards arrived from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] during the 1370s. Mamluk cards used suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks.  As [[polo]] was an obscure sport, Italians changed them into batons.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|ref=Dummett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was a collection of small states so each region developed its own variations. Southern Italy was under strong Spanish influence so their cards closely resemble the ones in Spain. Northern Italian suits used curved swords instead of straight ones and their clubs are ceremonial batons instead of cudgels. Swords and clubs also intersect unlike their Spanish counterparts.

[[Tarot]] cards were invented during the early 15th century in northern Italy as a permanent suit of [[trump (card games)|trump]]s ([[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]). Italian-suited cards are rarely found outside of Northern Italy. In the past, however, tarot cards based on those from Milan, the [[Tarot of Marseilles]], spread to France, Switzerland, and most of central and northern Europe before being replaced by French-suited tarots during the 18th and 19th centuries. In a few places in Switzerland, the Italian-suited [[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]] is still used for games. 

The Venetian game of [[Trappola]] also spread northwards until dying out in the mid-20th century. The Greek word for playing card, "Τράπουλα", is a transliteration of Trappola.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; It may have entered into the Greek language from the [[Ionian Islands under Venetian rule|Venetian-occupied Ionian Islands]] during the 16th century. In [[Corfu]], [[Aspioti-ELKA]] produced Venetian pattern cards until the [[Greco-Italian War]].

40-card [[stripped deck]]s lacking the 8s, 9s, and 10s are the most common format found in Italy today. This is the result of popular 16th and 17th century games like [[Primero]] and [[Ombre]].  
{{clear}}

==Trentine, Bresciane, and Bergamasche==
[[Image:Trentine pattern.png|thumb|Trentine deck]]
These three patterns are closely related, having been formed in close proximity to one another. The [[Trento|Trentine]] pattern is believed to be the oldest surviving Italian pattern and the origin of the [[Brescia|Bresciane]] and [[Bergamo|Bergamasche]] patterns. Trappola cards may also have originated from this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-37.html Trento pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trentine cards are sold in either packs of 40 or 52. The smaller deck is missing the 8s through 10s. The larger deck comes with a pair of [[Joker (playing card)|Jokers]]. All the Kings sit on thrones and the cards are not reversible. The cards utilize only five colors: black, white, red, blue, and yellow which has led to face cards with blue, yellow, and red hair. Trentine [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] also have numerals though not always in the corner. These cards are wider than the two below.

The Bresciane deck comes only in sets of 52 cards and are not reversible. The cards are slightly more colorful, adding green and brown. Only the 7 and 9 of Swords are numbered and they are found within the pips.

The Bergamasche pattern comes in decks of 40 cards only. They are reversible or double-headed, meaning they can be turned upside down. None of the pip cards are numbered and color is added to the faces of the characters.

==Trevisane and Triestine==
The [[Treviso|Trevisane]] deck, also known as the Trevigiane, [[Venice|Venetian]] or [[Veneto]] deck, comes in sets of 40 or 52.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-35.html Venice pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller set is missing ranks 8 through 10 while the larger often includes two Jokers to bump it up to 54 cards. The face cards are reversible and the pip cards have corner indices.

Closely related is the [[Trieste|Triestine]] pack, which was created in the mid-19th century and was once available in 52 card sets but now only 40 card decks are sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-36.html Trieste pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Though ranks 8 through 10 were removed, the face cards are still numbered 11 through 13.  The face cards are reversible with each half separated by white box that labels the card, a feature usually found only in some tarot decks. This is the only deck in which both face cards and pip cards are numbered though not always in the corner.

These patterns can be found in some regions that used to be part of the Venetian Republic's [[Stato da Màr]].

==Primiera Bolognese and Tarocco Bolognese==
[[Image:Carte primiera bolognese al completo.png|left|thumb|Primiera Bolognese deck]]
Cards from [[Bologna]] are sold in two sets, the 40 card Primiera Bolognese set and the 62 card [[Tarocco Bolognese]] set. The Primiera set is used for standard games like [[Primero]] while the Tarocco set is used to play [[Tarocchini]]. The Primiera set goes from ranks Ace to 7, Knave, Knight, and King. The Tarocco set goes from ranks 6 to 10, Knave, Knight, Queen, King, and Ace.&lt;ref name="Bologna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=22–23, 30–31|ref=Bologna}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ranks that they share in common appear very similar but are not identical.

The Tarocco set's trump cards are also different from other [[tarot]] decks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-11.html Tarocco Bolognese] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While it has 21 trump cards, only trumps 5 to 16 are numbered and four of the lower trumps are considered equal. The [[The Magician (Tarot card)|Magician]] is an unnumbered trump and ranks as the lowest. All the face cards and trumps are reversible. Tarocco sets by [[Dal Negro]] includes two Jokers that aren't used in any tarocchini games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.trionfi.eu/WWPCM/decks06/d04910/d04910.htm Tarocco Bolognese decks] at the World Web Playing-Card Museum. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tarocco Piemontese and Swiss 1JJ==
The [[Tarocco Piemontese]] is a 78-card tarot deck from [[Piedmont]] and the most popular tarot playing deck in Italy. It is derived from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-4.html Tarocco Piemontese] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the traditional Piemontesi deck which uses French suits, the tarot deck uses Italian suits. [[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]] is numbered as 0 despite not being a trump card. Trumps and most pip cards have indices in modern Arabic numerals (for trumps, cups, and coins) or Roman numerals (for swords and batons). The face cards and trumps are reversible.&lt;ref name="Piemontese"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=31–34|ref=Piemontese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dal Negro]]'s decks include two Jokers that aren't used for tarot games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.trionfi.eu/WWPCM/decks05/d02970/d02970.htm Tarocco Piemontese decks] at the World Web Playing-Card Museum. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swiss 1JJ Tarot|Swiss 1JJ]] is a 78-card tarot set descended from the Tarot of Besançon, an offshoot of the Marseilles tarot, and is still used in pockets of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-7.html Swiss Tarot] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having Italian suits, the trumps are labelled in French or German. They are not reversible and the trumps and pip cards use Roman numeral indexing. They are used by the [[Romansh people|Romansh]] to play [[Troccas]] and by [[German-speaking Switzerland|German Swiss]] to play [[Troggu]].

The club has been owned throughout its existence by former [[motorcycle speedway]] rider Sam Jukes, who started the club with two friends in 1969 after his sporting career was ended by injury.&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt;  It began operation as a disco night held in the [[social club]] at the former home stadium of [[Dudley Town F.C.|Dudley Town Football Club]] and was intended to raise extra funds for the cash-strapped club.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63661695.html|title=First rung on the ladder to stardom|work=[[The Birmingham Post]]|first=Gideon|last=Burrows|date=25 July 2000|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It quickly outgrew these premises and relocated to a 250-capacity venue behind a menswear shop on King Street in the early 1970s, before moving to its present location on Castle Hill in 1994, which afforded a capacity of 1000.&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt;  Jukes states that he named the club after John Bryant, a local DJ who was popular with women, as he felt his association with the venue would help bring in customers,&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt; although rumours persist that it was named after [[Led Zeppelin]] drummer [[John Bonham]], a native of nearby [[Redditch]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; It has now re-open for venue bookings such as parties and marriages.

In 2008, rumours circulated that the venue might be subject to a [[compulsory purchase order]] and closed down as part of a multimillion-pound redevelopment scheme for the town centre.  A spokesman for [[Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council]] stated, however, that this was not part of the plan at that time, although the redevelopment might extend to include Castle Hill at a future date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2008/02/14/threat-hanging-over-club/|title=Threat hanging over club|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=1 April 2010|work=[[Express &amp; Star]]|location=[[Wolverhampton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club [[went into administration]] during 2010, and it was hoped that a buyer would be found to continue to run the club in its then-present state but new ownership failed to materialise and the club was closed in January 2011. The site of the club was eventually sold in late 2012 and was briefly transformed into a conference and banqueting centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/08/30/date-set-for-reopening-of-legendary-club-jb%E2%80%99s/|title=Date set for reopening of legendary club JB’s|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=17 February 2013|work=[[Express &amp; Star]]|location=[[Wolverhampton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/dudley-venue-jbs-gets-new-191591&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerts==
[[File:Firewind, JB's img 4989.jpg|thumb|right|256px|[[Gus G.]] of [[Firewind]] playing at JB's in 2007]]
The venue has hosted performances by [[U2]], [[UB40]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Skunk Anansie]], [[The Stone Roses]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Doctor Feelgood]], Sister Love [[Radiohead]] and [[Judas Priest]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;  It also regularly hosted concerts by up-and-coming local bands.  The three leading bands of the so-called "[[Stourbridge]] music scene" of the early 1990s, [[Pop Will Eat Itself]], [[The Wonder Stuff]] and [[Ned's Atomic Dustbin]], all cite the venue as a major influence over their early careers.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;  In 2000, the venue celebrated its 30th anniversary by hosting a two-day music festival at nearby [[Dudley Castle]] featuring [[Terrorvision]], Ned's Atomic Dustbin, and former Wonder Stuff frontman [[Miles Hunt]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;

[[Frank Sidebottom]] maintained that his set at JB's -- a poorly-attended gig at which the audience collectively decided to play football instead of watch the band -- was the best gig he ever did.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/12/frank-sidebottom-movie-michael-fassbender-chris-sievey&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ketoprak''''' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]: '''''Kethoprak''''') is a theatrical genre of [[Java]] featuring actors who may also sing to the accompaniment of the [[gamelan]]. It draws its stories from Javanese history and romances and in this differs from ''[[wayang wong]]'', which shares with ''[[wayang kulit]]'' a repertoire drawn from the Hindu epics [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]], as well as from ''[[ludruk]]'' which uses contemporary settings and the [[fourth wall|three-walled]] ''[[srimulat]]'', which specializes in [[vampire]] stories. According to [[Clifford Geertz]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Religion of Java'' (Chicago 1960) p.289&lt;/ref&gt; it was invented as recently as 1923.

Ketoprak troupes might own or rent a performance building, such as Ketoprak Srimulat that used to be performed in a theatre both in Jakarta and Surabaya back in the 1980s, or troupes might travel through villages. The travelling ketoprak troupe is called ''Kethoprak Tobong'', also known as ''Ketoprak Tonil''. It might be considered as common people theatrical tradition in Java. The show were performed in certain period in an empty plain near a village and moved from one place to another, in fashion similar to western travelling [[circus]]. In this traveling troupe, the performers and staffs also brought show properties; such as costumes, stage decorations, chairs, gamelan, sound system, diesel electric generator, all were contained in a portable building that also used as set or stage called ''"tobong"''. During their journey, the troupe members also living in this ''tobong''.&lt;ref&gt;Risang Yuwono, Kethoprak Tobong Kelana Bhakti Budaya&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently ketoprak has been adopted into television show, the "Ketoprak Humor" show was aired in Indonesian national television. It is a comedy and action performance, often took place in modern settings or in historical ancient Javanese kingdoms. The ketoprak that took the story of ancient Java is quite similar with [[Wayang wong]] performance, however ketoprak performance is more free for improvisations, jokes and adoption of popular languages, while Wayang wong are traditionally highly stylized with precise and structurized dance drama discipline.

{{wikisource|Lara (Byron)}}
'''''Lara, A Tale''''' is a [[rhyme]]d, [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Lord Byron]]; first published in 1814. 

==Background==
The first work composed after Byron abandoned the idea of giving up writing and buying back his copyrights, it is regarded by critics as a continuation of the autobiographical work begun in ''[[The Corsair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, George Gordon; ''Lara; The Siege of Corinth; Parisina; The Prisoner of Chillon; The Dream'' Kessinger publications reprint 2004, editor's notes p16&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''The Corsair'', it was published anonymously, in conjunction with [[Samuel Rogers]]' ''Jacqueline''.&lt;ref&gt;''London Quarterly Review'' Vol. 11 1814&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lara, A Tale'' was first published anonymously by Lord Byron in 1814 alongside another poem that was not written by Byron. In this version, there is nothing to distinguish between ''Lara'' and ''Jacqueline'' (written by Samuel Rogers), as they were published anonymously and without any indication that there are two separate authors within the text. This tragic narrative poem is seen as a continuation of another poem of Byron’s, ''The Corsair''. It details Count Lara’s return home after spending a few years travelling abroad. With a page as his only company, Lara’s story continues as he encounters problems with his fellow men. First, this leads to a duel that Count Lara ends up winning and as the story progresses, he must also fight both friends and foes. Count Lara is successful in his battle against all odds, until one night he encounters a large group and attempts to fight them. Unfortunately, he is mortally wounded in the process and dies at the end of the poem.

The first drafts of the poem are from 1814. The copy text that Byron wrote for the first edition was made between June 14 and June 23, 1814. There were subsequent corrections made but none of the materials have been found. Sometime after August 5, 1814, ''Lara'' was published with ''Jacqueline'' for the first time. The first three editions were published together and anonymously, selling almost 7,000 copies. When the fourth edition was released, the tale was published by itself and under Byron’s name.

==Summary==

The narrative poem recounts the story of the fateful return of Count Lara to his home after spending years abroad traveling the [[orient]]. One of Byron's footnotes explains that, even though the name "Lara" is of Spanish origin, "no circumstance of local or national description fix[es] the scene or hero of the poem to any country or age". &lt;ref&gt; Byron, George, Gordon. "Lara." ''The Corsair ''and'' Lara''. Ed. Peter Cochran. 2009. 52-85. p.52. https://petercochran.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/the_corsair_and_lara.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to his patrimony with a retinue consisting of one foreign-born page, Kaled, Count Lara resumes the management of his landed estates. Lara's first efforts are crowned with success: only to be undermined by the jealousy and envy of his peers. After a successful duel to defend his honour, the count becomes inexorably caught up in local blood-feuds; which quickly escalate to open warfare between his own followers and the private armies of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, George Gordon. ''The Poems of Lord Byron''. London: Oxford University Press, 1945. pp. 303-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting against insuperable odds with desperate courage, Count Lara rallies the remnant of his shattered forces and makes for the border to regroup. During a forced night march he is intercepted by a large opposing force: and in the course of the ensuing battle he is mortally wounded, and is retired from the fighting due to the good offices of his ever-faithful oriental page.

As Count Lara lies dying he is confronted by his nemesis, Count Otho, but ignores the latter's taunts to address his dying words to his page in a foreign tongue unknown to his countrymen. Otho arranges the obsequies, but Count Lara's page refuses to desert the graveside, his grief rendering him immune to Otho's threats and pleas not to abandon his former master.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, George Gordon. ''The Poems of Lord Byron''. London: Oxford University Press, 1945. pp. 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kuwait]] is one of a hundred countries that have submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

''The Cruel Sea'' is the first feature film ever to be made in one of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] countries &lt;ref&gt;http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&amp;xfile=data/theuae/2007/october/theuae_october216.xml&lt;/ref&gt; and Kuwait became the first and thus far only GCC nation to submit a movie to the Academy Awards, in 1972. ''The Cruel Sea'' played at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and concerns the story of a young man from a poor, [[pearl diving]] family who loves a young woman from a merchant family who is betrothed to an elderly man. Six years later, Kuwait submitted ''The Wedding of Zein'', about a pious village idiot who becomes the object of affection of a beautiful local girl. Since 1978, Kuwait has not submitted any more films, making it one of only three participating countries-the other two being Cameroon and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] that has not submitted films in the past thirty years. Pakistan was another one as well but since they have submitted one in 2013, Kuwait is now the 2nd longest amount of time country has gone without submitting in another one.

[[File:Bartolomeo Pagano - Maciste.JPG|frame|[[Bartolomeo Pagano]] as Maciste.]]
'''Maciste''' ({{IPA-it|maˈtʃiste}}) is one of the oldest recurring [[fictional character|characters]] in [[film|cinema]], created by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and [[Giovanni Pastrone]]. He cuts a heroic figure throughout the history of the [[cinema of Italy]] from the 1910s to the mid-1960s.

He is usually depicted as a [[Hercules]]-like figure, utilizing his massive strength to achieve heroic feats that ordinary men cannot. Many of the 1960s Italian films featuring Maciste were retitled in other countries, substituting more popular names in the titles (such as Hercules, Goliath or Samson).

==Name==
There are a number of references to the name in literature. The name of Maciste appears in a sentence in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' (Book 8, Chapter 3, Section 21), in which he writes: {{lang|grc|ἐν δὲ τῷ μεταξὺ τό τε τοῦ Μακιστίου Ἡρακλέους ἱερόν ἐστι καὶ ὁ Ἀκίδων ποταμός}} — "And in the middle is the temple of the Macistian [[Heracles]], and the river Acidon."  The epithet Μακίστιος (Makistios, Latinized as ''Macistius'') is generally understood to be an adjective referring to a town called Μάκιστος (Makistos) in the province of [[Triphylia]] in [[Elis]].
In the first volume of the ''Dizionario universale archeologico-artistico-technologico'' (1858) ''Macistius'' is given as one among several epithets of Hercules (''Ercole'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xcceAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA607 Dizionario universale archeologico-artistico-technologico, contenente: Archeologia .... Belle arti .... Arti e mestieri ...], Luigi Rusconi, Tip. G. Favale e comp., 1859, p. 607&lt;/ref&gt; In the second volume of the same dictionary (1864) this name appears Italianized as ''Maciste'', defined as ''uno dei soprannomi d'Ercole'' ("one of the nicknames of Hercules").
According to William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology'', ''Macistus'' (Μάκιστος) was "a surname of [[Heracles]], who had a temple in the neighbourhood of the town of Macistus in Triphylia". Makistos was also the third child of [[Athamas]] and [[Nephele]], according to the [[Greek mythology]].

In the original draft outline of the 1914 film ''[[Cabiria]]'' by director [[Giovanni Pastrone]], the muscular hero's name had been ''Ercole''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LzPavb8xTVUC&amp;pg=PA34 Theatre to Cinema: Stage Pictorialism and the Early Feature Film], Benjamin Robert Brewster, Lea Jacobs, Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQyRX6WmMUMC&amp;pg=PA477 The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology], Roger D. Woodard, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; In the revised script, writer [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] gave the character the name ''Maciste'', which he understood (based on the above or similar sources) to be an erudite synonym for Hercules.  
&lt;br&gt;
By later writers using the character the original etymology was generally forgotten, and a [[folk etymology]] was constructed based on the name's superficial similarity to the Italian word ''macigno'' "large stone"; in the first of the 1960s films, Maciste tells another character in the film that his name means "born of the rock", and in a later film, Maciste is actually shown in one scene appearing from within a solid rock wall in a cave as if by magic.&lt;ref&gt;

Maggie Günsberg in ''Italian Cinema: Gender and Genre'' claims that d'Annunzio used two sources: one from ancient Greek, ''makistos'', meaning "longer," (though [[Doric Greek]] μάκιστος actually means "greatest", "tallest", or "longest in time") and the second from a supposed Latin word ''macis'' meaning "rock". No such word as ''macis'' exists in Latin. The [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''macigno'' ultimately derives from Latin ''machina'' used in the sense of "millstone".&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Cabiria''==
Maciste made his debut in the 1914 [[Italy|Italian]] [[silent movie]] classic ''[[Cabiria]]''. ''Cabiria'' was a story about a slave named Maciste (played by [[Bartolomeo Pagano]]) who was involved in the rescue of a [[Rome|Roman]] princess named Cabiria (played by [[Lidia Quaranta]]) from an evil [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[priest]] who plotted to sacrifice her to the cruel god [[Moloch]].  The film was based very loosely on ''[[Salammbo]]'', a [[historical novel]] by [[Gustave Flaubert]], and had a plot and screenplay by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

Maciste's debut set the tone for his later adventures. Including ''Cabiria'' itself, there have been at least 52 movies featuring Maciste, 27 of them being pre-1927 silent films starring Bartolomeo Pagano and the other 25 being a series of sound/color films produced in the early 1960s.  Typical plots involve tyrannical rulers who practice vile [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] rituals or worship evil [[god]]s. Typically, the young lady who is the love interest runs afoul of the evil ruler. Maciste, who possesses superhuman strength, must rescue her. There is often a rightful king who wants to overthrow the evil usurper, as well as a [[belly dance]] scene. There is often an evil queen who has carnal designs on the hero. These films were set in locales including [[Mongolia]], [[Peru]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Roman Empire]].

==Bartolomeo Pagano's Maciste films==
[[Image:Maciste01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Original trade ad for the first of the Maciste silent film series]]As a character, Maciste had two distinct moments in the spotlight. The first was in the Italian silent movie period, in which the original Maciste from ''Cabiria'', the muscular actor [[Bartolomeo Pagano]], starred in a series of at least 26 [[sequel]]s over the period from 1915 through 1926. Then decades later, (following on the heels of the success of the two 1950s Steve Reeves "Hercules" films) Maciste was revived by Italian filmmakers for a series of 25 sound films (all made between 1960 and 1965).

The Bartolomeo Pagano silent Maciste films established the character as someone who could appear at any place and at any time.  Some of the earlier ones, made during [[World War I]], had the distinct flavour of [[propaganda]], and cast the hero in the role of a soldier.  Later films in the series return to [[fantasy]], but the fantasy was not always mythological.  Maciste appears as an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athlete, in contemporary settings, or in the [[afterlife]].  His character and his plots remained consistent in whatever setting; he was always a [[populism|populist]] Hercules, using his physical prowess to overcome the evil ruses of effete [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and authority figures.
[[Image:Maciste-MarkForest.jpg|thumb|250px|[[bodybuilding|Bodybuilder]] [[Mark Forest]] played Maciste in the 1961 film "Maciste l'uomo più forte del mondo"]]

==Revival of the 1960s==
The character was revived in the 1960s. In 1957, [[Steve Reeves]]' ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', an Italian production, created a minor boom in Italian dramas featuring [[United States|American]] bodybuilders in vaguely [[mythology|mythological]] or [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[history|historical]] subjects. Maciste was the hero in 25 of these films. Other films starred such heroes as Ursus, Samson, Hercules and Goliath.

Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed, nor was he confined to one specific time period/setting in his adventures. However, in the first of the 1960s Maciste films, he mentions to another character that the name "Maciste" means "born of the rock" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled "The Giant from the Dolomite" (another reference that he was not born as an ordinary mortal man would have been). Hence it is hinted that Maciste is more god than man, which would explain his great strength.

This [[sword and sandal]] fad continued for about six years, until the new fad for [[spaghetti Western]]s and spy films took over the attention of the [[Italian cinema]] industry. The name Maciste was not in the title of the [[English language|English]] versions of most of these films: when the films were imported into the USA and dubbed in English, the hero's name was often changed to Hercules, [[Samson]], [[Goliath]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], Ulysses or Colossus, because the name Maciste was not widely recognised in the USA.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Alansteel23.jpg|thumb|Sergio Ciani, AKA: Alan Steel, as Hercules... who can be distinguished from Maciste by the presence of his beard]] --&gt;
Some Italian sword and sandal films were not theatrically released in the USA; rather they premiered on American television in a syndication package called ''[[The Sons of Hercules]]'', usually broadcast on Saturday afternoons. Best remembered for its stirring theme song, films originally featuring Maciste were dubbed into a variety of different "Sons of Hercules" pictures, with stock narration at the opening attempting to tie the film's lead character in to Hercules any way they could. A number of Italian musclemen played Maciste in the 1960s films, but Mark Forest was the actor who played Maciste the most (7 times). The other actors included [[Gordon Scott]], [[Reg Park]], [[Gordon Mitchell]], [[Reg Lewis (actor)|Reg Lewis]], [[Kirk Morris]], [[Samson Burke]], [[Alan Steel]], [[Richard Lloyd (actor)|Richard Lloyd]], [[Renato Rossini]] and [[Frank Gordon (actor)|Frank Gordon]].

==Influence==
* The ''Cabiria'' scene in which Maciste pushes a mill wheel for ten years seemingly{{or|date=December 2015}} inspired [[John Milius]], who shot a similar one for his movie ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982).
* [[Federico Fellini]] claimed that ''Maciste all'inferno'' (1926) was the first movie he remembered seeing as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Fellini, Making a Film, Contra Mundum Press, 2015, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; His 1954 film ''[[La Strada]]'' features a brutish strongman performer.
* The 1960s adventures have been enjoyed mostly by devotees{{who|date=April 2013}} of [[camp (style)|camp]] style. Two of the films, ''Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste'' (translated as ''[[Colossus and the Headhunters]]'') and ''Maciste e la regina di Samar'' (as ''[[Hercules Against the Moon Men]]'') appeared on the comedy television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in the 1990s. In ''Colossus and the Headhunters'', the pronunciation of Maciste's name was frequently mocked as "my cheesesteak."
* The legendary Belgian strongman [[John Massis]] based his pseudonym on Maciste.
* The 2006 film ''[[The Caiman]]'' features an Italian exploitation film producer who made the film ''Machiste Against Freud''.
* In the 2013 film ''[[Il Futuro]]'' [[Rutger Hauer]] plays a retired actor and bodybuilder nicknamed "Machiste" for having starred in the role in the 1960s.

===The 1960s film series (in chronological order)===

There were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930).  By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves ''Hercules'' films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character ''Maciste'' in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the [[Ice Age]] to 16th Century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name "Maciste" means "born of the rock" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled "The Giant from the Dolomite", hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength. &lt;br&gt;
The first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses. (Note how many times Maciste's name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):

* ''[[Maciste il Vendicatore dei Mayas]]'' / ''[[Maciste, Avenger of the Mayans]]'' (has no American title, 1965) (Note* This Maciste film was made up almost entirely of re-edited stock footage from 2 older Maciste films, ''[[Maciste contro i mostri]]'' and ''Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste'', so Maciste switches from Kirk Morris to Reg Lewis in various scenes; this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the USA and is not available in English.)

===The 1973 films of Jesús Franco===
In 1973, the Spanish cult film director [[Jesús Franco]] directed two low-budget "Maciste films" for French producers: ''Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones'' (''Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons'') and ''Les exploits érotiques de Maciste dans l'Atlantide'' (''The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis''). The films had almost identical casts, both starring [[Wal Davis]] as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a "Karzan" movie (a cheap [[Tarzan]] imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as ''Les Gloutonnes'' ("The Gobblers"). Despite their titles; these two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series; Maciste was presented as a 16th-century French adventurer who travels overseas to exotic lands.

== History ==
It was established as a body corporate on 8 June 1964 under the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation Ordinance no. 7 (1964). Prior to that date it operated as a Government Service under the name of Mauritius Broadcasting Service.

The original ordinance establishing the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation was amended and consolidated by Acts of Parliament: Act no. 65 of 1970, Act no. 22 of 1982 and Act no. 65 of 1985. These amendments were necessary to accommodate interalia changes at both technological and social levels as well as to satisfy the aspirations of all segments of the Mauritian nation.

TV broadcasts started on a pilot basis in 1964 with the installation of three repeater stations at Fort George, Mount Thérése and Jurançon. On 8 February 1965, television was officially launched with a daily evening transmission of about three hours. The first live local program was broadcast on the occasion of the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra in 1968.

The phasing out process of black and white television started in 1973 and indeed the OCAMM Conference which was held at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in the same year was broadcast live in colour ([[SECAM]] system). By 1978 the MBC was fully equipped for the broadcast of colour programs. The MBC started it operation in [[Rodrigues]] on 7 November 1987. A second channel was launched on 30 July 1990, the [[MBC 2 (Mauritius)|MBC 2]]. The [[MBC 3 (Mauritius)|MBC 3]] became operational in March 1996.

In 2005, the MBC was the first public television broadcaster in Africa to launch Digital Terrestrial Television channels. In 2007, the MBC also extent its digitalized service to the islands of [[Rodrigues]] and [[Agaléga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmediaforms.wetpaint.com/page/Digital+Terrestrial+Television+Broadcasting+(DTT)+in+Mauritius|publisher=newmediaforms|title=Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting in Mauritius - History |accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the MBC move from its former headquarter in [[Curepipe|Forest Side, Curepipe]] to Moka. The Bhojpuri Channel and Senn Kreol was launched in January 2013.

In 2012, the President of the Republic stated that the MBC is run with a mindset of unfairness, partiality, and is not worthy of a democratic nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ifex.org/mauritius/2012/03/23/partial_and_unfair/|title=Island republic's television stations a "tool of the government," says president - IFEX|work=IFEX|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2016, MBC rebranded the logo of its 17 channels and introduced a standardised logo with different colour variations for each channel. Additionally, new onscreen graphics were introduced.

MBC broadcasts many of its own shows, promoting the country and the physical and mental health of the people of Mauritius.

On 1 December 2016, the MBC released the [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mbc.intnet.mu.mbcplay&amp;hl=en '''MBC play'''] app, which is still under development, on Google Play Store, allowing users around the globe to stream Live TV &amp; radio channels of the corporation. Later on, after releasing a stable version, this app is also expected to be available on the Apple App Store.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11078">'''Meno Fortas''' is a theatrical production facility and theater group in [[Vilnius]] formed and directed by [[Lithuania]]n [[Eimuntas Nekrošius]] since 1998. It was specifically created for the production of works under this director, but is also active in the formation of young theater arts professionals and the promotion of Lithuanian theatre tradition both at home and abroad. The institution does not have its own theater and performs heavily abroad at theatre festivals. The institution is known for its streamlined stagings, heavy on metaphor, with most of its stories based on known plays, including major works by [[Shakespeare]], [[Anton Chekov]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].  These productions are an extension of Nekrošius’s directing career which began in the 1970s.
==The institution==
Meno fortas was formed in 1998 as a private, non-profit institution by Eimuntas Nekrošius, [[Nadežda Gultiajeva]] and The Ministry of Culture of the [[Lithuania|Republic of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.menofortas.lt/index.php?id=245 |title= Introduction |date=25 September 2011 |publisher=Meno Forte }} &lt;/ref&gt; (shorthis) The name translates to “fortress of art,” and applies to the Vilnius-based production facility as well as the theater company.&lt;ref name="otelo"&gt; {{cite news |title= El Otelo de la compañía Meno Fortas destaca el drama de la vida del hombre |author= Merry MacMasters |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/10/07/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Othello of the Meno Fortas company highlights the drama of the man’s life }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakas"&gt; {{cite journal |last= Nakas |first= Kestutis |date=May–June 2007 |title= The Lions of Lithuanian Theatre |journal=American Theatre |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=54–59 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the institution is to produce works created and/or directed by Lithuanian director Eimuntas Nekrošius in Lithuania and abroad. Most of these works represent Lithuanian theatrical tradition and are promoted by the company to a wider audience. However, it also works to on collaborative projects with other institutions, training young theater artists, organize various types of cultural events financed by both public and private monies.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shorthis"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://etu.szinhaz.org/english/menofortas.shtml |title= Meno Fortas |publisher= Union des Theatres del Europe |accessdate= September 25, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt; Meno Fortas has been a member of the [[Union of the Theatres of Europe]] since 2000.&lt;ref name="shorthis"/&gt;

There are different artists working constantly in the studio, chamber concerts and performances are taking place here as well. After 2007, the group added chamber theatre to its repertoire.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; Meno Fortas does not have its own building, but rather rents space for its offices and rehearsal rooms and performances are held in rented theatres.&lt;ref name="shorthis"/&gt; The company performs about fifty times a year outside of the country, mostly of works such as Song of Songs, The Seasons by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]] and the Shakespeare trilogy of [[Hamlet]], [[Macbeth]] and [[Othello]].&lt;ref name="propuesta"&gt; {{cite news |title= Llega al Cervantino la propuesta escénica de Meno Fortas |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=October 27, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The purposeful scenery of Meno Fortas arrives to the Cervantino }} &lt;/ref&gt; The group is part of strong theatre scene in that exists in the capital of Vilnius despite the country’s poverty. It also has a very strong tradition of the theater being dominated by its directors.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;
== Eimuntas Nekrošius==
Eimuntas Nekrošius, born 1952, is a graduate of the [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts|Lunacharsky Art Institute]]  (today Russian Academy of Theatre Arts) in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="artact"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.artactmagazine.ro/eimuntas-nekrosius1.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101021065435/http://www.artactmagazine.ro/eimuntas-nekrosius1.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= October 21, 2010 |title= Eimuntas Nekrosius |date= April 16, 2010 |publisher= Art Act Magazine |location= Romania |accessdate= September 25, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He began is directing career as the “[[enfant terrible]]” of the [[Vilnus State Youth Theater]], working there from 1978 to 1991, with a short stint from 1979 to 1980 at the [[Kaunas National Drama Theatre]].&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt; During the [[USSR|Soviet era]], major works that he produced include such as ''The Square'' by Yeliseyeva in 1980, L''ove and Death in Verona'' by Antanėlis and Geda (1982), ''Pirosmani, Pirosmani, A Day Longer Than a Hundred Years'' by Aitmatov (1983) and ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' by Chekhov (1986).&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt; Of these the two most important were ''The Square'' and ''Uncle Vanya''. In the first, life in prison was measured by counting sugar cubes, which audiences interpreted as a metaphor for Soviet life and in the latter, Astrov’s maps were tiny postage stamps, which Yelena viewed through a very large magnifying screen.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eimuntas"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.menofortas.lt/en/nekrosius |title= Eimuntas Nekrošius |date=25 September 2011 |publisher=Meno Forte }} &lt;/ref&gt; This performance of Uncle Vanya broke the tradition of staging this play set by [[Constantin Stanislavski]] .&lt;ref name="stpete"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://petersburgcity.com/news/culture/2003/10/21/menofortas/ |title= The XII Union of European theatres Festival brings the works of Eimuntas Nekroshius to the city |first= |date=October 21, 2003 |publisher= PetersburgCity.com |location=St. Petersburg, Russia |accessdate=September 25, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; His performances produced by the LIFE Festival include ''Mozart and Salieri'', ''Don Juan'', ''Plague'' by Pushkin (1994), ''Three Sisters'' by Chekhov (1995) and ''Love and Death in Verona'' (1996), all of which were also presented at various international theater festivals.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;  This work popularized a new trend in Lithuanian theatre based on poetry and metaphor, with the main focus on psychology and emotion with relatively plastic acting. Scenery, while sparse, is important to give multiple layers to the use of metaphor.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt;  Nekrošius has continued with this style of production as founder and director of Meno Fortas, founded 1998.&lt;ref name="eimuntas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt; The director has received a number of awards for his work include best stage director of the year by Lithuanian Critique, the New Reality in Europe Theater by the Europe Theater Union and the Taormina Art Festival committee and the UBU Premium of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt;

==Productions and performances==
Menos Forte has continued with Nekrošius streamlined, metaphoric staging. One example of this style is seen in the group’s production of [[Faust]]. Its depiction of Faust is marked by the main character slowly walking downstage as other actors are flicking ropes to makes waves in yellow light. When in the middle of them, he panics, grabs his heart and falls. The ropes then cover Faust.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;

Meno Forte’s shows are financed as international co-productions and are presented more often abroad than in Lithuania.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;  One of its signature pieces, ''Hamlet'', actually precedes the group as it was first performed at the LIFE Festival in 1997, being performed there for five year in a row. However, the characteristics of this piece would define Meno Fortas, as it starred a Lithuanian pop singer in the title role and featured a huge, melting chandelier made of ice hovering over the scene.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shorthis"/&gt; The piece has been performed by the group in nearly all of Europe’s main theatre festivals, winning many awards.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt; 

Macbeth was created after the formation of the theater group, premiering in 1999.&lt;ref name="shorthis"/&gt;  In 2001, Othello was first premiered at the [[Venice Biennale]], followed by the first opera Macbeth at the Teatro Comunale in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="otelo"/&gt; The three Shakespeare pieces, ''Hamlet'', ''Macbeth'' and ''Othello'' are heavily dependent on the performance of the actor in the title role.  This reliance on a single main actor has forced the company to cancel shows when this actor cannot perform.&lt;ref name="cancela"&gt; {{cite news |title= La compañía Meno Fortas cancela el montaje de Hamlet en el FIC |author= Fabiola Palapa Quijas |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/10/10/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Meno Fortas company cancels its showing of Hamlet at the FIC }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Other productions include a version of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Pedro Calderón’s]] ''La vida es sueño'' with the Compañía Estable of [[Colombia]], [[Cornamusa, SA]] of [[Mexico]] and [[Teatro 4]] of [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="cancela"/&gt;

In 2003, the company created a production called ''The Seasons'', based on an epic poem by Lithuanian writer [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]. In the same year, a production of Anton Chekov’s ''The Cherry Orchard'' was produced with Russian actors.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;

In 2004, the company produced a play based on the Old Testament called ''The Song of Songs'',&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt; and ''the Cherry Orchard'' received the top prize at the [[Golden Mask (Russian award)|Golden Mask Festival]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name="nakas"/&gt;

In 2005, two operas were produced called the ''Children of Rosenthal'' by [[Leonid Desyatnikov]] at the [[Bolshoi Theater]] in Moscow and ''Boris Godunov'' at the Teatro Comunale in Florence.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;

Another major work by the group is called ''[[Faust]]'', base on the version by Johan Wolfgang.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt; This piece has been performed for various years in various countries including the [[Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico]].&lt;ref name="propuesta"/&gt; Another 2006 production is ''Valkyrie'', based on [[Ride of the Valkyries|the musical piece by Richard Wagner]], and which was staged at the [[Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theater]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;

In 2008, the company performed ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' at the Emilia Romagna Teatro in [[Modena]] and an opera called ''The Legend of Invisible city of [[Kitez]]'', at the [[Teatro Lirico di Cagliari]] and Bolshoi Theater.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;

The most recent production by the company include a large scale show based on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]’s ''[[The Idiot]]''.&lt;ref name="artact"/&gt;

'''Mr. Bubbles''' is one of several [[brand name]]s that have been used by an entity variously known as Chemtoy, Tootsietoy, and StromBecKer for its [[soap bubble|bubble]]-blowing solution. The company is currently owned by J. Lloyd International and markets under [[TootsieToy]]. J. Lloyd International also owns the rights to the name StromBecKer. It still contains a traditional "[[magic wand]]."

The formula of Mr. Bubbles is proprietary and is among those preferred by bubble trick performers such as [[Sterling Johnson (performer)|Sterling Johnson]] to make up part or all of the mixtures they use. It is also used by [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrbubbles.com/history.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530192523/http://www.mrbubbles.com/history.html |date=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Bubbles celebrated its 75th year of operation in 2008 with the release of several new products,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrbubbles.com/bubblefigures.html#1210  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618002229/http://www.mrbubbles.com/bubblefigures.html#1210 |date=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a classic Mr. Bubbles Figure Bank, which converts to a [[bank]] when the solution is gone.

'''MrsP.com''' is a free children's entertainment website.  It stars actress [[Kathy Kinney]] as Mrs. P, a redheaded Irishwoman who reads classic children's stories from her "Magic Library."  The target audience for the website is kids between the ages of 3-12, and its goal is to "encourage a lifetime love of reading." &lt;ref&gt;International BusinessTimes Online http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20081110/sitcom-star-debuts-comic-kids-show-to-promote-love-of-reading.htm Retrieved on 2008-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has no advertising and no subscription fees.  The site is produced by Mrs P Enterprises, LLC and was created by Kinney, who played Mimi on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', TV writer and producer [[Clay Graham]], and former entertainment and New Media executive Dana Plautz.

== Content ==
The primary content offered on MrsP.com is a library of [[streaming video]] episodes.  The episodes range in length from 5–30 minutes and feature the Mrs. P character seated near a fire in her "Magic Library."  She offers a short, often humorous introduction, usually based on one of her youthful adventures and related in some way to the story she is about to read.  She then reads the story directly to the camera.  The videos include illustrations or photographs, but focus primarily on the emotive performances of the storyteller "in the hope that viewers will use their imaginations." &lt;ref name=Carpenter2010&gt;[[Susan Carpenter]], "Mrs. P has a story for you, kids"  http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-et-mrs-p10-2008nov10,1,2661628.story  Los Angeles Times, 2008-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Stories''' read by Mrs. P on the website include ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MrsP.com, online video library  http://www.mrsp.com Retrieved on 2008-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  New stories are added every few weeks.

The site also features an animated game in which a stuffed dog, Spyri, comes to life, as well as a "window" in which various visitors appear, including actor Robert Blanche (''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'') as a singing policeman trying to woo Mrs. P.&lt;ref&gt;MrsP.com, Credits  http://www.mrsp.com  Retrieved on 2008-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Development of MrsP.com began in April 2007, when [[Clay Graham]], who had been the head writer and an executive producer of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', first had the idea of creating a "storytelling" website.  Dana Plautz, who had been a marketing executive at [[Hanna-Barbera]], joined soon after as a partner and co-president, and they approached [[Kathy Kinney]], who was their "first -- and only -- choice" to play Mrs. P.&lt;ref name=Carpenter2010/&gt; Kinney also is co-president and co-creator of the website.&lt;ref&gt;MrsP.com, Credits  http://www.mrsp.com  Retrieved on 2008-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site launched at midnight on November 10, 2008.  Its production offices are in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Los Angeles]].  [[Powell's Books]], the world's largest [[independent bookstore]], supports the site with a "Mrs. P Aisle" on its website, [http://www.powells.com  www.powells.com], and with other promotional activities.&lt;ref&gt;Powell's Bookstore Online  http://www.powells.com Retrieved on 2008-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. P made her first national TV appearance on Dec. 6, 2008 in a live broadcast from the Manhattan [[FAO Schwarz]] Toy Store for the [[CBS]] ''[[Early Show]]''.  She recommended her favorite children's books for the holiday season and read ''[[The Princess and the Pea]]'' to an audience of children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/05/earlyshow/series/perfect_holiday/main4651497.shtml cbsnews.com, "Mrs. P's Picks:Best Children's Books"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2008, MrsP.com began offering videos from its library for purchase and download on the [[iTunes Store]].  Ten percent of all MrsP.com's after-tax profits will be donated by Mrs P Enterprises, LLC to literacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;refer=conews&amp;tkr=AAPL%3AUS&amp;sid=aVznMVBC5T4U Bloomberg.com, "Mrs. P Reads Classic Children's Stories on iTunes."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. P made an appearance at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, the nation's largest book fair, on April 25, 2009.  She read to a crowd of several hundred children and parents from the Target-sponsored Children's Stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.mrsp.com/news.asp MrsP.com Press Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2009, MrsP.com won the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval.  In its review, the Center called the website "beautifully conceived" and "beautifully rendered," adding that "the site felt extremely genuine in its desire to help children develop a love of reading and did so by creating a fun environment for them" in which to be read to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnpc.com/search/tnpcarticle2.asp?rec=6263 The National Parenting Center website, "MrsP.com Review, Spring 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

TeachersFirst.com, a website resource "by teacher, for teachers" reviewed MrsP.com in May, 2009, stating "You almost want to toast marshmallows on the open fire as you cyber-curl under Mrs. P's feet by the fireplace."  The teacher's website also said MrsP.com "will thrill your eager readers for hours" - although warning "do not even try this one on a slow connection." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersfirst.com/single.cfm?id=9687 TeachersFirst.com, MrsP.com review, May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 2009, MrsP.com was chosen by the American Library Association as one of its "Great Web Sites for Kids."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/gwstemplate.cfm?section=greatwebsites&amp;template=/cfapps/gws/displaysection.cfm&amp;sec=19 American Library Association website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Assange]], the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with ''[[Nieuwsuur]]'' published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources.&lt;ref name="nieuws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2124316-assange-belooft-nieuwe-onthullingen-over-clinton.html |title=Assange belooft nieuwe onthullingen over Clinton |first= |last=Nieuwsuur |date=August 9, 2016 |language=Dutch |publisher=Nieuwsuur |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unbidden, Assange brought up the case of Seth Rich. When asked directly whether Rich was a source, Assange nodded, then said "we don't comment on who our sources are".&lt;ref name="youtube_Kp7FkLBRpKg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg |title=Julian Assange on Seth Rich |first= |last=Nieuwsuur |date=August 9, 2016 |publisher= |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent statements by WikiLeaks emphasized that the organization was not naming Rich as a source.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morton |first=Joseph |url=http://www.omaha.com/news/crime/wikileaks-offers-reward-for-help-finding-omaha-native-seth-rich/article_cfb287bc-5e98-11e6-ae0c-8b471b8cbfbb.html |title=WikiLeaks offers $20,000 reward for help finding Omaha native Seth Rich's killer |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For context, Assange was well-known as a longtime critic of Clinton,&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/11/assange-clinton-should-quit-045756 |title=Assange: Clinton should quit |first=Jennifer |last=Epstein |date=November 30, 2010 |publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it subsequently came to light that WikiLeaks communicated with the Trump campaign over other issues, casting doubt on Assange's motivation.&lt;ref name="DMs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/11/15/wikileaks-julian-assange-donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton/ |title=Julian Assange's Hatred of Hillary Clinton Was No Secret.

In April 2018, Twitter direct messages revealed that even as Assange was suggesting publicly that WikiLeaks had obtained emails from Seth Rich, Assange was trying to obtain more emails from the hacker [[Guccifer 2.0]], who was at the time suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence. ''BuzzFeed'' described the messages as "the starkest proof yet that Assange knew a likely Russian government hacker had the Democrat leaks he wanted. And they reveal the deliberate bad faith with which Assange fed the groundless claims that Rich was his source, even as he knew the documents' origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collier |first=Kevin |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/kevincollier/assange-seth-rich-lies-guccifer-wikileaks-hannity |title=These Messages Show Julian Assange Talked About Seeking Hacked Files From Guccifer 2.0 |work=BuzzFeed News |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks' supporters on social media argued Assange's actions were consistent with WikiLeaks' mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilmour |first=David |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/guccifer-wikileaks-seth-rich/ |title=Does the Guccifer-WikiLeaks Story Exonerate Seth Rich? |date=April 6, 2018 |work=The Daily Dot |accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debunking===
The conspiracy theories have been debunked by law enforcement,&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;&lt;ref name="politifact" /&gt; as well as by [[fact-checking websites]] like [[PolitiFact.com]],&lt;ref name="politifact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="politifactgillin"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[PolitiFact.com]] |first=Joshua |last=Gillin |url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/26/patriotcriercom/conspiracy-theory-comey-hid-seth-richs-ties-wikile/ |title=Conspiracy theory that Comey hid Seth Rich's ties to WikiLeaks based on retracted story |date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snopes.com]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and [[FactCheck.org]].&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}

The [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] described the murder as related to a bungled attempted robbery,&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; and said "the assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; The FBI told PolitiFact.com that the MPD was investigating the homicide.&lt;ref name="politifactgillin" /&gt;

Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham said the police had no information suggesting a connection between Rich's death and data obtained by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

People who worked with Rich said he was not an expert computer hacker helping to leak information to foreigners. Andrew Therriault, a data scientist who had mentored Rich, said although he had recently been working as a programmer, this "wasn't his background", and another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard hackers associated with Russian intelligence services had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_january_18_2017" /&gt;

Rich family representative, Brad Bauman, responding to the conspiracy theorists' claim that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was investigating the case said, "The FBI is not now and has never been a party to this investigation."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;

FactCheck.org analyzed statements by [[Newt Gingrich]] related to the conspiracy theory, where Gingrich said Rich "apparently was assassinated" subsequent to "having given WikiLeaks something like … 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments".&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; FactCheck.org determined this claim was "unsupported" and determined "there's no evidence for his claim."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;

PolitiFact.com said the assertion that Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks is a "baseless claim", concluding "Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."&lt;ref name="politifact" /&gt; In a separate analysis, PolitiFact.com concluded: "There's no evidence there's any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong."&lt;ref name="politifactgillin" /&gt;

Snopes.com looked into the matter and stated: "We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder — it is an MPD investigation." Snopes contacted a spokesman for the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, who said, "All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Snopes rated the claim "DNC staffer Seth Rich sent 'thousands of leaked e-mails' to WikiLeaks before he was murdered" as "False".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The fabrications were described as [[fake news]] and falsehoods by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="fakenewsendures" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the persistence of false claims, concluding: "fake news dies hard".&lt;ref name="fakenewsendures" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the conspiracy theories "unsubstantiated rumors".&lt;ref name="shalby" /&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the power of fake news to spread virally online.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; The paper used the example as a case study of the persistence of fake news, and found that television news media can be a soft target for such false stories.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' further found that the proliferation of fake news via Facebook had decreased, but remained powerful on Twitter due to spread via online bots.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; They found that the conspiracy theories with the largest potential to spread on the Internet were those that held attraction for both the alt-right movements and the political left wing.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' concluded that even if a particular false story had been sufficiently debunked, such fact-checking was unable to stop the spread of the falsehoods online.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt;

===Wheeler lawsuit===
On August 1, 2017, Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Butowsky who was the first to claim links between Seth Rich's murder and the DNC hack on Fox, but who later appeared to retract his claims, filed a lawsuit (Case 1:17-cv-05807 Southern District of New York), in which 21st Century Fox, the Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and [[Ed Butowsky]] are named as defendants, stating that quotes attributed to him in the original Fox News piece were fabricated. The lawsuit also alleges that the fabricated quotes were included in the Fox News story at the urging of the Trump White House.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bump |first=Philip |date=August 1, 2017 |title=A timeline of the explosive lawsuit alleging a White House link in the Seth Rich conspiracy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/01/a-timeline-of-the-explosive-lawsuit-alleging-a-white-house-link-in-the-seth-rich-conspiracy/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |location=|access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540783715/lawsuit-alleges-fox-news-and-trump-supporter-created-fake-news-story |title=Behind Fox News' Baseless Seth Rich Story: The Untold Tale |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text messages and audio apparently supporting this assertion were included in the filing of the lawsuit. About a month before the story was aired on Fox News, Wheeler and Butowsky met at the White House with the White House Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]] to review the planned story on Seth Rich's murder. After talking to Wheeler and Butowsky, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft of a story without any quotes from Wheeler on May 11. On May 14 Butowsky texted Wheeler saying ''"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure."'' Butowsky also left a voicemail for Wheeler which said ''"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;
Butowsky said [[Seymour Hersh]] confirmed a link between Rich and the FBI. Hersh confirmed the conversation with Butowsky but told NPR the link was "gossip" and that Butowsky exaggerated its significance.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In an email to Fox News Butowsky also wrote about the purpose behind the Seth Rich story: ''"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion (between) Trump and the Russians."'' He also instructed Wheeler that ''"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections (...) If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

When the story aired on Fox News, it included supposed quotes from Wheeler and was written as if the accusations against the DNC came from him. Wheeler alleges that the quotes were fabricated and should not have been attributed to him.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In later recordings Butowsky told Wheeler that the claims being attributed to him were false but says that ''"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say."'' He also says ''"I know that's not true, if I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Judge [[George B. Daniels]] dismissed this lawsuit in August 2018.&lt;ref name="lawsuits dismissed"&gt;{{cite news |last=Segers |first=Grace |title=Seth Rich case against Fox News dismissed by federal judge |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-rich-case-dismissed-by-federal-judge/ |publisher=CBS |date=August 2, 2018 |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family's reactions===

In May 2017, Seth Rich's brother Aaron Rich issued a statement saying, "We simply want to find his killers and grieve. Instead, we are stuck having to constantly fight against non-facts, baseless allegations, and general stupidity to defend my brother's name and legacy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The family spokesperson said "At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies."&lt;ref name="Wash Post Weigel 2017-05-21 Gingrich"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/21/gingrich-spreads-conspiracy-theory-about-slain-dnc-staffer/ |title=Gingrich spreads conspiracy theory about slain DNC staffer |date=May 21, 2017|access-date=May 21, 2017 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] PowerPost blog |author=[[David Weigel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents authored a piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on May 23, 2017 titled: "We're Seth Rich's parents. Stop politicizing our son's murder," in which they wrote:

{{Quote|We are asking you to please consider our feelings and words. There are people who are using our beloved Seth's memory and legacy for their own political goals, and they are using your outrage to perpetuate our nightmare. We ask those purveying falsehoods to give us peace, and to give law enforcement the time and space to do the investigation they need to solve our son's murder.&lt;ref name="washpostparents" /&gt;}}

In March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich.

'''''My Father and the Man in Black '''''is a 2012 Canadian documentary film directed and produced by Jonathan Holiff about the stormy relationship between country music star [[Johnny Cash]] and the filmmaker's father, Saul Holiff, Cash's personal manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKay|first=Hollie|title=New info on Johnny Cash will 'shock and surprise,' documentary director says|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/03/new-info-on-johnny-cash-will-shock-and-surprise-ducumentary-director-says/|work=Fox 411|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It qualified for Oscar consideration in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reaney|first=James|title=My Father &amp; The Man in Black on Oscar list: Report|url=http://blogs.canoe.ca/brandnewblog/entertainment/my-father-the-man-in-black-on-oscar-list-report/|work=James' Brand New Blog|publisher=London Free Press|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holiff was inspired to produce the film when he stumbled on his father's storage locker filled with audio diaries and a large assortment of other documents relating to his time in the 1960s and 1970s as Cash's manager. The locker also included a framed gold record of "[[A Boy Named Sue]]" which went on display at the Grand Theatre during the running of their musical ''[[Ring of Fire (musical)|Ring of Fire]]''.

==Production==
The film employs historically accurate flashbacks, starting with how Holiff met Johnny Cash when he hired him to sign autographs at his "Sol's Square Boy" drive-in in [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reaney|first=James|title=More Saul Holiff: A #ldnont quiz &amp; a Mel-O-Dene &amp; Capers hero remembers the Man|url=http://blogs.canoe.ca/brandnewblog/general/more-saul-holiff-a-ldnont-quiz-a-mel-o-dene-capers-hero-remembers-the-man/|work=James' Brand New Blog|publisher=London Free Press|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollif went on to sign Cash to a number of other music gigs and Cash hired him to be his manager, with a contract written on the back of a paper napkin.

The film is narrated by Jonathan Holiff, interlaced with archival audio by [[Johnny Cash]] and Saul Holiff.

The structure of the film interlocks the relationship of Cash and Saul, and often pans to the relationship of Saul with Jonathan. His son often resented his father's time on the road. There is an emphasis of the rift between Cash and Saul, caused by Cash's status as a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and Saul as an [[atheist]], and how their relationship spiraled out of control. [[Variety.com]] comments on the unique structure of this film: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Documentaries as expressions of filial trauma usually fail to generate audience empathy. But with its posthumous, anguished, first-person confessional revolving around the larger-than-life Man in Black this one partly transcends its inherent self-indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/my-father-and-the-man-in-black-review-1200596432|title=‘My Father and the Man in Black’ Review: Poignant Documentary Looks at Johnny Cash, Manager - Variety|work=Variety|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and awards==
''My Father and the Man in Black'' has had mixed reviews from critics in the United States. The film has a "Fresh" rating (63 percent) on critic review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_father_and_the_man_in_black/|title=My Father and the Man in Black|date=6 September 2013|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[LA Weekly]]'' described it as a "fascinating documentary" despite what it called the "warning signs of a vanity project"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2013-09-05/film-tv/my-father-man-in-black/|title=My Father and the Man in Black: A Fascinating Documentary From the Son of Johnny Cash's Manager|date=22 December 2014|work=LA Weekly|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] noted the fresh take on a documentary, saying: "Refreshingly, My Father and the Man In Black does not slip into the realm of tabloid. It’s an intense personal adventure with universal themes and appeal that just happens to feature one of 20th-century music’s great icons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-father-and-the-man-in-black|title=My Father and The Man In Black|work=Metacritic|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Roger Ebert]].com, the movie was described as "too damn interesting to be maudlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/my-father-and-the-man-in-black-2013|title=My Father And The Man In Black|author=Sheila O'Malley|date=6 September 2013|publisher=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated, "heart and feeling is soaked through it like the sweat in Cash's guitar strap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-09-04/film/my-father-and-the-man-in-black/|title=My Father and the Man in Black Is a Full and Vital Look at Johnny Cash's "Interesting Years"|author=Alan Scherstuhl|date=30 August 2013|publisher=Villagevoice.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been nominated and has won a number of awards on the film festival circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimooz.com/film-reviews/review-my-father-and-the-man-in-black|title=VIMOOZ - REVIEW: My Father and The Man in Black|publisher=Vimooz.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853620/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=My Father and the Man in Black (2012)|work=IMDb|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The film garnered mostly positive reviews in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom. ''[[The Financial Times]]''  called it "a non-fiction 'Walk the Line' with script input by Eugene O'Neill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/6973a090-fa90-11e2-87b9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2al7rYMn5|title=Film reviews: Only God Forgives, Heaven’s Gate, Paradise: Hope, From Up on Poppy Hill, My Father and the Man in Black and The Conjuring|work=Financial Times|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "finally, a fresh angle on the Cash mythology." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2013/08/05/only-god-forgives-the-heat-paradise-hope-this-weeks-new-films/?or=1|title=Only God Forgives, The Heat, Paradise: Hope: this week's new films|work=Here Is The City|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented on the frequent dramatic confrontations between Cash and Holiff revealed in authentic audio of phone exchanges between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10215749/My-Father-and-the-Man-in-Black-review.html|title=My Father and the Man in Black, review|author=Robbie Collin|date=1 August 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer from the UK website Film Forward stated that the movie is a type of [[answer song]] to the movie ''[[Walk the Line]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film-forward.com/star-reviews/my-father-and-the-man-in-black|title=My Father and the Man in Black|work=Film-Forward|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it covers a number of themes not mentioned in ''Walk the Line'', like Cash's conversion to [[Christian fundamentalism]] at the peak of his career, the racism Cash faced by the [[KKK]] when they believed Cash's first wife was African American, and the [[antisemitism]] Holiff faced both growing up and in the early days of [[country music]].

==Historical accuracy==
The documentary is considered among the most historically accurate films about Johnny Cash's career in the 1960s and early 1970s, and the often stormy relationship with his manager between 1958 and 1977. This is due to the fact that the film is driven by contemporaneous audio diaries and telephone calls, and hundreds of letters between the two men. A number of the movie props were genuine articles given to Holiff by Cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-holiff/johnny-cash-documentary_b_1942591.html|title=Before There was Johnny and June, There was Johnny and Saul|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has seven floors of galleries with permanent exhibitions focusing on [[photography]], [[television]], [[animation]], [[videogaming]], the [[Internet]] and the scientific principles behind [[light]] and [[colour]]. It also hosts temporary exhibitions and maintains a collection of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million pieces in its research facility. The venue has three [[movie theatre|cinema]]s, operated in partnership with [[Picturehouse Cinemas]], including an [[IMAX]] screen. It hosts festivals dedicated to widescreen film, video games and science, and has previously hosted popular film festivals, including the Bradford International Film Festival until 2014.

In September 2011 the museum was voted the best indoor attraction in Yorkshire by the public, and it is one of the most visited museums in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/9261616.Bradford_museum_is_voted_third_best_attraction/|title=Bradford museum is voted third best attraction|date=21 September 2011|newspaper=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishphotohistory.ning.com/profiles/blogs/national-media-museum-visitor-numbers-continue-to-fall |title=National Media Museum visitor numbers continue to fall|accessdate= 30 August 2012|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2016|2}} the museum, in response to revenue shortfalls, has controversially adopted a policy of focusing on "the science and culture of light and sound"—to the exclusion of what are seen as "unsustainable" aspects of creativity and culture, such as past film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Quinton-Tulloch, Jo [http://blog.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/my-message-to-bradford/ My Message to Bradford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228142719/http://blog.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/my-message-to-bradford/ |date=28 February 2016 }} Museum Director, at blog.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk, 4 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 a £7.5&amp;nbsp;million five year investment plan in the museum was revealed by the Science Museum Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/aboutus/pressoffice/2016/march/national-media-museum-to-benefit-from-seven-point-five-million-investment-plans|title=Museum to benefit from £7.5&amp;nbsp;million investment plans over 5 years - National Science and Media Museum|website=www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 its name was changed from National Media Museum to National Science and Media Museum.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-39209528 Bradford's National Media Museum changes its name]". [[BBC News]], 9 March 2017. Accessed 29 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building and admission ==
Entrance is free, with the exception of cinema screens. The museum is open 10&amp;nbsp;am until 6&amp;nbsp;pm every day. The museum underwent a £16&amp;nbsp;million refurbishment in 1998, developing a new digital technology gallery. This new development created a new glass-fronted atrium, which houses a new [[café]] and [[retailing|shop]].

===Galleries===
There are seven permanent exhibitions:
[[File:NMM Seaside Kodak Gallery 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Tableau in the Kodak Gallery]]
* ''Kodak Gallery'' – The Kodak Gallery takes the viewer on a journey through the history of popular photography, from the world's first photographs to the digital snapshots of today. Most of the items on display in the gallery are taken from the museum collection of 35,000 objects and images donated by [[Eastman Kodak Company|Kodak]].
* ''Wonderlab'' – Explores light and sound through interactive exhibits and live experiments. Opened in 2016, replacing the Experience TV gallery.

== History ==
===National Museum of Photography, Film and Television===
The museum occupies a site originally proposed for a theatre in central Bradford, for which work begun in the 1960s remained unfinished.&lt;ref name="Bell 1983 961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=John|title=The Flash, Bang, Wallop Show|year=1983|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|pages=961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43iBpIukRCkC&amp;pg=PA961&amp;dq=dame+Margaret+weston+museum+bradford&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OZgWUdHDFMSn0AXP9YD4BQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dame%20Margaret%20weston%20museum%20bradford&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resulting from discussions between [[Margaret Weston|Dame Margaret Weston]] of the [[Science Museum, London]] and Bradford city councillors,&lt;ref name="Bell 1983 961"/&gt; the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, as it was then called, opened on 16 June 1983.&lt;ref name=museumhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160810112513/http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/aboutus/museumhistory|title=Museum History - About Us - National Media Museum|author=|date=|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum launched Britain’s largest cinema screen, [[IMAX]], five storeys high with six-channel sound, on the same day.  During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making since [[Colin Ford (curator)|Colin Ford]], its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to appreciation of the ideas expressed and the intentions and skills of image-makers.  To mark the 50th anniversary of the first public television service, two interactive television galleries were developed in 1986. These allowed visitors to operate cameras on a studio set with programmed sound and lighting, use vision mixers, read a news item from an [[autocue]] and discover how [[chroma key]]ing works.

In 1989, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of photography, the museum launched the [[Kodak]] Gallery, a display of the history of photography from its invention. This was followed by the installation of a standard television studio, first used by [[TV-am]] for outside broadcasts and, later, [[Nickelodeon]]. These studios were the first live broadcasting studios in a museum.

While continuing to run the [[Pictureville Cinema]] and exhibitions in a temporary venue on the other side of the city, the museum closed its main site on 31 August 1997 to allow for a 19-month, £16&amp;nbsp;million redevelopment, making the museum 25% bigger. The IMAX cinema was also developed to show [[3D film]]s. The new museum was opened on 16 June 1999 by [[Pierce Brosnan]].

===National Media Museum===
On 1 December 2006, the museum was renamed the National Media Museum&lt;ref name=museumhistory/&gt; and two new £3&amp;nbsp;million interactive galleries were opened: Experience TV (now replaced by Wonderlab) and TV Heaven (now the BFI Mediatheque), dedicated to the past, present and future of television. The galleries displayed scientific exhibits, such as [[John Logie Baird]]'s original apparatus, and television ephemera such as [[Wallace and Gromit]] and [[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]] toys. TV Heaven made accessible the museum's collection of television programmes, most of which are not available elsewhere.

In 2009 the museum partnered with other bodies from the Bradford district in a successful bid to become the world's first [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) [[City of Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/bradford-wins-unesco-city-of-film |title=Bradford wins Unesco City of Film award|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2009|accessdate= 18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major revamp of the foyer was unveiled in February 2010, including a brand new Games Lounge, a new gallery drawing on the [[GameCity#National Videogame Arcade|National Videogame Archive]] established in 2008 in partnership with [[Nottingham Trent University]]. It was originally intended to be temporary but one in five visitors to the Games Lounge named it as their favourite part of the museum, resulting in the creation of a permanent Lounge in another part of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Maldonado, Adrián [http://almostarchaeology.com/post/137194823888/mediumarchaeology1 Medium Archaeology Part 1: Beyond TV Typology at the National Media Museum] at almostarchaeology.com, 13 January 2016. Retrieved 18 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 the museum opened Life Online, the world's first gallery dedicated to exploring the social, technological and cultural impact of the Internet. The permanent gallery was initially accompanied by a temporary exhibition, ''[open source]: Is the internet you know under threat?'' – an exploration of the [[Open-source software|open source]] nature of the Internet and the current threats to [[net neutrality]] and the continuation of the [[Open-source movement|open source culture]].

In October 2014 the museum entered into a partnership with [[Picturehouse Cinemas]] with the national chain taking over the running of the three cinema screens in a bid to boost audience figures and revenue. The partnership is designated "Picturehouse at the National Media Museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/11502911.Cinema_chain_takes_over_operation_of_National_Media_Museum__39_s_three_screens/ |title=Cinema chain takes over operation of National Media Museum's three screens|accessdate= 2 January 2015|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current festival programme ==

=== Widescreen Weekend ===
This event began as part of Bradford International Film Festival and has been expanded into a 4-day standalone film festival. It takes place every October and focuses on large-screen formats and cinema technologies. It includes 70mm and [[Cinerama]] screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Widescreen Weekend|url=https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/whats-on/widescreen-weekend|publisher=National Science and Media Museum|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yorkshire Games Festival ===
This [[video game]] festival began in 2016. It celebrates games culture, design and production, and includes a conference programme as well as a weekend of events for families. It takes place every November. Guests at the first Yorkshire Games Festival included [[John Romero]], [[Rhianna Pratchett]], [[Charles Cecil]], [[Warren Spector]] (via live video link), [[Brenda Romero]], and presenters of [[The Yogscast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yorkshire Games Festival|url=https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/whats-on/yorkshire-games-festival|publisher=National Science and Media Museum|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bradford Science Festival ===
This family science festival was first held in 2012, but was cancelled in 2016 after the previous organisers no longer had the capacity to carry it on. The museum took over the festival in 2017, in partnership with organisations including the University of Bradford, Bradford Council and Bradford College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bradford to host big science festival with fun events planned for city centre|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/15268608.Science_festival_to_return_to_city_centre/|work=Telegraph &amp; Argus|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discontinued film festivals ==
The museum organised and held four major film events every year: Bradford International Film Festival, Bradford Animation Festival, Bite the Mango and Fantastic Films Weekend. These attracted international speakers and new and classic works from around the world. All four festivals were eventually cancelled by the museum.

=== Bradford International Film Festival ===
From its inception in 1995, Bradford International Film Festival (BIFF) presented new and classic films from around the world. The Festival presented films in their original formats wherever possible, and existed to develop understanding of the art and science of the moving image by hosting innovators in many fields of filmmaking.

BIFF included the Shine Awards – which highlighting the work of new European directors, a Filmmakers Weekend designed to offer guidance and support to filmmakers in the north of England, and the Widescreen Weekend, which discussed film formats including [[Cinerama]], [[VistaVision]], [[70 mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm]] and [[IMAX]].

=== Bradford Animation Festival ===
The animation and video games festival was the UK's leading event of its kind; host to discussions, workshops and special events. The annual BAF Awards honoured new animation from around the world.

Past guests include representatives from studios such as [[Pixar]], [[Aardman]], [[Weta Workshops]] and [[Sony Interactive]] plus animators [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]], [[Bob Godfrey]], [[Caroline Leaf]], [[Michael Dudok de Wit]] and [[Bill Plympton]].

After the museum ended the festival following its 20th edition in 2014, former museum staff successfully revived the event in Manchester in November 2015 as [[Manchester Animation Festival]].

=== Fantastic Films Weekend ===
This festival began in 2002 as a weekend event focusing on classic ghost stories and the supernatural. It developed into an annual celebration of horror, fantasy and sci-fi cinema and television. In February 2013 it was announced that the Fantastic Films Weekend would not continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farewell Fantastic Films Weekend|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/fantastic-films-weekend-comes-to-an-end/|publisher=National Media Museum Blog|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6967">'''''O du eselhafter Peierl''''', [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 559a, is a [[canon (music)|canon]] composed by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The music, originally in [[F major]], is set for four singers. The words are probably by Mozart himself.&lt;ref name=NMA&gt;Preface to ''Neue Mozart Ausgabe'' edition (External link below)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The work was written sometime between 1785 and 1787.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for this is that the singer for whom the canon was written, Johann Nepomuk Peierl, was resident in Vienna only during this time.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 1788, Mozart entered it into his personal catalog of works as part of a set of ten canons.&lt;ref name=NMA /&gt; Although some of the canons in the set of ten have serious (that is, religious) lyrics, K. 559a was meant for fun, a gesture of mocking, scatological humor directed at a friend of Mozart's, the [[baritone]] [[Johann Nepomuk Peyerl]] (1761–1800).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmlo.lmu.de/p0297 Peierl (Peyri, Peyerl, Peyrl), Johann Nepomuk], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canon begins
:O, du eselhafter Peierl
:O, du peierlhafter Esel

("Oh, you asinine Peierl; oh you Peierline ass"). Later, the lyrics include "O leck mich doch geschwind im Arsch" ("Oh lick me real quick in the ass (arse)"&lt;ref&gt;"Ass" and "arse" are equivalent terms in American and British English.&lt;/ref&gt;), a favorite expression in Mozart's scatological works. For more examples and discussion, see [[Mozart and scatology]].

"O du eselhafter Peierl" was originally intended to be sung immediately following "Difficile lectu". For the tale of how these two canons originated, see "[[Difficile lectu (Mozart)]]".

==Revised version==
Mozart later transposed "O du eselhafter Peierl" into [[G major]], in versions that replaced "Peierl" with the names of two other individuals, named Martin and Jakob. There are other minor differences in words and notes.

According to Link (2007), "Martin" was the composer [[Vicente Martín y Soler]]. Mozart scholar [[Alfred Einstein]] suggested a different hypothesis, that "Martin" was [[Philipp Jakob Martin]], who served as impresario for Mozart's concerts in the [[Mehlgrube]] and in the [[Augarten]]. The lyrics of the revised canon replace "Nepomuk" (see above) with "Lipperl", a [[Diminutive#German|German diminutive]] form of "Philipp".

==Autographs==
The autograph (original manuscript copy) of K. 559a has survived; it is a "tiny slip of paper" (Searle) on the reverse side of which is the original of K. 559. For discussion, see [[Difficile lectu (Mozart)]]. The later G major version, K. 560, is also preserved and is currently in the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum]] in Salzburg.&lt;ref&gt;Abert (2007, 772)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The canon is perhaps the most often performed of Mozart's comic canons; performances have often used [[censorship|bowdlerized]] versions of the lyrics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Zaslaw and Cowdury (1990) express admiration for the work, saying "it makes brilliant use of [[imitation (music)|imitative]] and [[hocket]]-like devices" and "possesses the clockwork-like vocal interplay of a well-wrought ''[[opera buffa]]'' ensemble."&lt;ref&gt;Zaslaw and Cowdury (1990, 105)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;O, you asinine Peierl!
O, you Peierline ass!&lt;ref&gt;Here, "ass", translating "Esel", means "donkey"; as an insult it might also be translated "jackass". For discussion see [[Ass (animal)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
You're as idle as a nag 
with neither head nor legs!
There's nothing to be done with you
I'll see you hanged yet.
You stupid nag, you're so idle
You stupid Peierl, you're idle as a nag
Oh dear friend, I beg you
Oh kiss&lt;ref&gt;"Leck" is literally "lick"; "kiss" forms a more idiomatic English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; my [ass|arse] real quick!
Oh dear friend, forgive me,
I'm going to whip your [ass|arse].
Nepomuk! Peierl! Forgive me!&lt;ref&gt;Most of the translation is taken from Abert (2007, 772; trans. Spencer), who omits the vulgar material.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34782">The '''Ontario Student Classics Conference''' ('''OSCC''') is an annual event committed to the promotion and appreciation of studies in [[Classics]].  It is a four-day competition that occurs in early May at [[Brock University]] of [[St. Catharines|St.&amp;nbsp;Catharines]], [[Ontario]].  Initially, the Conference was established as an [[National Junior Classical League#State chapters|extension]] of the [[National Junior Classical League]] (NJCL) but has since expanded and grown to become one of the largest and most popular conferences in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ontario Student Classics Conference|url=http://www.ontclassics.org/conference.html |work=OntClassics.org - September 2007|publisher=Internet Archive: Wayback Machine|year=2010|accessdate=July 29, 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035603/http://www.ontclassics.org/conference.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 500 students attending each year from 15-20 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exemplary Teacher: Mary McBride A Classic!|url=http://www.oct.ca/publications/professionally_speaking/september_2005/exemplary.asp|work=Professionally Speaking|publisher=Ontario College of Teachers|date=September 2005|accessdate=July 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074034/http://www.oct.ca/publications/professionally_speaking/september_2005/exemplary.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=}}

The conference is dedicated to the study of Classics; students compete in over 100 academic, athletic, and creative competitions all based on aspects of Classical life.&lt;ref name="OSCC Guidebook Rev. 2009, By Margaret-Anne Gillis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario Student Classics Conference Guidebook - General Information: Revised August 2009|url=http://www.classicsconference.org/download/guidebook2010-introductiongeneral.pdf|work=ClassicsConference.org|publisher=Ontario Student Classics Conference (OSCC)|date=2010|accessdate=August 2, 2010|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:pompa.jpg|thumb|The Pompa|300px|right|Students gather for the Pompa during the 2006 OSCC.]]
In addition to competitions, students also participate in different classically themed events, one of these being the "Pompa" ([[Latin]] for "Parade").  For this event everyone is required to dressed appropriately in classical attire, namely [[toga]]s, and line up with their school to parade around the campus before attending a celebratory banquet and awards ceremony.&lt;ref name="OSCC Guidebook Rev. 2009, By Margaret-Anne Gillis" /&gt;

The OSCC is not affiliated with the Ontario Classical Association (OCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario Student Classics Conference|url=http://www.ontclassics.org/index_files/Page611.htm|work=Ontario Classical Association (OCA)|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|date=2001|accessdate=July 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727144738/http://www.ontclassics.org/index_files/Page611.htm|archivedate=July 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSCC Mission Statement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The Ontario Student Classics Conference brings together students and teachers from across the province to promote and nurture a deeper understanding of the Classical World by providing opportunities to celebrate our Classical heritage through a variety of social events and competitions.  While the goal of each club is the pursuit of excellence, following the philosophy 'mens sana in corpore sano,' it is an essential mandate of this Conference to promote the pursuit of this goal in a spirit of cooperation, mutual encouragement, and sportsmanship."''&lt;ref name="OSCC Guidebook Rev. 2009, By Margaret-Anne Gillis" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Competitions==

===Academic contests===
These competitions are designed to challenge students' knowledge of the cultures of [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]] through the writing of a wide variety of contests.  Most contests are offered at three different levels: Junior, Intermediate and Senior.  The Greek Derivative and Greek Oral Reading tests only have two: Junior and Senior.  Quaerite Summa does not have levels.  Levels in some contests are determined by the years of language study while others are based on grade level or a combination of the two.  The Academic Pentathlon consists of all five of the 'cursus' contests where Pentathletes' total score is determined by their total score achieved in all five contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario Student Classics Conference Guidebook - Academic Competitions|url=http://www.classicsconference.org/download/guidebook2010-academic1.pdf|work=ClassicsConference.org|publisher=Ontario Student Classics Conference (OSCC)|year=2010|accessdate=August 3, 2010|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Competitions"&gt;{{cite news|date=May 12, 2000|title=Can't beat the classics|newspaper=[[Guelph Mercury|Daily&amp;nbsp;Mercury]]|publisher=Torstar|page=A9 - News}}

'''''Phantom of the Opera''''' is a 1943 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Arthur Lubin]], loosely based on [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1910 novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and its [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] starring [[Lon Chaney]]. Produced and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film stars [[Nelson Eddy]], [[Susanna Foster]] and [[Claude Rains]], and was filmed in [[Technicolor]]. The original music score was composed by [[Edward Ward (composer)|Edward Ward]].

The auditorium set, a replica of the [[Palais Garnier|Opéra Garnier]] interior, created for the previous iteration was reused. Other than the sets, this remake had little in common with the earlier film. The original storyline was completely revised and there was no attempt to film the [[Masquerade ball|masked ball]] sequence, although the famous falling of the chandelier was re-enacted on an epic scale, using elaborate camera set-ups. It is also the only Universal horror film to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematography]].

==Plot==
[[Violin]]ist Erique Claudin is dismissed from the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] after revealing that he is losing the use of the fingers of his left hand. Unbeknownst to the conductor, who assumes Claudin is able to support himself, the musician has used all his money to help anonymously fund the voice lessons for Christine Dubois, a young soprano with whom he has fallen in love. In a desperate attempt to earn money, Claudin submits a [[Piano concerto|piano concerto]] he has written for publication.

After submitting it and not hearing a response, he becomes worried and returns to the publishers, Pleyel &amp; Desjardins, to ask about it. No one there knows what happened to it, and do not seem to care. Claudin persists, but Maurice Pleyel rudely tells him to leave and goes back to the [[etching]]s he was working on. Finally giving up, Claudin stands there for a moment and hangs his head sadly. Someone begins to play music in the next room, and he looks up in shock when he hears it. It is his concerto that is merely being endorsed and praised by [[Franz Liszt]]. Convinced that Pleyel is trying to steal his concerto, Claudin leaps up and begins to strangle him. Just as he tosses the body of Pleyel to the floor, Georgette, the publisher's assistant, throws etching acid at Claudin. Screaming and wailing in agony, Claudin dashes out the door clutching his face. Now being hunted down by the police for murder, he flees to the sewers of the Opera. Claudin steals a prop [[mask]] from the costume department to cover his now-disfigured face.

Meanwhile, Inspector Raoul Dubert ([[Edgar Barrier]]) wants Christine to quit the Opera and marry him. But famed opera baritone Anatole Garron ([[Nelson Eddy]]) hopes to win Christine's heart. Christine considers them both good friends but doesn't openly express if she loves them.

During a performance of the opera ''Amore et Gloire'', Claudin drugs a glass of wine which Biancarolli drinks and makes her collapse and unable to perform. The director puts Christine in her place and she dazzles both the audience and everyone else with her singing.

However Mme. Biancarolli, who suspects that Garron and Christine are responsible for drugging her, orders Raoul to arrest them but he says he can't because there is no evidence to prove her statement true. So Biancarolli sets a condition that she will forget the whole affair only if Christine's performance is not mentioned in the papers. Her conditions are reluctantly accepted, much to Christine and Anatole's dismay. The next night Claudin enters Biancarolli's dressing room and kills her and her maid. The opera is subsequently closed.

After some time, the opera's owners receive a note demanding that Christine replace Biancarolli. To catch Claudin, Raoul comes up with a plan: not let Christine sing during a performance of the (fictive) Russian opera ''Le prince masqué du Caucase'' (“The Masked Prince of the Caucasus”) so as to lure Claudin out into the open, while Garron plans to have Liszt play the concerto after the performance. But Claudin strangles one of Dubert's men and heads to the domed ceiling of the auditorium. He then brings down the large chandelier on the audience causing chaos. As the audience and the crew flee, Claudin takes Christine down underground. He tells Christine that he loves her and that she will now sing all she wants, but only for him. But Christine doesn't recognize Claudin and is afraid of him.

Raoul, Anatole and the police begin pursuing them underground. Just as Claudin and Christine arrive in his lair they hear Liszt and the orchestra playing Claudin's concerto. Claudin plays along with it on his piano. Christine watches, realizing the concerto was written around the melody of a lullaby she had known since childhood. Raoul and Anatole hear Claudin playing and follow the sound. Overjoyed, Claudin urges Christine to sing, which she does. While Claudin is distracted by the music, Christine sneaks up and pulls off his mask and sees his burnt disfigured face caused by the acid. At that same moment, Raoul and Anatole break in. Claudin grabs a sword to fight them with. Raoul fires his gun at Claudin, but Anatole knocks Raoul's arm and the shot hits the ceiling causing a cave in. Anatole and Raoul escape with Christine but Claudin gets crushed to death by the falling rocks.

Once they're safe, Anatole tells Christine that she and Claudin had come from the same town district, which explains why they both knew the lullaby. She responds by saying while Claudin had seemed a bit like a stranger to her she had somehow "always felt drawn to him" (an earlier version of the script had Claudin be Christine's biological father, who abandoned her and her mother—this explains his devotion and knowledge of the lullaby). Anatole finishes by saying that Claudin's madness will be forgotten, but his concerto will live on.

Later, Anatole and Raoul demand that Christine finally chooses between the two men. She surprises them by choosing to marry neither one of them and pursue her singing career, because she now understands how much Claudin loved her and how much he was devoted to her singing career. She leaves the room and joins her adoring fans outside. The film ends with Anatole and Raoul going off to commiserate together.

==Development==
Universal first announced a remake of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' in 1935. This version would have been set in contemporary Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded [[World War I]] veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. The screenplay lingered in development until 1941, when [[Henry Koster]] was brought on board to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine's father. Producer George Waggner ultimately fired Koster from the project and replaced him with Arthur Lubin.&lt;ref name="Unmasked"&gt;"The Opera Ghost: A Phantom Unmasked". [Special Feature on DVD release of ''Phantom of the Opera'']. Universal Studios, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Cesar Romero]], [[Boris Karloff]], [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Broderick Crawford]] were all considered for the role of the Phantom at various points during production, before the role was given to Rains.&lt;ref name="Unmasked"/&gt; Koster's subplot about the Phantom being Christine's father was jettisoned because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship [[incest]]uous overtones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Scott McQueen, audio-commentary on ''Phantom of the Opera'' DVD (Universal)&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year that the film was released, ''Phantom of the Opera'' was adapted into an audio presentation for the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''. Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Edgar Barrier reprised their roles, but instead of Claude Rains, [[Basil Rathbone]] played Erique Claudin. This presentation was produced and hosted by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].

==Score==
[[File:Stage 28, or "Phantom of the Opera" Stage.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Stage 28, also known as ''The Phantom of the Opera'' Stage, was originally built for the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|1925 film]], and reused in the 1943 version.]]
[[Edward Ward (composer)|Edward Ward]] wrote the score. The film has many elements of a [[Musical films|musical]], with lengthy [[opera]] sequences, and has been criticized for being more musical than horrific. For the opera sequences, Ward adapted music from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 4]] as well as using themes by Chopin. He also composed an original theme, ''Lullaby of the Bells'', which was heard in the film as the Phantom's [[piano concerto]].

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were mixed. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' panned the film for being "watered down" from the original, calling the opening sequence "the only one in the film in which the potential excitement of the story is realized," while otherwise the "richness of décor and music is precisely what gets in the way of the tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9904E3D91438E33BBC4D52DFB6678388659EDE |title=Movie Review - Phantom of the Opera |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther |date=October 15, 1943 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=February 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a vivid, elaborate, and, within its original story limitations, an effective production geared for substantial grosses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 18, 1943 |title=Film Reviews |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page= 10 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it "a good entertainment, the sort that will direct an appeal to all types of audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 21, 1943 |title='The Phantom of the Opera' with Nelson Eddy, Claude Rains and Susanna Foster |url= |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location= |publisher= |page= 136 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Lardner's review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' dismissed the film, calling it "by no means a sample of the march of progress in the film world. The old version had Lon Chaney, who scared you plenty, and the new one has Claude Rains, who somehow doesn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lardner |first=David |date=October 16, 1943 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Corp. |page= 53 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave this version of  ''Phantom of the Opera'' an average score of 75%, based on 20 reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1016241-phantom_of_the_opera/ Rotten Tomatoes: Phantom of the Opera (1943)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled sequel==
Following the success of ''Phantom of the Opera'', Universal announced that a sequel would be made, titled ''[[The Climax]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster were to return, along with Claude Rains as the Phantom, most likely meaning that his character survived the cave-in at the finale of the first film (indeed, in the final shot of the mask and violin atop the rubble, there is a sound of moving rock). The sequel, however, was later cancelled due to story troubles and problems concerning the availability of Claude Rains. ''[[The Climax]]'' was indeed released the year after ''Phantom of the Opera'', but it was not a continuation of the previous film and featured completely new characters.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s, winning in two categories:&lt;ref name="Oscars1944"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1944 |title=The 16th Academy Awards (1944) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-14|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pie''' or, '''Pieman, Pieman''' is an outdoor [[game]] for more than three children. Its origin is unknown. A variant exists called Easter Eggs.

==Description==
The game requires a seating area for the players (such as a flight of porch steps or a garden wall) which is designated the "Pie Shop" or "Bakery."  Also required are a [[Goal]] distant from the seating area such as a tree, post or other object, and an expanse of lawn or field for a chase similar to the chase in the game of [[Tag (game)|Tag]].

One player is chosen Pieman, another Buyer, and the other players are Pies. The Buyer is sometimes designated Simple Simon following the [[Mother Goose]] rhyme:

:Simple Simon met a pieman
:Going to the fair;
:Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
:"Let me taste your ware."

To begin the game, the Buyer is sent to the Goal where he cannot see or hear the other players.  The Pieman then names each Pie with a common [[pie|pie filling]] such as Apple, Blueberry, Pumpkin, etc.  When all the Pies have been named, the Pieman calls the Buyer to the Pie Shop.

The Buyer demands, "Pieman, Pieman, I would like a pie."  The Pieman asks, "And what might that Pie be?"  The Buyer then names a pie flavor such as Apple.  If one of the Pies has been designated Apple, then he rushes from the Pie Shop to the Goal while the Buyer runs after him and attempts to [[Tag (game)|tag]] him. Both the Pie and the Buyer must touch the Goal before running back to the Pie Shop. If the Pie returns to the Pie Shop without being tagged, he resumes his seat, and is renamed for another round. The chase may be complicated with dodging about lawn furniture, flower beds, clotheslines of drying laundry, or other obstacles in the path to and from the Goal.

Before the Buyer leaves the Pie Shop in pursuit of the Pie, he is required to pay the Pieman the price he asks for the Pie (such as 10 dollars).  Payment is accomplished by slapping the Pieman's outstretched, up-turned palm, and counting aloud the required number of "dollars."  Paying the Pieman gives slower, or smaller Pies a "head-start" against the Buyer.

Should the Pie be "tagged" during his flight to the Goal, he becomes the Buyer, the Buyer becomes a Pie, and play resumes in a similar manner.

==Variants==
A variation of the game for children who may have limited knowledge of pie flavors is Easter Eggs. Here, players are given colors (red, blue, green, purple，etc.) rather than pie fillings. The Pieman becomes The [[Easter Bunny]] and the seating area the Easter Basket. Another variant is called Red Devil, where one child is removed from the group, and the kids are assigned colors (pink,yellow,blue) the child then returns and says "Red Devil, Red Devil, may I borrow a crayon?" the group then asks "What color?" and like pie the color chosen must try to catch the asker before the asker takes that person's seat.

In another variant, the Buyer is known as the Witch. The Witch says to the Baker: "Do you have any pies today?" The Baker replies, "What kind do you want?" If the Witch names one of the Pies, he or she must chase the named Pie around a designated spot, such as a tree or a light post. If the Pie gets back to the Pie Shop safely, the game begins again. However, if the Pie is caught, he or she becomes the new Witch. The Witch now becomes a Pie and sits with the others on the Pie Shop shelf and the game continues.

'''Pirate Baby's Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006''' is a 12-minute, black and white animated movie by [[Paul Robertson (animator)|Paul Laurence Robertson]], featuring music by [[Qua (musician)|Cornel Wilczek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/reviews/p/pirate-babys-cabana-2006.shtml Pirate Baby's Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006], [[PopMatters]], March 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Qua. It depicts a fictional [[Side-scrolling game|side-scroller video game]], "heavily influenced and inspired by [[anime]], cult 1980s games such as [[Double Dragon]], [[Bubble Bobble]] and [[R-Type]], and [[Culture of Australia|Australian popular culture]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://2006festival.nextwave.org.au/objectlibrary/591 Press Release from the Next Wave Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; in which two male characters must fight their way through a building full of [[zombies]], humans, giant [[Beetle#Development|grubs]] and [[octopuses]] to rescue a woman being held captive by the main antagonist, a pirate baby. The animation was created with [[Autodesk Animator]] and [[Adobe Flash]], and contains considerable gore and some nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/txt/Sunday2April2006.htm Paul Robertson Interview on [[Sunday Arts]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsored by [[Melbourne]]'s [http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=75&amp;pg=791 Living the Arts] program, it was first shown at the [[Next Wave Festival#2006_Next_Wave_Festival_.E2.80.93_Empire_Games|2006]] [[Next Wave Festival]]. It was released on the [[internet]] as a 113 MB [[MPEG-1|MPEG]] video on April 20, 2006.

==Synopsis==
The fictional game begins with an introductory title sequence. There are five play levels, each with a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end. The two heroes each have a preferred fighting style; one primarily uses a [[baseball bat]], though he also uses [[Uzi]]s at one point, and the other utilizes a variety of kicks. Numerous [[Fighting game#Special attacks|special attack]]s are used, including three which are specifically named:
* ''[[Datsun 180b]] [[Monster Truck]]''
* ''The Ghosts of a Billion Dead Mosquitos''
* ''[[The Big Lebowski|You are Entering a World of Pain]]''

It ends with credits and stills depicting events after the pirate baby is defeated.

==Legacy==
The video was generally well-received, but considered inappropriate for children due to intense violence and some nudity.
Robertson later made a second movie, ''Kings of Power 4 Billion%'', also featuring music by Wilczek. Robertson later became involved in the art direction for the videogame, ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game]]'', based on the ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' series of graphic novels, which was released on August 10, 2010. He was also involved in the creation of the official music video of Architecture in Helsinki's 'Do The Whirlwind'.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}

==Reception==
The game received a score of 78/100 on Gamertell, with reviewer Jenni Lada writing "''Planet Stronghold'' isn't for everyone. It's a good game, but it's also quite challenging. This may dissuade beginners or typical visual novel players, who may not be accustomed to level-grinding characters, seeking out extra battles and carefully managing character equipment to keep everyone at their best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamertell.com/technologytell/article/planet-stronghold-for-windows-mac-and-linux-review-winter-wolves/|title=Gamertell Review: Planet Stronghold for Windows, Mac and Linux|year=2011|accessdate=2011-10-23|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mac Games gave 4 of 5 stars and wrote: "The anime artwork is exquisite as always with great alien drawings. The instructions are clear and stats detailed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgames.org/planet-stronghold-review/|title=Mac Games Review: Planet Stronghold|year=2011|accessdate=2011-10-23|website=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830134017/http://www.macgames.org/planet-stronghold-review/|archivedate=2011-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameZebo]] gave 3,5 of 5 stars and wrote: "If ''Planet Stronghold'' has a weakness, it’s that the story and characters in and of themselves aren’t especially interesting. The game isn’t poorly written or even poorly translated, it’s just a bit generic given the type of anime sci-fi fare that’s clearly influenced it. That doesn’t matter quite so much when the game is simply fun to play for its own sake, which it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/planet-stronghold/review|title=GameZebo Review: Planet Stronghold|year=2011|accessdate=2011-10-23|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings Per Game explained and criticized the flaws in parts of the games combat mechanics. Such as the music not looping, the Grenades not being able to stack, and obvious chosen one aspect with the Nelson family. However she stated it was worth playing if you could overlook the flaws in the story and mechanics. The artwork, while praised, did get criticized on the costume design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratings Per Game|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcytwFRSc_c|work=Review|publisher=Quintega}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tip jar''' is a game similar to a [[raffle]]. Players buy folded or sealed pieces of paper dealt from large glass jars in hopes of winning prizes. The pieces of paper conceal numbers or symbols that may entitle the purchaser to winnings immediately after opening the ticket. Tip jars were named at a time when the betting slips were tipped out of bags into glass jars or fish bowls. Jars are not necessarily needed. The tickets can be spread out in a pile or pinned on a board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class II Games: Punch Boards, Tip Jars, and Instant Bingo|url=http://www.nigc.gov/Reading_Room/Bulletins/Bulletin_No._1999-2.aspx|publisher=National Indian Gaming Commission|work=nigc.gov|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2167">'''''Vamos vamos Argentina''''' is a very popular [[chant]] in [[Argentina]], used by supporters in sports events, mainly in [[football (soccer)]] matches of the [[Argentina national football team|national team]] and related celebrations.

==Lyrics==
In Spanish:
{{Quote|
Vamos, vamos Argentina,&lt;BR&gt;
vamos, vamos a ganar,&lt;BR&gt;
que esta barra ''quilombera'',&lt;BR&gt;
no te deja, no te deja de alentar.
}}
English translation:
{{Quote|
Let's go, let's go Argentina,&lt;BR&gt;
We're going, we're going to win,&lt;BR&gt;
for these raucous supporters,&lt;BR&gt;
won't stop, won't stop cheering you.}}

The adjective ''quilombera'' used in the third line is a mildly obscene term. In the [[lunfardo]] argot, ''[[quilombo]]'' means [[brothel]]; the word is used by Argentines (when profanity is tolerated) to mean "bedlam" or "mess".  In this case, ''quilombera'' is used to describe the fact that football fans make a lot of noise and usually a mess of throwing [[confetti]] when goals are scored. On recordings, or when profanity is not tolerated, ''quilombera'' is replaced by ''bullanguera'' ("rackety").

This chant unites all of Argentina's supporters regardless of their club allegiance. It had its first heyday during the [[1978 World Cup]], played in Argentina, and is often the first song attempted by Argentine expatriates when the national team visits a foreign country. Usage has spread to [[Argentina national basketball team|basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams, but not to the [[Los Pumas]] rugby union team (normally they use ''Yo te daré, te daré una cosa'' -''I will give you/I will give you a thing''-).

The other most popular chant among Argentine fans is ''Es un sentimiento ... no puedo parar'' ( {{lang-en|It's a feeling ... I can't stop}} [''cheering''])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGQ8g8r2e1o video in Germany WC]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">'''''The Arena Spectacular''''' is a live adaptation of the award-winning television series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. Like the TV series, ''The Arena Spectacular'' has to recreate [[dinosaurs]] to the point of the viewers accepting the creatures as real.

==Production==
[[File:Walking with Dinosaurs.jpg|thumb|Tyrannosaurs in the arena]] 
''The Arena Spectacular'' was created by [[The Creature Technology Company]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/arts/walking-with-dinosaurs-brings-245-million-years-of-history-to-stage/news-story/6d43a37d1ae60d9cba95e74c0c9e390e?nk=40c2e0e55993d70807ba3c22467f1ab3-1515737865|title=245 million years of history on stage|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production cost $20 million to stage, and 20 dinosaurs representing 10 species were created for the show, using [[puppetry]], [[Dinosaur suit|suits]], and [[animatronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fox6now.com/2014/10/15/stepping-into-the-world-of-dinosaurs-sneak-peek-of-walking-with-dinosaurs-arena-spectacular/|title="Stepping into the world of dinosaurs:" Sneak peek of "Walking with Dinosaurs" arena spectacular!|date=2014-10-15|work=FOX6Now.com|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each large dinosaur weighs several tons, and is operated by two "voodoo puppeteers" and a driver beneath the dinosaur who also monitors the hydraulics and batteries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2014/09/unusually-historical-theater-show-walking-dinosaurs|title=Behind-the-Scenes of ‘Walking with Dinosaurs’ {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller dinosaurs (marked by an *) are suits operated by the person in it, each weighing from 20–30&amp;nbsp;kg (44-66&amp;nbsp;lbs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are six puppeteers for these suits, which only have side views.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The dinosaurs featured are:

*''[[Allosaurus]]''
*''[[Ankylosaurus]]''
*''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' (adolescent)
*''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' (adult)
*''[[Iguanodon]]'' (carcass)
*''[[Liliensternus]]''*
*''[[Ornithocheirus]]''
*''[[Plateosaurus]]'' (adult)
*''[[Plateosaurus]]'' (2 hatchlings)
*''[[Stegosaurus]]''
*''[[Torosaurus]]'' (2x)
*''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (adult)
*''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (juvenile)*
*''[[Utahraptor]]'' (3x)*
The dinosaurs initially did not have feathers, but they were later added after new research showed dinosaurs possessed plumage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This also necessitated rewrites of the script, which were added to later iterations of the show as well as improvements in the animatronics, making them more responsive to puppeteers and giving them the ability to "eat" food and spray water vapor as "breath".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Tours==
''The Arena Spectacular'' originated in [[Australia]] in January 2007 (as ''Walking with Dinosaurs: The Live Experience''), and toured [[North America]] in 2007–10, [[Europe]] in 2010, and returned to North America until 2011. It also toured [[Asia]] beginning in December 2010. In 2011 the show came to its final destination of its first tour, [[New Zealand]]. In 2012, the show toured the UK, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1085030/T-rex-comes-town-Stunning-10m-life-size-dinosaurs-stomps-Britain.html|title=T-rex comes to town: Stunning £10m show with life-size dinosaurs stomps towards Britain|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2018, the show will be touring only the UK from Summer until Christmas 2018.

==Synopsis==
The protagonist, Touya Kagari, is a resident of Shin Yokozaki City and a sophomore at the prestigious Hakuou North Academy. An earnest and responsible young man, Touya appears to be no more than your average high school student. While returning from his part-time job, he heard a mysterious sound coming from the depths of the Restricted Ward, an area off-limits to unauthorized personnel due to a horrible disaster that happened there ten years ago.

His curiosity having gotten the best of him, Touya ventured ever deeper into the ruins of the ward, eventually coming across a man who appeared to be gravely injured. Concerned, Touya rushed to his side, asking if he was okay and if he needed any help. But as Touya approached, the man suddenly stood up and attacked, screaming, “You’re an enemy!” And in the midst of invisible ringing bells, psychotic strangers, exploding walls of flame, and almost certain death, a small, cute girl with an enormous sword came charging in.

And despite her frilly, fragile appearance, her battle prowess was beyond reason or doubt. The name of Touya’s savior was Es, a soldier belonging to the Mitsurugi Agency.
Seithr, Drives, Unions, and secretive organizations. Yanked from the comfort of his everyday life, Touya was forced head-long into a world where the threat of death was everywhere and even allies could be his downfall. The wheel of fate has begun to turn. And the story of the Azure, and that of Touya Kagari and the mysterious girl Es, began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/story/|title=Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Characters===
*'''Touya Kagari''', in addition to being naturally curious, he also is incredibly kind and compassionate. Despite his calm demeanor, he will charge head long into any fights he sees in order to stop them. Currently lives with the Himezuru family and works part-time at the curry restaurant “Maha Raja”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/touya/|title=Touya}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hinata Himezuru''', the younger sister of the Himezuru family, of which Touya is unofficially a member. Incredibly friendly and cheerful, she always looks like she’s enjoying life. She is the de facto head of the household as her older sister Yuki, who is a doctor, is always at work. However, she truly enjoys housework, especially cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/hinata/|title=Hinata}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Es''', an anti-ability warrior (aka Sleipnir) attached to the Mitsurugi Agency. Outside of combat operations, she is shockingly naive and ignorant about the world around her. She rarely speaks or shows her emotions. In addition to her fighting prowess, she can also detect Discover Calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/es/|title=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kuon Glamred Stroheim''', an apprentice at the Academy located on the isle of Ishana. A daughter of the powerful Stroheim family, she has no tolerance for malfeasance and her tendency to white knight frequently gets her in trouble. Her temper is legendary, earning her the nickname “Fire Empress Stroheim”. Due to her potential strength, most believe she will be the first in a long while to earn the right to become a Ten Sage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/kuon/|title=Kuon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mei Amanohokosaka''', grudgingly works with the Mitsurugi Agency. The scion of the Amanohokosaka clan, she has been hunting Unions since she was a child. As a result, she is far more mature than her peers and often has problems relating to them. She practices a unique form of magic which she uses primarily to obtain information, though she will occasionally use her powers in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 28, 2015|url=http://aksysgames.com/xblaze/mei/|title=Mei}}&lt;/ref&gt;
