'''Abstract Meaning Representation''' ('''AMR''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.isi.edu|title=Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|semantic representation language]]. AMR graphs are rooted, labeled, directed, acyclic graphs ([[Directed acyclic graph|DAGs]]), comprising whole sentences. They are intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. By nature, the AMR language is biased towards English – it is not meant to function as an international auxiliary language.

The '''''African Geographical Review''''' is a biannual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] on behalf of the [[American Association of Geographers]]' [[Africa Specialty Group]].

The journal was originally established in 1963 at [[Makerere University]] ([[Uganda]]) as the ''East African Geographical Review''. Due to political turmoil in Uganda, the journal had to suspend publication for a number of years. It was renamed as the ''African Geographical Review'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bakama |first=BakamaNume |title=Brief History of the African Geographical Review |url=http://www.macalester.edu/geography/agr/history.htm |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012 it is published by Taylor &amp; Francis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">An '''art book fair''' is a type of curated [[Arts festival#Art Fair|art fair]] or [[exhibition]] for the purpose of displaying, selling and networking between artists, [[Artist's book|art book]] creators, illustrators, writers, specialty printers, [[Independent publisher|independent publishers]] and their audience. The parameters of inclusion vary from fair to fair: some only include publications which are themselves considered art objects, limited edition [[Artist's book|art books]], artist multiples or books specifically about an art topic; others are wider to include [[Graphic novel|graphic novels]], cultural [[Magazine|magazines]], [[Zine|zines]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]], and other artist projects. Like other art fairs, an art book fair will not only include works for sale but also artist installations, projects, [[Happening|happenings]], workshops, talks, panel discussions or book launches. Recursive fairs may run with a yearly theme or prompt which guides programming.

Unlike a traditional [[trade fair]] or book fair (such as the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]), art book fairs are public and less formal in regards to industry conferencing or networking; while they do serve as an opportunity for publishers and artists to commingle, the nature of art book sales is such that there are no sales or rights marketing as with a regular book fair. Instead, art book fairs are an aspect of [[Artist-run initiative|artist-run culture]] and an address to artmaking in the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] era&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherlock|first=Diana|date=Spring 2013|title=Institutions by Artists: Resistance Or Retreat?|url=|journal=International Contemporary Art|volume=|pages=16–20|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Art book fairs are also a way for viewers to interact with, collaborate, and learn with and obtain artwork outside of commercial art institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/obituaries/shannon-michael-cane-who-transformed-art-book-fairs-dies-at-43.html|title=Shannon Michael Cane, Who Transformed Art Book Fairs, Dies at 43|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2017-11-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=All the Books You'Ll Never Catch on a Kindle.|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=October 3, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the ephemeral and mass-produced nature of [[Publishing|publishing history]], "publishing seems to offer," as Offprint Paris director Yannick Bouillis put it, "an authentic, autonomous space within the art community. Books and other publishing artifacts such as magazines, posters, and tapes are—in comparison to artworks—relatively free from public and market concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/why-has-there-been-such-a-boom-in-art-book-fairs/948|title=Why has there been such a boom in art book fairs?|website=e-flux conversations|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
One early example of art book fair as differentiated from trade book fairs or art exhibitions is by artist-run non-profit organization [[Printed Matter, Inc|Printed Matter]], which emerged in New York City in the 1960s. Printed Matter began a bookstore and gallery which celebrated publishing as an artistic medium, artist-run culture, and alternative art practice, an ethos which has carried through to contemporary art book events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/beyond-prints-a-confrontation-at-la-art-book-fair|title=Beyond Prints: A Confrontation at L.A. Art Book Fair|date=2015-02-06|work=KCET|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2004 Printed Matter and then director, artist [[AA Bronson]], launched the first [[NY Art Book Fair|New York Art Book Fair]], and later the LA Art Book Fair in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.printedmatter.org/about/mission-history|title=Mission History - Printed Matter|website=Printed Matter|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fairs have grown steadily to an audience well beyond the local art scenes or literati: the 2015 NY Art Book Fair was host to 370 exhibitors from 28 countries and had an estimated 35,000 guests in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/09/26/ny-art-book-fair-numbers/|title=The Rise of the New York Art Book Fair: A Look at the Numbers|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=2015-09-26|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the Printed Matter model, art book fairs have emerged around the world as a way for artist-run or non-profit institutions to generate awareness with a broader public and fundraise through the sale of admission, special event tickets, and limited edition artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/beyond-prints-a-confrontation-at-la-art-book-fair|title=Beyond Prints: A Confrontation at L.A. Art Book Fair|date=2015-02-06|work=KCET|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fairs include the Vancouver Art Book Fair, Canada's first international art book fair, the London Art Book Fair and Tokyo Book Fair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2403">The '''Astrakhan Declaration''' is a [[Russia]]n-brokered [[humanitarian]] agreement between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], signed on October 27, 2010 in the Russian city of [[Astrakhan]]. Concerning the [[Nagorno-Karabakh#Contemporary_situation_.28since_1994.29|post-war situation in Nagorno-Karabakh]], the declaration envisages the exchange of [[prisoners of war]] and the return of the bodies of killed servicemen with the assistance of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] co-chairmen and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The First Deputy Chairman of the [[State Duma]] International Affairs Committee [[Leonid Eduardovich Slutsky|Leonid Slutsky]] assessed the declaration as "a small advancement in [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] sense", which in fact has "a great political significance in the case of Nagorno-Karabakh problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.az/news/politics/75736.html|title=Russia's State Duma welcomes Astrakhan declaration on Nagorno-Karabakh|publisher =Today.az|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101029180925/http://www.today.az/news/politics/75736.html| archivedate= 29 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In his statement, the then French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] said, that "the measures set out in the resolution adopted in Astrakhan can help to reduce tension and violations of the ceasefire, which have become frequent in past months" and "therefore, France expects them to be executed immediately".&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/?p=4184|title=US and France Hail Medvedev Mediation on Karabagh|publisher =Mirror-Spectator|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press briefing in Washington U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [[Philip J. Crowley]] welcomed the signing of Astrakhan Declaration as a "positive development": "We appreciate President [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]]’s personal efforts to reach this agreement, which aims to build confidence between the parties and to strengthen the [[Bishkek Protocol|1994 ceasefire]]".&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

The '''Beaver Hall Group''' refers to a [[Montreal]]-based group of [[Canadians|Canadian]] painters who met in the late 1910s while studying art at a school run by the [[Art Association of Montreal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism. They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of [[Modern art|Modernist]] and traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All ten of the group's participants had studied under [[William Brymner]] (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of [[Randolph Stanley Hewton]], [[Edwin Holgate]], [[Mabel May]] and [[Lilias Torrance Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://artcore.ca/beaverhall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the [[downtown Montreal]] studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included [[Mabel Lockerby]], [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]], and President of the group, [[A.Y. Jackson]].

The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, [[A.Y. Jackson|Jackson]] emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel "with utter disregard for what
has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us," Jackson stressed, "individual expression is our chief concern".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; He identified its goals as being those of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the ''Montreal Gazette'' and ''La Presse'' gave generous coverage to the vernissage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO926-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition "The Beaver Hall Hill Group". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]] and [[A.Y. Jackson]] had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, ''1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group'' at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, "As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/correspondents/jazz-age-montreal-and-the-beaver-hall-group-canada-s-other-modernist-art-movement|title = Jazz Age Montreal and the Beaver Hall Group: Canada's Other Modernist Art Movement|date = December 14, 2015|accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = Magazine|publisher = National Gallery of Canada|last = Singhal|first = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bendor Gerard Robert Grosvenor''' (born 27 November 1977) is a British [[art dealer]], [[Art history|art historian]] and writer. He is known for discovering a number of important [[lost artworks]] by Old Master artists, including [[Sir Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brueghels-return-to-fold-as-lost-sheep-are-found-k6qm3cdzm|title=Brueghels Return to the Fold|work=The Times|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a dealer he specialises in Old Masters, with a particular interest in [[Anthony van Dyck]].

During 2011 - 2016 he performed specialist research for, and appeared in, the [[BBC1]] art programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxxz6/profiles/bendor-grosvenor|title=Fake or Fortune?|work=BBC One|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then presented the [[BBC4]] series ''[[Britain's Lost Masterpieces]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07xjtbp|title=Britain's Lost Masterpieces|work=BBC One|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Jacky Klein and Emma Dabiri, which ran from 2016 - 2017.

==Life and work==
Grosvenor was educated at [[Harrow School]], [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] where he completed his PhD entitled ''"The Politics of Foreign Policy: Lord Derby and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-8"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|title=Bendor Grosvenor|work=Philip Mould &amp; Company|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040923/http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|archivedate=24 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming an art historian he worked in politics, first as an adviser to the Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Lord Stratford]], and then to the Conservative MP [[Hugo Swire]].

His first major art discovery was a mis-catalogued portrait by [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] in 2003 that was being sold at a London auction as a work by Lawrence's pupil, [[George Henry Harlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/417wnxhPlvxr5JxPGdKFJcT/bendor-grosvenor|title=Bendor Grosvenor}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 until 2014 he worked for [[Philip Mould]] Ltd{{fact|date=February 2017}}, where he made a number of significant art historical discoveries, including lost works by artists such as [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], and [[Sir Anthony Van Dyck]], on whom he is an acknowledged specialist.{{cn|date=September 2018}} He now has his own company, and specialises in establishing the authenticity of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconografie.co.uk|title=Iconografie}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nicg|date=February 2017}} He recently{{when|date=September 2018}} sold a newly identified portrait by [[Joan Carlile]], the first professional British female artist, to the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/typical-how-britains-first-professional-female-artist-was-mistak|title=Typical!|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 he discovered the [[Lost portrait of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|"lost portrait" of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham ]] at [[Pollok House]], [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The painting was thought to be a copy of a painting by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]] that had been lost for nearly 400 years, but after restoration was found to be the original by Rubens.&lt;ref name="graun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slawson|first1=Nicola|title=Lost Rubens portrait of James I's 'lover' is rediscovered in Glasgow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lost-rubens-portrait-james-i-lover-rediscovered-glasgow|accessdate=26 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grosvenor has been a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, and the Lord Chancellor's Forum for Historical Manuscripts and Academic Research.{{citation_needed|date=April 2018}} He also works as a journalist and writer, and presents programmes for BBC2's ''[[The Culture Show]]''.

==Jacobite portraiture==
Grosvenor has made a special study of Jacobite portraiture. In 2009 he proved that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery's iconic portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] was in fact a portrait of Charles' brother, [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/gallery-admits-portrait-isn-t-bonnie-prince-charlie-1-782863|title=Gallery admits portrait isn't Bonnie Prince Charlie|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013 he discovered the [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]] by Scottish artist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] at [[Gosford House]], the home of the [[Earl of Wemyss]] near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost Bonnie Prince Charlie portrait found in Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-26287887|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrait is now on display at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]], and has taken the place of the La Tour pastel as the definitive portrait of Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14391862.Historic__lost__portrait_of_Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_secured_by_National_Galleries_of_Scotland|title=Historic lost portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie secured by the National Portrait Gallery|work=The Herald|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
The name ''Bendor'' is derived from the Grosvenor family's medieval heraldic shield, ''a bend or'', a golden [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] (diagonal stripe), which they used until 1389 when it was claimed instead by the Scrope family, in the case [[Scrope v Grosvenor]]. [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|The 2nd Duke of Westminster]] was nicknamed "Bendor". 

Bendor is the grandson of [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Baron Ebury|The 5th Baron Ebury]], and the 4th cousin once removed of [[Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster|The 7th Duke of Westminster]]. (He is fourth in line to the Marquessate of Westminster after [[Francis Grosvenor, 8th Earl of Wilton|The 8th Earl of Wilton]], Viscount Grey de Wilton, and his first cousin Alexander Grosvenor.) He is also of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] heritage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">[[Image:Beneventan.jpeg|thumb|right|Rule of St. Benedict, written at Monte Cassino in the late 11th century]]
The '''beneventan script''' was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[writing system|script]] which originated in the [[Duchy of Benevento]] in [[southern Italy]]. It was also called ''Langobarda'', ''Longobarda'', ''Longobardisca'' (signifying its origins with the [[Lombards]]), or sometimes ''Gothica''; it was first called ''Beneventan'' by [[palaeography|palaeographer]] [[Elias Avery Lowe|E. A. Lowe]].

It is mostly associated with Italy south of [[Rome]], but it was also used in Beneventan-influenced centres across the [[Adriatic Sea]] in [[Dalmatia]]. The script was used from approximately the mid-8th century until the 13th century, although there are examples from as late as the 16th century. There were two major centres of Beneventan usage: the [[monastery]] on [[Monte Cassino]], and [[Bari]]. The Bari type developed in the 10th century from the Monte Cassino type; both were based on [[Roman cursive]] as written by the Langobards. In general the script is very angular. According to Lowe, the perfected form of the script was used in the 11th century, while [[Pope Victor III|Desiderius]] was abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], declining thereafter.

==Features==
Beneventan features many [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] and "connecting strokes" – the letters of a word could be joined together by a single line, with forms almost unrecognizable to a modern eye.
Ligatures may be obligatory as: {{angbr|ei}}, {{angbr|gi}}, {{angbr|li}}, {{angbr|ri}} and {{angbr|ti}} (two different forms: ''ti-dura'' where had kept the t sound and ''ti-assibilata'' where t had taken the vulgar ts sound). They may be optional: frequent as {{angbr|et}}, {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|st}}; or rare as {{angbr|ta}}, {{angbr|to}} and {{angbr|xp}}.&lt;ref name="NewtonF"&gt;The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058-1105, Francis Newton&lt;/ref&gt;
Ligatures involving the letter {{angbr|t}} resemble late New Latin Cursive as in the [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]] and [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]],&lt;ref name="NewtonF" /&gt; exception made for peculiar  {{angbr|st}} ligature where  {{angbr|s}} is connected to  {{angbr|t}} on top influencing later on the [[pre-caroline script|German pre-caroline script]] and all the script from this derived until nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;Fonts for latin paleography, 4th ed.,   Juan-José Marcos&lt;/ref&gt; In ligatures {{angbr|t}} can take many forms depending on the letter joined to it. Ligatures with the letters {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|r}} are also common. In early forms of Beneventan, the letter {{angbr|a}} has an open top, similar to the letter {{angbr|u}}; later, it resembled "cc" or "oc", with long tails hanging to the right. In the Bari type, the letter {{angbr|c}} often has a "broken" form, resembling the Beneventan form of the letter {{angbr|e}}. However, {{angbr|e}} itself has a very long middle arm, distinguishing it from {{angbr|c}}. The letter {{angbr|d}} can have a vertical or left-slanting [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]], the letter {{angbr|g}} resembles the [[uncial]] form, and the letter {{angbr|i}} is very tall and resembles {{angbr|l}}.

The script has a unique way to signify [[Scribal abbreviation|abbreviations]] both by omission and contraction – like most other Latin scripts, missing letters can be signified by a macron over the previous letter, although Beneventan often adds a dot to the macron. There is also a symbol resembling the digit {{angbr|3}}, or a sideways {{angbr|m}}, when the letter {{angbr|m}} has been omitted. In other scripts there is often little or no punctuation, but standard punctuation forms were developed for the Beneventan script, including the basis for the modern [[question mark]].

Beneventan shares some features with Visigothic and Merovingian script, probably due to the common late Roman matrix.

A '''buffalo jump''' is a cliff formation which Native Americans historically used to hunt and kill [[plains bison]] in mass quantities.

[[File:Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump-27527-2.jpg|thumb|right|Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, in southern Alberta]]
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Hunting Buffalo - Walters 371940190.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo being chased off a cliff as seen and painted by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]] in the late 19th century.]]

==Method of the hunt==
Hunters herded the bison and drove them over the cliff, breaking their legs and rendering them immobile. Tribe members waiting below closed in with spears and bows to finish the kills. The [[Blackfoot]] Indians called the buffalo jumps "pishkun", which loosely translates as "deep blood kettle". This type of hunting was a communal event which occurred as early as 12,000 years ago and lasted until at least 1500 AD, around the time of the introduction of horses.  The broader term '''[[Game (food)|game]] jumps''' includes buffalo jumps and cliffs used for similarly hunting other herding animals, such as reindeer. The Indians believed that if any buffalo escaped these killings then the rest of the buffalo would learn to avoid humans, which would make hunting even harder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=441 A Buffalo Jump], Discovering Clark and Lewis, The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo jump sites are often identified by rock [[cairn]]s, which were markers designating "drive lanes", by which bison would be funneled over the cliff. These drive lanes would often stretch for several miles.

Buffalo jump sites yield significant archaeological evidence because processing sites and camps were always nearby. The sites yield information as to how the Native Americans used the bison for food, clothing and shelter. Plains Indians in particular depended on the bison for their very survival. Every part of the animal could be used in some way: hides for clothes and shelter, bones for tools, sinews for bowstrings and laces. Hooves could be ground for glue, and the brains could be used in the [[tanning (leather)|tanning]] process for the hides. The extra meat was preserved as [[pemmican]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/hunting/mass.html Mass Kills.] ''Texas Beyond History.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his journals, [[Meriwether Lewis]] describes how a buffalo jump was practiced during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;one of the most active and fleet young men is selected and disguised in a robe of buffalo skin... he places himself at a distance between a herd of buffalo and a precipice proper for the purpose; the other Indians now surround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all show themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffalo; the disguised Indian or decoy has taken care to place himself sufficiently near the buffalo to be noticed by them when they take to flight and running before them they follow him in full speed to the precipice; the Indian (decoy) in the mean time has taken care to secure himself in some cranny in the cliff... the part of the decoy I am informed is extremely dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Wednesday May 29, 1805. The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (Volume 4). Gary E. Moulton, editor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite having described a jump in detail, neither Lewis nor any white settlers are known to have personally witnessed the events.&lt;ref&gt;Reader's Digest "Mysteries of the Ancient Americas" (The Reader's Digest Association, Inc., 1986) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carpathian Tumuli culture''' (or "Carpathian Kurgan culture") is the name given to an [[archaeological culture]] which evolved in the parts of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] between the end of the 2nd and end of the 4th century AD. It was less vast than the area occupied by the [[Lipiţa culture]], encompassing today's [[Pokuttya]], [[Maramureş]], [[Bucovina]] and to a lesser extent, Northwest [[Moldova]].

The arrival of [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]] in the Upper [[Dniester]] region forced the [[Costoboci]] to withdraw or crowd into the Carpathians at the end of the 2nd century AD and the beginning of the 3rd, where a part of them were already living. Other groups migrated to the area of the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi people]] (Moldova) or remained to live together with the newly arrived peoples of the [[Przeworsk culture]].

Most of the material evidence of the culture suggests it was [[Dacians|Dacian]]. Tumuli tomb building disappeared from [[Roman Dacia]] with the coming of Imperial administration, but it continued to exist in the unconquered north of Dacia, a sign that the local population kept its ancestral traditions. The demarcation line is fairly clear, since the neighbour Przeworsk peoples did not have tumular tombs. As in the Lipiţa culture, the dead were cremated and their ashes were put in urns which were buried in the tumuli. The difference with the Carpathian Tumuli culture is that plane tombs are no longer found, but only (or almost only) tumular tombs.

After [[Roman emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] defeated the neighbouring Carpi people in 381 AD, the people of the Carpathian Tumuli culture lost an important ally and this archaeological culture dissipates soon after, its place being taken by another one, the [[Chernyakhov culture|Sântana de Mureș–Chernyakhov culture]], which also replaces the [[Poieneşti – Lucaşevca culture]] in the Northwestern Moldavian Subcarpathians, formed by the [[Bastarnae]] between the Costoboci and the Carpi.

We can follow the Costoboci even after the beginning of the 5th century, the newly formed [[Korchak culture|Prague-Korchak culture]] being linked to the Carpathian Tumuli. There was no chronological break between the two cultures; the Costoboci remained on their territories, but now start to receive not only Slavic-type material culture elements, but also some Slavic population.

In [[linguistics]], the '''catena''' (English pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|t|iː|n|ə}}, plural '''catenas''' or '''catenae'''; from [[Latin]] for "chain")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|catena}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a unit of [[syntax]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], closely associated with [[dependency grammar]]s. It is a more flexible and inclusive unit than the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] and may therefore be better suited than the constituent to serve as the fundamental unit of syntactic and morphosyntactic analysis.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

The catena concept was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady (1998) introduced the catena concept as a basis for his analysis of the [[syntax]] of [[idioms]]. O'Grady called the relevant syntactic unit a "chain", however, not a "catena". The term ''catena'' was introduced later by Osborne et al. (2012) as a means of avoiding confusion with the preexisting chain concept of [[Minimalist grammar|Minimalist]] theory.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been seized upon by other linguists&lt;ref&gt;The catena concept has been developed beyond O'Grady's (1998) analysis of idioms. See the following articles: Osborne (2005), Osborne et al. (2011), Osborne (2012), Osborne and Groß (2012a, 2012b), Osborne et al. (2012), and Osborne (2014: 620–624).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied to the syntax of [[idiosyncratic]] meaning of all sorts, such as [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] mechanisms (e.g. [[gapping]], [[stripping (linguistics)|stripping]], [[Verb phrase ellipsis|VP-ellipsis]], [[pseudogapping]], [[sluicing]], [[answer ellipsis]], comparative deletion), [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]-[[verb argument|argument]] structures, and [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]] ([[topicalization]], [[wh-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], [[extraposition]], etc.). The catena concept has also been taken as the basis for a theory of morphosyntax, i.e. for the extension of dependencies into words; dependencies are acknowledged between the morphs that constitute words.&lt;ref&gt;Two articles that acknowledge morph catenae, i.e. catenae the links of which are morphs (as opposed to complete words) are Groß and Osborne (2013) and Groß (2014). The former article, which is in German, demonstrates that constructions often consist of morph catenae and the latter article, which is in English, provides a dependency grammar account of [[clitics]] based upon the catena.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the catena concept has been applied mainly to the syntax of English, other works are also demonstrating its applicability to the syntax and morphology of other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Groß and Osborne (2013) demonstrate the applicability of the catena concept to the syntax and morphosyntax of German, and Imrényi  (2013a, 2013b: 98–100, 2013c) shows its utility for the analysis of verb combinations and clause structure in Hungarian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
:'''Catena'''
:Combination of elements (lexeme or morpheme) that are continuous in the vertical dimension (''y''-axis)

==Graph-theoretic definition==
In terms of graph theory, any syntactic [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] or connected subgraph of a tree is a catena. In this regard, every [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] is a catena, but there are many catenae that are not constituents. The constituent is therefore a subtype of catena. Any individual element (word or morph) or combination of elements linked together in the vertical dimension is a catena. Sentence structure is conceived of as existing in two dimensions. Combinations organized along the horizontal dimension (in terms of precedence) are called ''strings'', whereas combinations organized along the vertical dimension (in terms of dominance) are catenae. In terms of a [[cartesian coordinate system]], strings exist along the ''x''-axis, and catenae along the ''y''-axis.

[[File:Impenetrability.png|thumb|Illustration of morph catenae]]

==Four units==
An understanding of the catena is established by distinguishing between the catena and other, similarly defined units. There are four units (including the catena) that are pertinent in this regard: ''string'', ''catena'', ''component'', and ''[[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]]''. The definition of the catena is repeated for easy comparison with the definitions of the other three units:

::'''String'''
::Combination of elements that is continuous in the horizontal dimension (''x''-axis)

::'''Catena'''
::Combination of elements that is continuous in the vertical dimension (''y''-axis)

::'''Component'''
::Combination of elements that is both a string and a catena

::'''Constituent'''
::Component that is ''complete''

A component is complete if it includes all the elements that its root node dominates. The string and catena complement each other in an obvious way, and the definition of the constituent is essentially the same as one finds in most theories of syntax, where a constituent is understood to consist of ''any node plus all the nodes that that node dominates''. These definitions will now be illustrated with the help of the following dependency tree. The capital letters serve to abbreviate the words:

:::::[[File:Thistreeillustratesthecatenaunit.jpg|Catena illustration]]

All of the distinct strings, catenae, components, and constituents in this tree are listed here:

::'''Distinct strings'''
::AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF, ABCD, BCDE, CDEF, ABCDE, BCDEF, and ABCDEF

::'''Distinct catenae'''
::AB, BC, CF, DF, EF, ABC, BCF, CDF, CEF, DEF, ABCF, BCDF, BCEF, CDEF, ABCDF, ABCEF, BCDEF, and ABCDEF.

::'''Distinct components'''
::AB, BC, EF, ABC, DEF, CDEF, BCDEF, and ABCDEF

::'''Distinct constituents'''
::AB, DEF, ABCDEF

Noteworthy is the fact that the tree contains 39 distinct word combinations that are not catenae, e.g. AC, BD, CE, BCE, ADF, ABEF, ABDEF, etc. Observe as well that there are a mere six constituents, but 24 catenae. There are therefore four times more catenae in the tree than there are constituents. The inclusivity and flexibility of the catena unit becomes apparent. The following Venn diagram provides an overview of how the four units relate to each other:

::::::[[File:Venn diagram of four units of syntax and morphology (en).svg|Venn diagram that illustrates relationship between four key units of syntax and morphology]]

==Idiosyncratic language==
Idiosyncratic language of all sorts can be captured in terms of catenae. When meaning is constructed in such a manner that does not allow one to acknowledge meaning chunks as constituents, the catena is involved. The meaning bearing units are catenae, not constituents. This situation is illustrated here in terms of various collocations and proper idioms.

===Some collocations===
Simple collocations (i.e. the co-occurrence of certain words) demonstrate well the catena concept. The idiosyncratic nature of [[phrasal verb|particle verb]] collocations provide the first group of examples: ''take after'', ''take in'', ''take on'', ''take over'', ''take up'', etc. In its purest form, the verb ''take'' means 'seize, grab, possess'. In these collocations with the various particles, however, the meaning of ''take'' shifts significantly each time depending on the particle. The particle and ''take'' convey a distinct meaning together, whereby this distinct meaning cannot be understood as a straightforward combination of the meaning of ''take'' alone and the meaning of the preposition alone. In such cases, one says that the meaning is ''non-compositional''. Non-compositional meaning can be captured in terms of catenae. The word combinations that assume non-compositional meaning form catenae (but not constituents):

:[[File:Take itandon.jpg|four take trees]]

Both the a- and b-sentences show that while the verb and its particle do not form a constituent, they do form a catena each time. The contrast in word order across the sentences of each pair illustrates what is known as [[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]. Shifting occurs to accommodate the relative weight of the constituents involved. Heavy constituents prefer to appear to the right of lighter sister constituents. The shifting does not change the fact that the verb and particle form a catena each time, even when they do not form a string.

Numerous verb-preposition combinations are idiosyncratic collocations insofar as the choice of preposition is strongly restricted by the verb, e.g. ''account for'', ''count on'', ''fill out'', ''rely on'', ''take after'', ''wait for'', etc. The meaning of many of these combinations is also non-compositional, as with the particle verbs. And also as with the particle verbs, the combinations form catenae (but not constituents) in simple declarative sentences:

::[[File:Take again.jpg|Verb-preposition combinations]]

The verb and the preposition that it demands form a single meaning-bearing unit, whereby this unit is a catena. These meaning-bearing units can thus be stored as catenae in the mental lexicon of speakers. As catenae, they are concrete units of syntax.

The final type of collocations produced here to illustrate catenae is the complex preposition, e.g. ''because of'', ''due to'', ''inside of'', ''in spite of'', ''out of'', ''outside of'', etc. The intonation pattern for these prepositions suggests that orthographic conventions are correct in writing them as two (or more) words. This situation, however, might be viewed as a problem, since it is not clear that the two words each time can be viewed as forming a constituent. In this regard, they do of course qualify as a catena, e.g.

::[[File:Sheleft.jpg|particle verb trees]]

The collocations illustrated in this section have focused mainly on prepositions and particles and they are therefore just a small selection of meaning-bearing collocations. They are, however, quite suggestive. It seems likely that all meaning-bearing collocations are stored as catenae in the mental lexicon of language users.

===Proper idioms===
Full idioms are the canonical cases of non-compositional meaning. The fixed words of idioms do not bear their productive meaning, e.g. ''take it on the chin''. Someone who "takes it on the chin" does not actually experience any physical contact to their chin, which means that ''chin'' does not have its normal productive meaning and must hence be part of a greater collocation. This greater collocation is the idiom, which consists of five words in this case. While the idiom ''take it on the chin'' can be stored as a VP constituent (and is therefore not a problem for constituent-based theories), there are many idioms that clearly cannot be stored as constituents. These idioms are a problem for constituent-based theories precisely because they do not qualify as constituents. However, they do of course qualify as catenae. The discussion here focuses on these idioms since they illustrate particularly well the value of the catena concept.

Many idioms in English consist of a verb and a noun (and more), whereby the noun takes a possessor that co-indexed with the subject and will thus vary with subject. These idioms are stored as catenae but clearly not as constituents, e.g.
 
::[[File:Idioms 2.jpg|Idioms 1]]

Similar idioms have a possessor that is freer insofar as it is not necessarily co-indexed with the subject. These idioms are also stored as catenae (but not as constituents), e.g.

::[[File:She stepped on my toes.jpg|Catena: Idioms 2]]

The following idioms include the verb, and object, and at least one preposition. It should again be obvious that the fixed words of the idioms can in no way be viewed as forming constituents:

::[[File:Idioms2.jpg|Idioms 3]]

The following idioms include the verb and the prepositional phrase at the same time that the object is free:

::[[File:Idioms3.jpg|Idioms 4]]

And the following idioms involving a ditransitive verb include the second object at the same time that the first object is free:

::[[File:Idioms4.jpg|Idioms 5]]

Certainly sayings are also idiomatic. When an adverb (or some other adjunct) appears in a saying, it is not part of the saying. Nevertheless, the words of the saying still form a catena:

::[[File:Catena-idioms.jpg|Sayings trees]]

==Ellipsis==
[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] mechanisms (gapping, stripping, VP-ellipsis, pseudogapping, answer fragments, sluicing, comparative deletion) are eliding catenae, whereby many of these catenae are non-constituents. The following examples illustrate [[gapping]]:

::[[File:Catena-ellipsis.jpg|Ellipsis picture 1]]

The a-clauses are acceptable instances of gapping; the gapped material corresponds to the catena in green. The b-clauses are failed attempts at gapping; they fail because the gapped material does not correspond to a catena. The following examples illustrate stripping. Many linguists see stripping as a particular manifestation of gapping where just a single remnant remains in the gapped/stripped clause:

::[[File:Catena-ellipsis2.jpg|Ellipsis picture 2]]

The a-clauses are acceptable instances of stripping, in part because the stripped material corresponds to a catena (in green). The b-clauses again fail; they fail because the stripped material does not qualify as a catena. The following examples illustrate answer ellipsis:

::[[File:Catena-answer fragments.jpg|Ellipsis picture 4]]

In each of the acceptable answer fragments (a–e), the elided material corresponds to a catena. In contrast, the elided material corresponds to a non-catena in each of the unacceptable answer fragments (f–h).

The journal's full title was '''Central Asian Review: A Quarterly Review of Current Developments in Soviet Central Asia and Kazakhstan''' and was published quarterly by the [[Central Asian Research Centre]] in association with [[St. Antony's College]], [[Oxford University]]. Founder and director of the center, [[Geoffrey Wheeler (historian)|Geoffrey Wheeler]] was the editor-in-chief and frequent contributor to the journal.&lt;ref name=opc4&gt;{{

''Central Asian Review'' was one of the primary venues for scholarly articles concerning [[Central Asia]] and was the main English language source for digests of Soviet press coverage of Central Asia. The journal was notable because it was one of the few periodicals of Central Asian Studies published during a time when research in the field was difficult, due to Soviet censorship and travel restrictions for researchers. In 1968 Wheeler left the Central Asian Research Center and the following year “Central Asian Review” was incorporated into the journal ''Mizan'', published by the center from 1965 to 1971.&lt;ref name=opc4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myer/&gt;

The '''dative construction''' is a grammatical way of constructing a sentence, using the [[dative case]]. A sentence is also said to be in dative construction if the subject and the object (direct or indirect) can switch their places for a given verb, without altering the verb's structure (subject becoming the new object, and the object becoming the new subject). The latter case is not to be confused with the [[passive voice]], where only the ''direct'' object of a sentence becomes the subject of the passive-voiced sentence, and the verb's structure also changes to convey the meaning of the passive voice. The dative construction tends to occur when the verb indicates a state rather than an action.

==Examples==

===German===
In [[German language|German]], the dative construction sometimes occurs with the verb ''sein'' ("to be"). Compare:

:''Ich bin kalt'' ("I am cold")
:''Mir ist kalt'' (literally "Cold is to me")

The first example implies that the speaker has a cold personality. The subject here (''ich'', "I") is in the nominative case. The second construction is used when one wants to say "I am (feeling) cold" in German. While in English the subject of the sentence "I am cold" is "I", in German the subject of the sentence "''Mir ist kalt''" is ''kalt'' and ''mir'' ("me"-DATIVE) is the indirect object. The use of the nominative form equivalent to "I" is only possible with a different meaning: "Ich bin kalt"='I am cold (in personality)'. "Mir" behaves like a subject and can control infinitives:

"Mir war zu kalt um zur Kirche zu gehen"

me.DAT was too cold for to.the.Fem.D church to go.INFIN

'I was too cold to go to church' ("I" go, not "cold")

=== Icelandic ===
Dative constructions are extremely common in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. Their use is similar to that of German, although perhaps somewhat more widespread. The following example is exactly the same as the German one given above:

:''Ég er kaldur'' ("I am cold")
:''Mér er kalt'' (literally means, "cold is to me")

The implication of the first example is the same as in German, that the speaker has a cold personality rather than feeling physically cold. Dative constructions appear in many fixed expressions such as this, such as ''mér er alveg sama'' ("I don't care", lit. "to me it's completely the same"), ''henni er annt um umhverfið'' ("she cares about the environment", lit. "to her is dear about the environment") and ''þú getur fengið nýjan síma þér að kostnaðarlausu'' ("you can get a new phone free of charge", lit. "you can get a new phone to you at no cost").

[[Passive voice|Passive]] constructions in Icelandic also require the subject to be in the dative if the verb in question governs the dative, e.g. ''tímaáætluninni var breytt'' ("the timetable was changed"), ''skjölunum var eytt'' ("the documents were deleted") and ''framkvæmdum var frestað um tvær vikur'' ("works were delayed by two weeks"). Compare to passive constructions where the verb governs the accusative: ''búðin var opnuð á föstudaginn'' ("the shop was opened on Friday") and ''bréfið var sent fyrir hádegi'' ("the letter was sent before noon"). Verbs that govern the [[genitive case|genitive]] behave in the same way as verbs governing the dative, e.g. ''þín verður saknað'' ("you will be missed").

Finally, certain verbs require the subject to be in the dative. This is particularly common with verbs of emotion or opinion. For example:

:''Mér finnst hann góður kennari.'' ("I think he's a good teacher", lit. "to me [it] finds [that] he [is] a good teacher")
:''Önnu þykir erfitt að hætta.'' ("Anna finds it hard to stop", lit. "to Anna [it] seems difficult to stop")

This phenomenon is not only restricted to the dative case, some verbs require their subject to be in the accusative:

:''Krakkana langar í ís.'' ("The kids want ice cream")

In all of the above instances, the verbs used in these constructions are in the third-person singular form.

===Spanish===
A number of verbs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] employ a dative construction. Many of these verbs express psychological states; the most common one is ''gustar'', which is equivalent to English ''like'' (but syntactically functions like ''be pleasant to''). The verb agrees with the formal/morphological subject, but the subject is usually placed after the verb instead of before, as usual. The dative construction requires a [[clitic]] [[pronoun]]; if the dative argument is a full noun phrase or needs to be explicitly stated, it is shown by a phrase with the preposition ''a''.

:''Me gusta el verano.'' ("I like the summer")
:''A mí me gusta más la primavera.'' ("[As for me,] I like the spring better")
:''A Juan le gustan las rubias.'' ("Juan likes blondes")
:''A ella le gustas.'' ("She likes you")

Other verbs which show this pattern are ''apasionar'' ("to be passionate about"), ''antojarse'' ("to have a feeling for"), ''encantar'' ("to adore"), ''faltar'' ("to be lacking"), ''quedar'' ("to fall") and ''sobrar'' ("to be left").

===Serbo-Croatian===
In [[Serbo-Croatian]] (as in other [[Slavic languages]]), the dative construction is often used, mostly in the same manner as in German:

: ''Hladan sam.''
: cold.ADJ-MASC.NOM.SG be-1st.SG
literally "I am cold", meaning "I am a cold person".

: ''Hladno mi je.''
: cold-ADV 1st-DAT.SG be-3rd.SG
literally "It is cold to me", meaning "I am (feeling) cold".

&lt;br/&gt;
Some verbs, like ''nedostajati'' ("lack") use dative constructions:

: ''Nedostaju mu zubi.''
: lack-3rd.PL he-DAT.SG Teeth-NOM.PL
literally "Teeth to him lack".

===Georgian dative construction===
&lt;!-- I doubt this belongs here. The indirect verbs are a special class; the rest seem to be showing a morphosyntactic split between imperfect and perfect forms, not really uncommon. --&gt;

The dative construction is very common in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. The dative construction of Georgian differs somewhat from German, in that the dative case agrees with a certain person marking on the verb. The dative construction occurs in the perfect (not perfective) tense of transitive verbs and in all the tenses of some verbs, such as "to want", "to have", "to forget" and "to remember". These verbs are also called "indirect verbs" by some generativists. Compare:

:''Bavshvebi tsqal'''s''' svamen'' ("children are drinking water") Imperfective Aspect-Present Tense, NOM-DAT
:''Bavshveb'''s''' tsqali dauleviat'' ("children have drunk water") Perfect Aspect-Present Tense, DAT-NOM
:''Bavsheveb'''ma''' tsqali da-li-es'' ("children drank water") Perfective Aspect-Past (Aorist) Tense, ERG-NOM

In Georgian, the -'''''s''''' suffix is the dative case marker. In the first sentence, ''bavshvebi'' ("children") is the subject and in the nominative case. ''Tsqals'' ("water") is the object and in the dative case (with the suffix -''s'' attached). In the second sentence, however, the subject (children) is in the dative case (with -''s''), and the object (water) is in the nominative case. The verb in the imperfective and perfective sentences are conjugated in accordance with the subject of the sentence (regardless of the case of the subject); they are both third person plural. Perfect verbs also agree in part with their dative case subjects (in this case the -u- between da- and -leviat), but only have third person verb endings (singular form for all singular persons and ALSO first person plural; plural form for 2nd/3rd person plural). Therefore, "I have drunk water" would be:

:''(me) da'''mi'''levia''  (-a is singular, -at is plural)

The dative construction is also a separate class of verbs (Class IV) which have the semantics of experience, cognitive processes, and possession (all common DAT-construction predicates in languages which have them). An example of this can be given with the possessive verb ''kona'' ("to have"):

:''Kal'''s''' tsigni akvs'' ("The woman has a book")
:''Kal'''s''' tsigni hkonda'' ("The woman had a book")
:''Kal'''s''' tsigni hkonia'' ("The woman has had a book")

In all the tenses, the subject ''kals'' ("woman") is in the dative case, and the object ''tsigni'' ("book") is in the nominative case. Etymologically, the root is also found in the future forms of the copula 'be', making it very much like the Latin dative possession construction 'mihi est X'. Again, all singular persons have an agreeing proclitic pronoun on the verb, but a third person singular verb ending (-a or -s).

:''(me) tsigni '''m'''akvs'' ("I have a book")

===Finnish===
The genitive case is used in dative constructions. The "dative genitive" (''datiivigenetiivi'') is no longer productive in Finnish language, and it is often replaced with other cases, except in frozen expressions, e.g. ''luojan kiitos'' (thanks to god).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=997&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Minä olen kylmä.'' = I am cold (cold personality).
:''Minun on kylmä.'' = "To me is cold."
::More often in modern language: ''Minulla on kylmä.'' = "At me is cold."

The dative genitive is often used with verb infinitives.
:''Minun pitää tehdä se.'' = "To me has to do it." = I have to do it.
:''Minun tekee mieli syödä makeisia.'' = "To me makes mind to eat candies..." = I'd like to eat candies.
:''Minun tekee pahaa ajatellakin sitä.'' = "To me makes bad to even think about it." = I feel bad just thinking it.

===Latin===
Latin uses a dative construction for indirect objects (''dativus possessivus'').
:''Mihi est liber.'' = "To me is book." = I have a book.
===Hungarian===
Hungarian uses a similar construction to Latin for rendering possession without the verb ''to have'' which is missing from Hungarian.

Born and raised in Pittsburgh, McCullough earned a degree in [[English literature]] from [[Yale University]]. His first book was ''[[The Johnstown Flood (book)|The Johnstown Flood]]'' (1968); and he has since written nine more on such topics as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John Adams]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the [[Wright brothers]]. McCullough has also narrated numerous documentaries, such as ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], as well as the 2003 film ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]''; and he hosted ''[[American Experience]]'' for twelve years.

McCullough's two Pulitzer Prize-winning books, ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'' and ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]'', have been adapted by [[HBO]] into a [[Truman (1995 film)|TV film]] and a [[John Adams (miniseries)|miniseries]], respectively.

==Life and career==

===Youth and education===
McCullough was born in the Point Breeze neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name="AoAbio"/&gt; the son of Ruth (née Rankin) and Christian Hax McCullough.&lt;ref name="NatBook95"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_dmccullough.html|title= David McCullough |accessdate=2008-04-24 |work=National Book Awards Acceptance Speeches|publisher=National Book Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] descent.&lt;ref name="CRose"/&gt; He was educated at Linden Avenue Grade School and [[Shady Side Academy]], in his hometown of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="PresMedal"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerome L |last=Sherman |title=Presidential biographer gets presidential medal |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06350/746640-44.stm |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2006-12-16 |accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of four sons, McCullough had a "marvelous" childhood with a wide range of interests, including sports and drawing cartoons.&lt;ref name="AoAint"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mcc2int-1|title= Interview: David McCullough Two Pulitzer Prizes for Biography|accessdate= 2008-04-22|date= 1995-06-03|publisher= Academy of Achievement|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080403031357/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mcc2int-1|archivedate= April 3, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough's parents and his grandmother, who read to him often, introduced him to books at an early age.&lt;ref name="CRose"/&gt; His parents often talked about history, a topic he says should be discussed more often.&lt;ref name="CRose"/&gt; McCullough "loved school, every day";&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt; he contemplated many career choices, ranging from architect, actor, painter, writer, to lawyer, and contemplated attending [[medical school]] for a time.&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt;

In 1951, McCullough began attending [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="Pitt son"&gt;{{cite news |first= Bob |last= Hoover|title=David McCullough: America's historian, Pittsburgh son |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/books/20011230mccullough1230fnp2.asp|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date= 2001-12-30|accessdate=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that it was a "privilege" to study English at Yale because of faculty members such as [[John O'Hara]], [[John Hersey]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], and [[Brendan Gill]].&lt;ref name="NEHint"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/mccullough/interview.html|title= David McCullough Interview|accessdate=2008-04-22 |last= Cole|first= Bruce|publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough occasionally ate lunch with the Pulitzer Prize-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcnj.edu/~wilder/biography/frame.html|title= Biography |accessdate= 2008-04-22 |publisher=Thorton Wilder Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; novelist and playwright [[Thornton Wilder]].&lt;ref name="NEHint"/&gt; Wilder, says McCullough, taught him that a competent writer maintains "an air of freedom" in the storyline, so that a reader will not anticipate the outcome, even if the book is non-fiction.&lt;ref name="Wilder"&gt;{{ cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432304576369421525987128?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_opinion|title=Don't Know Much about History|last=Bolduc|first=Brian|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2001-06-18|accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing career===

====Early career====
After graduation, McCullough moved to New York City, where ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' hired him as a trainee.&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt; He later worked as an editor and writer for the [[United States Information Agency]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="AoAbio"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/mcc2bio-1|title= David McCullough Biography|accessdate= 2008-04-23|date= 2005-02-02|publisher= Academy of Achievement|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044317/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/mcc2bio-1|archivedate= May 17, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working for twelve years, including a position at ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', in editing and writing, McCullough "felt that [he] had reached the point where [he] could attempt something on [his] own."&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt;

McCullough "had no anticipation that [he] was going to write history, but [he] stumbled upon a story that [he] thought was powerful, exciting, and very worth telling."&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt; While working at ''American Heritage'', McCullough wrote in his spare time for three years.&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEHbio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/mccullough/biography.html |title= David McCullough biography: The Citizen Chronicler|accessdate=2008-04-23 |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Johnstown Flood (book)|The Johnstown Flood]]'', a chronicle of one of the [[Johnstown Flood|worst flood disasters]] in United States history, was published in 1968&lt;ref name="AoAint"/&gt; to high praise by critics.&lt;ref name="FloodRev"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electriceggplant.com/davidmccullough/flood_reviews.htm|title= Johnstown Flood: Reviews and Praise|accessdate=2008-04-23 |publisher=ElectricEggplant}}. The bestselling author [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]] has written that ''The Johnstown Flood'' was a book that changed his life. He found it full of "suspense, drama, class conflict, dire goings-on."

A registered independent, McCullough has typically avoided publicly commenting on contemporary political issues. When asked to do so, he would repeatedly say, "My specialty is dead politicians."

{{Professional responsibility}}

'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] or [[admission to practice law]]. Disbarment is usually a punishment for [[Legal ethics|unethical]] or criminal conduct. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].

==Germany==
In Germany, the ''[[Berufsverbot]]'' is a ban on practicing a profession, which can be issued to a lawyer for misconduct, ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.

In April 1933, the Nazi government issued a ''Berufsverbot'' forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the [[Frontkämpferprivileg]].

==United States==
===Overview===
Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, [[commingling]] funds, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most{{Where|date=November 2012}} jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's &lt;!-- DON'T "FIX" THIS TO JUST DESSERTS --&gt;[[just deserts]]&lt;!-- "Desert", from the same French root as deserve, meaning something deserved --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985–1986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Deserts|author1=Gentile, Michael A. |author2=McShea, Sarah Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare (in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rocketlawyer.com/blog/getting-disbarred-is-harder-than-you-think-915832&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.&lt;ref name="reapply"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein }} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable U.S. disbarments===
{{main|List of disbarments in the United States}}
The 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. [[President of the United States|president]] and one former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] disbarred, and another president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.

Former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], having pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of [[bribery]] and [[tax evasion]], was disbarred from [[Maryland]], the state of which he had previously been [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].

Former President [[Richard Nixon]] was disbarred from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;See In re Nixon, 53 A.D.2d 178, 385 N.Y.S.2d 305 (1st Dept. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nixon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html|date=July 9, 1976 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028075731/http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[obstruction of justice]] related to the [[Watergate scandal]]. He had attempted to resign from the New York bar, as he had done with California and the Supreme Court, but his resignation was not accepted as he would not acknowledge that he was unable to defend himself from the charges brought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/09/archives/new-york-court-disbars-nixon-for-watergate-acts-nixon-disbarred-by.html|title=New York Court Disbars Nixon for Watergate Acts|author=Tom Goldstein|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, following a 5-year suspension by the Arkansas bar, the [[United States Supreme Court]] disbarred [[Bill Clinton]], providing 40 days for him to contest the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Disbarred From Practice Before Supreme Court |publisher=New York Times |date=October 1, 2001 |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/national/clinton-disbarred-from-practice-before-supreme-court.html |archiveurl =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/national/clinton-disbarred-from-practice-before-supreme-court.html |archivedate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton barred from practicing  before Supreme Court |publisher=CNN |date=October 2, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061752/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |archivedate=April 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned before the end of the 40 day period, avoiding permanent disbarment hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |date=November 9, 2001 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209032021/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |archivedate=December 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Mike Nifong]], the [[District Attorney]] of [[Durham County, North Carolina]] who presided over the [[Duke lacrosse case|2006 Duke University lacrosse case]], was disbarred for [[prosecutorial misconduct]] related to his handling of the case.&lt;ref name="nifong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3285862&amp;page=1|title=Former Duke Prosecutor Nifong Disbarred|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar [[Andrew Thomas (prosecutor)|Andrew Thomas]], former [[County Attorney]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]]. According to the panel, Thomas "outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law" while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found "clear and convincing evidence" that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/andrew-thomas-disbarred-phoenix-prosecutor_n_1415815.html | work=Huffington Post | first=John | last=Rudolf | title=Arizona Prosecutor Disbarred For Plotting Bad Arrests With 'America's Toughest Sheriff' | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Were this a criminal case," the panel concluded, "we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2012-04-19/news/andy-thomas-needs-a-perp-walk-with-his-papi-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against video games, rap music, and [[Howard Stern]] was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action was the result of several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson attempted to appeal to the higher courts in order to avoid the penalty actually taking effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5054772/jack-thompson-disbarred|title=Jack Thompson Disbarred|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the US District court, nor the US Supreme Court&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042009zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.

[[F. Lee Bailey]], noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book ''Florida Pulp Nonfiction'' details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7153568/|title=F. Lee Bailey mounts a comeback|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey is also best known for infamously representing murder suspect [[O. J. Simpson]] in 1994.

He ordered the execution of all Nader's sons and grandsons, with the exception of the 13-year-old [[Shahrukh Afshar|Shahrokh]], the son of Reza Qoli.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History'' p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Nader's former treasurer, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], had declared his independence by founding the [[Durrani Empire]]. In the process, the eastern territories were lost and in the following decades became part of [[Afghanistan]], the successor-state to the Durrani Empire.  The [[Ottomans]] regained lost territories in [[Eastern Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. The northern territories, Iran's most integral regions, had a different fate. [[Erekle II]] and [[Teimuraz II of Kakheti|Teimuraz II]], who, in 1744, had been made the kings of  [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] and [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny.

The Afsharid dynasty would continue to live on in parts of Khorasan with [[Mashhad]] as the capital. When the Zand empire expanded rapidly, Karim khan allowed the Afsharids to continue rule in Khorasan, showing his respect for [[Nader Shah]]. It was eventually dissolved upon the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] ascension to the throne.

The '''dragon houses''' ({{lang-el|Δρακόσπιτα}}, ''Drakospita'') or '''Draga''' (Δραγκά) are some 20 large, ruined buildings found in the south of the island of [[Euboea]], [[Greece]]. They were built with massive stone blocks without mortar  and large stone slabs  for the  roofs. The Dragon House on [[Ochi (mountain)|Mount Ochi]] (Δρακόσπιτο της Όχης), north of [[Karystos]] is the most famous and well preserved. Other notable buildings are located in Palli-Lakka (Πάλλη-Λάκκα Δραγκά) and in Kapsala. In local folklore "[[dragon]]s" are not only reptilian monsters but also beings with superhuman powers. 
 
There is no accepted theory  about the identity of the builders nor an agreed estimation on their dating. No mention is identified in classical texts and the first account is from the 18th-century British geologist, traveler and writer [[John Hawkins (geologist)|John Hawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins J., '' An Account of the Discovery of a very Ancient Temple on Mount Ocha in Euboea '', In: R. Walpole: '' Travels in Various Countries of the East'' London 1820, pp 285-293 ([https://archive.org/details/travelsinvarious00walp online])&lt;/ref&gt; The first detailed account, after Hawkins was in 1842 by the German archaeologist H.N. Ulrichs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reber|first1=Karl|title=The Dragon Houses of Styra: Topography, Architecture and function|url=http://maajournal.com/Issues/2010/Vol10-3/STYRA_REBER.pdf|website=MAA|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The French classical scholar Jules Girard visited Euboea and described the Ochi dragon house, and provided further descriptions of the three Palli-Lakka Dragon houses&lt;ref&gt;Girard J., ''Mémoire sur l'île d'Eubée'' In: ''Archives des missions scientifiques et littéraires'', Paris, 1851, Vol. 2, pp. 708-714, and picture ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5734803r/f717.image.r=Jules%20Girard online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss archaeologist Karl Reber has tracked down all reported buildings and published a report in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Reber K., '' The Dragon Houses of Styra: Topography, Architecture. and Function '', Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry, Vol. 10, 2010, No. 3, pp 53 -61 ([http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/maa_journal/STYRA_REBER.pdf  (pdf)])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7318">In [[linguistics]], an '''echo answer''' or '''echo response''' is a way of answering a [[polar question]] without using words for [[yes and no]].  The verb used in the question is simply echoed in the answer, negated if the answer has a negative [[truth-value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Questions and Questioning|editor=Michel Meyer|author=Wendy G. Lehnert and Brian K. Stucky|pages=224, 232|chapter=Understanding answers to questions|publisher=de Gruyter|year=1988|location=New York|isbn=3-11-010680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
* "Did you go to the cinema?" (or "Didn't you go to the cinema?")
* "I did not." or "I didn't go."

==Finnish==

The [[Finnish language]] is one language that employs echo answers in response to [[yes-no question]]s.  It does not answer them with either [[adverb]]s or [[interjection]]s.  So the answer to "Tuletteko kaupungista?" ("Are you coming from town?") is the verb form itself, "Tulemme" ("We are coming."). Negatively phrased questions are answered similarly.  Negative answers use the [[Finnish grammar#Negation of verbs|negative verb]] ''en'' in coordination with the infinitive. The negative answer to "Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?" ("Do you know Mr Lehto?") is "En tunne" ("I don't know.") or simply "En" ("I don't.").&lt;ref name=BloomfieldHockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Language|author=Leonard Bloomfield and Charles F. Hockett|pages=176&amp;ndash;177|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-226-06067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goddard&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://als.asn.au./proceedings/als2002/Goddard.pdf|booktitle=Proceedings of the 2002 Conference of the Australian Linguistic Society|pages=7|title=Yes or no? The complex semantics of a simple question|author=Cliff Goddard|format=PDF|editor=Peter Collins and Mengistu Amberber|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic languages==

The [[Celtic languages]] also primarily employ echo answers. [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] lack the words "yes" and "no" altogether. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the words for "yes" and "no" ("[[wikt:ie#Welsh|ie]]" and "[[wikt:nage#Welsh|nage]]") are restricted to specialized circumstances. Like Finnish, the main way in these languages to state yes or no, to answer yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. In Irish, the question "An dtiocfaidh tú?" ("Will you come?") will be answered with "Tiocfad" ("I will come") or "Ní thiocfad" ("I will not come"). (In [[Hiberno-English]], it is the auxiliary that is echoed: the English question "Will you come?" is often answered in Ireland with "I will" instead of "Yes" or "I will not" instead of "no".)

Similarly, in Welsh, the answers to "Ydy Fred yn dod?" ("Is Fred coming?") are "Ydy" ("He is") or "Nag ydy" ("He is not"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with "[[wikt:nag#Welsh|nag]]". As in Finnish, it avoids the issue of what an unadorned "yes" means in response to a negative question. A "yes" response to the question "You don't beat your wife?" is ambiguous in English, but the Welsh response "nag ydw" has no ambiguity.&lt;ref name=Goddard /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Welsh|author=Gareth King|chapter=Yes/no answers|pages=111|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-12096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to say "Yes" and "No"|work=A Welsh Course|author=Mark H Nodine|date=2003-06-14|url=http://cs.cf.ac.uk./fun/welsh/Lesson02.html|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science, [[Cardiff University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Welsh Answering System|author=Bob Morris Jones|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1999|isbn=978-3-11-016450-3}} &amp;mdash; Jones' analysis of how to answer questions in the Welsh language, broken down into a typology of echo and non-echo responsives, polarity and truth-value responses, and numbers of forms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin==

[[Latin]], which has no single words for "yes" and "no", also employs echo answers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latin for the First Year|author=Walter B. Gunnison|pages=300|publisher=READ BOOKS|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4437-1459-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite book|title=A Practical Grammar of the Latin Language; with Perpetual Exercises in Speaking and Writing|author=George J. Adler|pages=8|location=Boston|publisher=Sanborn, Carter, Bazin, &amp;amp; Co.|year=1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Calvert&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of adjectives and adverbs, and saying yes or no|work=Latin For Mountain Men|date=1999-06-24|author=J.

Palma|pages=296|publisher=Research &amp;amp; Education Association|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7386-0090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nōnne Doofus molestus discipulus est?
*: "Doofus is an annoying student, isn't he?"
* Est.
*: "He is."
* Num Doofus litterās memoriā tenēre potest?
*: "Doofus cannot remember the alphabet, can he?"
* Nōn potest.
*: "He cannot."

==Portuguese==

The [[Portuguese language]] is the only major Romance language to use echo answers often even though it has words for "yes" and "no" proper (''sim'' and ''não'' respectively) as well. Portuguese will most commonly answer a polar question in the affirmative by repeating the main verb.

For example, one would answer the question, "Tens fome?" ("Are you hungry?" literally, "Do you have hunger?") by simply replying, "tenho" ("I have"). One could also add ''sim'' before or after the verb for the use of emphasis or to contradict a negative question, producing "sim, tenho" or "tenho sim". To produce a ''negative'' answer to a polar question, the verb is repeated followed by ''não'' before or after it. Thus, a negative answer to our above question would be: "Não tenho," "Tenho não" or "Não tenho fome." For emphasis, one could even say, "Não tenho, não."

==Chinese Languages==

The [[Chinese languages]] often employs echo answers. Often, yes-no questions in Mandarin are expressed in the [[A-not-A]] form, and are answered with either A or not-A. &lt;ref&gt;Li, Charles N., and Thompson, Sandra A., ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'', Univ. of California Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.558-563}}
For example, where Q stands for question, A for affirmative, and N for negative:

'''Q''': 你要不要吃桔子？ ''Nǐ yào bú yào chī júzi?'' ("You want or not want eat orange?")

'''A''': 要。 ''Yào.'' ("Want.")

'''N''': 不要。 ''Bú yào.'' ("Not want.")

'''Q''': 他在不在慢跑？ ''Tā zài bú zài màn pǎo?'' ("He is or not jog?")

'''A''': 在（慢跑）。 ''zài （màn pǎo).'' ("Is (jog).")

'''N''': 不在（慢跑）。 ''Bu zài （màn pǎo)'' ("Not is (jog).")

In addition, yes-no questions are often formed by adding the particle "吗" (''ma'' for "yes or no?") to the end of a sentence, in which case the answer can be "是的" (''shì de'' for "is (so)") or "不是" (''bu shì'' for "not is (so)"), or "对" (''duì'' for "right") or "不对" (''bu duì'' for "not right"):

'''Q''': 你不上课吗？ ''Nǐ bu shàng kè ma?'' ("You not go-to class yes-or-no?")

'''A''': 对。 ''Duì.'' ("Right.") or 是的。 ''Shì de.'' ("Is (so).")

'''N''': 不对。 ''Bu duì.'' ("Not right.") or 不是。 "Bu shì. ("Not is (so).")

In human speech, '''egressive sounds''' are sounds in which the [[airstream mechanism|air stream]] is created by pushing air out through the mouth or nose.  The three types of egressive sounds are '''[[pulmonic sounds|pulmonic egressive]]''' (from the [[lung]]s), '''[[ejective consonant|glottalic egressive]]''' (from the [[glottis]]), and '''lingual''' ('''velaric''') '''egressive''' (from the [[tongue]]). The opposite of an egressive sound is an [[ingressive sound]], in which the airstream flows inward through the mouth or nose.

==Pulmonic egressive==
[[Pulmonic sounds|Pulmonic]] egressive sounds are those in which the air stream is created by the [[lung]]s, [[rib]]s, and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The majority of sounds in most languages, such as vowels, are both pulmonic and egressive.  Pulmonic egressive sounds are found in all spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, Richard. ''An Introduction to English Phonetics''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glottalic egressive==
Glottalic egressive sounds are known as [[ejective consonant|ejective]]s.

==Lingual egressive==
The lingual egressive, also known as '''velaric egressive''', involves a double closure similar to that of the [[lingual ingressive]] sounds known as [[click consonants|clicks]], but with airflow in the opposite direction.  With the [[soft palate|velum]] closed, the speaker forces air out of the mouth using either the tongue or cheeks, as in the French expression of dismissal. While not known to be used for normal vocabulary in any human language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladefoged |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Ladefoged |title=A Course in Phonetics |year=2006 | edition=5th |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Boston |isbn=1-4130-0688-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from the extinct Australian ritual language [[Damin]], a variation of this airstream mechanism is known to musicians as part of [[circular breathing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">'''Encoded Archival Context - Corporate bodies, Persons and Families''' (EAC-CPF) is an [[XML]] standard for encoding information about the creators of archival materials -- i.e., a corporate body, person or family -- including their relationships to (a) resources (books, collections, papers, etc.) and (b) other corporate bodies, persons and families.  The goal is to provide contextual information regarding the circumstances of record creation and use.  EAC-CPF can be used in conjunction with [[Encoded Archival Description]] (EAD) for enhancement of EAD's capabilities in encoding [[finding aid]]s, but can also be used in conjunction with other standards or for standalone authority file encoding. 

EAC-CPF is defined in a [[document type definition]] (DTD) as well as in an [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] and a [[Relax NG]] schema. EAC-CPF elements reflect the [[ISAAR(CPF)]] standard and the [[ISAD(G)]], two standards managed by the [[International Council on Archives]]. 

EAC-CPF has been and is being tested in various institutions, such as the European Union ''LEAF'' project; 'Linking and Exploring Authority Files', funded between 2001 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jutta

'''Eugen Ehrlich''' (14 September 1862 – 2 May 1922) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] [[law (academic)|legal scholar]] and [[sociologist]] of law. He is widely regarded as one of the primary founders of the modern field of [[sociology of law]].

==Biography==
Ehrlich was born in Chernivtsi (now [[Chernivtsi]]) in the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], at that time a province of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Ehrlich studied law in Vienna, where he taught and practised as a lawyer before returning to Czernowitz to teach at the university there, a bastion of Germanic culture at the eastern edge of the Empire.

Ehrlich remained there for the rest of his teaching career and was Rector of the University in 1906–7. During the turmoil of World War I, when Czernowitz was occupied several times by Russian forces, he moved to Switzerland. After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the ceding of the Bukovina to Romania, Ehrlich planned to return to Czernowitz, where he would have been required to teach in Romanian, but he died of diabetes in Vienna, [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] in 1922.

Ehrlich's experience of the Bukovina's legal culture, where [[Austrian law]] and sharply contrasting local custom seemed to co-exist, caused him to question the hierarchical notions of law propounded by such theorists as [[Hans Kelsen]]. Ehrlich noted that legal theories that recognized law only as a sum of statutes and court decisions gave an inadequate view of the legal reality of a community. He drew a distinction between norms for decision and social norms or norms of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, E. ([1913] 2001). ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law.'' Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter actually govern the life of a society and, under certain conditions, can justifiably be regarded in popular consciousness, if not necessarily by lawyers, as law. For example, commercial usage and custom may develop and be recognized and respected by courts of law and other agencies as having normative force and legal significance.

Ehrlich claimed that the "living law" that regulates social life may be very different from the norms for decision applied by courts, and may sometimes attract far greater cultural authority which lawyers cannot safely ignore. Norms for decision regulate only those disputes that are brought before a judicial or other tribunal. Living law is a framework for the routine structuring of social relationships. Its source is in the many different kinds of social associations in which people co-exist. Its essence is not dispute and litigation, but peace and co-operation. What counts as law depends on what kind of authority exists to give it legal significance among those it is supposed to regulate.

Ehrlich's teaching is that the sources of law's authority are plural and insofar as some of those sources are political and others cultural they may conflict. But not all the norms of social associations should be thought of as 'law', in Ehrlich's view. Legal norms (understood sociologically, rather than juristically) are typically distinguished from merely moral or customary ones by powerful feelings of revulsion which typically attach to breach of them. They are, thus, regarded as socially fundamental. In addition, legal norms concern certain kinds of relationships, transactions and circumstances which he described as 'facts of the law'—specially important topics or considerations for social regulation.

Feminist Digital Humanities emphasizes the role of women, feminists, and cyberfeminists in technology, overturning ideas such as “Men invented the Internet”, as written in a June 2012 New York Times article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/technology/lawsuit-against-kleiner-perkins-is-shaking-silicon-valley.html|title=Lawsuit Shakes Foundation of a Man's World of Tech|date=3 June 2012|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Media Theorist [[Lisa Nakamura]] notes that "[as] women of color acquire an increasing presence online, their particular interests which spring directly from gender and racial identifications, that is to say, those identities associated with a physical body off-line, are being addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. “Cybertyping and the Work of Race in the Age of Digital Reproduction.” New Media, Old Media. Eds. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Thomas Keenan. Routledge: New York, 2006.p321&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Science, technology and society|Science and Technology Studies]] professor [[Donna Haraway]] has also pioneered specifically feminist approaches to the study of digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Wajcman, Judy. “Addressing Technological Change: The Challenge to Social Theory.” Society, Ethics and Technology. Eds. Morton E. Winston and Ralph D. Edelbach. Cengage Learning: 2011. Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

This intervention is notably crystallized in the work of [[FemTechNet]], "an activated network of scholars, artists, and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women’s, Queer, and Ethnic Studies".&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/directories/&lt;/ref&gt; FemTechNet has collaborated on a number of projects that reflect the aims of Feminist Digital Humanities, including Wikistorming, DOCC: Distributed Open Collaborative Course, and video dialogues. Their methods emphasize distribution through networks to connect diverse institutions, nations, and fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/docc2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors of Digital Humanities, Bethany Nowviskie and Miriam Posner have blogged about the structures in place that have kept women from engaging in digital humanities. There have been efforts to increase the racial representations within the field as well. These feminist digital humanities projects include #transformDH, That Camp Theory, [[Critical code studies|Critical Code Studies]], and [[Crunk Feminist Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Bailey| first= Moya Z.|title=All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave| journal=Journal of Digital Humanities| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Girls Code]] is a project that has recently garnered attention, with founder [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]] receiving a Standing O-vation presented by Toyota and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Shumaker | first=Laura|title= "Oprah gives San Francisco’s Kimberly Bryant a Standing O-vation"| journal=SFGate| year=2014|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2014/11/17/oprah-gives-san-franciscos-kimberly-bryant-a-standing-o-vation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archiving==
One goal of feminist literary scholars has been to increase the scope of women's literary works in visible archives. [http://orlando.cambridge.org/ The Orlando Project] and [[Women Writers Project|The Women Writers Project]] are two early projects that undertook the task of filling in the gaps that existed in literary history in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities"&gt;{{cite article|last=Wernimont | first=Jacqueline |title=Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives | journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly | publisher=The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations |year=2013 |url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000156/000156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both efforts sought to use the electronic format "to overcome the problems of inaccessibility and scarcity which had rendered women’s writing invisible for so long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwp.brown.edu/about/history/|title=WWP has moved|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;
One critique of a content-oriented approach to combating the marginalization of women's literary works is that it's simply not enough to add content to a system that is built upon a patriarchal methodology. "Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification, and access."&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;

==Purpose==

Learning goals of Filipinology include the comprehension, appreciation, and critical evaluation of the Philippines through [[Philippine History]], contemporary issues in Philippine community, and '''Philippine Humanities''' such as Filipino philosophy, [[Music of the Philippines|Filipino music]], [[Arts of the Philippines|Filipino art]], [[Philippine literature]], and [[Philippine dance]].&lt;ref name=CCSF3/&gt;  The incorporation of Philippine Humanities through literary readings, listening to musical recordings, film viewings, and field trips provide development of cultural acceptance and aesthetic sense.&lt;ref name=CCSF3&gt;[http://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Philippine_Studies/coursesphil.html#IDST 42.

==Filipinologists==
Experts on Filipinology are called '''filipinologists''' (Spanish: "Filipinologista") (Filipino: ''Pilipinolohista''; literally “experts in Filipino culture”).  According to Rosa M. Vallejo the "foremost" non-Filipino filipinologist is the [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[bibliographer]] [[Wenceslao Emilio Retana y Gamboa]].&lt;ref name=NCCA&gt;Vallejo, Rosa M.

Among the prominent Russian filipinologists are [[Vladimir Makarenko]] and Podberezsky.

==Publications==
Publications dealing with Filipinology seek to reach specialist and non-specialist audience from and outside the Philippines.  Among such Philippine Studies literature is the quarterly journal ''[[Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints]]'' published by the [[Ateneo de Manila University]].  Founded in 1953, the journal serves as a “forum” for disseminating many aspects of life in the Philippines through research in history, humanities and social sciences, “friendly and constructive debate”, and the expression of scholarly views.&lt;ref name=Philjol&gt;[http://www.philjol.info/index.php/PS Philippine Studies], PhilJOL, philjol.info&lt;/ref&gt;  Another publication is the book written by Remigio E. Agpalo entitled ''Adventures in Political Science''.  With an introduction written by Zeus A. Salazar, Agpalo’s book is a “major contribution” to Filipinology that covers important areas of [[political science]] in the Philippines, including political dynamics, comparative government, comparative politics, Philippine government, Philippine politics, political philosophy, political theory, political methodology, constitutional law, modernization and political development.&lt;ref name=BN&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Adventures-in-Political-Science/Remigio-E-Agpalo/e/9789715420181 ''Adventures in Political Science''], barnesandnoble.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiography of India refers to the studies, sources, critical methods and interpretations used by scholars to develop a history of India.

==Ancient India==

According to D. P. Singhal, Indians in ancient times did not neglect the discipline of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, Kishori Saran. The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India. Aditya Prakashan. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval India==
{{section-stub|date=September 2018}}
According to Peter Hardy, [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historiography]] on medieval India is often motivated by Islamic apologetics, which tries to justify "the life of medieval Muslims to the modern world".&lt;ref&gt; A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000 By E.

According to [[James Mill]]'s influential 'The History of British India' (1817), a scholarship of proper historiography was never developed in Ancient India.&lt;ref&gt; Weickgenannt, T. N. (2009). Salman Rushdie and Indian historiography: Writing the nation into being. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was widely accepted and created a sense of 'tabula rasa'.&lt;ref&gt; Weickgenannt, T. N. (2009). Salman Rushdie and Indian historiography: Writing the nation into being. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian nationalists like [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] (1838–1894) advocated the writing of a ‘truly Indian historiography of India’.&lt;ref&gt; Weickgenannt, T.

In post-Indepence [[India]], a historiography based on a Marxist interpretation of history was very influential.&lt;ref&gt; E. Sreedharan, [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Textbook_of_Historiography_500_B_C_to.html?id=jJVoi3PIejwC  A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The historians belonging to the Marxist Phase adopted a materialistic interpretation of history and focused on the study of the effects of social and economic factors on history.&lt;ref&gt; E. Sreedharan, [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Textbook_of_Historiography_500_B_C_to.html?id=jJVoi3PIejwC  A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000] (2004) p 469, 486-7&lt;/ref&gt; In India, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One debate in Indian history that relates to a [[historical materialist]] schema is on the nature of [[feudalism]] in India. [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1960s outlined the idea of "feudalism from below" and "feudalism from above", with which R. S. Sharma largely agrees.&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation'', Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177-85&lt;/ref&gt; Such Marxist historians argue that the economic origins of [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a "world capitalist system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit women in India: issues and perspective|page=138|first=Prahlad|last=Jogdand|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. R. Ambedkar]] criticised Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of [[caste]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7ffDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|title=Development-Induced Displacement in India and China: A Comparative Look at the Burdens of Growth|last=Padovani|first=Florence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|quote=Bhimrao Ambedkar himself, who criticized Indian Marxists|isbn=9781498529044|date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of [[history of India]].{{How|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India|quote=Marxists who always try to cover up the black spots of Muslim rule with thick coats of whitewash|first=Kishori Saran|last=Lal|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Politics, Then and Now: Essays in Historical Perspective|first=K|last=Seshadri|publisher=Pragatee Prakashan|page=5|quote=certain attempts made by some ultra-Marxist historians to justify and even whitewash tyrannical emperors of the medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in World Affairs, Volume 1|first=KR|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publisher|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw9uf7sRKtIC&amp;pg=PA249|isbn=9788126904952|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11Th-13th Centuries|last=Wink|first=André|publisher=BRILL|page=309|quote="apologists for Islam, as well as some marxist scholars in India have sometimes attempted to reduce Islamic iconoclasm.."}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critique is [[Arun Shourie]]'s ''[[Eminent Historians]]'' (1998), which does not identify any scholarly shortcomings but only minor inefficiencies and bureaucratic corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/books/story/19981207-book-review-of-eminent-historians-by-arun-shourie-827468-1998-12-07 |title=Book review: Arun Shourie's 'Eminent Historians' |website=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, E. E. (2014). Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Cary, USA: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] scholars especially have polemicised against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible by the Indian [[right-wing]] for aiding or defending [[Islam in India|Muslims]], who are considered as 'enemies within'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0RZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=|title=The Construction of History and Nationalism in India: Textbooks, Controversies and Politics|last=Guichard|first=Sylvie|year=2010|isbn=9781136949319}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'internal threats'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.thehinducentre.com/multimedia/archive/02486/Bunch_of_Thoughts_2486072a.pdf |last=Golwalkar |first=Madhav |year=1966 |title=Bunch of Thoughts}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hindutva]] ideologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhishikar |year=1991 |title= Concept of Rashtra: Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay: Ideology and Perception |location=New Delhi |publisher=Suruchi Prakashan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades of the twentieth century, the [[Subaltern Studies|subaltern historiography]] was developed. By highlighting the struggles of the workers and the peasants, this historiography has challenged not only conventional historiography but even Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt; E.

'''Iguaçu National Park''' ({{IPA-pt|iɡwaˈsu}}) is a [[National park (Brazil)|national park]] in [[Paraná State]], [[Brazil]]. It comprises a total area of {{Convert|185,262.5|ha|acre}} and a length of about {{Convert|420|km|mi}}, {{Convert|300|km|mi}} of which are natural borders by bodies of water and the Argentine and Brazilian sides together comprise around {{Convert|260,000|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/meio-ambiente/2014/07/parque-nacional-do-iguacu-sitio-do-patrimonio-mundial-natural|title=Parque Nacional do Iguaçu é sítio do Patrimônio Mundial Natural|last=Brasil|first=Portal|website=Portal Brasil|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iguaçu National Park was created by federal decree nr. 1035 of January 10, 1939, and became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1986. The park is managed by [[Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation]] (ICMBio).&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

The park shares with [[Iguazú National Park]] in [[Argentina]] one of the [[world]]'s largest waterfalls, extending over some {{Convert|2,700|m|ft}}. It is home to many rare and [[endangered species]] of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], among them the [[giant otter]] and the [[giant anteater]]. The clouds of spray produced by the waterfall are conducive to the growth of lush vegetation.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Entrada do Parque Nacional do Iguaçu.jpg|thumb|left|Iguaçu National Park Gateway]]
The Iguaçu National Park owes its name to the fact it includes an important area of the [[Iguazu River]] (Portuguese: Rio Iguaçu). Approximately {{convert|50|km2|mi2}} of the length of the river makes up the Iguaçu Falls.

It is the most important park of the Prata Basin and, since it is a haven to a significant genetic asset of [[animal]] and vegetal [[species]], it was the first park in Brazil to receive a Management Plan. As foreseen by Rebouças, the park's basic goal is the preservation of the highly relevant ecologically and scenic natural ecosystems, thus enabling scientific research and the development of environmental education and interpretation activities, recreation in natural surroundings and the ecological tourism.

The Iguaçu National Park is spectacular as well as pioneering. The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to "future generations", just as "it had been created by God" and endowed with "all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome" and "an unmatched flora" located in the "magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls". These were the words used by [[André Rebouças]], an engineer, in his book "Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia", which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls way back in 1876, when [[Yellowstone National Park]], the first national park on the planet, was four years old.

On November 17, 1986, during the [[UNESCO]] conference held in [[Paris]], the Iguaçu National Park was listed as Natural Heritage of Humanity and is one of the largest forest preservation areas in South America.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Parque Nacional do Iguaçú - Iguaçu National Park - Bilheterias - Ticket toll (13932942577).jpg|thumb|[[Box office|Ticket Office]]]]
In Brazil the Park has boundaries with the following municipalities: Foz do Iguaçu, Medianeira, Matelândia, Céu Azul, São Miguel do Iguaçu, Santa Terezinha de Itaipu, Santa Tereza do Oeste, Capitão Leônidas Marque, Capanema and Serranópolis.

The Park is located in the westernmost region of the state of Paraná, in the Iguaçú river basin, {{convert|17|km|mile|abbr=on}} from downtown Foz do Iguaçú. It borders Argentina, where the Iguazu National Park, which was implemented in 1934, is located. The border between the two countries and their national parks is made by the Iguaçú river, whose source is near the Serra (mountain range) do Mar near Curitiba and runs for {{convert|18|km|mile|abbr=on}} throughout the state of Paraná. The river estuary is located 18&amp;nbsp;km downriver from the Falls, where it flows into the Paraná river. This meeting of rivers forms the triple Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay border.

Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the [[Paraná River]] basin.
They were the [[Morro do Diabo State Park]], [[Rio do Peixe State Park]], [[Aguapeí State Park]], [[Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station]], [[Ivinhema State Park]], [[Ilha Grande National Park]], [[Caiuá Ecological Station]] and Iguaçu National Park.{{sfn|PES do Aguapeí – ISA |loc=Historico Juridico}} The [[Santa Maria Ecological Corridor]] connects the Iguaçu National Park with the protected margins of [[Itaipu Dam|Lake Itaipu]], and via these margins with the [[Ilha Grande National Park]].{{sfn|Teixeira|2016|p=3}}
The park would be part of the proposed [[Trinational Biodiversity Corridor]], which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.{{sfn|Araújo Corte|Valladares-Pádua|2007|p=23}}
{{wide image|Iguazu Décembre 2007 - Panorama 7.jpg|1200px|&lt;center&gt;The Garganta do Diabo Walkway allow panoramic view of the falls from the Brazilian side.&lt;/center&gt;}}

==Tourism==
[[File:Iguaçu National Park - Puma.jpg|thumb|A [[South American cougar]] caught on [[camera]]]]

The area of the park open for visitation and where the concession areas of Cataratas do Iguaçú S/A are located, accounts for approximately 0.3% of the total area of the park.

The most spectacular sightseeing of the park is the Iguaçú Falls, which form a 2,700m wide semicircle, while the water falls from a height of {{convert|72|m|ft}}. The number of waterfalls ranges from 150 and 300 depending on the Iguaçú river flow. Besides the exuberant waterfalls, there are other attractions such as rich fauna, the Poço Preto (the Black Well), the Macuco Waterfall, the Visitors Center, the Santos Dumont Statue, a homage paid by VASP (a defunct airline company) to the "Father of Aviation", who lent all his prestige and efforts in turning the falls area into a National Park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The park received 1,550,700 visitors (2014)

[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|300px|Habermas during a discussion in the [[Munich University of Philosophy|Munich School of Philosophy]] 2008]]

The works of the German [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher]] '''[[Jürgen Habermas]]''' (born June 18, 1929) includes books, papers, contributions to journals, periodicals, newspapers, lectures given at conferences and seminars, reviews of works by other authors, and dialogues and speeches given in various occasions. Working in the tradition of [[critical theory]] and [[pragmatism]]. Habermas is perhaps best known for his theory on the concepts of '[[communicative rationality]]' and the '[[public sphere]]'. His work focuses on the foundations of [[social theory]] and [[epistemology]], the analysis of [[advanced capitalistic societies]] and [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] in a critical [[Sociocultural evolution|social-evolutionary context]], and contemporary politics—particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, [[political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests.

This list is primarily based on ''Mapping Habermas from German to English: A Bibliography of Primary Literature 1952-1995'' edited by Demetrios Douramanis, ''Jürgen Habermas: A Bibliography'' by René Görtzen, and  Luca Corchia's ''Jürgen Habermas. A Bibliography: Works and Studies (1952-2013)'', a bibliography based on direct consultation of the original editions and their translations, with their internal references; as well as research carried out by other scholars.{{sfn|Corchia|2013|pp=17-25}}

The catalog of Habermas production includes books, collections, interviews, prefaces to later editions of his own books, papers, contributions to journals, periodicals, newspapers, lectures given at conferences and seminars, reviews of works by other authors, dialogues and speeches given in various occasions.

Furthermore, Habermas' publications are often collections of writings which have been taken and reordered chronologically in this bibliography. The chronology is determined by the publication dates of Habermas's German language books. Articles that do not appear in these books are included as works in their own right. Insofar as most of the writings collected in Habermas's books find their origin in journals, newspapers, edited books and magazines, or were delivered as lectures or discussion and occasional papers, information on their origin is given in the footnotes.

'''Kevin Owen Starr''' (September 3, 1940 – January 14, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] and California's State Librarian, best known for his multi-volume series on the [[history of California]], collectively called "Americans and the California Dream."

After an impoverished childhood, he received degrees from various universities where he studied history and literature. Beginning in 1973, Starr wrote nine books on the history of California during his career, along with being professor or visiting lecturer at numerous California universities.

From 1994 to 2004 Starr was California's State Librarian. He continued writing California history throughout his career, receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship, membership in the Society of American Historians, and the Gold Medal of the Commonwealth Club of California. In 2006 he was presented a National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush for his work as a scholar and historian, and in 2010 was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Kevin Starr was born on Sept. 3, 1940, in [[San Francisco]], to Owen Starr, a machinist, and Marian Starr (née Collins) a bank teller. He was a seventh generation Californian.&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt;

Starr's parents divorced when he was a child. When he was six his mother had a nervous breakdown, after which Starr and his younger brother, James, were placed in a Roman Catholic orphanage in [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]]. Five years later, he and his brother were reunited with their mother, where they lived in a public housing project in San Francisco, while they subsisted on welfare. He attended [[San Francisco County Parishes#Deanery Four|St. Boniface School]] in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; 

He later enrolled in the [[University of San Francisco]], a Jesuit institution, where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English in 1962. At the school, he was editor of ''The Foghorn,'' the school newspaper.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/kevin-starr-dead-california.html "Kevin Starr, Prolific Chronicler of California’s History, Dies at 76"], ''New York Times'', Jan. 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation he served for two years as a lieutenant in a tank battalion in Germany (the 68th Armored Brigade of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], in what was then [[West Germany]]). Upon release from the service Starr entered [[Harvard University]], earning an MA degree in 1965, a PhD in American Literature in 1969.  He subsequently launched his teaching career at Harvard as Assistant (and later Associate) Professor of American Literature from 1969 to 1973, and soon thereafter re-established his life in California.&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.ca.gov/about/starr/starrcv.html | title= Biographical Sketch:Kevin Starr  State Librarian Emeritus |work= California State Library web site |year= 2007 |accessdate= May 26, 2010 }} ([http://www.library.ca.gov/about/docs/StarrCV.pdf Full CV] in [[PDF]] format from October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After returning to California in 1973, he became an aide and speechwriter to Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He was also appointed city librarian, during which time he earned a master's degree in library science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1974.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He also did post-doctoral work at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;

Beginning in 1973, Starr wrote nine books on the history of California, six of which are part of his Americans and the California Dream series. It was at Harvard that he first became inspired to write about California's history, after browsing through their collection of books about California and the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He explained the impact those books had on him:
{{quote|All of a sudden I saw all these California books: diaries, memoirs, journals, histories, bibliographies. And a kind of enchantment overtook me, a kind of beguilement, a kind of reverie, definitely a physical reaction in the days that followed. As I look back on it psychologically, I see that I’d made an absolutely powerful connection between California and my interior landscape.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;}}

From 1974 to 1989 he was professor or visiting lecturer at numerous California universities, including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[ University of Southern California]],&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt; [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]], [[Santa Clara University]], the University of San Francisco, and [[Stanford University]]. He was also a columnist for the [[San Francisco Examiner]].&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote=Kevin Starr chronicled the history of California as no one else. He captured the spirit of our state and brought to life the characters and personalities that made the California story. His vision, like California itself, was bigger than life.|source=Governor [[Jerry Brown]]&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;}}

In 1989 Starr became Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the [[University of Southern California]], and was promoted to University Professor of History in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kevin Owen Starr: University Professor and Professor of History |work= Faculty profiles |publisher=  [[University of Southern California]] |url= http://college.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003730 |accessdate= May 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starr sometimes taught at the USC State Capital Center in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= SPPD Affiliated Faculty |work= USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development web site |url= http://www.usc.edu/schools/sppd/faculty |accessdate= May 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starr was appointed by [[Governor Pete Wilson]] to serve as California's State Librarian, a post he managed from 1994 to  2004, at which time [[Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] named him State Librarian [[Emeritus]].&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; Starr oversaw the allocation of $350 million in local library construction money after voters approved a statewide library borrowing measure in 2000.&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt; As a child, Starr had to read the newspaper to his visually impaired father, an experience which led him to create a statewide service that allowed visually impaired people to call a phone number to connect with someone who would read the news to them.&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt;

California State Librarian Greg Lucas calls Starr "truly, one of a kind. No other historian has been able to capture California’s exceptionalism, its vitality and its promise in such detail and yet invest it with the immediacy and excitement of a page-turner novel."&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt; Starr's library assistant, Mattie Taormina, notes that "Starr made you excited to be a Californian because you were going to create the future California."&lt;ref name=SacBee/&gt;

Starr is the author of the ongoing multi-volume history of California collectively entitled "Americans and the California Dream". The first volume in the series, ''Americans and the California Dream, 1850–1915'' was published in 1973. His most recent volume, which covers the period from 1950 to 1963, entitled "Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance" won the 2009 [[Los Angeles Times]] [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize|Book Prize]] for history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Los Angeles Times Book Prize Finalists |date= April 2010 |publisher=  [[Los Angeles Times]] |url= http://events.latimes.com/bookprizes/previous-winners/year-2009 |accessdate= May 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
His writing has won him a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], membership in the Society of American Historians, and the Gold Medal of the [[Commonwealth Club of California]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 2006, Starr was made a member of the College of Fellows of the [[Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. In 2006 he was presented a [[National Humanities Medal]] from President [[George W. Bush]] for his work as a scholar and historian.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners of the National Humanities Medal and the Charles Frankel Prize |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |url=https://www.neh.gov/search/content/Kevin%20Starr |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2010, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Maria Shriver]] inducted Starr into the [[California Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=SacBee&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article126755054.html "Kevin Starr, California’s premier historian, dead at 76"], ''The Sacramento Bee'', Jan. 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]] was inspired by the "Dream" series of books to write the piece ''[[City Noir]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= John Adams |url= http://earbox.com/W-citynoir.html |work= Adams' web site |title= City Noir |year= 2009 |accessdate= May 26, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100126053907/http://www.earbox.com/W-citynoir.html |archivedate= January 26, 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr received The Robert Kirsch Award by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as part of the 2012 [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-los-angeles-times-book-prize-winners-20130419,0,6759894.story |title=Announcing the 2012 Los Angeles Times Book Prize winners |work=[[LA Times]] |author=[[Staff writer]] |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lutte Pour Le Changement (LUCHA{{pronunciation needed}})''' is a group based in [[Goma]] in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] who fights for a class of [[rights]] that protect Congoleses' [[political freedom|freedom]] from infringement by [[government]]s, [[social organization]]s, and private individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the Congolese society and [[State (polity)|state]] without [[discrimination]] or [[Political repression|repression]].

==Background==
This group was born out of frustration with the current political process and diminished social condition in the Democratic Republic of Congo by a group of young Congolese students. These students understood that violence is not the way for anyone willing to find durable solutions to political and social disputes and wars that have torn their country apart for the past half century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enough|first1=Project|title=Roots of the Crisis - Congo|url=http://www.enoughproject.org/conflict_areas/eastern_congo/roots-crisis|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one thing that defines the Lutte Pour Le Changement activists is their love for their native DR Congo and the hope to see it prosperous and developed in their lifetime. They have decided to organize a series of non-violent actions throughout major cities in the country to shed light to some of the critical issues facing the Congolese population. Their actions are not limited to keeping politicians honest, but rather engaging the population into participating in the social issues debates. The movement started in the eastern city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Mid-June 2011 and in no time, the movement had spread all the way to the west of the country, with famous members such as '''Fred Bauma'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LUCHA|first1=Website|title=QUI EST FRED BAUMA?|url=http://www.luchacongo.org/nos-actions/freefred/qui-est-fred/|accessdate=29 December 2016|agency=La LUCHA|date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Yves Makwambala''' being incarcerated since March 2015 at the Congolese National Intelligence Agency headquarters in [[Kinshasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amnesty|first1=International|title=DRC: Release of pro-democracy activists cause for celebration|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/drc-release-of-pro-democracy-activists-cause-for-celebration/|accessdate=28 December 2016|agency=Amnesty International|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2015, according to the online news media Pragmora, "About 30 youth activists and international journalists and observers were arrested in Kinshasa during a youth workshop aimed at increasing youth participation in politics and the electoral process, and creating a new youth movement, Filimbi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PRAGMORA|first1=Planning The Peace|title=About LUCHA|url=http://pragmora.com/takeaction/drcongo/freefred/aboutlucha/|accessdate=28 December 2016|agency=PRAGMORA|date=18 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent uprising, many of the LUCHA activists arrested during Dec 19, 2016 have been released, including the 23 year old '''Gloria Sengha Panda Shala''' according to '''Ida Sawyer''' a Human Rights Watch [[Executive director|Director]] in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sawyer|first1=Ida|title=DR Congo Death Toll Rises, Mass Arrests After Protests|url=https://www.hrw.org/blog-feed/democratic-republic-congo-crisis|accessdate=29 December 2016|agency=Human Rights Watch|date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''LUCHA''' protest to receive widespread attention was the effort to get the young people to get involved in the 2011 presidential and legislatives elections by ensure that all eligible to vote got registered ahead of the upcoming the elections. Then followed a few actions in regards to lack of clean water in [[Goma]] and also issue with garbage waste in the same city. This movement got the eye of the Congolese people because this group managed first and foremost to get the general population to have a say in these critical matters facing their livelihood through the streets of various Congolese cities namely [[Kinshasa]], [[Mbuji-Mayi]], [[Lubumbashi]], [[Kisangani]] et [[Goma]].

==Goals==
The group is determined to ensure there is better [[governance]], respect for [[human rights]] and improved and much stronger [[democracy]] in the country that faced 32 years of President [[Mobutu]] Dictatorship. These inspired Congolese youths driven by [[social injustice]] and non democratic [[political process]] believe that their [[Political movement|movement]] can bring about positive change in the DR Congo, as well as [[Africa]] as a whole.

These courageous young men have come to know nothing but armed conflicts all of their teenage and adult lives.  Therefore, when deciding to create the movement they decided that they will only use non-violent actions as the core principal in raising awareness on social and political issues facing the DRC.  Nevertheless, most of these youths have been detained without charge during peaceful protest and /or gatherings.  Some of the famous members detained by the Congolese national intelligence agency and have made claims of moral and physical abuses while incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Human Rights|first1=Watch|title=DR Congo: Youth Activists Rounded Up at Strike|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/23/dr-congo-youth-activists-rounded-strike|accessdate=28 December 2016|agency=Human Rights Watch|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogan==
'''We are leaders. Not hostages of the past. Nor slaves of the present. Nor beggars of our future!'''

'''WE ARE NOT VIOLENT'''

'''WE RISK TOGETHER'''

'''WE ASSUME OUR ACTS'''

==Methods==
LUCHA activists have used web technologies and social media like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] to coordinate events. The digital evolution with the improvements on the application such as [[WhatsApp]], [[Imo (app)|Imo]] and [[Skype]] has helped the movement with [[communications]], [[conference calls]]  among participants in various locations within the [[DR Congo]] as well as the Congolese [[diaspora]] via various Congolese online media, such as Congo Mikili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yves|first1=Kabemba|title=Online News Media|url=http://congomikili.com/|website=Congo Mikili|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also been organizing workshops across the country to teach youth on how to engage in social and political issues.

A convention of sorting names with the Scottish and Irish [[patronymic]] prefixes '''Mac and Mc together''' persists in [[library science]] and archival practice.  An example is from the Archives at the Yale University [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/manuscript/process/iv.html#IV.D.3.d)  www.library.yale.edu, ''Processing Manual &gt; Chapter IV. Composing Folder Descriptions Mc IV.D.3.d)Mc and Mac, St. and Saint''.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also applied in areas such as [[voter registration]], where Mac and Mc names may be sorted together in a listing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/et/ete/ete04/onePage aceproject.org, ''Voter Registration Processing'']&lt;/ref&gt; Technically this is a convention in [[collation]].

On the other hand, [[ASCII]] is a computer standard and its corresponding sorting is gradually replacing this exception to ordinary [[alphabetisation]]. Rules once used for filing have been dropped for some newer computer systems, and the interfiling of Mac and Mc names is an example, according to a 2006 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carolyn E. Wolf|title=Basic Library Skills|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vb8DLHS9mMkC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=28 February 2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2635-5|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are in fact a number of options. In addition to sorting them under "Mac" and "Mc" respectively or choosing to sort them both under "Mc", it is known for Mc/Mac names to be placed in position before M.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091009091743/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/handbook/common/referencing-citing.htm ucl.ac.uk, ''UCL Institute of Archaeology, Coursework Guidelines, Rules for Referencing''.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mc file divider.jpg|thumb|Mc tab on a [[file card]] divider of British origin. Some traditional filing systems treated Mac/Mc names as if the prefix were a letter such as a putative "Mc" between M and N in the alphabet.]]

==History==
This topic has a complicated and disparate history, spread over different continents and relating to different areas of indexing, cataloguing and filing. The idea of a collating sequence itself has evolved, over time, and the "Mac and Mc" together example has been taken as representative of a possible paradigm.

===Obsolete filing rules===
A book on filing rules from 1918 gives an example showing Mc and M' treated as [[abbreviation]]s, i.e. for Mac, and ordered as if in the expanded version;&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Glen Barnstead, ''Filing Rules for Dictionary Catalogues'' (1918), [https://archive.org/stream/filingrulesfordi00barnuoft#page/4/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar book from 1922 makes the rule one of a number that apply also to St. (Saint) and Mrs. (Mistress).&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Public Library (Bertha Rickenbrode Barden), ''Filing Rules for the Arrangement of the Dictionary Catalogs of the Cleveland Public Library (1922), p. 9; [https://archive.org/stream/filingrulesfora00unkngoog#page/n12/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

===An older UK view on alphabetisation and standardisation===
A 1938 book that is a comparative study of cataloguing in various British libraries regarded Mac + Mc + M' sorting as an example of achieved "standardisation" in alphabetisation. It gave further examples where, it argued, such standardisation would be beneficial. One example was

:ä → ae

in the sense of alphabetising any word with ä as if the letter were replaced by "ae". Other examples given are the replacement of ''Sainte'' by "Saint" to accommodate the French adjective in its feminine form; or ''Archives'' in journal titles by "Archive". The example of the [[Fitz]] prefix, a [[Norman French]] patronymic, is applied by ignoring the following space, which may or may not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. 243–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical terms the author applies are "letter by letter" or "all through" for the case where spaces are ignored, and "word by word" or "nothing before something" for the case where [[space (punctuation)|space]] comes before A in the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In actual practice, some indexes, such as the British Union Catalogue of Periodicals, did practice such extensive standardisation. Sometimes by various technical devices such as replacing terms with conventional abbreviations that would be the same in all languages.

===A US library view (1942) for card sorting===
[[Donald Knuth]] in vol. 3 of his ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' gave a listing showing the operation of around 40 rules, of which "Mc = Mac" was one, for library card sorting.

'''Madhubani art''' (or '''Mithila painting''') is practiced in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, etc. using natural dyes and pigments, and is characterised by eye-catching geometrical patterns.{{cn|date=September 2018}} There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as [[Holi]], Surya Shasti, [[kali puja|Kali Puja]], [[Upanayana]], [[Durga Puja]].

== Origins==
Madhubani art or Mithila painting was traditionally created by the women of various communities in [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from [[Madhubani district]] of Mithila region of [[Bihar]], and, it is popularly called Mithila painting or Madhubani art. Madhubani is also a major export centre of these paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UvuJyvtsCjwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8kJ761p_SAhUrIsAKHb2ZDfYQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&amp;f=false|title=Madhubani Painting|date=30 September 2017|publisher=Abhinav Publications|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221110108/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UvuJyvtsCjwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8kJ761p_SAhUrIsAKHb2ZDfYQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&amp;f=false|archivedate=21 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments led to the name ''Madhubani art'' being used alongside the name "Mithila Painting."&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, "Documenting the Image in Mithila Art," Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and [[canvas]].&lt;ref name=krupa&gt;{{cite news|last=Krupa|first=Lakshmi|title=Madhubani walls|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/madhubani-walls/article4272411.ece|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129100902/http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/madhubani-walls/article4272411.ece|archivedate=29 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. And that is the reason for Madhubani painting being accorded the coveted GI ([[Geographical Indication]]) status. Madhubani paintings also use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. [[Ochre]] and [[lampblack]] are also used for reddish brown and black respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Madhubani paintings mostly depict the men &amp; its association with nature and the scenes &amp; deity from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like [[tulsi]] are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/madhubani.php|title=Know India: Madhubani Painting|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=2013-09-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907150703/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/madhubani.php|archivedate=7 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is still practiced and kept alive in the institutions spread across Mithila region.

== Styles ==
Madhubani art has five distinctive styles, namely, Bharni, Katchni, Tantrik, Godna and Kohbar. In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik style were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses, flora and fauna in their paintings. People of lower castes include aspects of their daily life and symbols, story of Raja Shailesh [ guard of village]  and much more, in their paintings. But nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form so there is no difference in the work of artists of the region on the basis of the caste system. They are working in all five styles. Madhubani art has received worldwide attention.&lt;ref name="a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulyabihar.com/a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/ |title=a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists and awards ==

In 1975, President of India gave the [[Padma Shri]] award to Jagdamba Devi, and the National Award to Sita Devi of Jitwarpur village near Madhubani.&lt;ref name="Padma Shri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Shri |publisher=Padma Shri |date=2015 |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sita Devi received the Padma Shri in 1981.

'''Massimo Pallottino''' (9 November 1909 in [[Rome]] – 7 February 1995 in Rome) was an Italian [[archaeologist]] specializing in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilization and art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/massimo-pallottino/ Pallottino, Massimo Enciclopedie on line&lt;/ref&gt;

Pallottino was a student of [[Giulio Giglioli|Giulio Quirino Giglioli]] and worked early in his career on the Temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Veii]].  In essence Pallottino created the modern discipline of Etruscology and trained many of its leading practitioners.  He published a massive corpus of material during his career and established a research center in Rome, today known as ''C.N.R. per l'Archeologia etrusco-italica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://studietruschi.org/istituto |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109215559/http://studietruschi.org/istituto |archivedate=2014-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also influential in establishing the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Etruschi e Italici and its journal, ''Studi Etruschi''.  His own work covered Etruscan art and culture, civilization, and language.  One of his most influential works was the handbook ''Etruscologia'' originally published in 1942 in Milan, but today available in numerous languages and still consulted by scholars and students alike.  Pallottino was a member of the faculty of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|Università di Roma, "La Sapienza"]].

In 1937, Pallottino wrote an article debunking the so-called "Etruscan Warrior" purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (by John Marshall under the direction of [[Gisela Richter|Gisela M. A. Richter]]), as a [[forgery]].  Richter remained unconvinced, but Pallottino was ultimately proven correct by the scholar Harold Parsons in 1961. Pallottino pointed out the Greek Hellenized world that Etruscan art emerged from. He wrote the volume on ''Etruscan Painting'' (1952) for Albert Skira's series on Great Centuries of Painting. In 1971 his ''Civiltà artistica etrusco-italica'' summarized the previous two generations of  work in Italian archaeology.&lt;ref name="Pallottino1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Massimo Pallottino|title=Civiltà artistica etrusco-italica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kxNAAAAYAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Sansoni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the [[Balzan Prize]] in 1982 for Sciences of Antiquity "For his research work and discoveries of outstanding importance carried out in the field of the sciences of antiquity through the excavation of Pyrgi, his contribution to the interpretation of the Etruscan language and his revealing research on the origins of ancient Rome and the peoples of pre-Roman Italy" (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). This included the momentous discovery of the [[Pyrgi Tablets|Pyrgi plaques]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/obituaries/massimo-pallottino-85-expert-on-ancient-etruscans-is-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Pallottino's memory and career were honored with the publication of a two-volume set, ''Etrusca et Italica: Scritti in ricordo di Massimo Pallottino''.&lt;ref name="etrusco-italica1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Istituto per l'archeologia etrusco-italica|title=Etrusca et Italica: scritti in ricordo di Massimo Pallottino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcrpAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Istituti editoriali e poligrafici internazionali|isbn=978-88-8147-025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his students was [[Giovanni Colonna (archaeologist)|Giovanni Colonna]], one of the leading figures in current Etruscology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18350">'''Mukhannathun''' ({{lang|ar|مخنثون}} "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular ''mukhannath'') was a term used in Classical Arabic to refer to men who were perceived as effeminate. ''Mukhannathun'', especially those in the city of [[Medina]], are mentioned throughout the [[hadith|ahadith]] and in the works of many early Arabic and Islamic writers. During the [[Rashidun caliphate|Rashidun era]] and first half of the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era, they were strongly associated with music and entertainment.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowson|first=Everett K.|date=October 1991|title=The Effeminates of Early Medina|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/The_effeminates_of_early_medina.pdf|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|location=|publisher=American Oriental Society|volume=111|issue=4|pages=671–693|doi=10.2307/603399|jstor=603399|id=|authorlink=|author2=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Abbasid caliphate]], the word itself was used as a descriptor for men employed as dancers, musicians, or comedians.&lt;ref name="EoAL" /&gt;

In later eras, the term ''mukhannath'' was associated with the receptive partner in [[gay sexual practices]], an association that has persisted into the modern day. [[Khanith]] is a vernacular Arabic term used in some parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to denote the gender role ascribed to males who function sexually, and in some ways socially, as women. The term is closely related to the word ''mukhannath''.

==Etymology==

The origins of the term are disputed. The 8th century lexicographer [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] connected ''mukhannath'' to ''khuntha'', meaning [[Intersex|hermaphrodite]]. Based on this etymology, he stated that the word ''mukhannath'' refers to an intersex person. According to the 9th century Arabic scholar Abu Ubayd, the term ''mukhannath'' instead derives from the verb ''khanatha'', meaning "to fold back the mouth of a waterskin for drinking", indicating some measure of being languid or delicate. This definition attained prominence among Islamic scholars until medieval times, when the term came to be associated with homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Islamic shari'a law p91-103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alipour|first=M|date=2016|title=Islamic shari'a law, neotraditionalist Muslim scholars and transgender sex-reassignment surgery: A case study of Ayatollah Khomeini's and Sheikh al-Tantawi's fatwas|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15532739.2016.1250239|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|volume=17:1|pages=91-103|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mentions in the ahadith==

''Mukhannathun'' existed in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic eras.&lt;ref name="EoAL"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, Volume 2|author=S. Moreh|authorlink=Shmuel Moreh|editor=Julie Scott Meisami, Paul Starkey|page=548|chapter=mukhannathun|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415185721}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[ahadith]] indicate that ''mukhannathun'' were used as male servants for wealthy women in the early days of Islam, due to the belief that they were not sexually interested in the female body. These sources do not state that the ''mukhannathun'' were homosexual, only that they "lack desire". 

Various ahadith say Muhammad cursed the ''mukhannathun'' and their female equivalents, ''mutarajjilat'', and ordered his followers to remove them from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/158 |publisher=Sunnah.com |access-date=2018-08-24 | title= Sunan Abi Dawud » Book of General Behavior (Kitab Al-Adab) » (61) Chapter: The ruling regarding hermaphrodites}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The Prophet (May peace be upon him) cursed effeminate men (mukhannathan) and women who imitated men, saying: Put them out of your houses, and put so-and-so out.

According to one hadith, this incident was prompted by a ''mukhannath'' servant of Muhammad’s wife [[Umm Salama]] commenting upon the body of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/64/354 |publisher=Sunnah.com |access-date=2018-08-24 | title= Sahih al-Bukhari » Book of Military Expeditions led by the Prophet » (56) Chapter: The Ghazwa of At-Taif}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment may have convinced Muhammad that the ''mukhannathun'' were only pretending to have no interest in women, and therefore could not be trusted around them.&lt;ref name="Irregularity"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender and difference in the Middle Ages|chapter=Gender Irregularity as Entertainment|last1=Rowson|first1=Everett K.|page=56-57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story places the incident around the time of the [[Siege of Ta'if]].

Early Islamic literature rarely comments upon the habits of the ''mukhannathun''. It seems there may have been some variance in how "effeminate" they were, though there are indications that some adopted aspects of feminine dress or at least ornamentation. One hadith states that a Muslim ''mukhannath'' who had dyed his hands and feet with [[henna]] (traditionally a feminine activity) was banished from Medina, but not killed for his behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud » Book of General Behavior (Kitab Al-Adab) » (61) Chapter: The ruling regarding hermaphrodites|url=https://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/156|publisher=Sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:An effeminate man (mukhannath) who had dyed his hands and feet with henna was brought to the Prophet. He asked: What is the matter with this man? He was told: "Messenger of Allah! He imitates the look of women." So he issued an order regarding him and he was banished to an-Naqi'. The people said: Messenger of Allah! Should we not kill him? He said: I have been prohibited from killing people who pray. 

Other ahadith also mention the punishment of banishment, both in connection with Umm Salama’s servant and a man who worked as a musician. Muhammad described the musician as a ''mukhannath'' and threatened to banish him if he did not end his unacceptable career.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

Beyond these incidents, there are few sources elaborating upon the ''mukhannathun'' during Muhammad’s lifetime.

==In later eras==
In the Rashidun and Umayyad eras, various ''mukhannathun'' of Medina established themselves as celebrated musicians. One particularly prominent ''mukhannath'' with the [[Arabic name|''laqab'']] Tuways ("little peacock") was born in Medina on the day Muhammad died.

There are few sources that describe why Tuways was labeled a ''mukhannath'', or what behavior of his was considered effeminate. No sources describe his sexuality as immoral or imply that he was attracted to men, and he is reported to have married a woman and fathered several children in his later life.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt; While he is described as non-religious or even frivolous towards religion in many sources, others contradict this and portray him as a believing Muslim instead. His main association with the label seems to come from his profession, as music was mainly performed by women in Arab societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction|editor=Elizabeth May, Mantle Hood|last1=Pacholczyk|first1=Jozef|chapter=Secular Classical Music in the Arabic Near East|page=253|publisher=UC Press|year=1983|isbn=9780520047785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia: Literature, arts, and learning|last1=Tierney|first1=Helen|year=1989|publisher=Greenwood|quote=In pre-Islamic Arabia, music was practiced mainly by women, especially by singing girls (qainat)|isbn=9780313310737|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuways is described as the first ''mukhannath'' to perform "perfect singing" characterized by definitive rhythmic patterns in Medina. He was also known for his sharp wit and his skill with the [[tambourine]], which had previously been associated only with female musicians.&lt;ref name="Touma"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Music of the Arabs|last1=Touma|first1=Habib|authorlink=Habib Hassan Touma|year=1975|page=8, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars believe that Tuways and other ''mukhannathun'' musicians formed an intermediary stage in the social class most associated with musical performance: women in pre-Islamic times, ''mukhannathun'' in the Rashidun and early Umayyad caliphates, and mainly non-''mukhannath'' men in later time periods.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt; While many still disapproved of the ''mukhannathun'' in general in this era, the musicians among them were nonetheless valued and prized for their skill. Some of the more well-known ''mukhannathun'' also served as go-betweens and matchmakers for men and women.&lt;ref name="Roughgarden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution’s Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People|last1=Roughgarden |first1=Joan|page=363-364|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Tuways is typically described as the leading ''mukhannath'' musician of Medina during his lifetime, historical sources describe others who served a similar role providing musical and poetic entertainment. A man with the ''laqab'' al-Dalal ("the coquettish") is mentioned as one of Tuways’ pupils. He is portrayed as a witty but sometimes crude man who "loved women" but did not have sex with them. Unlike Tuways, some tales involving al-Dalal do suggest that he was attracted to men.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

==Persecution and decline==

While sporadic persecution of ''mukhannathun'' dates back to the time of Muhammad, their large-scale governmental persecution began in the Umayyad caliphate. This may have been prompted by "a perceived connection between cross-dressing and a lack of proper religious commitment", according to the scholar Everett K. Rowson.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt; Some sources associate the beginning of severe persecution with [[Marwan I]] and his brother Yahya, who served as a governor under the caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], while others put it in the time of Abd al-Malik’s son, [[Al-Walid I]]. The governor of Mecca serving under al-Walid is said to have “issued a proclamation against the ''mukhannathun''”, in addition to other singers and drinkers of wine. Two ''mukhannathun'' musicians named Ibn Surayj and al-Gharid are specifically named as being impacted by this proclamation, with al-Gharid fleeing to Yemen and never returning. Like al-Dalal, al-Gharid is portrayed as not just "effeminate" but homosexual in some sources. Beyond these two men, relatively little is known of the ''mukhannathun'' of Mecca, compared to the more well-known group in Medina.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

The most severe instance of persecution is typically dated to the time of al-Walid's brother and successor [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. According to several variants of this story, the caliph ordered the full castration of the ''mukhannathun'' of Medina. Some versions of the tale say that all of them were forced to undergo the procedure, while others state that only a few of them were; in the latter case, al-Dalal is almost always included as one of the castrated ''mukhannathun''.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

Some variants of the story add a series of witticisms supposedly uttered by the ''mukhannathun'' prior to their castration:

:Tuways: “This is simply a circumcision which we must undergo again.”

:al-Dalal: “Or rather the Greater Circumcision!”

:Nasim al-Sahar (“Breeze of the Dawn”): “With castration I have become a mukhannath in truth!”

:Nawmat al-Duha: “Or rather we have become women in truth!”

:Bard al-Fu'ad: “We have been spared the trouble of carrying around a spout for urine.”

:Zillal-Shajar (“Shade Under the Trees”): “What would we do with an unused weapon, anyway?”&lt;ref name="Roughgarden" /&gt;

After this event, the ''mukhannathun'' of Medina begin to fade from historical sources, and the next generation of singers and musicians had few ''mukhannathun'' in their ranks. Rowson states that though many details of the stories of their castration were undoubtedly invented, “this silence supports the assumption that they did suffer a major blow sometime around the caliphate of Sulayman.”&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

By the days of the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mamun]], the ''mukhannathun'' working as entertainment were now more associated with [[court jesters]] than famed musicians, and the term itself seems to have become synonymous with an individual employed as a comedian or pantomime. The Abbasid caliphs al-Mamun and [[al-Mutawakkil]] employed a famed ''mukhannath'' named Abbada as an actor in comedic plays.&lt;ref name="EoAL" /&gt; He served as a buffoon whose act depended upon mockery and "low sexual humor", the latter of which involved the flaunting of his "passive homosexuality".&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt; These characteristics would define ''mukhannathun'' in later eras,&lt;ref name="Irregularity" /&gt; and they never regained the relatively esteemed status they held in the early days in Medina.

==Religious opinions==

The eighth-century scholar [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]] stated that one should pray behind ''mukhannathun'' only in cases of necessity. Some thirteenth and fourteenth-century scholars like [[an-Nawawi]] and [[Shams-ud-Din Kermani|al-Kirmani]] classified ''mukhannathun'' into two groups: those whose feminine traits seem unchangeable, despite the person’s best efforts to stop them, and those whose traits are changeable but refuse to stop. Islamic scholars like [[Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani]] stated that all ''mukhannathun'' must make an effort to cease their feminine behavior, but if this proved impossible, they were not worthy of punishment. Those who made no effort to become less "effeminate", or seemed to "take pleasure in (his effeminacy)", were worthy of blame. By this era, ''mukhannath'' had developed its association with homosexuality, and [[Badr al-Din al-Ayni]] saw homosexuality as "a more heinous extension of ''takhannuth''", or effeminate behavior.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-1711#page-3195|publisher=Shamela|access-date=14 October 2018|author=an-Nawawi|title=Al-Minhaj bi Sharh Sahih Muslim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn 'Abd al-Barr]] stated that ''mukhannathun'' in his era were "known to be promiscuous", and resembled women in "softness, speech, appearance, accent and thinking". These ''mukhannathun'' were the ones initially allowed to be the servants of women, as they did not demonstrate any physical attraction to the female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=al-Maqdīsī  |first=Ibn Qudamah |title=Al-Mughni wa al-Sharh al Kabeer |pages=7/463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

While sometimes classified as [[transgender]] individuals, ''mukhannathun'' as a group do not fit neatly into any one of the prevailing categories of [[gender]] or [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] used by modern LGBT communities.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt; Although they were probably not predominantly cisgender or [[heterosexual]], it cannot be said that they were simply either homosexual males or transgender women. There was too much variety between one ''mukhannath'' and the next to determine a specific label for their gender or sexual identity, and the term's meaning changed over time.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"/&gt;

Likewise, while some ''mukhannathun'' are said to have engaged in homosexuality, others did not, complicating efforts to label them gay men. According to Muhsin Hendricks:
{{quote|Muhammad did deal with a group of effeminate men in Medina called "Mukhannathun". However, while this group of Mukhannathun did possess qualities of modern gay men, it cannot be said that the Mukhannathun fully represent modern homosexual men, as they were involved in practices not common to contemporary homosexual men.&lt;ref name="Hendricks"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Muhsin |last=Hendricks |title=Islam and Homosexuality |publisher=ILGA |date=July 2006 |location=ILGA's preconference on religions |url=http://doc.ilga.org/content/download/4522/27322/version/1/file/ILGA-July06-Religions.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-22 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222247/http://doc.ilga.org/content/download/4522/27322/version/1/file/ILGA-July06-Religions.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1980s, Mufti [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]] of Egypt issued a [[fatwa]] supporting the right for those who fit the description of ''mukhannathun'' to have [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Tantawy seems to have associated the concept with hermaphroditism or [[intersex]] individuals. [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] of [[Transgender rights in Iran|Iran]] issued similar fatwas around the same time. Khomeini's initial fatwa concerned intersex individuals as well, but he later specified that [[sex reassignment surgery]] was also permissible in the case of transgender individuals.&lt;ref name="Islamic shari'a law p91-103"/&gt; Because [[homosexuality]] is illegal in Iran but [[transgenderism]] is legal, some gay individuals have been urged to undergo the surgery and transition into the opposite sex, regardless of their actual gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29832690 | title=The gay people pushed to change their gender | author=Ali Hamedani | publisher=BBC Persian | date= 5 November 2014 | access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]] are officially recognized as a [[third gender]] that is neither male nor female, a concept that some have compared to ''mukhannathun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature|page=305|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814774670|chapter=Conclusion|author=Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Islamic authorities say that if an individual deemed a ''khuntha'' or intersex has an unclear gender, it is not permissible for him to marry a woman until a medical professional confirms that he is male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/114670 | title=Ruling on marrying a man who is intersex or impotent, and the difference between them | publisher=islamqa.info | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15647">{{Hatnote|For a broader coverage, including national account systems used outside of the U.S., see [[National accounts]]}}

The '''national income and product accounts''' ('''NIPA''') are part of the [[national accounts]] of the United States. They are produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce. They are one of the main sources of data on general economic activity in the United States.

They use [[double-entry accounting]] to report the monetary value and sources of output produced in the country and the distribution of incomes that production generates. Data are available at the national and industry levels.

Seven summary accounts are published, as well as a much larger number of more specific accounts. The first summary account shows gross domestic product (GDP) and its major components.
The table summarizes national income on the left (debit, revenue) side and national product on the right (credit, expense) side of a two-column accounting report. Thus the left side gives GDP by the income method, and the right side gives GDP by the expenditure method.
The GDP is given on the bottom line of both sides of the report. GDP must have the same value on both sides of the account. This is because income and expenditure are defined in a way that forces them to be equal (see [[accounting identity]]). We show the 2003 table later in this article; we present the left side first for convenient screen display.

The U.S. report (updated quarterly) is available in several forms, including interactive, from links on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) NIPA ([https://www.bea.gov/index.htm]) page. Other countries report based on their own adopted system of [[National accounts]] which are frequently based on the U.S. NIPAs, the widely adopted [[United Nations System of National Accounts]], or their own custom approach. The level of detail (granularity) accounted for internally, and reported publicly, varies widely across countries. Likewise, a nation's system of accounts, (analogous to a firm's [[Chart of accounts]]) are typically gradually revised and updated on their own individual schedule. The U.S. NIPAs are prepared by the staff of the Directorate for National Economic Accounts within the BEA. The source data largely originate from public sources, such as government surveys and administrative data, and they are supplemented by data from private sources, such as data from trade associations (BEA 2008: 1–6).

==Income accounting==
The income side of the national income and product account report begins with the kinds of income people might have. Employee compensation includes the wages and salaries paid to anyone whose income is subject to income tax withholding. Since wages and salaries affect more individuals and families directly than the other sources of income, it has by far the largest value.

Proprietors' income is the payments to those who own non-corporate businesses, including sole proprietors and partners. inventory value adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCA) are corrections for changes in the value of proprietor's inventory (goods that may be sold within one year) and capital (goods like machines and buildings that are not expected to be sold within one year) under rules set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Rental income of persons excludes rent paid to corporate real estate companies. Real estate is capital rather than inventory by definition, so there is no IVA.

Corporate profits with IVA and CCA is like the entries for proprietors' income and rental income except that the organization is a corporation. Corporate profit is shown before taxes, which are part of taxes on production and imports, two lines down.

Business current transfer payments is not explained here.

Net interest and miscellaneous payments is interest paid minus interest received plus payments to individuals and corporations that are not elsewhere classified (NEC). Taxes on production and imports does not include corporate income tax payments to the states and to the federal government. Taxes on production and imports were previously classified as "indirect business taxes" and include excise taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and other taxes relating to business production. While the report includes the net value of interest payments and receipts, both the taxes paid and subsidies from the government are shown.

National income (NI) is the sum of employees, proprietors, rental, corporate, interest, and government income less the subsidies government pays to any of those groups.

Net national product (NNP) is National Income plus or minus the statistical discrepancy that accumulates when aggregating data from millions of individual reports. In this case, the statistical discrepancy is US$25.6&amp;nbsp;billion, or about 0.23% of gross domestic product. A discrepancy that small (less than three-tenths of one percent) is immaterial under accounting standards.

Gross national product is net national product plus an allowance for the [[consumption of fixed capital]], mostly buildings and machines, usually called depreciation. Capital is used up in production but it does not vanish.

Finally, GDP is gross national product plus payments from the rest of the world that are income to residents of the U.S. minus payments from the US to the rest of the world that count as income where they are received.

==Production accounting==
[[Macroeconomics]] defines GDP, from the production perspective, as the sum of personal consumption, investment, [[net exports]], and government expenditures; {{nowrap|1=GDP = C + I + (X − M) + G}}.

The production side report also begins with individuals and families, in this case their personal consumption expenditures on goods and services, C in the definition. Durable goods are expected to last more than a year (furniture, appliances, cars, etc.) and to have little or no secondary resale market. Nondurable goods are used up within a year (food, clothing, medicine...). Services includes everything else, everything we buy that has little or no physical presence, like banking, health care, insurance, movie tickets, and so on.

[[Gross private domestic investment]] includes expenditures on goods that are expected to be used for an extended period of time, I in the definition. Residential investment includes owner occupied and rental housing. Nonresidential investment includes buildings, machinery, and equipment used for commercial or industrial purposes (small business, agriculture, manufacturing, service, etc.). The last element of Investment accounts for any change in the value of previous investments that are still in use, called inventory.

Net Exports reports the balance between goods produced domestically but consumed abroad (X) and goods produced abroad but consumed domestically (M). There is no distinction between consumption and investment or between the private and public sectors; a consumer's imported television, a corporation's imported lab equipment, and the government's use of imported food on military bases count equally. When net exports are positive, the country has a trade surplus. When Net Exports are negative, there is a trade deficit.

Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment includes all government expenditures on domestically produced goods and services. Like an individual or family, the government consumes food, clothing, furniture, and other goods and services in its administrative, military, correctional, and other programs. Governments also invest in buildings for program use and in improvements to harbors, rivers, roads, and airports. [[Transfer payment]]s, like subsidies to the unemployed or the retired, are ''not'' included in this item, since they are simply a movement of money from government to citizens, rather than a purchase of goods or services.

The sum of the four production categories is gross domestic product, the value of all domestic expenditures on goods and services. GDP (income) must equal GDP (production) except for any rounding error that accumulates when the data used to prepare a table includes rounding at prior stages of analysis, as appears to have happened in this case.

&lt;ref group="note" name="n1"&gt;On 17 Sep 2004 the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounting (US BEA NIPA) web site was {{cite web |url=http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050625073903/http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn1.htm |archivedate=2005-06-25 |df= }}. At that time, the tables cited here were downloaded as a wk1 format spreadsheet in a zip file through a button on that page.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The BEA's table and line numbers were removed for clarity and the sums were recalculated. Copies of the downloaded BEA NIPA tables used to construct the example, including table and line numbers, are in a pdf file.

The BEA offers the NIPA tables interactively and as txt, zipped wk1, exe, csv, and pdf files. Footnotes to the BEA's tables are available in their pdf file only.  The downloads include the two most recent annual values and the five most recent quarterly values for each item. The quarterly values are seasonally adjusted at annual rates; they do not add to a reported annual value.

The income side of the report is derived from BEA NIPA Tables 1.7.5 (Relation of gross domestic product, gross national product, net national product, national income, and personal income) and 1.12 (National income by type of income).

The production side of the report is derived from BEA NIPA Table 1.1.5 (Gross domestic product). There is a 0.1 (US$100M or 0.00091%) rounding error from the official GDP (11,004.0) in the recalculated sum on the Product Accounts side.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="n2"&gt;Employee compensation includes wages and salaries plus employer payments for government insurance and pension programs.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="n3"&gt;IVA refers to inventory valuation adjustment and CCA refers to capital consumption adjustment; they are features of U.S. tax law.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="n4"&gt;Corporate profits reported here are before taxes. They are divided among Tax payments (234.90), net dividends (395.30), and Undistributed profits (also known as retained earnings) (390.90).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Getty Villa exterior.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Getty Villa]] representing life at otium (leisure) of an ancient Roman villa]] 
'''''Otium''''', a [[Latin]] abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's [[retirement]] after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing "active public life". ''Otium'' can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (''negotium'') or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (''i.e.'' speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Julia Conaway |last1=Bondanella |year=2008 |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/clj/BondanellaAbstract.html |title=Petrarch's Rereading of Otium in ''De vita solitaria'' |journal= Comparative Literature |publisher=[[American Comparative Literature Association]] |volume=60 |number=1 |pages=14–28 |accessdate=9 November 2011 |doi=10.1215/-60-1-14 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
In ancient Roman culture ''otium'' was a military concept as its first Latin usage. This was in Ennius' ''Iphigenia.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17–24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iphigenia'' (241–248)

He who does not know how to use leisure &lt;br&gt; has more of work than when there is work in work. &lt;br&gt; For to whom a task has been set, he does the work, &lt;br&gt;desires it, and delights his own mind and intellect: &lt;br /&gt;in leisure, a mind does not know what it wants.&lt;br /&gt; The same is true (of us); we are neither at home nor in the battlefield; &lt;br /&gt;we go here and there, and wherever there is a movement, we are there too.&lt;br /&gt;
The mind wanders unsure, except in that life is lived.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmo, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman soldiers at rest.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Representation of ancient Roman soldiers at rest]]
According to historian Carl Deroux in his work ''Studies in Latin literature and Roman history'', the word ''otium'' appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia.&lt;ref&gt;Deroux, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius' first use of the term ''otium'' around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed ''otium negotiosum'' (free time to do what one wanted) and ''otium otiosum'' (idle wasteless free time).&lt;ref name="Langis2"&gt;''[http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S&amp;R_2008_Langis.pdf Leisure, Idleness and Virtuous Activity in Shakespearean Drama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514084059/http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S%26R_2008_Langis.pdf# |date=14 May 2014 }}'' by Unhae Langis, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]], while discussing the word ''praeterpropter'' ("more or less") quotes a fragment of [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', which contrasts ''otium'' with ''negotium'' repeatedly.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0071:book=19:chapter=10 19, 10]. For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as "more or less" ''living''.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant appearance of the word in [[Latin literature]] occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the ''Iphigenia'' of [[Ennius]], where it is contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Ennius, frg. XCIX in the edition of Jocelyn, ''otio qui nescit uti | plus negoti habet quam cum est negotium in negotio'', rendered by Jocelyn: "the man who has no job to do and does not know how to employ the resulting leisure has more difficulty than when there is difficulty in a job on hand". For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of ''otium'' was never a direct translation of the Greek word "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. ''Otium'' is an example of the usage of the term "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war.&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"&gt;Sadlek, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (''i.e.'', winter months, weather not permitting war).&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"/&gt; This was associated with ''otium otiosum'' (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was ''otium negotiosum'' (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying [[hobby]] or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was ''otium privatum'' (private leisure), equal to ''negotium'' (a type of business).&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract "Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium" by Brian Vickers], p. 6 ''The first recorded use of the term is in a fragment from a soldiers' chorus in Ennius' Iphigenia (c. 190 BC), whose preservation we owe to that philologian's ragbag, the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (c. 150 AD) - he cites it as an example of the usage of the word praeterpropter (19.10.12). The soldiers are unoccupied, resting and bored, wanting to return home. They distinguish between otium negotiosum, leisure with a satisfying occupation, which takes place in the city, around the hearth, and otium otiosum, unoccupied and pointless leisure, such as their prolonged stay in the countryside, which they find disorientating. Andre argues that otium originally had military, not pastoral associations, referring to the enforced inactivity that coincided each year with the dead months of winter (especially January and February), unsuitable for war, farming or fishing.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest citation for ''otium'' is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17-24, The tragedy is [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', ''apud'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0071%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D10 19, 10] (a discussion of a different word in the same fragment).&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (''otium'') than to be idle doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons&lt;ref name="Bernard16"&gt;Bernard, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; - a time for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Even though originally ''otium'' was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons,&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"&gt;Bright, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, pp 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of ''otium'' as a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of ancient Roman considered ''otium'' a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paoli, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and [[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]] point out the only legitimate form of ''otium'' was transpired with intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Almasi, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otium'' was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (''negotium'') and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek philosophers ==
[[File:Epikur2.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]] ]]

The favorable sense of ''otium'' in [[Cicero]]nian Latin reflects the Greek term {{lang|grc|σχολή}} (''skholē'', "leisure", a meaning retained in [[Modern Greek]] as σχόλη, ''schólē''); "leisure" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the [[kalos kagathos|Athenian gentleman]]: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became "discussion", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. [[Plato]] (and his contemporaries, if the ''[[Greater Hippias]]'' be not authentic) brought ''schole'' into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the ''Greater Hippias'', it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henry Smith, ''The new nobility: A prolegomenon to Plato's "Greater Hippias"'' 2007; pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the [[Academy]], they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the [[New Academy]] of [[Carneades]] practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy lasted nearly a thousand years; different authors divide its history differently. For the text, see, ''inter permulta alia'', R. J. Hankinson, ''The Skeptics'', pp. 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] and [[Dicaearchus]], students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"/&gt;

Roman Epicureans used ''otium'' for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"&gt;Haase, p. 2265&lt;/ref&gt; An Epicurean proverb {{cquote|
''It is better to lie on the naked ground and be at ease, than to have a golden coach and a rich table and be worried.''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenmeyer, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The phrase "to be at ease" can have the meaning "to be of good cheer" or "to be without fear" {{mdash}} these being interdependent. The [[Epicurean]] idea of ''otium'' favors contemplation,&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (''i.e.'' sailors). The rustic ''otium'' concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism.  The active city public life of ''negotium'' and an ''otium'' of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].

[[Epicurus]]'s philosophy was contrary to [[Stoicism|Hellenistic Stoicism]]. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of ''otium''.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"/&gt; The concept of the Epicurean ''otium'' (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in [[Epicureanism|Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden]]. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in "The Garden" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean ''otium'' and the  Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of ''otium'' (''i.e.'' private or public; contemplation or "employment"; ''otium'' or ''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Republic ==
In early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, ''otium'' is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to ''officium'', "office, duty" than to ''negotium'' ('business"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then ''otium'' meant "leisure" while ''negotium'' meant "non-leisure" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of ''otium'' was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. ''Otium '' and ''negotium'' was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of ''otium'' was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter,&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 20-22,  35-36, 79-81, 421, 434-437&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the business (''negotium'') of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual ''otium.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows that the beauty of the individual ''otium'' poses rest.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 514 ''beaute de l'otium individuel poesie du repos.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Maccius Plautus]] in his play ''[[Mercator (play)|Mercator]]'' says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim ''tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames'' (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0102%3Aact%3D3%3Ascene%3D2 T.

[[File:CiceroEpistulaeAdFamiliaresVenice1547page329Detail.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Cicero busy at work]]

[[Cicero]] speaks of himself, with the expression ''otium cum dignitate'', that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Chaim |last1=Wirszubski |journal=The [[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=44|year=1954 |pages=1–13|title=Cicero's CVM Dignitate Otivm: A Reconsideration |jstor=637589 |doi=10.2307/297549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/637589 AUCTORITAS, DIGNITAS, OTIUM]&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ousted from  each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for "worthy leisure". During this time he composed ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', a series of books on [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"&gt;Stroup, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero defines ''otium'' as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of "public health".&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt; It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book ''On Duties'' that when the city life becomes [[Frustration|too much]], one should retreat to the country for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Prosperetti, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''otium cum dignitate'' in Cicero's ''Pro Sestio'' was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some.&lt;ref&gt;Wirszubski, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero says in ''Pro Sestio'', XLV., 98{{cquote|
''Id quod est praestantissimum, maximeque optabile omnibus sanis et bonis et beatis, cum dignitate otium.''&lt;br /&gt;That which stands first, and is most to be desired by all happy, honest and healthy-minded men, is ease with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Harbottle, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and ''otium''. In one passage of ''[[De Oratore]]'' he explains that [[Philistus]] spent his retirement writing history as his ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book ii. 13.57&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say in ''De Oratore'' Book iii that other men passed their ''otium'' of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, [[knucklebones]], dice games or just games they made up. Others that were "retired" from public life for whatever reason devoted their ''otium cum seritio'' (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book iii.15.57&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Klaus Bringmann]] shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a [[hypocrite]] while in ''otium''  because of his sense of duty to serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, pp. 77-78 ''Cicero on "otium"...

It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (''desidia'') had derogatory implications and unqualified ''otium'' was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with ''negotia publica'', participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''off.'' 3.1; ''Brut.'' 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish between plain "idleness" and aristocratic ''otium homestum'', ''otium liberale'' or ''otium cum dignitate'', writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to ''res publica'' (the general public).  These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc. 1.5; 5.105; ''fam'' 1.9.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Cat.'' 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero praises [[Cato the Elder]] for his respectful use of ''otium'' in  his expression ''non minus otii quam negotii'' (no less for doing nothing than business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x | volume=4 | title=Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium | year=1990 | journal=Renaissance Studies | pages=1–37 [7] | last1 = Vickers | first1 = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero was associating ''otium'' with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed he was ''never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.''&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Cicero in his ''[[De Officiis]]'' (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus ''Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a [[goad]].''  Cicero's idea of ''otium cum dignitate'' (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of "free time" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (''otium'') available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of [[hobby|hobbies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bereday, p. 60 &amp; 156&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero has a number of different concept versions for ''otium''. In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (''maximos labores'') should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Vasaly, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catullus]], a late [[Roman Republic]] poet, in his poems shows that the significance of ''otium'' of the middle Republican time of [[autonomy]] into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark ''otium'' with erotic influence.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt;

=== Imperial Rome ===
[[File:GNM - Römische Villa.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reconstruction of a Roman villa]]
The imperial dictatorship by [[Augustus]] during the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (''otium'') because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 123, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The home of choice (''domus'') then became the countryside [[villa]] as the rise of the [[Roman Empire]] made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-style architecture became their new [[Roman villa|villa otium]] outside of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/arts/12iht-otium.1.16069552.html?pagewanted=all |title=The pursuit of leisure and the rise of the Roman villa|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times the "otium villa " was a [[Dionysian]] idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (''otium'') in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The "villa with a garden" and "villa by the sea" was associated with ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
The life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a "superior world" of living.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Roman poet [[Statius]] writes of a "otium villa" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work ''[[Silvae]]'': ''It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure,  non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...''&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 3.5.85-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in ''otium'' of the time by the life he lived from his "otium villas". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |title=The Roman Villa |access-date=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620235350/http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |archive-date=20 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibullus]] was an [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac]] poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his [[Tibullus#Extant works|existing first two books of poetry]] he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]] as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, ''adsiduus labor'', and military service (''militia''). He shows in his poetry that originally ''otium'' was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons.&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"/&gt; Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (''interdum'') and therefore inserts ''otium'' (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life.&lt;ref name="Myers73"&gt;Myers, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ''ignobile otium'' (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee-Stecum, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of ''otium''. He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]] as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward ''otium''. The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that ''otium'' is not really "free time", but a study of other matters (''i.e.'', reading, writing) other than political and career gains.&lt;ref&gt;Trapp, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by ''otium liberale'' (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De otio, De brevitate vitae, De tranquillitate animi, ep.'' 82.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''epp.'' 1.22; 9.3&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of ''otium ruris'' (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''epod.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''g.'' 2.475–540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''dial.'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'' describes retirement from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Erskine, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on ''otium'' (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref name="Bernard16"/&gt;

These are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'':
# virtue, freedom and happiness by reasoning.
# the military metaphor.
# that the virtuous person chooses ''statio'', a specific place for doing one's 'employment'.
# ''otium'' (leisure) is still ''negotium'' (business) even if withdrawal from public activity.
# that the virtuous person's ''otium'', as a citizen of the universe, is the field for the performance of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later writers ===

[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|125px|&lt;center&gt;Augustine studying]]

While Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of [[Athenodorus of Soli|Athenodorus]]'s ''De Tranquillitate'' it is basically different. In ''De Otio 3.5'' Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in ''De Tranquillitate'' the theme is peace of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] reminded Romans of ''otium philosophandi'', a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that ''otium'' was the prerequisite for contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of ''otium'' that [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described ''Christianae vita otium'' as the Christian life of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of ''otium'' as the [[deadly sin]] of [[acedia]] (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated ''otium'' as meaning to serve God through deep thought.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary, ''Trin.'' 1.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; These same Christian writers also showed ''otium ruris'' (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic ''propositum''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulinus of Nola, ''ep.'' 5.4; ''carm.'' 10.166&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine describes the monastic life as ''otium sanctum'' (sanctified leisure or approved leisure).&lt;ref name="Enarrations"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/augustine/textstrans.html |title=Enarrations on the Psalms |page=220.3 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - ''negotium'') and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - ''otium'').&lt;ref name="Prosperetti 48"&gt;Prosperetti, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]], 14th-century poet and [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]], discusses ''otium'' in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees ''otium'' not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|100 px|left|&lt;center&gt;Petrarca]]

Petrarch considered solitude (''i.e.'', rural setting, "villa otium", [[Philippe de Cabassoles#The best friend of Petrarch|his Vaucluse home]]) and its relationship to ''otium'' as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said "no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it."&lt;ref&gt;Kleist, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of ''otium'':

{{cquote|''...&amp;nbsp;ought it not to be my first aim to have my leisure as remote from idleness as my life is from active affairs?''&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;}}
Petrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in ''otium'' (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's ''Vetus Itala'' in ''De otio religioso'' where in [[Christianity]] it was associated with contemplation and ''vacatio'' (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with ''videre'' (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of ''otium'' as ''vacate et videte'' (be still and see—a form of [[meditation]], contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Marvell]]’s seventeenth-century poem [[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]] is a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] of nine [[stanzas]] in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to ''otium''. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows ''otium'' to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized ''otium'' with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.&lt;ref name="Vickers5"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}; page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]], a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of ''otium'' in his 1878 publication ''[[Human, All Too Human|Menschliches, Allzumenschliches]]'':{{cquote|

== Private life and public life meanings ==
Private life meaning of ''otium'' meant personal [[retirement]]—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of "active public life". One would not be a historian in this case.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=637589 |title= Auctoritas, Dignitas, Otium |first1=J. P. V.

In public life ''otium'' meant public peace and relief after war.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war).&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the ''[[status quo]]'': acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Sestio'' 98; cf. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8720">'''Paul Devereux''' (born 1945) is a British author, researcher, lecturer, broadcaster, artist and photographer based in [[England]]. Devereux is a co-founder and the managing editor of the academic publication ''Time &amp; Mind – the Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture'', a research associate with the Royal College of Art (2007-2013), and a Research Fellow with the International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL) group at [[Princeton University]].

Paul Devereux' work primarily deals with archaeological themes, especially [[archaeoacoustics]] (the study of sound at archaeological sites), the anthropology of consciousness (ancient and pre-modern worldviews), [[ecopsychology]], unusual geophysical phenomena, and consciousness studies, spanning the range from academic to popular. He has written or co-written 28 books since 1979. He originated  two Channel 4 (UK) television documentaries.

==Biography==
Paul Devereux grew up in [[Leicester]]. He painted and studied at the [[Ravensbourne College of Art and Design]] in [[London]]. With a preference for [[abstract expressionism]], he found increasing inspiration in the geometry and ground plans of ancient sites. He admits to experiencing LSD and mescaline in college, and having at least one profound epiphany under the influence in 1966. He also witnessed, along with all the students on campus, the passage of a UFO in broad daylight in 1967.&lt;ref name="artconwall devereux"&gt;[http://www.artcornwall.org/interviews/Paul_Devereux.htm Paul Devereux on LSD, leys, The RCA, and Places of Power], ''Artconwall.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, he exhibited his work that a critic described as «a collision between [[Op art]] and [[archaeology]]». He was also a teacher, eventually teaching an evening class in [[Kensington]] called ''Earth mysteries''. Interested in researching the ideas behind [[ley line]]s, he took over as editor of ''The Ley Hunter'' magazine in 1976.&lt;ref name="artconwall devereux"/&gt;

==Work==
===Ley lines===
Devereux is indelibly associated with “leys", or “[[ley line]]s". In 1976, Paul Devereux took over as editor of the magazine ''The Ley Hunter''. His first order was an article on the mystical power of ley lines, but none of the writers could provide concrete documentation on the matter. According to him, Alfred Watkins' alignments «were really just chance alignments of points on maps. This can be demonstrated quite conclusively».&lt;ref name="ghostvillage 12132003"/&gt;

Paul Devereux'  work on ley lines was mainly focused on debunking the mystical properties ''falsely'' attributed to them. He argues that fake information about ley lines started in 1936 with [[Dion Fortune]]'s book ''Goat-Foot God'' where the author introduced the idea that ley lines have mystic power. He also mentions [[Aimé Michel]]'s 1958 book, ''Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery'', which stipulates that UFOs followed straight specific lines, an idea that ex-RAF pilot Tony Wedd later linked to [[Alfred Watkins]]' ''[[The Old Straight Track]]''. This idea then bloomed in the psychedelic movement of the 1960s and became a pillar of the [[New Age]] philosophies.&lt;ref name="ghostvillage 12132003"&gt;Jeff Belanger, [http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2003/legends33_12132003.shtml Ley Lines, Old Straight Tracks, and Earth Energies], ''Ghostvillage.com'', 13 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

About the [[Nazca Lines]], Paul Devereux argues that they are walking tracks, and that their pattern mainly reveal the religious beliefs of the Kogi Indians around sacred roads. In his 2003 book ''Fairy Paths &amp; Spirit Roads'', Paul Devereux studied many ley lines worldwide and concluded that these linear features are essentially «paths of spirits». He led the Dragon Project for 10 years and admitted that there are places of high radiation where some participants experienced powerful and vivid hallucinatory episodes of spirit-like visits.&lt;ref name="ghostvillage 12132003"/&gt;

===Dragon Project===
Devereux is the director of the Dragon Project Trust, which in the past used scientific measuring instruments as well as primary sensing (using dowsers and self-proclaimed psychics) to test modern rumours and traditional folklore of there being "energies" at sacred places. Between 1990 and 2000, it ran an ambitious ancient sites dream research programme (a modern, updated research version of ancient "temple sleep" practices).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010118023200/http://www.arthistory.sbc.edu/sacredplaces/devereux.html Dragon Project Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFOs===
Devereux states that he suspects a small percentage of unexplained aerial phenomena are literally unexplained flying objects, their nature currently unknown. He strongly doubts they are extraterrestrial craft but rather exotic natural phenomena – probably some form of plasma with extraordinary properties. He coined the term “earth lights" to label these type of phenomena. Most [[UFO]] sighting reports he thinks result from misperceptions of astronomical objects, atmospheric effects such as mirages, or aircraft and other mundane objects, or downright hoaxes. Some reports, he feels, also stem from psycho-social causes. Devereux states that he became interested in unexplained aerial phenomena because of a bizarre sighting of his own in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Finlo Rohrer, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6268708.stm Saucers in the sky], ''www.bbc.co.uk'', 4 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Devereux has written three  books on the topic, ''Earth Lights'', and, in particular, ''Earth Lights Revelation'', and has co-authored (with Peter Brookesmith) a major work, ''UFOs and Ufology'', and  has also written numerous articles on earth lights and given several lectures (including at the Dana Centre, Science Museum, London) on the subject.

===Archaeoacoustics===
In 2014, the Landscape and Perception Project led by Paul Devereux led research on the rocks in [[Stonehenge]] and concluded they were resonant rocks that work like a giant prehistoric [[glockenspiel]]. This theory would explain why the rocks were brought from 200 miles away from the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-26417976 Stonehenge bluestones had acoustic properties, study shows], ''www.bbc.com'', 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research led him to the observation that [[cairn]]s on burial grounds resonate at 111&amp;nbsp;Hz (sacred resonance). According to him, [[Pythagoras]] created his accoustic scale starting with the sacred 111&amp;nbsp;Hz resonance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://interestingengineering.com/temples-resonates-frequency-111-hz Mysterious Ancient Temples Resonate at the 'Holy Frequency'], ''Interestingengineering.com'', 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8381">{{for|the broader philosophical and critical applications of the concept|performativity}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[speech acts theory]], '''performative utterances''' are [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s which not only describe a given reality, but also change the social reality they are describing.

In his 1955 [[William James]] lecture series, which were later published under the title ''[[How to Do Things with Words]]'', [[J. L. Austin]] argued against a [[positivist]] philosophical claim that the utterances always "describe" or "constate" something and are thus always true or false. After mentioning several examples of sentences which are not so used, and not truth-evaluable (among them [[nonsensical]] sentences, [[interrogative]]s, [[speech act|directive]]s and "ethical" propositions), he introduces "performative" sentences or [[illocutionary act]] as another instance.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. ''How to Do Things with Words'' Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-19-824553-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austin's definition==
In order to define performatives, Austin refers to those sentences which conform to the old prejudice in that they ''are'' used to describe or constate something, and which thus ''are'' true or false; and he calls such sentences "constatives". In contrast to them, Austin defines "performatives" as follows:

*(1) Performative utterances are not [[Truth|true or false]], that is, not [[Logical value|truth-evaluable]]; instead when something is wrong with them then they are "unhappy", while if nothing is wrong they are "happy". 
*(2) The uttering of a performative is, or is part of, the doing of a certain kind of action (Austin later deals with them under the name [[illocutionary act]]s), the performance of which, again, would not normally be described as just "saying" or "describing" something (cf. Austin 1962, 5).

For example, when Paul says "I promise to do the dishes" in an appropriate context then he thereby does not just say something, and in particular he does not describe what he is doing; rather, in making the utterance he performs the promise; since promising is an illocutionary act, the [[utterance]] is thus a performative utterance. If Peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise, or if eventually he does not keep it, then although something is not in order with the utterance, the problem is not that the sentence is false: it is rather "unhappy", or "infelicitous", as Austin also says in his discussion of so-called [[felicity conditions]]. In the absence of any such flaw, on the other hand, the utterance is to be assessed as "happy" or "felicitous", rather than as "true". Austin dropped this distinction in favour of a distinction between explicit performatives ("I promise it will never happen again") and primary or implicit performatives ("It will never happen again," functioning as a promise).

The initial examples of performative sentences Austin gives are these:
* 'I do (sc. take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife)' – as uttered in the course of the marriage ceremony.
* 'I name this ship the "Queen Elizabeth"'
* 'I give and bequeath my watch to my brother' – as occurring in a will
* 'I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow' (Austin 1962, 5)

As Austin later notices himself, these examples belong (more or less strikingly) to what Austin calls, [[explicit performatives|''explicit'' performatives]]; to utter an "explicit" performative sentence is to make explicit what act one is performing. However, there are also "implicit", "primitive", or [[inexplicit performatives|"inexplicit" performatives]]. When, for instance, one uses the word "Go!" in order to command someone to leave the room then this utterance is part of the performance of a command; and the sentence, according to Austin, is neither true nor false; hence the sentence is a performative; – still, it is ''not'' an ''explicit'' performative, for it does not make explicit that the act the speaker is performing is a command.

As Austin observes, the acts purported to be performed by performative utterances may be socially contested. For instance, "I divorce you", said three times by a man to his wife, may be accepted to constitute a divorce by some, but not by others.

===Examples (mainly of explicit performative utterances)===
* "I now pronounce you man and wife" – used in the course of a marriage ceremony
* "I order you to go", "Go{{mdash}}that's an order"
* "Yes" – answering the question "Do you promise to do the dishes?"
* "You are under arrest" – used in putting someone under arrest
* "I christen you"
* "I accept your apology"
* "I sentence you to death"
* "I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you" (Islamic: see: [[Triple talaq|Talaq-i-Bid'ah]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_151_200/triple__talaq.htm triple Talaq]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I do" – wedding
* "I swear to do that", "I promise to be there"
* "I apologize"
* "I dedicate this..." (...book to my wife; ...next song to the striking Stella Doro workers, etc.)
* "This meeting is now adjourned", "The court is now in session"
* "This church is hereby de-sanctified"
* "War is declared"
* "I resign" – employment, or chess
* "You're [hereby] fired."

==True/false value and John Searle==
[[John Searle|John R. Searle]] argued in his 1989 article ''How Performatives Work'' that performatives are true/false just like constatives. Searle further claimed that performatives are what he calls ''declarations''; this is a technical notion of Searle's account: according to his conception, an utterance is a ''declaration'', if "the successful performance of the speech act is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true." Searle believes that this double direction of fit contrasts the simple word-to-world fit of [[assertives]].

==The receiving side==
Bach and Harnish claimed that performatives are successful only if recipients infer the intention behind the literal meaning, and that therefore the success of the performative act is determined by the receiving side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bach|first1=Kent|last2=Harnish|first2=Robert|title=Linguistic Communication and Speech|journal=Language in Society|date=August 1981|volume=10|issue=2|pages=270–274|jstor=4167219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performativeness as non-dichotomous variable==
[[Eve Sedgwick]] argued that there are performative aspects to nearly all [[word]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[phrase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sedgwick|first1=Eve|title=Touching Feeling|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, according to Sedgwick, performative utterances can be 'transformative' performatives, which create an instant change of personal or environmental status, or 'promisory' performatives, which describe the world as it might be in the future.  These categories are not exclusive, so an utterance may well have both qualities. As Sedgwick observes, performative utterances can be revoked, either by the person who uttered them ("I take back my promise"), or by some other party not immediately involved, like the state (for example, [[gay marriage]] vows pre-legalisation).

Words on a list can be either descriptive or performative.  'Butter' on a shopping list implies that "I will buy butter" (a promise to yourself).  But 'Butter' printed on your till receipt means "you have purchased butter" (simply a description).

==Performative writing==
The above ideas have influenced [[performative writing]]; they are used as a justification for an attempt to create a new form of [[critical writing]] about [[performance]] (often about [[performance art]]).  Such a writing form is claimed to be, in itself, a form of performance. It is said to more accurately reflect the fleeting and ephemeral nature of a performance, and the various tricks of memory and [[referentiality]] that happen in the mind of the viewer during and after the performance.

[[File:1888DemocraticPoster 2.png|thumb|''Public office is a public trust'']]
The concept of the '''public trust''' relates back to the origins of [[democratic government]] and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society; therefore, whatever ''trust'' the public places in its officials must be respected.
One of the reasons that [[bribery]] is regarded as a notorious [[evil]] is that it contributes to a culture of [[political corruption]] in which the public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are [[lobbying]], special [[interest group]]s and the public [[cartel]].

==Use in the Philippines==
{{See also|Impeachment in the Philippines}}
In the Philippines, "betrayal of public trust" is one of the impeachable offenses. In ''Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,'' the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] ruled that the definition of "betrayal of public trust" is "a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power" under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc. |vol=415 |reporter= SCRA |opinion=44 |pinpoint=105 |court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] |date=2003 |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/nov2003/160261.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.

'''Refugee Women's Network, Inc.''' (RWN) is a national [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], USA. RWN works exclusively with [[refugee]] and [[immigrant]] women to enhance their strength, skills and courage through [[leadership training]], [[education]] and [[advocacy]].

== History ==
RWN was founded in 1995 by a group of women who have immigrated to the [[United States]] as refugees; a Vietnamese from Atlanta, a Laotian [[Hmong people|Hmong]] from [[Milwaukee]], an Iranian from [[New York City]] and an Ethiopian from [[Los Angeles]] .They had experienced the refugee resettlement process and had worked in [[social service]] agencies that provided support to refugees. Through their collective experience, they knew that women’s skills, courage and experiences were not being adequately supported.

Refugee Women's Network celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melick|first1=Dena|title=Associate Editor|url=http://www.decaturish.com/2015/08/clarkston-womens-refugee-organization-to-celebrate-20-year-anniversary/|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=Decaturish|date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization has continued to be relevant to new refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basu|first1=Moni|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/world/world-refugee-day-vignettes/index.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=CNN.com|date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
Refugee Women’s Network  is a national non-profit organization created by women, for women, that focuses on enhancing refugee and immigrant women’s strengths, skills and courage through its leadership training, education and advocacy to promote independence, [[self-sufficiency]] and [[Business networking|networking]] among its participants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refugeeworks.org/downloads/rwnews_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the Refugee Women's Network is to aid and inspire refugee women into becoming independent individuals and developing them into leaders within their families, businesses, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://refugeewomensnetworkinc.org/what-we-do/|title=Our Story|website=Refugee Women's Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Programs ==
'''The Leadership Program''' is one of the oldest programs of RWN. Since 1995, 300 women in 30 American states from over 40 countries of origin have graduated from the leadership program. After participating in RWN's Leadership Program, many women have started their own organizations supporting refugees and immigrants in their communities. The Leadership Program is based on ‘Training for Transformation’, an approach to [[community development]] which focuses on "responsible, ethical, inclusive" methods of engaging community members. The leadership training gives participants tools and skills to understand, motivate and bring changes within themselves and their communities and the world. The goals of the Leadership Program are three-fold: strengthen women’s leadership abilities; increase their capacity to access community resources; and assist women to identify their values and build allies across [[ethnicity]] for advocacy.

'''The Health Promoters Program''' recruits refugees and immigrants from the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] to become bicultural, bilingual bridges between their ethnic communities and the U.S. health care system. The project started in 2004 as a partnership with the [[DeKalb County Board of Health]], [[Women Watch Afrika]] and RWN. Health promoters participate in 40 hours of training on health issues pertinent to their communities. RWN uses the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) definition of health, which includes physical, social, spiritual and mental well-being. Participants learn about topics such as [[nutrition]], [[hygiene]], [[mental health]], [[reproductive health]], [[physical health]] and adaptation of ethnic food to meet their current caloric needs. Following training, health promoters provide 12 hours of [[health education]] within their own ethnic communities each month and meet monthly for three hours of [[continuing education]] where they share stories, discuss community concerns and learn new information. The goals of the Health Promoters Program are: train women to be community health educators; provide health promoters with the resources to be liaisons between their ethnic communities and the health care system; and strengthen women's leadership abilities.

'''The Microenterprise Program''' was created in April 2001 in response to recurring requests for professional training and assistance to help refugee and immigrant women start or strengthen their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlc.org/ASSETS/6ACE42F907934EAF8C92945BF76AD47D/CPB%20-%20Immigration%20Employment%201008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, RWN added a micro-lending component to the program, which gives loans between $250 and $15,000 to women entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=106319&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Microenterprise]] Program provides [[business development]] training, microloans, one-on-one business consultation and technical assistance to refugee and immigrant women who are working to start or strengthen their businesses. The goal of the Microenterprise and [[Microfinance]] Program is to help refugee and immigrant women and their families attain economic self-sufficiency through [[self-employment]].

'''The Advocacy Program''' consists of RWN's continuous efforts to advocate on behalf of refugees, immigrants and women on a number of issues pertinent to their experiences. RWN participates in advocacy efforts on several national, state and local policy levels, taking part in initiatives representing the interest of refugee and immigrant women. These include inter-disciplinary initiatives like health, [[economic empowerment]], housing and community development; creating a platform for the voices of refugees and immigrants; and empowering refugee and immigrant women to find their own voices.

'''Stanford Jay Shaw''' (5 May 1930 – 16 December 2006) was an American [[historian]], best known for his works on the late [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkish Jews]], and the early [[Turkish Republic]]. His works have been criticized by some scholars for containing errors, and he is considered an [[apologetics|apologist]] for the [[Armenian genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Virginia Press| isbn = 978-0-8139-2267-6| last1 = Peterson| first1 = Merrill D.| last2 = Peterson| first2 = Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History Merrill D.| title = "Starving Armenians": America and the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1930 and After| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1353/dsp.1998.0008| issn = 1911-1568| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 3–24| last = Goekjian| first = Gregory F.| title = Diaspora and Denial: The Holocaust and the "Question" of the Armenian Genocide| journal = Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies| accessdate = 19 June 2018| date = 1998| url = https://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/diaspora_a_journal_of_transnational_studies/v007/7.1.goekjian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Stanford Jay Shaw was born to Belle and Albert Shaw, who had immigrated to St. Paul from [[England]] and [[Russia]] respectively in the early years of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"&gt;[http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~shaw/profile.html Profile of Prof. Shaw] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025854/http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~shaw/profile.html |date=17 October 2007 }}. [[Bilkent University]]. Accessed 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford Shaw and his parents moved to [[Los Angeles]], California, in 1933 because of his father's illness, and they lived there until 1939, first in [[Hollywood]], where Stanford went to kindergarten, and then in [[Ocean Park, Santa Monica, California|Ocean Park]], a community on the shore of the Pacific Ocean between Santa Monica and Venice, where his parents operated a photographic shop on the Ocean Park pier. The family returned to St. Paul in 1939, where Stanford went to the Webster Elementary School. After his parents divorced, Stanford went with his mother to Akron, Ohio during World War II, where he went to elementary school. Stanford and his mother remained there until she married Irving Jaffey and moved back to St. Paul. Stanford then attended Mechanic Arts High School in St. Paul, where he graduated in 1947, one out of only five students from a student body of 500 who went to college.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"/&gt;

===Education and early research===
He went on to [[Stanford University]], where he majored in [[History of the British Isles|British history]] under the direction of Professor [[Carl Brand]], with a minor in Near Eastern history, under the direction of Professor [[Wayne Vucinich]]. He received his B.A. at Stanford in 1951 and M.A. in 1952, with a thesis on the foreign policy of the [[British Labour Party]] from 1920–1938, based on research in the [[Hoover Institution]] at Stanford.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"/&gt;

He then studied Middle Eastern history along with Arabic, Turkish and Persian as a graduate student at [[Princeton University]] starting in 1952, receiving his M.A. in 1955. Subsequently he went to England to study with [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Paul Wittek]] at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and with Professor [[H. A. R. Gibb]] at Oxford University.

Following this, he went to Egypt to study with [[Shafiq Ghorbal]] and [[Adolph Grohmann]] at the [[University of Cairo]] and [[Shaikh Sayyid]] at the Azhar University, also doing research in the Ottoman archives of Egypt at the Citadel in Cairo for his Princeton Ph.D. dissertation concerning Ottoman rule in Egypt. Before leaving Egypt, he had a personal interview with President [[Gamal Abd al-Nasser]], who arranged for him to take microfilms of Ottoman documents out of the country.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"/&gt;

===Main research===
In 1956-7 he studied at the University of Istanbul with Professors Omer Lutfi Barkan, Mukrimin Halil Yinanc, Halil Sahillioglu, and Zeki Velidi Togan, also completing research on his dissertation in the Ottoman archives of Istanbul, where he was helped by a number of staff members, including Ziya Esrefoglu, Turgut Isiksal, Rauf Tuncay, and Attila Cetin, and in the Topkapi Palace archives, where he was provided with valuable assistance and support by its director, Hayrullah Ors and studied with Professor Ismail Hakki Uzuncarsili.

He received his Ph.D. degree in 1958 from Princeton University. His dissertation was titled "The Financial and Administrative Organization and Development of Ottoman Egypt, 1517–1798," which was prepared under the direction of Professor Lewis Thomas and Professor Hamilton A.R. Gibb, and later published by the Princeton University Press in 1962.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"/&gt; Stanford Shaw served as Assistant and Associate Professor of Turkish Language and History, with tenure, in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and in the Department of History at Harvard University from 1958 until 1968, and as Professor of Turkish history at the University of California Los Angeles from 1968 until his retirement in 1992.

===Last years===
He was recalled to teach Turkish history at UCLA between 1992 and 1997. His final post was at [[Bilkent University]], Ankara as professor of Ottoman and Turkish history from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Bilkent"/&gt;

The announcement of his death by his department at UCLA noted that his life was commemorated at Etz Ahayim Synagogue in [[Ortaköy]], Istanbul, where his family accepted condolences from friends and colleagues and from Turkish Foreign Minister [[Abdullah Gül]] and numerous other dignitaries and that he was buried at the Ashkenazi Cemetery in Ulus.&lt;ref name=CNES&gt;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/cnes/people/article.asp?parentid=73949 Wolf Leslau and Stanford J. Shaw: CNES mourns the passing of Professors Leslau and Shaw], UCLA Center for Near East Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
He was an honorary member of the [[Turkish Historical Society]] (Ankara), recipient of honorary degrees from [[Harvard University]] and the [[Boğaziçi University]] (Istanbul), and a member of the Middle East Studies Association, the American Historical Society, and the Tarih Vakfi (Istanbul). He also has received [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Turkey]] from the [[President of Turkey]] and medals for lifetime achievement from the [[Turkish-American Association]] and from the Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture (IRCICA) at the [[Yıldız Palace]], Istanbul. He received two major research awards from the United States National Endowment from the Humanities as well as fellowships from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Fulbright-Hayes Committee. He was also a Senior Fellow of the [[Institute of Turkish Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/stanford-j-shaw Stanford J. Shaw: Biography]." ''[[The Guardian]]''. Accessed 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey''===
One of Shaw's most prominent works was a two-volume history on the [[Ottoman Empire]], titled ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey''. The first volume, subtitled ''Empire of the Gazis: the Rise and Decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1280–1808'', published in 1976, was met with generally mixed to negative reviews. Many faulted him for producing a work embellished with numerous historical errors and distortions. [[Colin Imber]], a scholar on Ottoman history, noted in his review that both volumes were "so full of errors, half-truths, oversimplifications and inexactitudes that a non-specialist will find them positively misleading....When almost every page is a minefield of misinformation, a detailed review is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Imber, Colin. "[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/567074?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=55988260783 Review of ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'']." ''[[The English Historical Review]]'' 93 (Apr. 1978): pp. 393–395.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer, [[Victor L. Ménage]], Professor of Turkish at the [[University of London]], counted over 70 errors in the work and concluded, "One 'prejudice' that has vanished in the process is the respect for accuracy, clarity, and reasoned judgment."&lt;ref&gt;Ménage, Victor L. "[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/615640?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=55988260783 Review of ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'']." ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London'' 41 (1978): pp. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive review of the first volume, [[Speros Vryonis]], a specialist in Byzantine and Early Ottoman Studies at UCLA, listed a litany of problems he encountered in the work, such as Shaw's assertion that Sultan [[Mehmed II]]'s forces did not subject Constantinople to a full scale sack and massacre upon its capture and his account of the treatment of the Greeks of Cyprus following the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|Ottoman conquest]] in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;[[Speros Vryonis|Vryonis, Speros]]. ''Stanford J. Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume I: A Critical Analysis''. Thessaloniki: Institute for Balkan Studies, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Vryonis also charged Shaw for largely failing to consult the proper primary sources of the period and therefore presenting a distorted picture of the formation of the [[Ottoman Armenia|Armenian]] and Greek/Eastern Orthodox ''[[millet system|millet]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Vryonis. ''A Critical Analysis'', pp. 88–112.&lt;/ref&gt; More troubling allegations were put forward by Vryonis, when he accused the Shaw of wholesale [[plagiarism]], claiming that as much as 90% of the first volume had been lifted from the works of two Turkish historians and a Turkish-language encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="HewsenLecture"&gt;Lecture delivered by [[Robert Hewsen]]. {{YouTube|Fmvc5p998Dg|"Genocide Denial: Evolution of a Process"}}, part of the 2007 Holocaust and Genocide Lecture Series at [[Sonoma State University]] (27:24 mark). 17 April 2007. Accessed 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Vryonis presented his findings to the administration at UCLA, but the university declined to carry out any further investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name="HewsenLecture"/&gt;

In the second volume of the ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', which Shaw co-authored with his wife, Ezel Kural Shaw, and which was published in 1977 with the subtitle ''Reform, Revolution, and Republic: the Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808–1975'', the Shaws [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide|denied]] the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Most scholars today believe that the events of 1915 constitute genocide.&lt;ref name=cons&gt;[http://europe.newsweek.com/why-scholars-say-armenian-genocide-was-genocide-obama-wont-325262 Why scholars say Armenian Genocide was genocide but Obama won't], ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] the Shaws characterize the Armenians as "the victimizers rather than the victims, as the privileged rather than the oppressed, and the fabricators of unfounded tales of massacre."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard G. Hovannisian|Hovannisian, Richard G]]. "The Armenian Genocide and Patterns of Denial" in ''The Armenian Genocide in Perspective'', ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New Brunswick, NJ: Transactions Publishers, 1986, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Hovannisian also criticized the book: "What could have been – what should have been – a valuable text is instead an unfortunate example of nonscholarly selectivity and deceptive presentation."&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, Richard G. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/162774?seq=1&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=shaw&amp;term=hovannisian&amp;term=richard&amp;term=stanford&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dstanford%2Bshaw%2Brichard%2Bhovannisian%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26wc%3Don&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=63&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;resultsServiceName=doBasicResultsFromArticle The Critic's View: Beyond Revisionism]." ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' 9 (October 1978): pp. 379–388. Retrieved 6 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Shaws' response, see Stanford J. Shaw and Ezel Kural Shaw, "[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/162775?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103295837847 The Authors Respond]." ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 9 (October 1978): pp. 388–400.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the bibliography of his general study on modern Turkey, Turkologist Eric J. Zürcher of the [[University of Leiden]] describes the second volume as "a mine of data," though the information not necessarily being accurate. He highlighted the Shaws' treatment of the reigns of Selim III and Abdülhamit II as the book's strongest parts, but observed that the last one hundred years it covers suffers from a "Turkish-nationalist bias."&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher, Eric J. ''Turkey: A Modern History, 3rd. Ed''. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume caused a stir among Armenian students attending UCLA and the Armenian community of Los Angeles at large. Matters came to a head when on the night of 3 October 1977, a bomb, placed by unknown assailants, exploded at the doorstep of Shaw's home at 3:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., although no one was hurt. A phone call placed several hours later by a man claimed that the Iranian Group of 28 was responsible for the bombing. Turkey's permanent ambassador to the UN disputed this, however, and alleged that Armenians were behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw made light of the situation and attributed the bombing to the fact that he had probably assigned too many F's. But he claimed that Armenian and Greek students had threatened him over the previous two years and canceled the rest of his classes for the remainder of the quarter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Bruin]]''. 4 October 1977, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With the controversy unabated ten years later, Shaw would claim Armenians were persecuting him not because of his scholarly views but for [[anti-Semitism]], a charge that was refuted by Jewish organizations, including the UCLA chapter of [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]], on campus, as well as a number of Jewish public figures and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Arkun, Aram. "[http://www.armenews.com/article.php3?id_article=27883 Stanford Jay Shaw, 1930–2006: An academic who denied the Armenian Genocide]." ''[[The Armenian Reporter]]''. 23 December 2006. Retrieved 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Turkey and the Holocaust''===
In 1991, Shaw's study on the role of Turkey in providing refuge to the Jews of Europe in the years leading to and during the [[Holocaust]] was published.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Stanford. ''Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing Turkish and European Jewry from Nazi Persecution, 1933–1945''. New York: New York University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw claimed that the Republic of Turkey, as a neutral during the greater part of World War II, exerted its diplomatic efforts to the best of its abilities to save Jews of Turkish origins from extermination. The work was particularly receptive among Turkish government circles. It was, however, severely criticized by [[Bernard Wasserstein]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' for factual and methodological errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wasserstein |first=Bernard |title=Their Own Fault – Attempts to shift the blame for the Holocaust |journal=The Times Literary Supplement |date=7 January 1994 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw's points have been challenged in a more recent study by Corry Guttstadt, who contests that his work has contributed to "an ossified, self-perpetuating myth [of Turkish utilitarianism] which is frequently propagated in international publications,"&lt;ref&gt;Guttstadt, Corry. ''Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Turkey, in fact, passed laws that prevented Jewish immigration and threatened to expel refugee academics if they lacked proper documentation (after their citizenship had been revoked by [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Von Bieberstein, Alice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">The '''Stroke-ornamented ware (culture)''' or (German) '''Stichbandkeramik''' (abbr. '''STK''' or '''STbK'''), '''Stroked Pottery culture''', '''[[Danubian culture|Danubian Ib]]''' culture of [[V. Gordon Childe]], or '''Middle Danubian culture''' is the successor of the [[Linear Pottery culture]], a major archaeological horizon of the [[European Neolithic]]  in [[Central Europe]]. 
The STK flourishes during approximately  4600-4400 BC.
Centered on [[Silesia]] in [[Poland]], eastern [[Germany]] and the northern [[Czech Republic]], it overlaps with the [[Lengyel culture|Lengyel]]  horizon to the south, and the [[Rössen culture]] to the west.

[[Image:European-late-neolithic-english.svg|thumb|350px|Map of late European Neolithic showing the survival of STK.]]

==Description==
The STbK and the [[Notenkopfkeramik]] are a development of the LBK. Much of the Musical Note pottery features incised zig-zag bands going around the pot, with punctures at the line segment junctions. The STK abandons incision in favor bands of small punctures, also in zig-zag patterns, with a vertical band dividing each angle. The effect is a band pattern of contiguous A-frames.

Where the Musical Note pottery expanded east over the [[Bug River]], the STK moved down the [[Vistula]] and [[Elbe]]. The spread of this style must have been basically the transmission of cultural objects.
The homes of the STK people show a slight modification that became a major feature of later cultures: one end of the long house was made shorter than the other to achieve a trapezoidal shape. The reason for this modification remains obscure. Also, the STK people developed a preference for cremation rather than burial. The preceding early LBK had used both methods.

==Gosek circle==
An unusual structure associated with STK has been found at [[Goseck circle|Gosek]], south of Berlin: a large, double concentric ring of post holes pierced by gates and surrounded by a [[circular ditch]]. The placement of the gates and some of the posts lead some investigators to hypothesize an observatory similar to Stonehenge, but in wood rather than stone; i.e., the posts mark some positions of celestial bodies.

'''Take Back Parliament - Lebanon ''' ({{lang-ar|إسترجعوا البرلمان}}), (TBP - Lebanon) is a political movement launched by several Lebanese activists who met through various social organizations and civil initiatives. Social media has played a significant role in helping to expand the group. The grassroots campaign was created as an alternative to the gridlock between the two existing political alliances in Lebanon, the [[March 8 Alliance]] and [[March 14 Alliance]]. The group members crowd-sourced to build an [[#Agenda|electoral platform]] which is the ideal political agenda they would like to see candidates represent. The political agenda calls for a democratic secular nonsectarian government, bringing social justice awareness, and an eventual end to corruption.

== Values ==
- '''Practice that reflects Principles''': TBP strives to reflect its values in its internal organizing. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Zero Budget''': TBP did not hire any staff; the endeavor is completely dependent on volunteers. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Transparency''': TBP only asks for donations to pay necessary fees and bills and has pledged to make its accounts and spendings transparent. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Direct Democracy''': TBP promotes direct democracy as its internal way of organizing and as a viable democratic system for Lebanon. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Accountability''': The campaign is built on open, honest, and friendly accountability mechanisms of individuals, groups, and decisions within the group.&lt;br&gt;
- '''Grassroots Organizing''': TBP members believe in a bottom-up approach to political change in Lebanon. They did not seek mainstream media campaigns and have announced knocking on doors and taking the time to speak to people individually.&lt;br&gt;
- '''Faith in the Impossible''': TBP members admit that their project might seem impossible but say that they have trust in the power of the people.

== Agenda ==
TBP was created to challenge what it calls the total inefficiency of the current and previous Lebanese parliaments and their disconnect from the daily lives of citizens. TBP members crowd-sourced and contacted various experts and NGOs to build agenda papers regarding the following issues:

[[File:Analemma fishburn.tif|right|thumb|An [[analemma]] illustrates the changing [[position of the Sun]] over the course of a year, as viewed from a fixed [[standard time|time of day]].]]

A '''year''' is the [[orbital period]] of the [[Earth]] moving in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]]. The current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

In [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.

A [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.

In astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.) Reprinted from: {{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf |title=The IAU Style Manual |year=1989 |journal=IAU Transactions |volume=XXB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''year'' is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [[seasonal year]], the [[fiscal year]], the [[academic year]], etc. Similarly, ''year'' can mean the orbital period of any [[planet]]; for example, a [[Martian year]] and a [[Venus|Venusian year]] are examples of the time  a planet takes to    transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "year", entry 2.b.: "''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
English ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''ġēar'' ({{IPA|/jɛar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''ġēr'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*jǣran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#ē₁ and ē₂|ē₁]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ran&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
Cognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''jār'', [[Old Norse]] ''ár'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:𐌾𐌴𐍂|jer]]'',&lt;!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--&gt; from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh₁-|*yeh₁r-om]]}}'' "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''yārǝ'' "year", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὥρα}} (hṓra) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[[hour]]"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jarŭ'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' "of this year". &lt;!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁ey-]] "go", needs reference to deal with the "laryingealistic" problems--&gt;

Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''annī'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''annō'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h₂et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''aþn'' "year" (only the dative plural ''aþnam'' is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh₁r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh₁-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh₁-ro-'' and ''*h₂et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", ''*h₁ey-'' and ''*h₂et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''éti'' "goes", ''atasi'' "thou goest, wanderest").
A number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means "each year", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", {{lang|grc|ἔτος}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' "old", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' "year", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' "year" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' "bull calf",  English ''wether'' "ram" (Old English ''weðer'', Gothic ''wiþrus'' "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:年|年]] "year", originally [[:wikt:秂|秂]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/godъ|godŭ]]'' "time period; year" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lěto|lěto]]'' "summer; year".

In the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.

== Intercalation ==
No astronomical year has an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.

=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name "[[Leap Day]]" is applied to the added day.

The [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, 
has 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;).
In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Miriam Nancy. (1924). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924PA.....32..407S "The New Calendar of the Eastern Churches], ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 32, p.407. Courtesy NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gregorian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the [[northward equinox]] to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [[tropical year|northward equinox year]], or [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziggelaar, A. (1983). [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The Papal Bull of 1582 Promulgating a Reform of the Calendar"].

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.

===Other calendars===
{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}
Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.
Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).

A modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

==Year numbering==
A [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.

The worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]] era (but the label [[Common Era]] is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P. K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly state Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does state on page 585 the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes; the Gregorian calendar is used with the Anno Domini era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] "in the year of the Lord"), or alternatively CE for "[[Common Era]]. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].
Year numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no "year zero".
In the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], −1 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.

==Pragmatic divisions==
Financial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.

=== Fiscal year ===
A [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.

=== Academic year ===
An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].

Some schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

== Astronomical years == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] --&gt;

=== Julian year ===
{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}
The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit "year" (symbol "a" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].

In the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.

:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]

The [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.

=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===
{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}

Each of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.

The [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service. (2010).[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [[ecliptic longitude]] of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). Calendars. In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann (Eds.), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.). Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books. p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#longitude-ecliptic longitude, ecliptic]" and "[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#dynamical-equinox dynamical equinox]". (2018). In "Glossary", ''The Astronomical Almanac Online''. United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt; the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is {{val|365.259636}} days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Draconic year ===
The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is
:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Full moon cycle ===
The [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:
:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Lunar year ===
The [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].
A Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.

=== Vague year ===
The vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

=== Heliacal year ===
A heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Sothic year ===
The [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

=== Gaussian year ===
The [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:
:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).

=== Besselian year === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] --&gt;
The [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):&lt;ref&gt;

The TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].&lt;!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' --&gt;

=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.
* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].

An average Gregorian year is 365.2425 [[day]]s (52.1775 [[week]]s, {{val|8765.82}} [[hour]]s, {{val|525949.2}} [[minute]]s or {{val|31556952}} [[second]]s).  For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ({{val|8760}} hours, {{val|525600}} minutes or {{val|31536000}} seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ({{val|8784}} hours, {{val|527040}} minutes or {{val|31622400}} seconds).  The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has {{val|146097}} days and hence exactly {{val|20871}} weeks.

== "Greater" astronomical years ==

=== Equinoctial cycle ===
The Great Year, or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.

=== Galactic year ===
The [[Galactic year]] is the time it takes Earth's [[solar system]] to revolve once around the [[galactic center]]. It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years.&lt;ref&gt;

== Seasonal year ==
{{Further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [[month]] from year to year.

== Symbols ==
In the [[ISO 80000-3|International System of Quantities]] the symbol for the year as a [[unit of time]] is ''[[a (year)|a]]'', taken from the Latin word ''annus''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;

:''a'', without a qualifier = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;;
:and, ''ar'' for ''[[Hectare#Are|are]]'', is a unit of area.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] have jointly recommended defining the annus, with symbol ''a'', as the length of the tropical year in the year 2000:
:''a'' = {{val|31556925.445}} seconds (approximately {{val|365.24219265}} [[ephemeris day]]s)

This differs from the above definition of 365.25 days by about 20 [[parts per million]]. The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year "bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth’s orbital movement", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norman E.

The notation has proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use ''a'' specifically for ''years ago'', and ''y'' or ''yr'' for a one-year time period.&lt;ref name="Biever-war"/&gt;

==== SI prefix multipliers ====

For the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as ''kilannus'', ''megannus'', etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.
* {{Anchor|Kiloannus|Kiloannum}} '''''ka''''' (for kiloannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[thousand]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E3 yr, also known as a [[millennium]] in [[anthropology]] and calendar uses. The prefix multiplier "ka" is typically used in geology, paleontology, and [[archaeology]] for the [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[period (geology)|periods]], where a non−[[radiocarbon dating]] technique: e.g. [[ice core]] dating, [[dendrochronology]], [[uranium-thorium dating]], or [[varve]] analysis; is used as the primary dating method for age determination. If age is primarily determined by [[radiocarbon dating]], then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [[Before Present]].
* {{Anchor|Megaannus|Megaannum}} '''''Ma''''' (for megaannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[million]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E6 yr. The suffix "Ma" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[celestial mechanics]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term "ago" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that "ago" is implied; the alternative unit "mya" does include "ago" explicitly. It also written as "million years" (ago) in works for general public use. In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author.
* {{Anchor|Gigaannus|Gigaannum}} '''''Ga''''' (for gigaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years. "Ga" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and geology to signify extremely long time periods in the past. For example, [[history of the earth|the formation of the Earth]] occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago.
* {{Anchor|Teraannus|Teraannum}} '''''Ta''''' (for teraannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] years. "Ta" is an extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the [[age of the universe]]. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small [[red dwarf]].
* {{Anchor|Petaannus|Petaannum}} '''''Pa''''' (for petaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[10^15|quadrillion]] years. The half-life of the nuclide [[cadmium|cadmium-113]] is about 8 Pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = P.

* {{Anchor|Exaannus|Exaannum}} '''''Ea''''' (for exaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[quintillion]] years.

===Abbreviations yr and ya===
{{anchor|years ago}}{{anchor|kya}}{{anchor|Mya}}
{{further|Before Present}}

In [[astronomy]], geology, and paleontology, the abbreviation ''yr'' for ''years'' and ''ya'' for '''''years ago''''' are sometimes used, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASC"&gt;

 |quote=(c) Convention and abbreviations. – The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; years), Mega-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years), and Giga-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English "[[:wikt:year|year]]", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "22,000 years ago" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] ("BP") date.

These abbreviations include:

Use of ''mya'' and ''bya'' is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being ''Ma'' and ''Ga'' for dates [[Before Present]], but "m.y." for the duration of epochs.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strat" /&gt; This ''ad hoc'' distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Society of America|title=Time Units|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|accessdate=February 17, 2010| archivedate=June 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616100504/http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that on graphs, using ''ya'' units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the ''ya'' units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
