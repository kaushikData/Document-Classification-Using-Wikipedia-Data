{{History of Morocco}}
In the '''1990s in Morocco''' gradual political reforms culminated in the constitutional reform of 1996, which created a new bicameral legislature with expanded, although still limited, powers. Although reportedly marred by irregularities, elections for the Chamber of Representatives were held in 1997. With the death of [[King of Morocco|King]] [[Hassan II of Morocco]] in 1999, the more [[Liberalism|liberal]]-minded Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, who assumed the title of [[Mohammed VI]], took the throne. He has since enacted successive reforms to modernize Morocco, and the country has seen a marked improvement in its [[human rights]] record. One of the new king's first acts was to free some 8,000 political prisoners and reduce the sentences of another 30,000. He also established a commission to compensate families of missing political activists and others subjected to arbitrary detention.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Morocco.pdf Morocco profile] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning the final decade of his notoriously conservative rule, [[King Hassan II]] continued the pattern of oppressing political opposition. Systematically jailing and silencing his opponents through state run forces, many of which were kept at the secret political prison [[Tazmamart]] for often indefinite and undetermined lengths of time, Hassan was not opposed to extreme measures to enforce his rule.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1991, January 1). Human Rights Watch World Report 1990 - Morocco. Retrieved November 22, 2018, from http://www.refworld.org/docid/467fca3d1e.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite efforts to hide the abuses from the outside world, King Hassan continued to receive backlash from International watch groups and human rights advocacy organizations in which his methods were put into the spotlight unnerving him and creating the need for action to be taken. In [[1990]] Hassan met with representatives from the human rights advocacy group [[Amnesty International]] in what was initially believed to be a step towards reforms in Moroccan policy. However hopes of a freer Morocco were dashed after Amnesty International published a report on Morocco alleging human rights abuses performed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;£MOROCCO @A PATTERN OF POLITICAL IMPRISONMENT, "DISAPPEARANCES" AND TORTURE. (1991). Amnesty International, 1-63. Retrieved November 22, 2018, from https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/196000/mde290011991en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that year Hassan continued his crackdown on political opposition to the state with the prosecution of members of the Islamic group Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane, a largely peaceful Islamic group which pushes for the Islamisation of society through education and awareness rather than violence. Accusing members of belonging to and attempting to advertise for the unsanctioned association, roughly 40 members of Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane were charged leading to at least 30 convictions. Some of which due to appeals and efforts by the defense were either overturned or had sentences commuted. The trials themselves were marred by accusations of corruption as reports of judicial malpractice arose. Accounts of enforcement officers violating procedures in regard to what constitutes lawful and unlawful searches as well as the falsification of official documents called into question the legitimacy of these arrests and the independence of the Moroccan judiciary as a whole. 

Upon discovery of the use of torture as a method of interrogation by state officials, there arose new ammunition for advocacy groups aiming to overturn convictions as well as pressure the government into enacting more protections of civil rights for the Moroccan people. Questions as to the reliability of confessions provided a basis for appeals to courts and were covered by the media, however due to governmental influence courts largely turned a blind eye to any reported case of torture.

In response to the negative media coverage plaguing the regime, Moroccan courts began targeting media outlets more severely with charges of defamation against state run organizations. Convictions for the "defamation of the courts and tribunals" followed swiftly as several high profile media figures faced imprisonment including the director of "Al-Ittihad al-Ishtiraki", the publication of the main opposition party at the time, Ahmed Bendjelloun of "at-Tariq" as well as Mustaphe el-Alaoui, director of "al-Usbu' as-Sahafa w'as-Siyasi". All three faced several months in jails due to stories published in which the ability and independence of the courts were brought into question. While the sentences were short, four months for Benjelloun and three months for el-Alaoui, the message that was conveyed to the governments opposition was clear, any attempts to deviate from the message approved by Hassan would not be welcome in Morocco.

Shortly after the attack on the press, the Moroccan government found itself at war with once again with international human rights watch dogs. Amnesty International, the organization that had previously sent representatives to meet with Hassan, had its legitimacy as an organization attacked by defenders of the regime. Claims that the human rights group misrepresented facts in its reporting of the conditions of prisoners and political oppression arose and were widely circulated among the Moroccan people leading to support for the regime. The skewed information made it easier for  the  regime to deny entry to and expel those who disagreed with their practices, such as representatives from the French group the "Association for victims of Repression in Exile". In 1990 two members were expelled from Moroccan soil on accusations of intending to violate their travel visas. The same representatives had previously been harassed by Moroccan officials on a separate trip. In this incident the representative had her items seized and searched by security officials, confiscating all evidence of human rights abuses from her luggage as well as intimidating her in the process. 

Despite past actions, in an attempt to rectify his public image King Hassan formed a new task force to assess the validity of the accusations made by watchdog groups. The so-called "Consultative Council on Human Rights" was used more as tool of the regime to tell the world that conditions for political prisoners in Morocco was not as the many international watch dog groups had reported. However Hassan did begin a process of releasing prisoners due to mounting pressure from international organizations and foreign governments, with over three hundred released in 1991 alone.&lt;ref&gt;HUMAN RIGHTS IN MOROCCO. (1995). Human Rights Watch, 7(6). Retrieved November 22, 2018, from https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/MOROCCO95O.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1worldspace''', known for most of its existence simply as 'WorldSpace', is a defunct [[satellite radio]] network that in its heyday provided service to over 170,000 subscribers in [[East Africa|eastern]] and southern Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia with 96% coming from [[India]]. It was profitable in India, with 450,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forbesindia.com/article/special/5-things-that-disappeared-in-the-last-five-years/37838/1 |title=5 Things That Disappeared in the Last Five Years |work=[[Forbes India]] |first=Kathakali |last=Chanda |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timbre Media along with Saregama India planned to relaunch the company.&lt;ref name=itsback&gt;{{cite news |title=WorldSpace radio is back |date=July 19, 2011 |first=N. S. |last=Ramnath |work=[[Forbes India]] |url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/features/worldspace-radio-is-back_566645.html |accessdate=October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellites AfriStar and AsiaStar however are now being used by the [http://www.yazmi.com/ Yazmi USA, LLC] run by WorldSpace's former CEO [[Noah A. Samara]]. The company claims to have built the first satellite-to-tablet content delivery system. The system primarily aims at providing educational services to rural areas in developing countries. The first pilots of the technology are said to be taking place in India (with 30,000 licenses) and the sub-Saharan region in Africa, with the latest trials in two schools in South Africa, in Rietkol, in Mpumalanga Province, and at Heathfield, in Western Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newtec.eu/article/release/world-s-first-satellite-powered-tablet-to-use-newtec-technology-for-e-learning |title=World's First Satellite-Powered Tablet to Use Newtec Technology for E-Learning |work=newtec.eu |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The company, founded in 1990 has its headquarters in [[Silver Spring, MD]] and additional studios were located in Washington, DC, [[Bangalore]], [[Mumbai]], [[New Delhi]], and [[Nairobi]].  In 1991 Noah Samara, working with Thomas van der Heyden - founder of what was then International Telecommunications Inc. (ITI), later in 1997 to become the geostationary satellite division of Orbital Sciences, prepared and filed for the world's first Radio Broadcast Satellite with the US FCC.  In 1992, Samara and van der Heyden (at the time representing the Republic of Indonesia) were able, at WARC-92 with the support of many African and Asian countries, to have the ITU establish a new radio frequency spectrum band dedicated to Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) in the L-band - 1,452&amp;nbsp;MHz - 1,492&amp;nbsp;MHz.  After WARC-92 Samara went on to build WorldSpace and van der Heyden to build IndoVison and the Indostar S-band Direct Broadcast Satellite satellite program for Indonesia.

Before filing for bankruptcy in October 2008, 1worldspace employed two satellites and broadcast 62 channels – 38 of which were content provided by international, national and regional third parties and 24 1worldspace-branded stations produced by or for 1worldspace.&lt;ref name="1worldspace.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1worldspace.com/corporate/ |title=Company Overview |work=1worldspace |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822191714/http://www.1worldspace.com/corporate/ |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the channels used to be available only through a subscription plan.

1worldspace claimed to be the only company with rights to the world's globally allocated spectrum for digital satellite radio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, it never made use of its license to broadcast to the Americas or the Caribbean. The company gained attention around 2000 because of its willingness to invest in impoverished areas and from 2006 to the present due to its financial difficulties and bankruptcy proceedings.

The company filed for bankruptcy in October 2008. For a while [[Liberty Media]] sought to buy the assets,  but in June 2010, a company called [[Yazmi USA]] owned by former WorldSpace founder, chairman, and CEO Noah Samara purchased the remains for US$5.5M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qtvGXToh?url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1856716 |url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1856716 |archivedate=July 1, 2010 |title=FMQB In Brief |accessdate=1 July 2010 |date=28 June 2010 |publisher=[[FMQB]] |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European operations were liquidated in the spring of 2009.

On December 25, 2009, the company issued notices to all of its subscribers in India that WorldSpace service in India would officially be terminated from December 31, 2009, with no refunds given to its subscribers, on account of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldspace.com/index_wsmsg.html |title=Home |work=worldspace.com |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was known as "AfriSpace" until 1992 when it changed its name to "WorldSpace" until July 2008.

On July 18, 2011, [[Forbes]] India reported that Timbre Media was re-launching WorldSpace Radio in association with [[Sa Re Ga Ma]] in September 2011, although it would only be streamed through mobile phones, the Internet and direct-to-home television networks. Reportedly, old WorldSpace receivers would no longer work. The re-launch would start with 40 stations and eventually have as many as 120 stations, including sub-categories such as music for cardio-workouts.&lt;ref name=itsback/&gt;

==Content==
1worldspace assembled a combination of news, sports, music, brand name content and educational programming which it delivered to its market in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The 62 channels (38 of which were third-party content and 24 of which were produced by or for 1worldspace) represented popular international music formats including contemporary hits, country, classic rock and jazz&lt;ref name="1worldspace.com"/&gt; with content specific to the local geographic region.  Sports coverage included content from [[Fox Sports Radio]] and [[talkSPORT]] in addition to regional coverage. 1worldspace also broadcast news from well-renowned sources such as [[BBC World Service|BBC]], [[CNBC]], [[CNN]], [[NPR]], [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]], and [[WRN Broadcast|WRN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/news/ |title=Channels: News |work=1worldspace |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205055125/http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/news/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional content included channels that highlighted poetry and literature, comedy, talk shows, and inspirational and religious programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/talk_and_entertainment/ |title=Channel Guide: Talk and Entertainment |work=1worldspace |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060010/http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/talk_and_entertainment/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/inspirational/ |title=Channel Guide: Inspirational |work=1worldspace |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060515/http://www.1worldspace.com/channel_guide/inspirational/ |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1worldspace's program directors and announcers operated from studios in Washington, DC, Bangalore, and Nairobi, where 18 original music and lifestyle channels were created for distribution. Four of these stations were previously available in the United States on the [[XM Satellite Radio]] network.  This arrangement ended in 2008.

==System==
The 1worldspace system had three major components: the space segment, the ground segment, and the user segment. The space segment referred to the company-owned satellites that broadcast the signals over a large percentage  of the eastern hemisphere.  The ground segment referred to the operating and broadcasting centers.  The user segment referred to the user-owned devices in which the signal was received.  In addition, the company planned to implement terrestrial repeater networks in order to facilitate access to new markets in Europe and the Middle-East.

The 1worldspace system was built with companies including [[Alcatel Space]] (now [[Thales Alenia Space]]), [[EADS Astrium]] and [[Arianespace]] (France), [[SED Systems|SED]] (Canada), GSI (USA), [[Fraunhofer Institute]] (Germany), [[ST Microelectronics]] (Italy), Micronas (Germany) and others.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315054/000119312508071173/d10k.htm |title=Form 10-K |work=Sec.gov |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920175949/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315054/000119312508071173/d10k.htm |archivedate=September 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space segment===

1worldspace operated two satellites: [[AfriStar]] and [[AsiaStar]]. This made it available in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and parts of Europe.

===[[Ground segment]]===
The regional [[Mission control center|operations centers]] for the satellites were located in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] for AfriStar and [[Melbourne, Australia]] for AsiaStar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  These centers managed the performance and status of the satellites by controlling them and monitoring there. The system architecture is identical for each region.

Telemetry, command and ranging (TCR) [[ground station]]s consisted of an [[X-Band]] uplink command and control system and an [[L-Band]] telemetry monitoring system. A backup mode was also provided using an S Band link from Bangalore, India. Each satellite had two TCR stations with sufficient geographic distance between them so that if natural disasters or any unforeseen events were to make one inoperable, a back-up station would be available. The TCR stations for AfriStar were located in [[Bangalore, India]] and [[Port Louis, Mauritius]], and the ones for AsiaStar in Melbourne, Australia and Port Louis, Mauritius.

In addition to the TCR stations, a communications system monitoring station (CSM) was associated with each satellite to monitor continuously the quality of the downlink services. The CSM facilities were located in [[Libreville, Gabon]] for AfriStar and Melbourne, Australia for AsiaStar.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

===User segment===
Users purchased receivers compatible with the [[L-Band]] frequency in order to access the system. The radio receiver processed, decoded and descrambled the signals to allow users to receive programming content. The company’s broadcast frequency and satellites required a special receiver design incorporating either a small patch antenna measuring approximately 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4 to 3.2&amp;nbsp;inches) which folded neatly into the receiver unit or a similarly sized omni-directional antenna mounted on the car rooftop.  Each receiver was individually addressable via a unique identifier that could be used to unlock specially coded audio or multimedia signals. This capability provided the flexibility to deliver free, subscription and/or premium services to consumers.

The currently available receivers were manually coded for subscription authorization. A password, valid for varying periods of time depending upon the length of the subscription purchased and paid for, is provided to a subscriber and entered into the receiver. Passwords were re-validated on a quarterly basis. Upon subscription renewal, a new passcode was provided and similarly entered into the receiver. As new receiver products were introduced, there were plans to provide over-the-air activation of subscriptions.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

The radio sets, or receivers, which could pick up 1worldspace signals were manufactured by South Korea's AMI, India's [[BPL Group|BPL]] and China’s Tongshi, among other corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldspace.com/howitworks/receivers/receiverfaq/index.html |title=Receiver FAQ |work=worldspace.com |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discontinued models were manufactured by [[JVC]], [[Sanyo]], [[Hitachi]], and [[Panasonic]]. The radios consisted of a satellite receiver plus an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] that has to be placed in clear view of the relevant satellite, and properly oriented to the user's geographic [[azimuth]] and elevation.  A new receiver manufactured by Delphi using [[open standard]] [[ETSI Satellite Digital Radio]] technology would have been used in Europe if the company had entered the car satellite radio receiver marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.worldspace.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=189783&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1119610&amp;highlight= |title=Investor |work=worldspace.com |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216124246/http://investor.worldspace.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=189783&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1119610&amp;highlight= |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt===
1worldspace finally became insolvent in 2009/10 after a prolonged series of financial crises. In the first quarter of 2008 the company lost a net total of 2676 subscribers and reported that it would scale back its marketing activities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200805181172/worldspace-concerned-at-lack-of-cash.html |title=WorldSpace ‘concerned’ at lack of cash |work=Rapid TV News |date=June 28, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628192443/http://rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200805181172/worldspace-concerned-at-lack-of-cash.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WorldSpace recorded a $36.0 million net loss in the second quarter of 2008, as compared to a net loss of $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/1worldspace-reports-second-quarter-2008/story.aspx?guid%3D%7BE9C8D9DE-19A5-4496-8673-19C4E38F34AD%7D%26dist%3Dhppr |title=1worldspace-reports-second-quarter |work=Marketwatch.com |accessdate=August 22, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2008 and 2009 company was in deep debt and was reported to owe its creditors over $50 million, due to be paid by various repeatedly postponed deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200807281780/what-assets-does-worldspace-now-own.html |title=What assets does Worldspace now own? |work=Rapid TV News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924141737/http://rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200807281780/what-assets-does-worldspace-now-own.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
The company filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection on Friday, October 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ae8qD.ZAhts8 |title=WorldSpace, Inc.

The company's wholly owned India affiliate was not covered by the bankruptcy filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] |volume=169 |date=October 27, 2008 |title=WorldSpace Bankruptcy |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-profile resignations===
In August 2008, two of the top executives of 1worldspace announced their resignations. Greg Armstrong, co-COO, left effective on August 1 and Alexander Brown, co-COO, has given notice of his intention to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200808101867/two-worldspace-top-execs-bail-out.html |title=Two Worldspace top execs bail out |work=RapidTVNews |first=Chris |last=Forrester |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723001608/http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200808101867/two-worldspace-top-execs-bail-out.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotional information==
WorldSpace audio advertisements in 2006 highlighted the company's ability to provide communication and data-transmission services to remote areas of the world, particularly in a disaster-relief context. The promotions also mentioned WorldSpace's facilitation of long-distance educational projects in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The ads, broadcast on Washington D.C. radio stations, appeared aimed at government procurement officials and possibly NGOs.

WorldSpace named noted Indian composer [[A.R. Rahman]] as its brand ambassador in India where 90% of its customers are located, and unveiled an integrated marketing communication campaign across print and visual media featuring an exclusive signature tune composed by Mr. Rahman.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In a last-ditch but ultimately completely unsuccessful effort to avoid commercial insolvency in July 2008, WorldSpace changed its brand and corporate identity to 1worldspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/617050 |title=WORLDSPACE, with the Creative Support of PIR Marketing, Unveils "1worldspace" as New Corporate Identity and Brand and Launches Re-Designed Company Website |work=Web 2.0 Journal |first=Adrian |last=Bridgwater |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
'''WorldSpace Foundation''' was a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt organization created in 1997 with the aim of improving literacy in Africa, and providing content through satellite to smaller community radio stations in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediarights.org/organization/worldspace_foundation |title=WorldSpace Foundation |work=MediaRights Organizations Database |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102525/http://www.mediarights.org/organization/worldspace_foundation |archivedate=February 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WorldSpace Foundation has changed its name to '''First Voice International'''.

First Voice International was a non-profit organization that tried to ensure that people living in poverty and remote places get the information they need to improve their lives, have the means to communicate their needs and wants, are able to share what they know with others – in their own voice. The organization attempted to reach the most people for the least cost by combining satellite and other technologies. By bypassing the isolating effects of illiteracy and remoteness, the organization routinely delivers information to people in areas lacking electricity, telephone or Internet service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstvoiceint.org/ |title=First Voice Africa |work=Firstvoiceint.org |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic plans for service development==
Since uninterrupted line of sight reception may be difficult in the urban areas, a need was identified to install terrestrial repeating transmitters to rebroadcast the satellite signals in the largest metropolitan areas of intended mobile [[Digital Audio Radio Service|DARS]] markets. The company had been licensed to build networks of terrestrial repeaters in Italy, Switzerland and Germany.  With this addition, the system could have provided more reliable broadcast services to receivers in automobiles.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; 1worldspace had planned to start providing mobile radio and data services in Italy using a combination of satellite and terrestrial broadcasts in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldspace-europe.com/en/overview.php |title=WorldSpace Europe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606121848/http://www.worldspace-europe.com/en/overview.php |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had signed an agreement with [[Fiat]], an Italian automobile manufacturer, to make radios capable of receiving the signals available to car owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/index.php?method=news&amp;action=zoom&amp;id=2007071820361698504c8759ec19c8fe9e69c70f481586&amp;id_subsection= |title=unknown |work=Fiat Group Automobiles Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235758/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/index.php?method=news&amp;action=zoom&amp;id=2007071820361698504c8759ec19c8fe9e69c70f481586&amp;id_subsection= |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiat plans to make such radios available as a bookable option made prior to purchasing a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/07/19/afx3929656.html |work=Forbes |title=Fiat, Worldspace in satellite radio deal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628132700/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/07/19/afx3929656.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the service had been launched and had been a commercial success in Italy, it was then planned to make similar services available in Germany and Switzerland. 1worldspace would have used [[ETSI Satellite Digital Radio]] (SDR) [[open standard]] in the new European coverage beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1worldspace.com/press/01_04_2006.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The receivers for the new markets would have been manufactured by [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] and would have delivered a gap-free coverage to vehicles similar to that of [[Sirius XM Radio]] vehicular mobile service.

[[File:Svätýroh.jpg|thumb|A Slovak Bible and cross]]
==The Camaldolese Bible, 1756==
The first vernacular Bibles to enter into use in Slovakia were in Czech, which came to be used among Slovak Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Eva |last1=Frimmová |chapter=Renaissance and humanist tendencies in Slovakia |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrC1HFgjJxsC&amp;pg=PA54 |pages=54–70 |editor1-first=Mikuláš |editor1-last=Teich |editor-link1=Mikuláš Teich |editor2-first=Dušan |editor2-last=Kováč |editor3-first=Martin D. |editor3-last=Brown |year=2011 |title=Slovakia in History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-49494-6 |quote=The Czech Bible was soon being used among Slovak Protestants, and its language, called Biblical Czech or Slovakised Czech, was used in the Protestant liturgy until the 1980s.

A more modern Slovak version was produced by the Lutheran pastor [[Jozef Roháček]] in 1936.

In 2008 the Slovak Bible Society published two versions of the Slovak Ecumenical Translation (with and without the [[deuterocanonical books]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sme.sk/c/3630281/vysiel-preklad-biblie-na-ktorom-sa-pracovalo-19-rokov.html |title=Vyšiel preklad Biblie, na ktorom sa pracovalo 19 rokov |trans-title=A Bible translation has come out that was worked on for 19 years |date=December 10, 2007 |work=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Count of Vannes''' was the title held by the rulers of the '''County of Vannes'''.

==History==
===Gwened===
{{see also|Bro Gwened}}
[[Bretons]] held the hinterland around [[Vannes]] ({{lang-br|Gwened}}) as early as [[Waroch I|Waroch]] (''{{lang|br|Gwereg I}}'') in the early 6th century. He and his successors established a [[Bro Gwened|petty kingdom]] in the area. His son [[Canao I|Canao]] began killing his brothers rather than divide the patrimony, but his brother [[Macliau]], the [[bishop of Vannes|bishop of Gwened]], not only escaped but successfully annexed neighboring [[Cornouaille]] from an [[Tewdwr Mawr|underage ruler]] who had been left in his care. [[St Judicaël]] successfully unified the Breton states in the early 7th century, but they split once again and were not reunified until [[Nominoë]] in the 9th century.

===Brittany===
{{hatnote|See also: [[Kingdom of Brittany|Kingdom]] and [[Duchy of Brittany]].}}
[[Nominoë]] (''{{lang|br|Nevenoe}}'') was certainly titled count of Vannes, appearing as such on two charters. It is uncertain when he was raised to the office, however: it may have been as early as 819 or as late as 834. His son and successor [[Erispoë]] seems to have used the area as a similar base but, after his assassination by his cousin [[Salomon, King of Brittany|Salomon]] (''{{lang|br|Salaün}}''), the county went to a [[Ridoredh]]. A prominent landowner in the area, he was succeeded by his elder son [[Pascweten]] and his younger son [[Alan I, King of Brittany|Alan]] eventually rose to become [[King of Brittany]]. Upon Alan's death, Brittany was overrun by [[Viking invasions of Brittany|several Viking raiding parties]]. The Countship of Vannes was interrupted from either 907 or 919 to approximately 937 when [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany|Alan the Fox]] returned to Brittany. Alan the Fox had been in exile in [[Saxon England|England]]. Defeating the Vikings at the 939 [[Battle of Trans-la-Forêt]], he reasserted himself both as Count of Vannes and [[Duke of Brittany]]. At this point, the title was effectively merged with that of the [[Duke of Brittany]]. After the death of the childless [[Drogo, Duke of Brittany|Drogo]], the [[count of Rennes|Counts of Rennes]] ceased to use the title. It was effectively merged to the [[crown of France]] and thus extinguished under the [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]].

'''Czechs''' are a historically significant and traditional migrant group within [[Austria]]. As of 2016, there were 40,324 self-identified Czechs in Austria. The [[History of the Czechs in Vienna|only significant community of Austrian Czechs today]] is in [[Vienna]], the capital city, where they have had a significant presence since the 19th century.

==History==
In the 19th century, the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech and Slovak]] region went through an economic depression, causing many unemployed ethnic Czechs and [[Slovaks in Austria|Slovak]]  menial workers to migrate to Vienna and the Americas.

From the 1880s the 1890s, around 230,000 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] emigrated to Austria proper, mainly for construction work and other menial labor jobs in the larger cities, particularly [[Vienna]]. After the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], 150,000 people returned to Czechoslovakia after its independence. Of the more than 300,000 Czechs in the country, the population diminished to around 10,000 by 1991.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/eslovac/an/i1/i1.html|title=SLOVAK IN AUSTRIA|website=Uoc.edu|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In recent years,{{When|date=January 2018}} several dozen thousand Czech citizens have emigrated from [[Czech Republic]], mainly due to the open borders that have been made possible by the [[European Union]]. The Czech population has increased by as much as 4 times as of 2016.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"/&gt;

'''Raashaun Casey''' (born September 3, 1977) is an American [[disc jockey]] (DJ) better known by his professional name '''DJ Envy'''.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p490143|pure_url=yes}} DJ Envy at allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Baker, Al (May 13, 2006) [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/nyregion/13arrest.html?_r=0 D.J.

==Career==
{{advert|date=April 2016}}
A native of [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], DJ Envy was tutored by neighborhood acquaintance [[DJ Clue?]],&lt;ref name="xxlmag"&gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=12480 DJ Envy Return of the Hustle]. Xxlmag.com (July 27, 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20071201120543/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=12480 Archived version] dated December 1, 2007, accessed via Internet Archive on October 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced him to the mixtape circuit in the mid-1990s.  He quickly climbed up the ranks, and by the early 2000 he was peddling the latest commercials and exclusives for big-name rappers like [[Jay-Z]], [[50 Cent]] and [[The L.O.X.]]. Since his reputation was so esteemed, DJ Clue signed him to their affiliate label [[Desert Storm Records]]. In 2003, he released his commercial debut album entitled ''[[The Desert Storm Mixtape: Blok Party, Vol. 1]]''.

Envy's big break on the radio came when he mixed once a month for [[WQHT|Hot 97]]'s show called "Takin' it to the Streets", hosted by [[Angie Martinez]] from 12:00 am to 4:00 am, but later filled in when [[Angie Martinez]] got pregnant.&lt;ref name="sohh"/&gt; He then co-hosted [[WQHT|Hot 97]]'s morning show with [[Miss Jones (radio personality)|Miss Jones]] from 6 am-10 am daily. His run on the morning show ended in July 2008 when Miss Jones moved to Philadelphia. Envy spun on his own mixshows on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] called "The People's Mix" on Saturdays from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm and "The People's Choice Hit List" on Sundays 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm.  He had a segment on Hot 97 titled "New at 2", where he played the newest hits from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm. He hosts [[Hip-Hop Nation]]'s afternoon show on [[Sirius XM Radio]] on weekdays 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm EST and on weekends he used to do a show from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm on [[WWPR-FM|Power 105]].

On Monday December 6, 2010, DJ Envy, [[Angela Yee]] and [[Charlamagne Tha God]] began hosting the morning show on Power 105 as [[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]. In September 2016, he voiced support for [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|stop-and-frisk]], and later apologized after constant criticism.&lt;ref name="bet"&gt;[http://www.bet.com/music/2016/09/27/dj-envy-supports-stop---frisk--twitter-bites-back.html DJ Envy Supports Stop and Frisk, Twitter Bites Back]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ&gt;[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/09/dj_envy_stop_and_frisk_shooting_nj.html DJ Envy, stop-and-frisk supporter, says he was recently shot at in N.J]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Complex&gt;DJ Envy Is Catching Hell for Defending Unconstitutional Stop and Frisk Policing [http://www.complex.com/music/2016/09/dj-envy-catching-hell-twitter-stop-frisk-comments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vibe.com&gt;[http://www.vibe.com/2016/09/dj-envy-condemns-stop-and-frisk-after-conversation-with-john-legend DJ Envy Condemns Stop-And-Frisk After Conversation With John Legend]&lt;/ref&gt;

Envy has made appearances on Juelz Santana's and [[Lloyd Banks]]'s music video "Beamer Benz Or Bentley" and various television shows, such as ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', and ''Tha Corner'', which he hosts on the [[Music Choice]] channel.&lt;ref name="sohh"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107151506/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/12665 DJ Envy's 5 DJ Commandments].

IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in The Raw Report of [[Gucci Mane]] documentary.

On March 21, 2010, DJ Envy took over as VJ of [[MTV2]]'s [[Sucker Free]] Countdown.

He recently released a record entitled "Still A Fan" featuring recording artist, songwriter, producer "Rico Love". Which leads many to believe he may be planning a new mixtape or album in the future. He and his wife Gia Casey host a podcast called "The Casey Crew" that talks about the good, bad, ugly, and beauty of relationships and family.

The '''flag of [[Bornholm]]''' emerged in the mid-1970s after a design by local painter [[Bent Kaas]], and is used to some extent. Mainly as a souvenir bought by tourists, military units while on exercise in Denmark and on foreign missions, and by mainly German sailors visiting Bornholm. It is the [[Flag of Denmark|Danish flag]] with a green [[Nordic cross]] in the centre. The green is said to symbolize the natural greenery of the island.

The flag is not officially recognized.

'''"Für zwei Groschen Musik"''' ("Twopenny Music") was the [[Germany|German]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958]], performed in [[German Language|German]] by [[Margot Hielscher]].

The song was performed eighth on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Fud Leclerc]] with "[[Ma petite chatte]]" and preceding [[Austria]]'s [[Liane Augustin]] with "[[Die ganze Welt braucht Liebe]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 5 points, placing 7th in a field of 10.

The song is in the ''chanson'' mode popular at the early Contests and is in praise of music itself. Hielscher sings about the simple joy which can be had by paying a small sum of money to hear music.

It was succeeded as [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|German representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959 Contest]] by [[Alice Kessler|Alice]] &amp; [[Ellen Kessler]] with "[[Heute Abend wollen wir tanzen geh'n]]".

'''Gryttie''' is a mythical creature which is reputed to dwell in the depths of [[Gryttjen]], in [[Hälsingland]], [[Sweden]]. Gryttjen Lake is located fairly deep in the forest between the towns of Ljusdal and Hudiksvall.

==History==
Gryttie is a local legend in the province of Hälsingland and unconfirmed sightings has been made at the lake since the 1800s but none were fully documented. The lake is stated to have a depth of about 118 feet but local attempts with sounding lines have found deep holes measuring over 300 feet down. The rumours of the lake monster was that it was some kind of [[sea serpent]]. However in 1985 a group calling themselves the Gryttie-group formed and started to make more systematic examinations of the lake including underwater cameras and side sonar scanning.

Their current theory today is that the creature is some form of isolated [[Sirenia|seacow]] that lives in the lake. No conclusive evidence has been discovered of either the existence of the monster nor of any animals that can explain the sightings.

In [[political science]], '''intergovernmentalism''' treats states, and national governments in particular, as the primary actors in the integration process.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergovernmentalist approaches claim to be able to explain both periods of radical change in the [[European Union]] because of converging governmental preferences and periods of inertia because of diverging national interests. Intergovernmentalism is distinguishable from [[realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] because of its recognition of the significance of [[institutionalisation]] in international politics and the impact of domestic politics upon governmental preferences.

A monetary union, the [[eurozone]], was established in 1999 and is composed of 17 member states. Through the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] the EU has developed a role in [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external relations]] and [[Military of the European Union|defence]]. Permanent [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|diplomatic missions]] have been established around the world. The EU is represented at the [[European Union and the United Nations|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[European Union and the G8|G8]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]].

Intergovernmentalism represents a way for limiting the conferral of powers upon supranational institutions, halting the emergence of common policies. In the current institutional system of the EU, the European Council and the Council play the role of the institutions which have the last word about decisions and policies of the EU, institutionalizing a de facto intergovernmental control over the EU as a whole, with the possibility to give more power to a small group of states. This extreme consequence can create the condition of supremacy of someone over someone else violating the principle of a "Union of Equals".&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[African Union]]''' ('''AU''', or, in its other official languages, '''UA''') is a [[Continental union|continental intergovernmental union]], similar but less integrated to the EU, consisting of 54&amp;nbsp;[[Africa]]n [[Sovereign state|states]]. The AU was established on 26 May 2001 in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and launched on 9 July 2002 in [[South Africa]] to replace the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Julaha''' are a community of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], which adopted the profession of [[weaving]]. They are a sub category of Khatri people who are native of [[East Punjab]].

==Etymology==
The term ''Julaha'' may derive from the Persian ''julah'' (ball of thread).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQRuAAAAMAAJ|title=The scheduled castes|last=Singh|first=Kumar Suresh|last2=India|first2=Anthropological Survey of|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|isbn=9780195632545|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other explanation put forth by Julaha themselves include
"''jal'' (net), ''jils'' (decorated) or ''uila'' (lighted up, or white)".

Both Hindu and Muslim Julaha groups exist; a number of the Muslim Julaha later changed their group name to terms such as ''[[Momin Ansari|Ansari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl53OdhuU7YC|title=Beyond Hindu and Muslim: Multiple Identity in Narratives from Village India|last=Gottschalk|first=Peter|date=2005-10-27|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199760527|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the prophet Mohammed's term for the Muslims of [[Medina]]) or ''Nurbaf'' (''weaver of light''), Persian being a prestigious language amongst area Muslims).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

{{Anti-consumerism |People}}
'''Kalle Lasn''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈkɑlˑɛ ˈlɑsn̥|et}}) (born March 24, 1942) is an [[Estonia]]n-[[Canadians|Canadian]] film maker, author, magazine editor, and activist. Near the end of [[World War II]], his family fled [[Estonia]] and Lasn spent some time in a German refugee camp. At age seven he was resettled in Australia with his family, where he grew up and remained until the late 1960s, attending school in Canberra. In the late 1960's, he founded a market research company in Tokyo, and in 1970, moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. Over the course of twenty years, he produced documentaries for PBS and Canada’s National Film Board. He currently resides in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leiren-Young|first=M.|title=His one demand:  Profile of Kalle Lasn|journal=The Walrus|date=December 2012|volume=9|issue=10|pages=26–32|url=http://thewalrus.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the co-founder of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine and author of the books ''Culture Jam'' and ''Design Anarchy'' and is the co-founder of the Adbusters Media Foundation, which owns the magazine. He reportedly started ''Adbusters'' after an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that there was something profoundly wrong with consumerism. It happened in a supermarket parking lot. Frustrated that he had to insert a quarter to use a shopping cart, he jammed a bent coin in so that the machine became inoperable. This act of vandalism was his first (quite literal) "culture jam"—defined as an act designed to subvert mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a82sdnhzeRMC&amp;pg=PR15 Kalle Lasn, ''Culture Jam'', Harpers Collins, 1999, page xv]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Born in [[Tallinn, Estonia]], during World War II, Lasn spent his early childhood residing in a "displaced-persons camp", and eventually resettled in Australia to pursue a degree in applied mathematics. Soon after, Lasn relocated to Tokyo, where he spent five years running his own market-research firm before eventually immigrating to Canada in 1970. Lasn’s life works are applied within the philosophical lens of the French [[Situationists]] theory and the philosophy of [[detournement]]. His concept pertained to the "rerouting [of] spectacular images, environments, ambiences and events to reverse or subvert their meaning." Lasn has also contemporized the concept of the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]], in which he applies to explain the thousands of images encountered by consumers on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Interviewtwo"&gt;[https://search.proquest.com/docview/208370419?accountid=14701 "WHEN A BRAND BUSTER BECOMES A BRAND. Advertising Age, 78(47), 1-1,29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[PRWeek]]'' magazine, Lasn recalls the moment in 1989, as an environmental campaigner, where he realized that all brands carry a "political message". In response to a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign launched by the forest industry, which sought to reassure the [[Pacific Northwest]] that they had nothing to worry about, Lasn and his team developed a 30-second advertisement of their own which would challenge the initial campaign. However, Lasn’s attempt at airing the spot on television ultimately failed, as the TV station refused to sell him any time. Lasn referred to this move as "absurd and unfair" because "even the most innocuous product ad is laden with unspoken and unquestioned political assumptions", adding that no line exists between product and advocacy ads, and that all ads are political.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITBC&amp;sw=w&amp;u=otta77973&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA382203327&amp;asid=39caa05cdc0949ab5f86a1a8151dbf47 "The Interview: Kalle Lasn - Power in your hands", PR Week, UK, 1 Sept. 2014, p. 26. Business Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adbusters===
{{See also|Adbusters}}

Inspired by what he saw as the lack of democracy in access to all-power media, Lasn founded ''Adbusters'', a bi-monthly radicalizing magazine which lends itself the title of one of the leading voices in global [[environmentalism]], anti-capitalist and anti-consumerist movements. Having worked in market research in Japan in the 1960s, Lasn drew from his personal experience and knowledge to produce publications and campaigns that would employ the necessary tools and techniques to create powerful imagery, stunts, slick graphics and vibrant language to promote his cause.&lt;ref name="Interview" /&gt;

By taking conventional [[marketing communication]] techniques and applying them to [[anti-consumerism]] messages, ''Adbusters'' has created a powerful, global social movement, which takes aim at large-scale industries. Although the company’s headquarters in Vancouver only has ten employees, it has a large global following, with 40,000 paper subscribers and 30,000 online subscribers. Lasn claims that ‘’Adbusters" is the "hub of global activism – it’s the (communication) model of the future".&lt;ref name="Interview" /&gt;

==Books and films==
{{See also|Culture jamming}}

In his first book, ''Culture Jam'', Lasn portrays [[consumerism]] as the fundamental evil of the modern era. He calls for a "[[meme]] war": a battle of ideas to shift Western society away from [[consumer capitalism]]. Lasn, in his book, calls on the values of authenticity, individuality and freedom of expression. He promotes the rebelling of the notion that hierarchies can dictate people’s identities. Essentially, Lasn’s concept of ''culture jamming'' calls upon consumers to value experiences over possessions, while accusing marketing experts of co-opting these values and "slapping a brand name on them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=otta77973&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA58129344&amp;asid=20ca35f75597a060c9f6e3c4289558af Goldman, Debra. "Consumer Republic." ADWEEK Western Edition 22 Nov. 1999: 13. Academic OneFile. Web. 9 Mar. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book, ''Design Anarchy'', calls on graphic designers, illustrators and others to turn from working in service to corporate and political pollution of both the planet and "the mental environment", and to embrace a radical new aesthetic devoted to social and environmental responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. The book, which in an introduction to Lasn’s notion of ''culture jamming'', includes a compilation of some of ''Adbuster''’s greatest moments, but with the addition of what Lasn calls a "technical event", which forces the mind to take notice of something and search for meaning, even if there is no meaning. This "technical event" invites readers to become mindful of their patterns of consumption.  Similar to Lasn’s prior book, ''Design Anarchy'' is a "personal statement, manifesto and textbook", which takes many of the prominent advertising campaigns found in the ''Adbusters'' magazine, and reconfigures them to stop "the flow of bits of information long enough to interrupt the spectacle, to promote the jolt, to allow the process of awareness". In the book, Lasn claims that if members of a society can begin by demarking themselves, then they are able to de-market certain rituals imposed by commercial forces, consequently shifting the ways in which the customer interacts with mass media, the way information flows, and the ways in which meaning is produced, ultimately leading to a break in commercial meaning and a shift to a [[Anti-consumerism|post-consumerist society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20206569 Barber, John F. “Leonardo.” Leonardo, vol. 41, no. 2, 2008, pp. 193–194]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his third book, ''Meme Wars: The Creative Destruction of Neoclassic Economics'', Lasn prefaces the book by calling on University students to realize that they are being "fooled by the façade" of the capitalist educational system, adding that the lack of incorporation of externalities such as species extinction, resource depletion, climate change, and financial meltdowns has turned the profession into a "target for derision and ridicule". Lasn challenges students to look beneath the surface of the façade to realize that economics is a "highly contested" and "questionable" field. To do so, Lasn offers two distinct ways for students to approach their academic endeavours: to either "accept the status quo" of the system, or become "an agitator, a provocateur, a meme warrior, and occupier", calling on students to engage in a paradigm shift within educational institutions. The book includes a series of essays, photographs and advertisements, which support Lasn’s approach to [[culture jamming]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EC3QuQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Kalle+lasn+meme+wars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja-9ap8cTSAhVE0oMKHd7oBMsQ6AEIHDAA Kalle Lasn, "Meme Wars: The Neoclassic Economics, A real world economics textbook".

Lasn made documentary films for 20 years beginning in 1970 - many of them to do with [[Japan]], the homeland of his wife, Masako Tominaga.&lt;ref name="Vancouver"&gt;[http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/2011/10/12/adbusters-kalle-lasn-brilliant-flawed-genius-behind-occupy-wall?page=0,3 Linda Solomon, "Adbusters' Kalle Lasn: the flawed genius behind Occupy Wall Street", ''[[Vancouver Observer]]'', October 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; His award-winning films include:

==Activism and views==
{{See also|Occupy Wall Street}}
Lasn, in collaboration with [[Micah White]], came up with the original idea for an [[Occupy Wall Street]] (OWS) demonstration, but has been careful not to claim ownership of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mackey |first=Robert |title=Occupy Movement Could Declare ‘Victory’ and Scale Back Camps, Founder Suggests |work=The Lede |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 15, 2011 |url= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/occupy-movement-could-declare-victory-and-scale-back-camps-founder-suggests/?scp=1&amp;sq=Occupy%20movement&amp;st=cse |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Mattathias |title=Pre-Occupied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">The '''kozhushanka''' ({{lang-uk|кожушанка}}) is a traditional [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[sheepskin]] coat.

Kozhushankas were winter attires worn by women, typically in the middle [[Dnieper River]] region, including the [[Left-Bank Ukraine|Left-Bank]] and [[steppe]] areas, and also in the [[Lemko]] region, particularly in the central regions.  They are thought to have originated in the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\D\R\Dress.htm Dress]'' at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The coats varied in color from region to region.

In the [[Lemko]] areas, the Kozhushanka was worn on top of the [[blouse]]. It was designed to resemble the traditional Lemko korset [[bodice]], but without wedges at the bottom. It was made of cherry-colored [[velvet]], lined by homemade coarse cloth or linen. The edges were trimmed with black sheepskin or other differently dyed material. It was embellished by a couple of bouquets of various color and, like most Ukrainian clothing of the time, [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]], particularly on the chest.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Krasovs'kyj. ''[http://www.carpatho-rusyn.org/lemkos/ivan.htm Traditional Lemko Women's Clothing]''.  Carpatho-Rusyn American, Volume 10 #3, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian immigrants]] were often singled out by their sheepskin coats, and detractors such as politician [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]] said they looked more like beasts than men.  However, then [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|interior minister]] [[Clifford Sifton]] (in charge of immigration) defended the "stalwart peasant in a sheepskin coat, born on the soil, whose forefathers have been farmers for ten generations, with a stout wife and a half-dozen children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/resources/publications/legacy/chap-2a.asp#chap2-6 Forging Our Legacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, when Oliver replaced Sifton as minister of the interior, Ukrainian immigration continued apace, but the kozhushanka was increasingly dropped by the Ukrainians in Canada favor of Western garments.

'''Løvenskiold''' is a [[Danish nobility|Dano]]-[[Norwegian nobility|Norwegian noble family]] of [[Germany|German]] origin. Members of the family now live primarily in [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slekt.org/books/quisling/gaard1/010.html ''Løvenskioldslegten'' (J.L. Quisling  ''Gaardshistorie''. Kristiania: 1921)]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named Leopoldus, it was one of the first [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] Norwegian families to buy noble status, in 1739, when it was also granted the surname Løvenskiold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/L%C3%B8venskiold |title=  Løvenskiold|publisher =   Store norske leksikon |author=   Jon Gunnar Arntzen|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Løvenskiold family descend from merchant Herman Leopoldus (died 1696), who immigrated from [[Lübeck]] to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo, Norway). His son, also named Herman Leopoldus (1677–1750), became quite wealthy. Both he and his son, Herman Løvenskiold (1701-1759), were ennobled by [[letters patent]] in 1739, by paying the King's private fund (''partikulærkassen'').&lt;ref&gt;Albert Fabritius: Danmarks Riges Adel, Copenhagen, 1946, p 52.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they received the surname ''Løvenskiold'' (lit. ‘Lion Shield’). His grandson was [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] Herman Leopoldus Løvenskiold (1739-1799). His great-grandson Severin Løvenskiold (1743–1818) was made a [[baron]] (Norwegian: ''baron'' or ''friherre''). He was the father of [[Severin Løvenskiold]] (1777–1856) who served as [[Prime Minister of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=         https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/L%C3%B8venskiold |title=    Løvenskiold |publisher =    lokalhistoriewiki.no

==Property==
Members of the family have owned a number of historic homes in Denmark and Norway including  Løvenborg Castle (''Løvenborg Slot'')  at  Merløse   in [[Holbæk]], Holden Manor (''Holden hovedgård'') at [[Ulefoss]] in [[Telemark]] and Fossum Manor (''Fossum hovedgård'') at Fossum Ironworks in  [[Skien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://runeberg.org/dbl/10/0607.html |title=  Løvenskiold, Herman, 1677-1750, Godsejer  |publisher =    Dansk biografisk Lexikon|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     http://www.danskeherregaarde.dk/26384.aspx |title=  Løvenborg|publisher =  Danske Herregaarde

The name is also given to the family's privately owned company [[Løvenskiold-Vækerø]], headquartered at [[Ullern]]. The holding company owns vast tracts of woodland in and around [[Oslo]], [[Akershus]], [[Oppland]],  [[Buskerud]] and [[Telemark]], as well as the building materials retail chain [[Maxbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://lovenskiold.no/about-the-company/ |title=   About Løvenskiold-Vækerø|publisher =     Løvenskiold-Vækerø |accessdate= July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mankanya language''' is spoken by approximately 70,000 people in [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]] primarily belonging to the [[Mankanya people|ethnic group]] of the same name. It belongs to the [[Bak languages|Bak branch]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]].

The language has status as an official language in Senegal, and an [[orthography]] has recently been developed for writing it. Mankanya is known as "Uhula" by the people themselves (the [[Mankanya people]], or "Bahula"). The name 'Mankanya' ('Mancagne' in [[French language|French]]) is thought to have been conferred upon the people and their language by [[colonialists]] who mistook the name of their chief at the time of [[colonisation]] for the name of the people-group itself.

The language contains many [[loanwords]] from [[Guinea-Bissau Creole|Kriol]]. There is also extensive [[multilingualism|bilingualism]] in Mandjak, a closely related language which is largely [[mutual intelligibility|mutually comprehensible]], as well as in other minority languages spoken in the area, such as [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]] and [[Jola language|Jola]]. Finally, Mankanya speakers in Senegal also know French, and those in Gambia know English.

[[Image:GoliaPavel-foto Berthold.jpg|thumb|Pavel Golia, photo by [[Avgust Berthold]]]]
'''Pavel Golia''' (10 April 1887 – 15 August 1959) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[poet]] and [[playwright]].

==Life==
Pavel Golia was born in a relatively wealthy family in Trebnje. Between 1907 and 1915, he served as an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In 1918, he was a journalist in [[Moscow]]. Later, he worked as a [[dramaturge]] or manager of the national theaters in [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana|Ljubljana]] (1920–46, with a two-year break), [[Croatian National Theatre in Osijek|Osijek]], and [[National Theatre in Belgrade|Belgrade]]. He died in Ljubljana.

==Work==
Golia wrote his first collection of poems, titled ''Alkohol'' ("Alcohol"), in 1908. It was published only in 1914. He wrote poems for about 40 years. According to the literary historian [[Igor Grdina]], Golia was an intimate poet who wrote about alcoholism, prostitution, and deviant people. Emotions in his poetry are not serious. He was influenced by [[Oton Župančič]], but developed his own form, sometimes closer to artistry.

Golia has been praised for his plays, particularly the ones written for children. He published his first play ''Peterčkove poslednje sanje: božična povest v štirih slikah s prologom'' ("Peter's Final Dreams: A Christmas Play in Four Images with a Prologue") in 1923. His most known children plays are ''Princeska in pastirček'' ("A Princess and a Shepherd Boy"), ''Jurček'' ("Little George"), ''Srce igrač'' ("The Heart of Toys"), ''Uboga Ančka'' ("Poor Little Annie"), and ''Sneguljčica'' ("Snow White"). The expert in Slovenian youth literature [[Igor Saksida]] placed him among the best Slovenian children's playwrights.

==Commemoration==
[[File:Trebnje Golia rojstna hiša 2.jpg|thumb|Pavel Golia's birth house in Trebnje]]
The [[Municipality of Trebnje]] celebrates 10 April as Pavel Golia Memorial Day. The library in Trebnje is named after him.

The walls were built of stones packed without any mortar in such a manner that successive courses overlapped inwards until the opening at the apex was small enough to be closed by a single large slab. For obvious reasons, the huts were generally small. Few of them exceeded an internal diameter of 1.5 metres, and the height from floor to apex of the roof was barely 1,2 m. The only opening was the entrance at ground level usually about 45 cm high and 40 cm wide, so that it was necessary to enter the structure by crawling on one’s stomach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahra.org.za/sites/923260003 Beehive Stone Huts, Sedan, Lindley District]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sheikhdom''' (alt. sheikdom) ({{lang-ar|مشيخة}} [''Mashyakhah'']) is a [[geographical area]] or a [[society]] ruled by a [[sheikh]] (Arabic: {{rtl-lang|ar|شيخ}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/sheikhdom&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikhdoms exist almost exclusively within [[Arab countries]], particularly in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The word is generally used as a descriptive term for political systems rather than as a noun (such as the case is with "Kingdom"), and although some countries are ruled by a sheikh, they are not typically referred to as sheikdoms.

'''Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor''' is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] which covers the [[Chang'an]]-[[Tianshan]] portion of the ancient [[Silk Road]] and historical sites along the route.  On June 22, 2014, UNESCO designated a 5,000&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the Silk Road network from Central China to the Zhetsyu Region of [[Central Asia]] as a World Heritage site. The corridor spans [[China]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]] and includes 33 new sites and several previously designated heritage sites.&lt;ref name=officialsite/&gt;

==History==
In 1988, UNESCO initiated a study of the Silk Road to promote understanding of cultural diffusion across Eurasia and protection of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  In August 2006, UNESCO and the [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage|State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China]] co-sponsored a conference in [[Turpan]], [[Xinjiang]] on the coordination of applications for the Silk Road's designation as a World Heritage site.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB&gt;(Chinese) [http://finance.people.com.cn/n/2014/0623/c1004-25185125.html 高美, "丝路入遗33遗迹22处在中国" 《新京报》] 2014-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;  At this conference, China and five Central Asia republics, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]], agreed to make a joint application in 2010.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  The six countries formed a coordinating committee in 2009 to prepare for the joint-application.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  

On March 28, 2008, China submitted a tentative list of 48 Silk Road sites to UNESCO for consideration as cultural heritage.  These sites were divided into overland Silk Road sites in [[Henan]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Qinghai]], and [[Gansu Province]], [[Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region]] and [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] as well as maritime Silk Road sites in [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang Province]] and [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5335/ UNESCO, "Chinese Section of the Silk Road: Land routes in Henan Province, Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Sea Routes in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province and Quanzhou City, Fujian Province - from Western-Han Dynasty to Qing Dynasty"] 2008-03-28&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 2, 2008, [[Iran]] submitted a tentative list of Silk Route sites in [[Khorasan Province]].  On January 3, 2010, [[Turkmenistan]] submitted a list of 29 sites along 11 segments of the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5521/, UNESCO, "Silk Roads Sites in Turkmenistan"] 2010-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 20, 2010, [[India]] submitted a tentative list of Silk Road sites divided into 12 components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5492/ UNESCO, "Silk Road Sites in India"] 2010-01-20&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 19, 2010, Kyrgyzstan submitted a list of six sites and Uzbekistan submitted a list with 18 sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5518/ "Silk Roads Sites in Kyrgyzstan"] 2010-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5500/ UNESCO, "Silk Roads Sites in Uzbekistan"] 2010-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;  Kazakhstan's tentative list was submitted on May 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5754/ UNESCO, "Silk Road"] 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2011, UNESCO proposed that due to the vast scale of the Silk Road project that the application be divided into corridors.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  In December 2011, China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan agreed to jointly pursue application for one corridor from Central China across the Tianshan Range, and each country nominated one government official, one archaeologist and a national application committee.  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan prepared to apply for another corridor.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  In 2013, the application for the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor was finalized and officially submitted by Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  It contained 22 sites in China, 8 sites in Kazakhstan and 3 sites in Kyrgyzstan.  Each UNESCO member country may submit one application per year, and China had submitted an application for the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]].&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  The original sites proposed by China was substantially revised for this application.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;  Sites in the [[Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region]] and relating to the Maritime Silk Road were removed.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://hn.ifeng.com/zixun/yaowen/detail_2014_06/21/2466710_0.shtml 梁新慧, "3国联手申遗'丝绸之路'河南成唯一'双遗产'省份" 《东方今报》 ] 2014-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese organizers have said that several of the sites left out of the application may be submitted in the future.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;

On June 22, 2014, at the 38th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor application was approved.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;

==Sites on the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor==
The Silk Road's Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor, which was approved by the World Heritage Committee in June 2014 as Site No. 1442, consists of 33 newly designated sites in China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  The sites include capital cities and palace complexes of various empires and kingdoms, trading settlements, Buddhist cave temples, ancient paths, posthouses, mountain passes, beacon towers, sections of the [[Great Wall]], fortifications, tombs and religious buildings.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1442/ UNESCO World Heritage Sites, "Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor"] Accessed 2014-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectively, the 33 sites cover an area of {{convert|42668.16|ha|sqmi|1|abbr=on|sortable=on}} and have buffer zone {{convert|189963.13|ha|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GaoMeiXJB/&gt;

The sites are categorized into four regions along the Silk Road by ICOMOs, which assessed eligibility for the World Heritage inscription:&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2014/whc14-38com-inf8B1-en.pdf ICOMOS report to the World Heritage Committee 38th ordinary session: ''2014 Evaluations of Nominations of Cultural and Mixed Properties to the World Heritage List'' June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://news.hsw.cn/system/2014/06/23/051954802.shtml 刘超, "丝路申遗涉及3国33处遗迹是全球最大跨国遗产项目" 西安晚报] 2014-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Social Forum''' ('''WSF''', {{lang-pt|Fórum Social Mundial}} {{IPA-pt|ˈfɔɾũ sosi'aw mũdʒiˈaw|}}) is an annual meeting of civil society organizations, first held in [[Brazil]], which offers a self-conscious effort to develop an alternative future through the championing of [[counter-hegemonic globalization]]. The World Social Forum can be considered a visible manifestation of global [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Handbook of Political Citizenship and Social Movements |first=Sebastiaan |last=Tijsterman |title=Global and cosmopolitan citizenship |editor-first=Hein-Anton |editor-last=Van der Heijden |page=185 |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-78195-470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing together [[non governmental organizations]], advocacy campaigns, and formal and informal [[social movements]] seeking international [[solidarity]]. The World Social Forum prefers to define itself as "an opened space – plural, diverse, non-governmental and non-partisan – that stimulates the decentralized debate, reflection, proposals building, experiences exchange and alliances among movements and organizations engaged in concrete actions towards a more solidarity, democratic and fair world....a permanent space and process to build alternatives to [[neoliberalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsm2009amazonia.org.br/what-the-wsf-is {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is held by members of the [[alter-globalization]] movement (also referred to as the [[global justice movement]]) who come together to coordinate global campaigns, share and refine organizing strategies, and inform each other about movements from around the world and their particular issues. The World Social Forum is explicit about not being a representative of all of those who attend and thus does not publish any formal statements on behalf of participants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated413"&gt;Smith, Jackie (October 2004). "The World Social Forum and the challenges of global democracy". ''Global Networks'', Volume 4, Issue 4, pp. 413–421. {{doi|10.1111/j.1471-0374.2004.00102.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It tends to meet in January at the same time as its "great capitalist rival", the [[World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum's]] Annual Meeting in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]. This date is consciously picked to promote alternative answers to world economic problems in opposition to the World Economic Forum.

==Charter of Principles==
This Charter was approved and adopted in [[São Paulo, Brazil]] on April 9, 2001, by the organizations that make up the World Social Forum Organizing Committee, and approved with modifications by the World Social Forum International Council on June 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Charter of Principles (World Social Forum)|Charter of Principles (World Social Forum) - Wikisource, the free online library]]. En.wikisource.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

1) The World Social Forum is an open meeting place for reflective thinking, democratic debate of ideas, formulation of proposals, free exchange of experiences and interlinking for effective action, by groups and movements of civil society that are opposed to [[neo-liberalism]] and to domination of the world by capital and any form of [[imperialism]], and are committed to building a planetary society directed towards fruitful relationships among humankind and between it and the Earth.

2) The World Social Forum at Porto Alegre was an event localized in time and place. From now on, in the certainty proclaimed at Porto Alegre that "Another World Is Possible", it becomes a permanent process of seeking and building alternatives, which cannot be reduced to the events supporting it.

3) The World Social Forum is a world process. All the meetings that are held as part of this process have an international dimension.

4) The alternatives proposed at the World Social Forum stand in opposition to a process of [[globalization]] commanded by the large [[multinational corporations]] and by the governments and international institutions at the service of those corporations' interests, with the complicity of national governments. They are designed to ensure that globalization in [[solidarity]] will prevail as a new stage in world history. This will respect universal [[human rights]], and those of all citizens - men and women - of all nations and the environment and will rest on democratic international systems and institutions at the service of social justice, equality and the sovereignty of peoples.

5) The World Social Forum brings together and interlinks only organizations and movements of civil society from all the countries in the world, but intends neither to be a body representing world [[civil society]].

6) The meetings of the World Social Forum do not deliberate on behalf of the World Social Forum as a body. No one, therefore, will be authorized, on behalf of any of the editions of the Forum, to express positions claiming to be those of all its participants. The participants in the Forum shall not be called on to take decisions as a body, whether by vote or acclamation, on declarations or proposals for action that would commit all, or the majority, of them and that propose to be taken as establishing positions of the Forum as a body. It thus does not constitute a locus of power to be disputed by the participants in its meetings, nor does it intend to constitute the only option for interrelation and action by the organizations and movements that participate in it.

7) Nonetheless, organizations or groups of organizations that participate in the Forum's meetings must be assured the right, during such meetings, to deliberate on declarations or actions they may decide on, whether singly or in coordination with other participants. The World Social Forum undertakes to circulate such decisions widely by the means at its disposal, without directing, hierarchizing, censuring or restricting them, but as deliberations of the organizations or groups of organizations that made the decisions.

8) The World Social Forum is a plural, diversified, non-confessional, non-governmental and non-party context that, in a decentralized fashion, interrelates organizations and movements engaged in concrete action at levels from the local to the international to build another world.

9) The World Social Forum will always be a forum open to pluralism and to the diversity of activities and ways of engaging of the organizations and movements that decide to participate in it, as well as the diversity of genders, ethnicities, cultures, generations and physical capacities, providing they abide by this Charter of Principles. Neither party representations nor military organizations shall participate in the Forum. Government leaders and members of legislatures who accept the commitments of this Charter may be invited to participate in a personal capacity.

10) The World Social Forum is opposed to all totalitarian and reductionist views of economy, development and history and to the use of violence as a means of social control by the State. It upholds respect for Human Rights, the practices of real democracy, participatory democracy, peaceful relations, in equality and solidarity, among people, ethnicities, genders and peoples, and condemns all forms of domination and all subjection of one person by another.

11) As a forum for debate the World Social Forum is a movement of ideas that prompts reflection, and the transparent circulation of the results of that reflection, on the mechanisms and instruments of domination by capital, on means and actions to resist and overcome that domination, and on the alternatives proposed to solve the problems of exclusion and social inequality that the process of capitalist globalization with its racist, sexist and environmentally destructive dimensions is creating internationally and within countries.

12) As a framework for the exchange of experiences, the World Social Forum encourages understanding and mutual recognition among its participant organizations and movements, and places special value on the exchange among them, particularly on all that society is building to center economic activity and political action on meeting the needs of people and respecting nature, in the present and for future generations.

13) As a context for interrelations, the World Social Forum seeks to strengthen and create new national and international links among organizations and movements of society, that, in both public and private life, will increase the capacity for non-violent social resistance to the process of dehumanization the world is undergoing and to the violence used by the State, and reinforce the humanizing measures being taken by the action of these movements and organizations.

14) The World Social Forum is a process that encourages its participant organizations and movements to situate their actions, from the local level to the national level and seeking active participation in international contexts, as issues of planetary citizenship, and to introduce onto the global agenda the change-inducing practices that they are experimenting in building a new world in solidarity.

==History==

The World Social Forum first met in 2001, but it had its roots in Latin American activism, namely the encuentro, a meeting which emphasizes dialogue and exchange of ideas among activists. Some of the founders of the WSF, were part of the First International Encuentro for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism in 1996, and decided to expand the idea and make it a global forum for activists of all stripes opposing hegemonic [[globalization]] and [[neoliberalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It has also been suggested{{By whom|date=June 2012}} that the beginnings of the World Social Forum originated in the [[Battle for Seattle]] November 1999, where [[anti-globalization]] activists protested a meeting of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s latest [[trade negotiations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=19622 The 1999 Seattle protests gave birth to a global movement]. Socialistworker.co.uk. Retrieved on 12 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the originators of the World Social Forum, [[Oded Grajew]], of the Ethos Institute for Business and Social Responsibility, said in an interview with [[InMotion]] Magazine in 2004, "Then I had the idea. Why not create the World Social Forum, as we have the World Economic Forum, speaking about the people in the world? Why not have the World Social Forum -- the social is more important than the economic -- to have a space to show that we can have an alternative? We have choice. This is not the only way you can see the world, globalization. We have another way to see it. And, at the same time, force people to look, to make a choice. What is your choice? What is your vision of the world?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/global/ogwsf_int.html Interview with Oded Grajew - Initiator and Secretariat Member of the World Social Forum / Global Eyes / In Motion Magazine]. Inmotionmagazine.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A variation on this creation story is reported by Bernard Cassen in "On the Attack," [http://www.newleftreview.org/ ''New Left Review''] 19, January–February 2003, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of the founders of the WSF, [[Cándido Grzybowski]] has said of the annual meetings, "The numerous recent crises are expressions of the contradictions and limitations of the form of global capitalism that has been imposed on humanity and the earth. The assertion that "another world is possible" is now an absolute necessity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/columns.asp?idnews=50074|title=Inter Press Service - News and Views from the Global South|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, the [[United Nations]] has had a presence at the WSF through [[UNESCO]], showing the institutional credibility achieved by the forum, seen by UNESCO as a "prime opportunity for dialogue and a laboratory of ideas for the renewal of public policies" through "critical reflection on the future of societies we want to create and for elaborating proposals in search of solidarity, justice, peace and human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7360&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO and the World Social Forum page |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 World Social Forum===
The first World Social Forum was held from 25 January to 30 January 2001 in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]], organized by many groups including the French Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens ([[ATTAC]]). The WSF was sponsored, in part, by the Porto Alegre government, led by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Worker's Party]] (PT). The town was experimenting with an [[participatory budgeting|innovative model]] for [[local government]] which combined the traditional [[representative democracy|representative institutions]] with the [[participatory democracy|participation of open assemblies]] of the people. 12,000 people attended from around the world. At the time, Brazil was also in a moment of transformation that later would lead to the electoral victory of the PT candidate [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. This first meeting was focused on gathering anti-globalization activists from all over the world to talk and organize amongst one another, while subsequent meetings have been more focused on specific ways to counter [[neoliberalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===2002 World Social Forum===
The second WSF, also held in [[Porto Alegre]] from 31 January to 5 February 2002, had over 12,000 official delegates representing people from 123 countries, 60,000 attendees, 652 workshops, and 27 talks.  Among the 500 American delegates several were selected to be members of the forum's "international council", made up of a rather large number of organizations.  Among those represented were Ralph Nader's [[Public Citizen]] organization ([[Medea Benjamin]] and [[Linda Chavez-Thompson]]), the Brazilian NGO [http://www.ibase.br/modules.php?name=Conteudo&amp;pid=122 Ibase] (Cândido Grzybowski and Moema Miranda), the Brazilian association of entrepreneurs for citizenship CIVES (Oded Grajew, founder of the WSF), the Brazilian Commission on Justice and Peace ([http://word.world-citizenship.org/wp-archive/1157 Francisco Whitaker]), [[Association pour la taxation des transactions pour l'aide aux citoyens|ATTAC]] (Christophe Aguiton), [http://www.crid.asso.fr/spip.php?article13 CRID France] (Gustave Massiah), [http://focusweb.org/ Focus on the Global South] Thailand (Nicola Bullard), and the [http://alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World] ([[Gustavo Marín]]). Members of the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]] were also very active.  The [[Ford Foundation]] funded $500,000 for the next meeting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===2003 World Social Forum===
The third WSF was again held in Porto Alegre, in January 2003. There were many parallel workshops, including, for example the ''Life After Capitalism'' workshop, which proposed focused discussion on non-[[communism|communist]], non-[[capitalism|capitalist]], participative possibilities for different aspects of social, political, economic, communication structures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807004352/http://www.zmag.org/lacsite.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the speakers was American linguist and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]]. Some credit this meeting of World Social Forum for the connections that made the global day of action on February 15, 2003 so successful. The [[protests against the Iraq War|global day of action]] was an international protest attended by an estimated 12 million people in 700 cities across 60 countries protesting the [[George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]'s plans to invade and occupy Iraq. At the time, the [[New York Times]] called international public opinion, a superpower to counter the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/world/threats-and-responses-news-analysis-a-new-power-in-the-streets.html | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick E. | last=Tyler | title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEWS ANALYSIS; A New Power In the Streets | date=2003-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 World Social Forum===
The fourth WSF was held in [[Mumbai]], India, from 16 January to 21 January 2004. It was the first meeting of the World Social Forum held outside Brazil and its success has encouraged the WSF to expand in scope across the [[global South]]. Some credit it with inspiring the [[Asian Social Forum]] held in November of that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated413"/&gt; The attendance was expected to be 75,000 and it shot over by thousands. The cultural diversity was one notable aspect of the forum.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} A notable decision{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} that was taken was the stand on [[free software]]. One of the key speakers at the WSF 2004 was [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. In contrast to earlier meetings, which had focused more on Euro-centric political intellectualism, the 2004 meeting included marches, as well as colorful and lively demonstrations. 

The 2004 meeting also saw the convening of the [[General Assembly of the Global Anti-War Movement]], an idea that originated from the [[Asian Social Forum]] in November 2003, and broadly coalesced in response to the [[invasion of Iraq]] by the United States in 2003. The Assembly had few activists from the United States, but overwhelmingly tried to articulate that they opposed the policy, and not the country itself. The former director-general of [[UNESCO]], [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], said at the Forum, "We must state it clearly. We must say to President Bush that we do not agree with the way he controls the world. We must tell him that he has to govern with his mind, not with might."&lt;ref name="autogenerated413"/&gt;

===2005 World Social Forum===
The fifth World Social Forum 2005 was held in Porto Alegre, Brazil between 26 January and 31 January. There were 155,000 registered participants at the Forum, with most coming from Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Uruguay, and France. A number of participants in the forum released the [[Porto Alegre Manifesto]]. Since Article 6 of the World Social Forum's Charter of Principles bars the event from attempting to represent all participants through formal statements, the [[Porto Alegre Manifesto]] was released on behalf of 19 activists. This 'Group of 19' includes [[Aminata Traoré]], [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[José Saramago]], [[François Houtart]], [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Roberto Savio]], [[Riccardo Petrella]], [[Ignacio Ramonet]], [[Bernard Cassen]], [[Samir Amin]], [[Atilio Borón]], [[Samuel Ruiz García]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Frei Betto]], [[Emir Sader]], [[Walden Bello]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openspaceforum.net/twiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=276 Porto Alegre Manifesto]. OpenSpaceForum. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 World Social Forum===
The sixth World Social Forum was "polycentric", held in January 2006 in [[Caracas]] (Venezuela) and [[Bamako]] (Mali), and in March 2006, in [[Karachi]] (Pakistan). The Forum in Pakistan was delayed to March because of the [[Kashmir earthquake]] that had recently occurred in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsf2006karachi.org/index.html|title=World Social Forums-Karachi|last=|first=|date=|website=World Social Forums-Karachi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718230121/http://www.wsf2006karachi.org/index.html|archive-date=2006-07-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/03/world-social-forum-polycentric-and-losing-focus/|title=WORLD SOCIAL FORUM: Polycentric and Losing Focus|last=Netto|first=Anil|date=24 March 2006|website=Inter Press Service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119190706/http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/03/world-social-forum-polycentric-and-losing-focus/|archive-date=19 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 World Social Forum===
The seventh World Social Forum was held in [[Nairobi]], Kenya in January 2007. There were 66,000 registered attendees, and 1,400 participating organizations from 110 countries, making it the most globally representative WSF so far.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Joyce.

===2008 World Social Forum===
The eighth World Social Forum in 2008 was not organized at a particular place, but globally, which means by thousands of autonomous local organizations, on or around January 26. They are also known as the Global Call for Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsf2008.net/eng/home |title=Jan. 26, 2008 - Act together for another world! &amp;#124; WSF2008 |publisher=WSF2008&lt;! |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 World Social Forum===
The ninth World Social Forum took place in the Brazilian city of [[Belém]], located in the Amazon rainforest, between January 27 and February 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en/taxonomy/term/513 "World Social Forum 2009"]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,900 indigenous people, representing 190 ethnic groups attended the event, to raise the issue of stateless peoples, and the plights that they face. The [[Escarré International Centre for Ethnic Minorities and Nations]] helped to organize the tent for the Collective Rights of Stateless Peoples, who are marginalized in an international system that recognizes only states as political units. Various stateless ethnic groups represented were the [[Basques]], [[Kurds]], [[Palestinians]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Tibetans]], [[Mapuche]], [[Saharawi]] and [[Australian Aborigines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=45644|title=Inter Press Service - News and Views from the Global South|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Social Forum===
The tenth edition of the World Social Forum was another decentralized affair, with about 35 national, regional and local forums taking place across the world. In [[Porto Alegre]], the flagship space for the WSF, events and speakers were held from January 25–29, entitled "FSM 10 Years: Greater Porto Alegre".

==Regional Social Forums==
The WSF has prompted the organizing of many regional [[social forum]]s, including the [[Americas Social Forum]], [[European Social Forum]], the [[Asian Social Forum]], the [[Mediterranean Social Forum]] and the [[Southern Africa Social Forum]]. There are also many local and national social forums, such as the [[Italian Social Forum]], India Social Forum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfindia.org/ World Social Forum]. Wsfindia.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liverpool Social Forum]] and the [[Boston Social Forum]]. The first-ever [[United States Social Forum]] took place in [[Atlanta]] in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussf2007.org Americas Social Forum | United States Social Forum]. Ussf2007.org (2007-07-01). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], hosted the United States Social Forum during June 22–26.&lt;ref name="ussf2010.org"/&gt;

Regional forums have taken place in the Southwest,&lt;ref&gt;http://forosocialfronterizo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest, Northeast, [[Midwest Social Forum|Midwest]] and [[Southeast Social Forum|Southeast]] regions of the United States. The first [[Canadian Social Forum]] took place in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialforum.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

Most, though not all, social forums adhere to the [[wikisource:Charter of Principles (World Social Forum)|WSF Charter of Principles]] drawn up by the World Social Forum. The goal of these forums is to decentralize and allow far more people to engage in the open forum atmosphere of the World Social Forum without needing very much money for travel expenses. All of the various social forums in this mold include international attendees and are in no way specifically focused on the problems of a single region of country.

==Criticisms==
[[Image:Another World Is Possible mural Seattle Chinatown 200511.jpg|thumb|right|This mural in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]'s Chinatown echoes the slogan of the World Social Forum: 'Another world is possible'.]]

===2001 Monsanto Incident===
Some activities by activists attending the WSF have also been criticised, such as at the WSF 2001, where activists invaded and destroyed an experimental [[genetically modified]] plantation of the [[Monsanto Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u28760.shl |title=Folha Online - Brasil - José Bové, militante francês antiglobalização, chega a Porto Alegre - 28 January 2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2001 a number of activists with Brazil's [[Movimento dos Sem-Terra]] (MST) reacted in protest to the growing role of [[Monsanto]] in global [[agribusiness]], which was considered by the group to be unethically using their seed patents to harm the rights of rural peoples, tore up an experimental plot of [[transgenic crops]] in Não-me-Toque, 300&amp;nbsp;km from Porto Alegre, where the World Social Forum was taking place at the time. Three days later, Jose Bove, a French citizen, was arrested by Brazilian authorities as the World Social Forum ended on January 29, 2001. Connections between the [[Movimento dos Sem-Terra]] and the World Social Forum are not well known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.com/0102a/copyright/wsf1.html (1/30/2001) WORLD SOCIAL FORUM: Don't Let Corporations Control Food Supply, Beg Farmers]. Albionmonitor.com (2001-01-30). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of NGOs===
{{See also|NGO-ization}}
The WSF has, especially in recent years, been strongly criticised for replacing popular movements of the poor with [[NGO]]s (non-governmental organization).&lt;ref name="abahlali1"&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/4959 Another World is Possible: Reflections and Criticisms on the World Social Forum, 2009, in Belem], Mzonke Poni, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Movements of the poor in poorer parts of the world, like Africa, have argued that they are almost completely excluded from the forum&lt;ref name="abahlali1"/&gt; and in countries like [[Kenya]] and [[South Africa]] they have protested against donor funded NGOs that, they argue, determine and dominate African representation at the forum. It has also been argued that NGOs sometimes compete with popular grassroots movements for access to the forum and for influence there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abahlali baseMjondolo |url=http://abahlali.org/node/845 |title=Article by David Ntseng on NGOs and grassroots movements at the forum |publisher=Abahlali.org |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 World Social Forum in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] in particular was criticized as a "NGO fair" because of how many [[NGO]]s attended, crowding out less formal groups of activists. Also, it has been alleged that at the Forum not all the attendees were properly represented, with the bigger and wealthier [[NGO]]s having far more space to talk and lead the events, while others were marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/letters/39464 World Social Forum: just another NGO fair?], by Firoze Manji, ''Pambazuka News'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raúl Zibechi]] argues that there is a "crisis" of the World Social Forum in that it has been "weakened" as it has been "taken over" by "those who were most capable of 'leading' assemblies, professionals from universities and NGOs."&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Zibechi, ''Territories in Resistance'', (AK Press: Oakland), 2012, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Corporations===

There was also criticism of the way that [[CelTel]] had exclusive rights at the Kenyan event, the  virtual monopoly of a local hotel offering food at rates that the average Kenyan could not afford, and the physical and financial exclusion of local business.&lt;ref name="wsf3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsf2007.net/info/analytical-articles/world-social-forum-just-another-ngo-fair|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317064627/http://wsf2007.net/info/analytical-articles/world-social-forum-just-another-ngo-fair|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 March 2012|title=World Social Forum: just another NGO fair? — WSF 2007|date=17 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===

According to Jai Sen the forum "remains largely led by aging males, mostly white or [[honorary white]], from middle and upper class and caste sections from settler societies around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://p2pfoundation.net/Engaging_Critically_with_the_Reality_and_Concept_of_Civil_SocietyInterrogating the Civil.

'''yes''', formally incorporated as '''D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd''' ({{lang-he|די.בי.אס. שרותי לווין (1998) בע"מ}}), is the sole [[direct broadcast satellite]] television provider in [[Israel]]. It broadcasts multichannel TV and VOD services via satellite [[Amos-2]] and [[Amos-3]].

In 2017, yes served about 600,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.calcalist.co.il/marketing/articles/0,7340,L-3729157,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Yes began broadcasting in July 2000. The largest shareholder of the provider is the [[Bezeq]] corporation, which holds up to 49% of its shares. The early years of the company were unstable due to technical and financial difficulties. Even though the three cable companies in Israel - [[Matav (Israel)|Matav]], [[Tevel (Israel)|Tevel]] and [[Arutzei Zahav]] - sought to compete with the satellite company by slashing prices, the subscriber base grew due to the new services that Yes offered, as well as the lack of cable coverage in many rural areas. In response,  the cable companies merged into one company under the name [[Hot (Israel)|HOT]].

Yes provides television services to more than half a million customers using two Israeli satellites – [[AMOS-2]] and [[AMOS-3]]. The company broadcasts more than 200 television stations from around the world, along with exclusive Israeli channels. In 2004, yes started offering its customers the first [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] (Digital video recorder) in Israel, called ''yesMax'' (similar in function to the [[TiVo]]).
==STINGTV==
The company markets itself as a "disassembled" TV service, customized to each customer, and offers specific content packages that can be ordered separately and can be combined. The packages offered are: movies, series, children, sport ONE, sports 1 and science and nature. There is also a family package, which offers all the packages at a cheaper price.

The service content consists of Idan + channels, which are freely transmitted to each dedicated digital converter, from additional channels that can be chosen specifically, and from VOD service where content is offered as part of the packages chosen by the customer. In addition, the service is provided on AndroidTV converter, either via a proprietary STINGTV BOX converter, or with a separate androidTV converter, which can be purchased independently, in which you can download a variety of content applications such as DailyMotion, Youtube, Kodi and more. (As of January 2018, it is not possible to download the Netflix application).
== High definition ==

On December 23, 2007, ''yes'' began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|High Definition]]. The broadcasting format is [[Widescreen|Widescreen 16:9]] with resolution of [[1080i|1080i50]]. The broadcasting system is [[DVB-S2]] and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]. There is also support for content in [[720p]]. On some of the content there is also [[Surround sound|5.1 Dolby Digital sound]]. In April 2011, yes had 18 HD channels (one of them in 3D). Receiving the broadcastings in HD is available only with ''yes''' HD [[set-top box]]es - '''ADB 7820S''' - which has multiple digital and analog outputs - including [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] (1.3a) and [[S/PDIF]] - coaxial and optical.

On April 22, 2009, ''yes'' released the HD-DVR set-top box - '''''yesMaxHD''''' (ADB 7820SX/7720SX) - which can record two shows simultaneously, also in High Definition.
On beginning of May 2010, ''yes'' started to provide Russian language audio track for HD movie channels.

On November 2011 ''yes'' introduced a Streamer feature within '''''yesMaxHD''''' available to those who purchase the VOD feature, ''yes'' Named this '''''yesMaxTOTAL'''''.

== Technical problems ==
In September and October 2007, satellite television channels in Israel were plagued with signal disruptions, with the north of the country particularly badly affected. Eventually the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]] intervened, and with the help of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and [[Israeli Sea Corps]], discovered that the problems had been caused by the radar systems of Dutch [[UNIFIL]] ships patrolling off the coast of [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/911201.html A nation steps up to rescue yes] Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt; In order to compensate its clientele, yes offered their pay-per-view "DVDbox" channels free to all clients for 2 weeks in October (although it eventually extended beyond that). Later, in an effort to win over many clients who were still displeased, yes offered all of its premium channels free for a period of 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/today/?p=2399 yes to restore confidence with free premium offer] Broadband TV News&lt;/ref&gt;
