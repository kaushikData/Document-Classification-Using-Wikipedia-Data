'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=136–142
| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Band II''' is the range of radio [[frequency|frequencies]] within the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from 87.5 to 108.0&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz]] (MHz).

== Radio ==
Band II is primarily used worldwide for [[FM broadcasting|FM radio broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="Tooley Circuits"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeeJj7aFzU4C&amp;lpg=SA13-PA17&amp;dq=%22Band%20II%22%20VHF&amp;pg=SA13-PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Band%20II%22%20VHF&amp;f=false | title=Electronic Circuits - Fundamentals &amp; Applications | publisher=Routledge | author=Tooley, Mike | year=2007 | isbn=9781136407383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcast television ==

=== Usage in Russia and in other former members of [[International Radio and Television Organisation|OIRT]] ===

In the former Soviet Union and other countries-members of OIRT, frequencies from 76&amp;nbsp;MHz to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz were designated for broadcast television usage.&lt;ref name="gost7845"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://protect.gost.ru/document.aspx?control=7&amp;id=136235 |page = 10 | title=GOST 7845-92 : Broadcast television system.

|-

|-
|3||76-84&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|4||84-92&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|5||92-100&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

Broadcast television channels 1 and 2 are assigned to [[VHF I]] band, channels 6 to 12 are assigned to [[VHF III]] band.

Starting from the early 1990s, frequencies previously allotted to television channels 4 and 5 have been re-allocated for FM radio, thereby harmonizing it with the Western allocation for FM radio service.

'''Bareback sex''' is physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[sexual penetration]], without the use of a [[condom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |year=2006|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I |first2=Tom |last2=Dalzell |first3=Terry |last3=Victor|edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-25937-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YfsEgHLjboC |quote=Bareback - to engage in sex without a condom.|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It most commonly refers to [[anal sex]] between [[men who have sex with men]] without the use of a condom, and may be distinguished from [[unprotected sex]] because of the deliberate act of forgoing condom use that is associated with it.&lt;ref name="Drescher"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jack Drescher, Perry Halkitis, Leo Wilton| title =Barebacking: Psychosocial and Public Health Approaches|publisher =[[CRC Press]]|year = 2006|pages=150–151|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-0789021748|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DR4x0gJcsTUC&amp;pg=PA150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggleton"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Aggleton, Richard Parker| title =Routledge Handbook of Sexuality, Health and Rights|publisher =[[Routledge]]|year = 2010|pages=391–393|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-1135272876|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=mlmOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[slang]] term, ''bareback sex'' comes from the [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] term ''[[bareback riding|bareback]],'' which refers to the practice of riding a [[horse]] without a [[saddle]].

==Etymology==
It is not known when the term (as sexual slang) was first used, although its use did gain momentum in the 1960s with the first appearance in print (as analogous reference) occurring in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Bernard and Joseph Bensman|title=Sexual Patterns in Three Ethnic Subcultures of an American Underclass|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1968|issue=376|page=70|quote=Risk or no risk, boys are generally hostile to the idea of prophylaxis. One objection is phrased purely in terms of the pleasure principle, most colorfully by a Chicago boy who explains why he never uses anything like a rubber, ‘I tried it once. lt's like riding a horse with a saddle instead of bareback.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by [[G.I. (military)|G.I.'s]] during the [[Vietnam War]] when sex without the use of a condom was known as "going in" or "riding" bareback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Gregory R.|title=Words of the Vietnam War: the Slang, Jargon. . .[etc.]|date=1990|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0899504650|page=437|quote=(under “Ride Bareback”) “GI slang for having sexual intercourse without using a condom. See also p. 66 (under “Boom-Boom”) “A GI that had his sex without the use of a condom was known as ‘going in’ or ‘riding’ bareback.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was included in the 1972 publication, ''Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English|date=1972|publisher=Playboy Press|page=20|quote=BAREBACK - Intercourse without any form of contraception, as in "They went at it bareback."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared occasionally in print until the 1980s and then in context to the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]] and the discussion of sexual practices. It did not have widespread use in [[LGBT culture]] until 1997, when there was an increase of discussion regarding condomless sex (as reflected in print publications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peyser|first1=Marc|title=A Deadly Dance: As AIDS Cases Decline Sharply, Some Gay Men Are Returning to Unsafe Sex. They Call It Barebacking|journal=Newsweek|date=September 29, 1997|volume=130|issue=13|page=136|quote=See also The Advocate (Jul 8, 1997) p. 34 (and other various references in 1997; Out [Magazine] (6:1-6) 1997 (various references throughout.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
{{Further|Condom}}
Initially used for [[contraception|contraceptive]] purposes, condoms also came to be used to limit or prevent [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), even after other contraceptive methods were developed. As [[AIDS]] emerged and the sexual transmission of [[HIV]] became known in the 1980s, the use of condoms to prevent infection became much more widespread, especially among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) who engage in [[anal sex]]. At the beginning of the AIDS crisis, in the context of the invention and development of [[safe sex]], the uptake of condoms among Western MSM was so widespread and effective that condom use became established as a norm for sex between men. From 1995, several high-profile HIV positive men{{who|date=April 2012}} declared their refusal to wear condoms with other HIV positive men in gay publications, dubbing the practice ''barebacking.'' While these early articulations of barebacking expressed a concern for HIV prevention, in that they generally referred to dispensing with condoms in the context of sex between people of the same HIV status, the [[moral panic]] which ensued was so pronounced that barebacking came to be framed as a rebellious and transgressive erotic practice for HIV positive and HIV negative people alike, irrespective of the risks of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"&gt;{{citation |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention|journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence and stigma===

A resurgence of barebacking in first-world gay communities during the 1990s has been a frequent topic for gay columnists and editorialists in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', [[Genre magazine|''Genre'' magazine]], and [[Out Magazine|''Out'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Human Condition: Johnny be good |last=Finlayson |first=Iain |authorlink=Iain Finlayson |date=21 June 1998 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-human-condition-johnny-be-good-1166398.html |quote=Whatever happened to that condom moment? 'Bareback', or unprotected, sex is still practiced by up to a third of gay men - because, despite the dangers, it feels liberated, sensuous and like one in the eye for 'sex police'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these articles express concern over bareback sex's popularity, and liken it to irresponsible and reckless behavior, despite the fact that a third of gay men take part in the practice.&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998/&gt; An article in the online resource ''The Body'' lists no fewer than 22 reasons why barebacking has become increasingly acceptable in the gay community.&lt;ref name=sowadsky&gt;See Rick Sowadsky, "Barebacking in the Gay Community," [http://www.thebody.com/content/art2276.html The Body] (May, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons listed are: the recent perception of HIV as a treatable illness one can live with, insufficient sex education, use of drugs such as crystal meth in sexual settings, and fetishization of bareback sex on various porn and dating sites.

Academic works suggest that barebacking is a way to reach for transcendence, to overcome the boredom of everyday average life in a hyper-rationalized society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Holmes |first=Dave |year=2006 |title=Raw Sex as Limit Experience: A Foucauldian Analysis of Unsafe Anal Sex between Men |last2=O'Byrne |first2=Patrick |last3=Gastaldo |first3=Denise |journal=Social Theory &amp; Health |pages=319–333 |volume=4.4 |issue=4 |issn=1477-8211 |oclc=366722101 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700077}} and {{citation |last=Martin |first=James |year=2006 |title=Transcendence Among Gay Men: Implications for HIV Prevention |journal=Sexualities |pages=214–235 |volume=9.2 |issue=2 |issn=1363-4607 |oclc=441346802 |doi=10.1177/1363460706058398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men are dispensing with condoms in the context of seroconcordant sex (sex between two men of the same HIV status). Early articulations of barebacking generally refer to sex between two HIV-positive men. This poses no risk of infecting an HIV-negative person newly with HIV (though it can cause [[HIV superinfection|infection with a new strain of HIV]], hastening disease progression). On this account, barebacking could be considered an early harm reduction strategy, similar to [[serosorting]], which was later endorsed by some public health authorities in the USA.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"/&gt;

Bareback sex has also become more acceptable since the introduction of [[pre exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP). One of the most popular forms of PrEP is [[Truvada]], a medication previously taken for HIV treatment that, when taken properly, has been shown to prevent HIV-negative users from contracting HIV from infected partners. While these drugs do not necessarily prevent the transmission of other STIs, they have stirred a discussion on what "safe" sex without the use of condoms really entails.

A 2005 study by Perry N. Halkitis concluded that the resurgence of barebacking led to an increase in sexually transmitted infections among the MSM community. The study found that of the 448 men who were familiar with barebacking, nearly half reported they had bareback sex in the last three months. In the San Francisco study, fewer men reported engaging in barebacking when the behavior was defined as intentional unprotected anal intercourse with a non-primary partner. Using this definition, 14% of the 390 men who were aware of barebacking reported engaging in the behavior in the past two years. Halkitis and Richard Wolitski also found that HIV-positive MSM were more likely to have bareback sex than were HIV-negative MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Halkitis PN, Drescher J, Wilton L |title=Barebacking: psychosocial and public health approaches |journal=Gay and Lesbian Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=3/4 |pages=14–15 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7890-2174-8 |doi=10.1300/j236v09n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study by Joseph Brennan used textual analysis to read discourse on gay pornography performer Jake Lyons and his decision to perform for bareback studios. Brennan explored the stigma attached to the practice, in particular narratives of 'disposal and disgust' that became associated with the performer, and contributed to a decline in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Joseph|title=‘Bare-backing spoils everything. He's spoiled goods’: Disposal and disgust, a study of retired power bottom twink Jake Lyons|journal=Porn Studies|date=2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=20–33|doi=10.1080/23268743.2015.1074867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bugchasing===

An extreme form of barebacking is [[bugchasing]], in which seronegative gay men actively seek to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023402/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers; Gemma Aldridge, "Bug chasing: Men deliberately trying to catch HIV for sexual thrill in astonishing craze", ''Mirror'', July 7, 2013, https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bug-chasing-men-deliberately-trying-2033433&lt;/ref&gt; These men may seek to contract HIV in order to not have to constantly live in fear of becoming infected.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Brandon Andrew. 2014. "Barebacking with Weber: Re-enchanting the Rational Sexual Order." Social Theory &amp; Health 12: 235-250. DOI: 10.1057/sth.2014.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay pornographic films===
Bareback [[gay pornography]] was standard in "pre-condom" films from the 1970s and early 1980s. As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers. By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex. However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex.&lt;ref name=hivscandalbbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7277000.stm|title=HIV scandal in gay porn industry|first=Madeleine|last=Holt|work=[[BBC]]|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[San Francisco]]-based studio [[Treasure Island Media]], whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include [[Spunk Video]], [[Lucas Entertainment]], SEVP, and [[Eurocreme]]. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as [[Kristen Bjorn]] Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene such as in "El Rancho" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as [[Falcon Entertainment]] and Spunk Video have also reissued older pre-condom films.&lt;ref&gt;"Bareback Classics" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon. For Spunk Video reissues, see Christopher Rage.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors use close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.)

Some bareback pornography studios say that they do not inquire whether their models are HIV positive, but assume that they are infected. For example, Hot Desert Knights (HDK) was one of the studios that initially operated on the assumption that all of their bareback models were HIV positive.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Adams, "The Adams Report: The GayVN Awards Show Highlights" (2002), quotes Jackson Price, the then director of casting for HDK, as saying, "we assume everyone is positive," and as implying that HDK did not require disclosure of any model's HIV status. (This report no longer appears to be available online.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2008 HDK announced that it would begin testing its models for HIV and engage in a process of "sero-sorting", which match HIV-positive performers with other HIV-positive performers, and negative with negative. Critics suggest that sero-sorting may not prevent the development of a multi-strain HIV [[HIV superinfection|"superinfection"]]. By contrast, [[BelAmi]] is one of the studios that claimed from the beginning to test their bareback models for HIV before allowing them to participate in condom-free scenes. A notice on the BelAmi website states: "all our performers are regularly tested for the presence of HIV or other communicable diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731202409/http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|title=BelAmi Video On Demand|archivedate=31 July 2008|work=belamionline.com|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bareback sex'' is used less frequently among heterosexuals.&lt;ref name="aids.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aids.about.com/od/safersexresources/a/barebacking.htm|title=Link Between HIV Infection and Barebacking|author=Mark Cichocki, R.N.|work=About.com Health|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] found that heterosexual women are more likely to bareback when engaging in anal sex than homosexual and bisexual men are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/23/survey-finds-more-straight-women-barebacking-than-gay-men/|title=Survey finds more straight women barebacking than gay men|work=PinkNews|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexual bareback sex, as opposed to [[safe sex]] with condoms, poses an increased risk of STIs whether vaginally or anally, and an increased risk of [[pregnancy]].

== Health risks ==
In addition to sexually transmitted infections, mechanical trauma are the same as in [[anal sex]]. Unprotected anal sex is a risk factor for formation of [[antisperm antibodies]] (ASA) in the recipient. In some people, ASA may cause autoimmune [[infertility]]. Antisperm antibodies impair fertilization, negatively affect the [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] process and impair growth and development of the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo|first=B.|last2=Cardona-Maya|first2=W.|date=October 2013|title=Antisperm antibodies and fertility association|journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas|volume=37|issue=9|pages=571–578|doi=10.1016/j.acuro.2012.11.003|issn=1699-7980|pmid=23428233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfK8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Assisted Reproductive Technology (3 Vols)|last=Rao|first=Kamini|date=2013-09-30|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|year=|isbn=9789350907368|location=|pages=311|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of art|Related articles}}
'''Cantometrics''' ("song measurements") is a method developed by [[Alan Lomax]] and a team of researchers for relating elements of the world's [[tradition]]al vocal music (or [[folk music|folk songs]])  to features of [[sociology|social]] organization as defined via [[George Murdock]]'s  [[Human Relations Area Files]], resulting in a taxonomy of expressive human communications style. Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a "systems-maintaining framework" which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management). 

Instead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in [[linguistics]], [[otolaryngology]] and [[Speech and Language Pathology|voice therapy]]. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of [[vocables]] versus meaningful words); and [[melisma]] ([[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]), to name a few. 

In the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children.... I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style"&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.culturalequity.org/psr-history.jsp Cantometrics: Concept of Style]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the theory==

Lomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co-creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished [[Columbia University]] anthropologist [[Conrad M. Arensberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Author of the pathbreaking ethnographic classic, ''The Irish Countryman: An Anthropological Study'', (1937), Arensberg helped shift the focus of anthropology from the study of exotic primitive peoples to the examination of complex modern societies. See his [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/nyregion/conrad-arensberg-86-dies-hands-on-anthropologist.html  1997 ''New York Times'' obituary.]&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of [[applied anthropology]]; anthropologists Edwin Erickson and Barbara Ayres; and statistician Norman Berkowitz. [[Laban Movement Analysis|Laban shape notation]] specialist [[Irmgard Bartenieff]] &lt;ref&gt;Pioneer physical therapist and developer of [[Bartenieff Fundamentals]], [http://www.culturalequity.org/alanlomax/ce_alanlomax_profile_irmgard_bartenieff.php Irmgard Bartinieff] is profiled on Lomax website [http://www.culturalequity.org/ Culturalequity.org].&lt;/ref&gt; and dancer and movement therapist Forrestine Paulay co-created the Choreometrics movement coding system, for analyzing dance, mapping the movement of the torso, hands, feet, and use of performance space. In 1968 Lomax's research team published a book, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'', in which they stated that, "for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other". 

Gideon D'Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 songs – around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the Columbia mainframe. A companion study of dance, Choreometrics, produced analyses of over 1,500 dance performances. Only a computer was capable of handling this enormous data set and looking for the patterns hidden within. The team, led by programmer Norman Berkowitz, developed a powerful set of statistically driven software tools to sort, separate, and group the performance data. Their analyses resulted in the first ever taxonomy of human performance style and in a series of maps showing the dis-semination of culture across the planet. These were presented to the American Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative volume, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Popular_Songbook.html Gideon D'Arcangelo, "Alan Lomax and the Big Story of Sound" in liner notes to ''The Alan Lomax Popular Song Book'' Rounder CD 82161-1863-1 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Results==

The Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship.  

Other results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system.

Murdock's taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales – for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of  production or permanence of settlement.  When they added factors of expressive communication  to the Murdock  measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture.

==Branching out into Choreometrics==

Three chapters of ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, "Dance, Style, and Culture," Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: "In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.".&lt;ref&gt;Lomax (1968), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture...  The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax et al. (1968) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax's type of analysis, since movement is "not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study of aurally perceived behavior." &lt;ref&gt;Irmgard Bartenieff, "Research in Anthropology: A Study of Dance Styles in Primitive Cultures", Cord Dance Research Annual I (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Films==

A series of short documentary films demonstrated some of  the results of the team's statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms.&lt;ref&gt;A book that Lomax and Paulay wrote about their findings remains in manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; These were: ''Dance &amp; Human History'' (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; ''Palm Play'' (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; ''Step Style'' (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally;&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from Lomax's film ''Step Style'' appeared in the online edition of the [http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/01/30/arts/music/100000001322535/the-lomax-archives.html New York Times of January 31, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Longest Trail'' (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD ''Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay'' produced by John Melville Bishop (Media-Generation, 1974–2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Welsch, in his 2009 review of the DVD in [http://www.media-generation.com/Articles/RhythmsVA.pdf, ''Visual Anthropology'', 22:241-242, 2009.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, cautioned that the films, some of them over 35 years old, now appear dated and warned that the late [[Robert Gardner (anthropologist)|Robert Gardner]], in one of the DVD's special features, was shown chain smoking, nevertheless he judged that students in introductory courses would find the material "dazzling" and pronounced the DVD "must-see for more advanced courses in expressive culture, visual anthropology, and any course involving ethnographic film."&lt;/ref&gt; Improvisational jazz musician and composer [[Roswell Rudd]] later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance.

==Criticisms and responses==
The reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological [[homology (sociology)|homology]].

The musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well. 

Alan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of our samples will hold up. Even "secret" songs generally tend to be stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not primarily concerned with "complete" collections and descriptions, as are most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Grauer noted that: “Cantometrics is a statistical method.  Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one.  There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/cantome2.htm Victor Grauer, "Song and Social Culture, A Response",  ''Musical Traditions'' web magazine, July 27, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantometrics as an educational tool==
The Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Roswell Rudd, quoted in Gideon D’Arcangelo (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Some have likened The Global Jukebox to [[Pandora (radio)|Pandora]], see for example the / interview of Don Fleming by reporter [[John Hockenberry]] on the [[Public Radio International]] [http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere  program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere |date=February 2, 2012 }}, [[The Takeaway (radio)|The Takeaway.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/arts/music/the-alan-lomax-collection-from-the-american-folklife-center.html?pagewanted=all  Larry Rohter, "Folklorist’s Global Jukebox Goes Digital", ''New York Times'' (January 31, 2019)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4733">The '''Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland''' or '''CELCIS''' is an organisation that supports the [[well-being]] of children.

==History==
CELCIS was established in 2011 with the intention being to provide a holistic approach, rather than serving a specialist part of the professionals who deal with looked after children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/protecting/lac/CELCIS |title=Centre for excellence for looked after children in Scotland |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to facilitate collaboration and therefore works with a range of organisations to improve outcomes relating to the lives of looked after children in Scotland. The centre was preceded by the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care (SIRCC), which was a centre of excellence that had been set up in 2000.

Types of work that CELCIS are involved with include supporting policy implementation, oversight of the looked after children strategic group and the provision of training, information resources and consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/12464/1/SB_11-79.pdf | page=12 |title=SPICe Briefing: Educational Attainment of Looked After Children |last=Kidner |first=Camilla |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since August 2012 they have a specific responsibility for identifying the development needs of professionals working with looked after children.&lt;ref name="workforce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpscotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LACSIG-Update-for-CCPS-Jan-2013.pdf |title=Looked After Children Strategic Implementation Group  |publisher=Coalition of Care and Support Providers |date=January 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre are funded by the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celcis.org/about_us/governance/ |title=Governance: Direction, scrutiny, accountability |publisher= Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are hosted by the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.strath.ac.uk/media/ps/rkes/generalweb/CELCIS.pdf |title=Knowledge Exchange.

==International Work==
In 2012 they were commissioned by the [[International Social Service]] to produce the “Moving Forward” report which aims to embed children’s rights in alternative care provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativecareguidelines.org/Portals/46/Moving-forward/Moving-forward-implementing-the-guidelines-ENG.pdf | title=Moving Forward: Implementing the ‘Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children’ |last1=Cantwell |first1=N. |last2=Davidson |first2=J. |last3=Elsley, S. |last4=Milligan |first4=I.|last5=Quinn |last6=N. |publisher=Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |date=2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 they were commissioned by [[SOS Children’s Villages]] to produce "Drumming Together

{{Expert-subject|literature|date=February 2012}}
'''Chiastic structure''', or '''chiastic pattern''', is a [[literary technique]] in [[motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s and other textual passages.  An example of chiastic structure would be two ideas, A and B, together with variants A' and B', being presented as A,B,B',A'.  Alternative names{{cn|date=August 2015}} include '''ring structure''', because the opening and closing 'A' can be viewed as completing a circle, '''palistrophe''',&lt;ref&gt;The term "palistrophe" was coined in:  {{citation |first= Sean E. |last= McEvenue |title= The Narrative Style of the Priestly Writer |publisher= Biblical Institute Press |place= Rome |year= 1971 |oclc= 292126 }}.{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or symmetric structure. It may be regarded as [[chiasmus]] scaled up from clauses to larger units of text.

These often [[symmetric]]al patterns are commonly found in ancient literature such as the [[epic poetry]] of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Classicist Bruno Gentili describes this technique as "the cyclical, circular, or 'ring' pattern (''ring composition''). Here the idea that introduced a compositional section is repeated at its conclusion, so that the whole passage is framed by material of identical content"&lt;ref&gt;Gentili, Bruno, ''Poetry and Its Public in Ancient Greece: From Homer to the Fifth Century'', trans. A. Thomas Cole (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), 48&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile in classical prose, scholars often find chiastic narrative techniques in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Herodotus frequently uses ring composition or ‘epic regression’ as a way of supplying background information for something discussed in the narrative. First an event is mentioned briefly, then its precedents are reviewed in reverse chronological order as far back as necessary; at that point the narrative reverses itself and moves forward in chronological order until the event in the main narrative line is reached again."&lt;ref&gt;Boedeker, Deborah. "Epic Heritage and Mythical Patterns in Herodotus." Published in ''Companion to Herodotus'', ed. Egbert J. Bakker, Irene J. F. de Jong, and Hans van Wees (Brill, 2002), 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Various chiastic structures are also seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Quran]]. 

Chiastic structures also appear in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]]. The [[contrapposto]] technique of sculpture in Ancient Greek sculpture often lead to this chiastic structure, such as in the [[Diadumenos]] of [[Polykleitos]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Chiastic.svg|thumb|120px|When read left to right, up to down, the first topic (A) is reiterated as the last, and the middle concept (B) appears twice in succession. (Also, the middle concept could appear just once.)]]
The term ''chiastic'' derives from the mid-17th century term [[chiasmus]], which refers to a ''crosswise arrangement'' of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. ''Chiasmus'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''khiasmos'', a word that is ''khiazein'', marked with the letter ''[[Chi (letter)|khi]]''. From ''khi'' comes ''chi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Chiasmus |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiasmus |work=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chi'' is made up of two lines crossing each other as in the shape of an ''X''. The line that starts leftmost on top, comes down, and  is rightmost on the bottom, and vice versa. If one thinks of the lines as concepts, one sees that concept A, which comes first, is also last, and concept B, which comes after A, comes before A. If one adds in more lines representing other concepts, one gets a chiastic structure with more concepts.
See Proverbs 1:20-33; vs 20-21=A, v 22=B, v 23=C, vs 24-25=D, vs 26-28=E, vs 29-30=D', v 31=C', v 32=B', v 33=A'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|1993|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemonic device==
[[Oral literature]] is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. In his study of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], Cedric Whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure "of the most amazing virtuosity" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Cedric M. |last= Whitman |title= Homer and the Heroic Tradition |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |year= 1958 |oclc= 310021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Hebrew Bible==

{{main|Book of Daniel#Chiasm in the Aramaic section}}

In 1986, [[William H. Shea]] proposed that the [[Book of Daniel]] is composed of a ''double-chiasm''. He argued that the chiastic structure is emphasized by the two languages that the book is written in: [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew]]. The first chiasm is written in ''Aramaic'' from chapters 2-7 following an ABC...CBA pattern. The second chiasm is in ''Hebrew'' from chapters 8-12, also using the ABC...CBA pattern. However, Shea represents Daniel 9:26 as "D", a break in the center of the pattern.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1986|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Wenham]] has analyzed the [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood narrative]] and has shown that it is essentially an elaborate chiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "The Coherence of the Flood Narrative" ''Vetus Testamentum'' 28 (1978) 336–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the earlier study of grammatical structure by F. I.  Andersen,&lt;ref&gt;F. I. Andersen, ''The Sentence in Biblical Hebrew'' (The Hague, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham illustrated a chiastic structure as displayed in the following two tables.

{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiastic structure of the Genesis Flood Narrative
|-
|A: Noah and his sons (Gen 6:10)
:B: All life on earth (6:13:a)
::C: Curse on earth (6:13:b)
:::D: Flood announced (6:7)
::::E: Ark (6:14-16)
:::::F: All living creatures (6:17–20 )
::::::G: Food (6:21)
:::::::H: Animals in man’s hands (7:2–3)
::::::::I: Entering the Ark (7:13–16)
:::::::::J: Waters increase (7:17–20)
::::::::::X: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::::::::J: Waters decrease (8:13–14)
::::::::I': Exiting the Ark (8:15–19) 
:::::::H': Animals (9:2,3)
::::::G': Food (9:3,4)
:::::F': All living creatures (9:10a)
::::E':  Ark (9:10b)
:::D’:No flood in future (9:11)
::C': Blessing on earth (9:12–17)
:B': All life on earth (9:16)
A: Noah and his sons (9:18,19a)
|}

Within this overall structure, there is a numerical mini-chiasm of 7s, 40s, and 150s:
{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiasm of the numbers 7, 40, and 150
|-
|α: Seven days waiting to enter Ark (7:4)
:β: Second mention of seven days waiting (7:10)
::γ: 40 days (7:17)
:::δ: 150 days (7:24)
::::χ: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::δ': 150 days (8:3)
::γ': 40 days (8:6)
:β': Seven days waiting for dove (8:10)
α': Second seven days waiting for dove (8:12)
|}

The two mentions of the 150 days refer to the same period, and the first 40 days (7:13,17) are part of the 150 days. All this is consistent with the date in 8:4. There was no compelling reason to repeat the first 7-day figure of waiting to enter the Ark except for the corresponding two 7-day figures for the dove. The second mention of the 150 days was also because of the chiasmus. The chiastic structure explains the repetition of these figures. Before these ancient literary conventions were recognized, followers of the [[Documentary Hypothesis]] explained the repetition by hypothesizing two different authors or redactors (J or Jahwist and P or Priestly sources). The repetition may also show the literary artistry of a single author or editor, either working from one tradition or weaving together the J and P sources in chiastic fashion.

==Use in the Quran==

While there are many examples of chiastic structure in the Quran, perhaps the most well known is in the 'Verse of the Throne' or 'Ayat al-Kursi'. The verse contains 9 sentences which exhibit chiasmus, but perhaps more interesting is that it is found in the longest chapter of the Quran, [[Al-Baqara]], which itself contains a fractal chiastic structure in its 286 verses, i.e. where each (outer) chiasm is composed of (inner) chiastic structures reflected in some sense in the analogue outer chiasm. One such analysis of the chapter is shown below (from &lt;ref&gt;Abu Zakariya, "Ring Theory: the Quran’s Structural Coherence", September 21 2015, https://www.islam21c.com/islamic-thought/ring-theory-the-qurans-structural-coherence/ &lt;/ref&gt;; alternate and/or more detail analyses can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Raymond K. Farrin, "Surat al‐Baqara: A Structural Analysis", January 19 2010, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1478-1913.2009.01299.x&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hassan uz Zaman Shamol, http://understandquran.com/coherence-evidence-of-the-qurans-literary-depth.html&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Muhammad Rizvi , " Symmetry in Sura al-Baqara", June 01 2018, https://tgminitiative.blogspot.com/2018/06/symmetry-in-sura-al-baqara.html &lt;/ref&gt;).

==ABC…CBA pattern==

===''Beowulf''===
In literary texts with a possible [[Oral literature|oral]] origin, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', chiastic or ring structures are often found on an intermediate level, that is, between the (verbal and/or grammatical) level of [[chiasmus]] and the higher level of chiastic structure such as noted in the Torah. John D. Niles provides examples of chiastic figures on all three levels.&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that for the instances of ll. 12–19, the announcement of the birth of (Danish) Beowulf, are chiastic, more or less on the verbal level, that of chiasmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each of the three main fights are organized chiastically, a chiastic structure on the level of verse paragraphs and shorter passages. For instance, the simplest of these three, the fight with [[Grendel]], is schematized as follows:

A: Preliminaries
*Grendel approaching
*Grendel rejoicing
*Grendel devouring Handscioh
:B: Grendel's wish to flee ("fingers cracked")
::C: Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:::HEOROT IN DANGER OF FALLING
::C': Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:B': "Joints burst"; Grendel forced to flee
A': Aftermath
*Grendel slinking back toward fens
*Beowulf rejoicing
*Beowulf left with Grendel's arm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=925–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Niles provides a diagram of the highest level of chiastic structure, the organization of the poem as a whole, in an introduction, three major fights with interludes before and after the second fight (with Grendel's mother), and an epilogue. To illustrate, he analyzes Prologue and Epilogue as follows:

'''Prologue'''&lt;br&gt;
A: Panegyric for [[Scyld]]&lt;br&gt;
:B: Scyld's funeral
::C: History of Danes before [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]]
:::D: Hrothgar's order to build [[Heorot]]

'''Epilogue'''&lt;br&gt;
:::D': Beowulf's order to build his barrow
::C': History of [[Geats]] after Beowulf ("messenger's prophecy")
:B': Beowulf's funeral
A': Eulogy for Beowulf&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|p=930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Paradise Lost''===
The overall chiastic structure of  [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' is also of the ABC…CBA type:

A: Satan's sinful actions (Books 1–3)&lt;br&gt;
:B: Entry into Paradise (Book 4)
::C: War in heaven (destruction) (Books 5–6)
::C': Creation of the world (Books 7–8)
:B': Loss of paradise (Book 9)

In [[computational complexity theory]], a [[computational problem]] is '''complete''' for a [[complexity class]] if it is, in a technical sense, among the "hardest" (or "most expressive") problems in the complexity class.

More formally, a problem ''p'' is called '''hard''' for a complexity class ''C'' under a given type of [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] if there exists a reduction (of the given type) from any problem in ''C'' to ''p''.  If a problem is both '''hard''' for the class and a member of the class, it is '''complete''' for that class (for that type of reduction).

A problem that is complete for a class ''C'' is said to be '''C-complete''', and the class of all problems complete for ''C'' is denoted '''C-complete'''. The first complete class to be defined and the most well-known is [[NP-complete]], a class that contains many difficult-to-solve problems that arise in practice. Similarly, a problem hard for a class ''C'' is called '''C-hard''', e.g. [[NP-hard]].

Normally it is assumed that the reduction in question does not have higher computational complexity than the class itself. Therefore, it may be said that if a ''C-complete'' problem has a "computationally easy" solution, then all problems in "C" have an "easy" solution.

Generally, complexity classes that have a recursive enumeration have known complete problems, whereas classes that lack a recursive enumeration have none. For example, [[NP (complexity)|NP]], [[co-NP]], [[PLS (complexity)|PLS]], [[PPA (complexity)|PPA]] all have known natural complete problems, while [[RP (complexity)|RP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]], [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] and [[TFNP]] have no known complete problems (although such a problem may be discovered in the future).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

There are classes without complete problems. For example, Sipser showed that there is a language '''M''' such that '''BPP'''&lt;sup&gt;'''M'''&lt;/sup&gt; ('''BPP''' with [[oracle machine|oracle]] '''M''') has no complete problems.&lt;ref&gt;M. Sipser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17053">In cultural and social studies, configurations are patterns of [[behaviour]], movement (→[[movement culture]]) and [[thinking]], which research observes when analysing different [[cultures]] and/ or historical changes. The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative [[anthropological]] studies and by [[cultural history]]. '''Configurational analysis''' became a special method by the Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] during the 1970s and later by [[body culture studies]] in Denmark.
	
'''Configurational analysis''' is marked by its distance towards the [[history of ideas]] and [[intention]]s, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) and particularly in [[materialist]] phenomenology.

== Configurations in earlier cultural studies ==

Configurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century.

[[Ruth Benedict]] (1934) contributed to the anthropology of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “[[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]] [[:de:Gestalt]]”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “[[culture]]”. It was used for comparison – between the [[Hopi]] Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of [[cultural relativism]]: Each culture has configurations of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth 1934: ''Patterns of Culture.'' Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a "materialist [[psychoanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston 1938: ''La psychanalyse du feu;'' English 1964: ''Psychoanalysis of fire.'' Boston: Beacon&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for [[Michel Foucault]].

[[Norbert Elias]] (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as ''figuration [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/figuration]'' – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as ''das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden'' (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), ''Spannungsgefüge'' (relations of suspense), ''Interdependenz der Spieler'' (interdependence of players), and ''das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance'' (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power).&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert 1939: ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation. Soziogenetische und psychogenetische Untersuchungen.'' Frankfort/ Main Suhrkamp; English 1982: ''The Civilizing Process.'' Oxford Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This became a key to his sociology of [[civilization]].

[[Michel Foucault]] (1966) used the term ''la configuration'' in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in [[epistemological]] disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel 1966: ''Les mots et les choses.'' Paris: Gallimard; English 1970: ''The Order of Things. An Archeology of the Human Sciences.'' New York: Pantheon&lt;/ref&gt;

: The age of [[Renaissance]] focused on the chains of similarities, going from sign to sign. [[Cervantes]] shaped an ironical picture of this configuration by the phantasmas of [[Don Quixote]].

: The 18th century constructed the tableau as an universal grammar. On this base, [[Linné]] constructed the genealogical trees of plants and animals as a tableau of life. An ironical picture of this configuration was given by [[Laurence Sterne]] in his [[Tristram Shandy]].

: The 19th century discovered [[progress (history)|progress]] and [[evolution]] – in [[life science]] as [[natural history]], in economy as [[Manufacturing|production]], and in language as [[linguistic history]]. On the background of these modern configurations, which took their form around 1800, individual [[subjectivity]] was constructed, as well as the dynamic of industrial life developed.

There are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a [[post-modern]] age.

== Configurations in historical behaviour studies ==

Configurational analysis (in German ''Konfigurationsanalyse'') became a particular methodological approach in the framework of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]], as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and [[Henning Eichberg]]. Nitschke analyzed ''raum-zeitliche Muster'' (patterns of space and time) and ''Körperanordnungen'' (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of [[art]] and patterns of [[social behavior]]. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog; id. 1975 (ed.): ''Verhaltenswandel in der industriellen Revolution.'' Stuttgart: Kohlhammer&lt;/ref&gt;

This analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: [[mentality]] ([[Georges Duby]]), affect control ([[Norbert Elias]]) (→[[Affect control theory]]), perception ([[Lucien Febvre]]), structural thinking ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]), needs ([[David McClelland]]), and interaction ([[George Herbert Mead]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1981: ''Historische Verhaltensforschung.'' Stuttgart: Ulmer&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of [[historiography]] explaining history by the aims of its actors ([[pragmatism]]), as an expression of [[weltanschauung]] ([[psychology]] and [[history of ideas]]) or by interests (in [[social history]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad-Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog&lt;/ref&gt;

The configurational analysis was especially applied to [[comparative]] and historical studies of [[sport]] and [[dance]] as indicators of [[social change]]. The [[comparative]] analysis of [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], [[ball games]], [[equestrianism]], [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], and [[dance]] showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of [[suspense]], the principle of [[competition]], and the production of result tables. The configurations of [[movement culture]] prefigured the patterns of [[productivity]] orientation, which characterized the [[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eichberg, Henning 1978: ''Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit. Sport und Tanz im gesellschaftlichen Wandel des 18./19. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta&lt;/ref&gt;

The applied concept of “configuration” was here different from "system" (→[[cultural system]]) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non-systematic), from “style” (being more [[aesthetic]] and having undertones of taste, [[subjectivity]] and stylization), and from “[[structure]]” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from [[structural functionalism]] in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change.

Configurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of [[reality]]. They give an epochal pattern of [[perception]] which concurrently defines a framework for action.  But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal "reality" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August (1962): ''Heilige in dieser Welt. Persönliche Autorität und politische Wirksamkeit''. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer; Kalckhoff, Andreas (1982): "Historische Verhaltensforschung: Ethnologie unserer Vergangenheit. Die Konfiguration eines Aufstandes im 10. Jahrhundert", in Gehlen, Rolf &amp; Wolf, Bernd (eds.): ''Werner Müller zu seinem 75.Geburtstag, Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand 11''. Berlin: Karin Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configurations in body culture studies ==

Studies of [[Human body|body]] culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences; Eichberg, Henning 1998: ''Body Cultures.'' London: Routledge; id. - 2001: “Thinking contradictions. Towards a methodology of configurational analysis, or: How to reconstruct the societal signification of movement culture and sport.” In: Knut Dietrich (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, 10-32; id. 2010: ''Bodily Democracy.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular [[festivity]], [[fitness culture]] (→[[physical fitness]]), sportive and non-sportive [[ball games]], sport [[racing]] and [[parcour]], different [[outdoor activities]], and different [[health]] cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of [[institutions]] and [[idea]]s (→[[Base and superstructure]]), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests.

: ''Time of bodily movement'' is marked, among others, by contradictions between acceleration and slowness – between living rhythm and mechanical pace – between linear-abstract and irreversible time – between cyclical, progressing and situational time. Historical change saw for instance the transformation from the noble [[exercises]] of the eighteenth century with their circulating and formally measured patterns to modern [[gymnastics]] and [[sports]] with their patterns of speed, acceleration, and flow, which characterized industrial behaviour more generally.

: ''Space of bodily movement'' is characterized by contradictions between the straight line and the [[labyrinth]] – between connection and parcellation of spaces – between geometrical and directed space – between space, place and intermediary space. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s study of the [[panopticon]] as a specific modern way of organising the space of movement and bodily visibility around 1800 showed the societal depth of this analysis.

: ''Energy of bodily movement'' consists of a multiplicity of different atmospheres, radiations, moods and modes of attunement. Modern suspension ([[suspense]], tension, thrill, excitement – in German ''Spannung''') emerged in eighteenth and nineteenth century’s [[boxing]] and [[ball games]] at the same time as it appeared in [[detective novels]]. This coincidence was illustrative for the configurational change towards [[industrial society]]. Social energy was also illustrated by the study of [[laughter]] in the tradition of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s analysis of [[Renaissance]] society.

: ''[[Interpersonal relations]]'' in bodily movement tell about power and [[gender]] – about winners and losers – about you- and we-relations in motion. The study of sports has especially been enriched by the attention to gender unbalances in body culture.

: ''[[Objectification]] of bodily movement'' is especially characteristic for modern body cultures. Bodily movement is reified in a tension between process and result – between [[social production]], reproduction and a-productive encounters in bodily activity – between producing data or pictures by movement. The production of records by modern sports has been a central point for understanding modern industrial behaviour.

: Above these basic body-cultural processes, body culture shows patterns of organizational and institutional character as well as the meanings and ideas, which are ascribed to bodily practices. Mainstream studies of sport often over-emphasize these ''superstructures'' (→[[Base and superstructure]]), while the configurational analysis of body culture gives priority to the focus on bodily practice, in the framework of a [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

== Further configurational approaches ==

Configurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies.

: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1966/67, 1979) launched the concept of ”[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]” to describe patterns of action, of bodily practice and presentation, of taste and aesthetic form (comparable to the [[Gothic style]] of Medieval  cathedrals). Like configuration, habitus was illustrative for a certain homology, which could be found inside a given social formation or class and as distinction between different [[social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre 1966/67: "Champs intellectuel et projet créateur." In: ''Temps modernes'', 22, 865-906; id. 1979: ''La distinction.'' Paris: Minuit. – English 1984: ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Peter Sloterdijk]] (1998/99) developed a cultural ”morphology”, which described the [[psychosocial]] geometry of people’s living space and inhabitations, their world and their understanding of God. Micro- and macrospheres were related to each other by characteristic configurations.&lt;ref&gt;Sloterdijk, Peter 1998/2004: ''Sphären. Plurale Sphärologie.'' Vols.1-3, Frankfurt/Main: Suhrkamp&lt;/ref&gt;

In any of these approaches, “configuration” made it possible to compare concrete human practice – i.e. “material” bodily phenomena – with larger spheres of [[society]] and [[culture]].

'''Connectionism''' is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|Connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]

==Basic principles==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]].

===Spreading activation===
{{Main|Spreading activation}}
In most connectionist models, networks change over time.  A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is ''activation''. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit.  For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [[probability]] that the neuron would generate an [[action potential]] spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it.  Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks}}
Neural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Most of the variety among neural network models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

Connectionists are in agreement that [[recurrent neural networks]] (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than [[feedforward neural networks]] (directed networks with no cycles, called [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]]. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novo|first=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-03|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate [[gradient descent]] over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the [[partial derivative]] of the error surface with respect to the weight. [[Backpropagation]] (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.

==History==

Connectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.

===Parallel distributed processing===

The prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as '''parallel distributed processing''' (PDP). It was an [[artificial neural network]] approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.  It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:

* A set of ''processing units'', represented by a [[set (computer science)|set]] of integers.
* An ''activation'' for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* An ''output function'' for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations.
* A ''pattern of connectivity'' among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength.
* A ''propagation rule'' spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units.
* An ''activation rule'' for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation.
* A ''[[learning rule]]'' for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables.
* An ''environment'' that provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some [[subset]] of the units.

A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)'' and ''Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)'', by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term "connectionism" is not used in the books.

===Earlier work===
PDP's direct roots were the [[perceptron]] theories of researchers such as [[Frank Rosenblatt]] from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book ''Perceptrons'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]], published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the [[exclusive disjunction]] (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8| title = Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators| journal = Neural Networks| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 359| year = 1989| last1 = Hornik | first1 = K. | last2 = Stinchcombe | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] ([[Artificial neuron|MP neuron]]), [[Donald Olding Hebb]], and [[Karl Lashley]]. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s.  Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments.

===Connectionism apart from PDP===
Though PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.

Many connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|url= |location= |publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0262510486 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.

In the 1950s, [[Friedrich Hayek]] proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.

There are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as [[Ron Sun]]).

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} thus the debate persisted. {{As of | 2016}}, progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.

The recent{{when|date=February 2016}} popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|arxiv=1410.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

'''Correctional psychology''' is the application of basic and applied psychological science or scientifically-oriented professional practice to the justice system to enable the proper classification, treatment, and management of offenders with the goal of reducing risk and improving public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psych-law.lab.asu.edu/forensic--correctional-psychology.html|title=Forensic &amp; Correctional Psychology|website=CLINICAL AND LEGAL JUDGMENT LAB|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other objectives of correctional psychology include contributing to the safety and well-being of staff and  offenders by meeting standards of care for mentally-ill individuals, reducing conflict, creating, monitoring, and providing treatment and rehabilitation programs.&lt;ref&gt;SAGE Publications. (2010, July 8). Revised standards for psychology services in jails, prisons, correctional facilities and agencies. ''ScienceDaily''. Retrieved November 20, 2018 from www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100708171353.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
In the 1900s, the bulk of work under correctional psychology was deciphering who was “feeble minded” and who would most likely have a long life of committing crimes. In 1913, correctional psychology was integrated into the United State’s correctional psychology system,  particularly in a women’s penitentiary in New York. Eleanor Rowland was the first psychologist who determined what offenders could benefit from being placed in programs and who could be safe for society. This process is called ''custody decisions'' or ''treatment decisions''. The first of its kind in the prison classification system, it was integrated into facilities in New Jersey in 1918, also becoming the first state to hire psychologists within correctional facilities. Then in 1924, Wisconsin became the first state to allow psychological evaluations in its prison systems and implemented applications for parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dyadic developmental psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment method for families that have children with symptoms of [[emotional disorder]]s, including [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] and disorders of [[Attachment disorder|attachment]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman, A. 2008 pp.329-337"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., &amp; Hughes, D., (2008) "Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: An evidence-based treatment for children with complex trauma and disorders of attachment," Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work, 13, pp.329-337&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Daniel Hughes as an intervention for children whose emotional distress resulted from earlier separation from familiar caregivers.&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;Hughes, D.

Dyadic developmental therapy principally involves creating a "playful, accepting, curious, and empathic" environment in which the therapist attunes to the child's "subjective experiences" and reflects this back to the child by means of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movements, voice tone, timing and touch, "co-regulates" emotional affect and "co-constructs" an alternative autobiographical narrative with the child. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy also makes use of [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] strategies. The "dyad" referred to must eventually be the parent-child dyad. The active presence of the primary caregiver is preferred but not required.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

A study by Arthur Becker-Weidman in 2006, which suggested that dyadic developmental therapy is more effective than the "usual treatment methods" for [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]],&lt;ref name="bw1"&gt;Becker-Weidman.

Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC). According to the APSAC Taskforce Report and Reply, dyadic developmental psychotherapy does not meet the criteria for designation as "evidence based" nor provide a basis for conclusions about "usual treatment methods".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al." &gt;Chaffin, M. et al.

Saunders  Reply to Letters  Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 research synthesis described the approach as a "supported and acceptable" treatment,&lt;ref name= "Craven"&gt;Craven &amp; Lee, (2006), "Therapeutic Interventions for Foster Children: A systematic Research Synthesis," Research on Social Work Practice, Vol. 16, #3, May 2006, pp. 287-304&lt;/ref&gt; but this conclusion has also proved controversial.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; A 2013 review of research recommended caution about this method of therapy, arguing that it has "no support for claims of effectiveness at any level of evidence" and a questionable theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="mercer2014"&gt;Mercer, Jean (2014). "Examining Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Adopted and Foster Children: A Review of Research and Theory", ''Research on Social Work Practice November'', 24(6), pp. 715-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy is based on the theory that maltreated infants not only frequently have [[Attachment in children|disorganized attachments]] but also, as they mature, are likely to develop rigid self-reliance that becomes a compulsive need to control all aspects of their environment. Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

It is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states "Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

The therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.

==Methods==

Firstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes "The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.

The aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. "As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words." (Hughes 2004 p18)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==
DDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making "a real logical jump" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"&gt;Pignotti, M., &amp; Mercer, J. (2007). Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited.   Research on Social Work Practice, 17 (4),  pp. 513–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques—features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book "Facilitating Developmental Attachment", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of "attachment therapies by another name", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self."&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997"&gt;Daniel A. Hughes (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205224739/http://danielahughes.homestead.com/fdaintro.html Facilitating Developmental Attachment: The Road to Emotional Recovery and Behavioral Change in Foster and Adopted Children]. Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Taskforce report on attachment disorder, reactive attachment disorder and attachment therapy, published in 2006, places Hughes and Becker-Weidman within the attachment therapy paradigm and indeed specifically cites Becker-Weidman for, amongst other things, the use of age regression, though not for coercive or restraining practices (p.&amp;nbsp;79). They also describe DDP as an attachment therapy in their November 2006 Reply to Letters.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}} "Dr. Becker-Weidman is cited three times in the body of the report, none of which refer to coercive techniques. The first citation references his Web site's assertion that traditional therapies are either ineffective or harmful (p. 78). The second citation references his recommendation that children be encouraged to regress to an earlier age as part of treatment (p. 79). The third citation references his assertions, which we believe are unsupported, about practicing an evidence-based treatment (p. 85)."&lt;/ref&gt; Becker-Weidman had stated in his letter to the Taskforce that it was essential to treat a child at its developmental rather than chronological level, but the Taskforce in its November 2006 Reply to Letters disagreed (p.&amp;nbsp;382).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman Letter"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman, Letter to the Editor, Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 379, {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292632}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taskforce in their ''Reply to Letters'' describe Hughes as "a leading [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapist]]" and cite Hughes (together with Kelly and Popper) as examples of attachment therapists who have more recently developed their practices away from the more concerning attachment therapy techniques (p.&amp;nbsp;383).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply3"&gt;"Hughes went on to describe how his own practice of attachment therapy has changed during the years, specifically in terms of less emphasis on parental victory in power struggles, less use of holding techniques, and rejection of cathartic or dysregulated ventilation of past trauma in favor of approaches that sound very similar to well-supported gradual exposure techniques. Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was "evidence based" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman/Kansas"&gt;Becker-Weidmann, A. (3/7/2004). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, retrieved
3/20/2004 from http://www.center4familydevelop.com/developmentalpsych.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uta et al."&gt;Uta M. Walter, U., M. and Petr, C. Best Practices in Children's Mental Health: "Reactive Attachment Disorder: Concepts, Treatment and Research" Produced by the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare in conjunction with Kansas Social Rehabilitation Services pp 10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' model is described as more clearly incorporating researched concerns about 'pushing' children to revisit trauma (as this can re-traumatize victims) and as having integrated established principles of trauma treatment into his approach. Avoiding dysregulation is described by Hughes as a primary treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Uta et al."/&gt;

Prior and Glaser state that Hughes's therapy 'reads' as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with 'little application of attachment theory', but do not include it in their section on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Prior 2006"&gt;Prior, V., and Glaser, D. (2006). ''Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Child and adolescent mental health series. | p268 | {{ISBN|1-84310-245-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trowell, while admiring Hughes's clinical skills, stated that "Parents and carers need their own specific parent work and the children and young people need specific work tailored to their needs ... parents with their own unmet attachment needs from childhood may significantly inhibit their ability to speak frankly with, and feel supported by professionals aiming to help their children".&lt;ref&gt;Trowell, J. (2004). Reflections on 'an attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people'. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 6(3), 279-283&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the use of facial expressions in attempts at attunement, Trowell noted, "although the therapist may look and feel sad, the young person may see this as a provocation-- either hit out or the therapist may be perceived to be triumphant (the facial expression may be misread)" (p.&amp;nbsp;281). Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that "There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically."

==Evidence==
Two research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"/&gt; The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.  The study also used the [[Attachment therapy|Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire]] as a measure,&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; which has not been empirically validated for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt; Statistical comparisons were performed using multiple [[t-test]]s rather than an [[analysis of variance]]; this has been criticized because t-tests increase the chance of finding any significant differences.&lt;ref name="mercer2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mercer J | year = 2015 | title = Revisiting an Article About Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: The Life Cycle of a Woozle | journal = Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | doi  = 10.1007/s10560-015-0399-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment group comprised thirty-four subjects whose cases were closed in 2000/01. This was compared to a "usual care group" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of "usual care" or clarify why the "usual care" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

In the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

Becker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"/&gt; The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt; Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.&lt;ref name="Letter to the Editor"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | 
&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.&lt;ref name="Reply p3"&gt;"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time." Reply to Letters p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven &amp; Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, &amp; Hanson (2004) system.&lt;ref name= "Craven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2004"&gt;Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., &amp; Hanson, R.F.

Research on Social Work Practice, 16, pp338-357&lt;/ref&gt; They considered only two therapies aimed at treating disorders of attachment, each of which was represented by a single study: dyadic developmental psychotherapy and holding therapy.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman 2004"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A. (2004). Dyadic developmental psychotherapy: An effective treatment for children with trauma-attachment disorders.

Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 29, 303-313&lt;/ref&gt; They placed both in Category 3 as "supported and acceptable". This classification means that the evidence basis is weak, but that there is no evidence of harm done by the treatment. The Craven &amp; Lee classification report has been criticized as unduly favourable.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; This critique noted the absence of a comprehensive manual giving details of the dyadic developmental psychotherapy intervention—one of the necessary criteria for assessment using the Saunders et al. guidelines, and one without which no outcome study can be placed in any of the available categories. Craven and Lee rebutted this paper in a reply that concentrated on holding therapy rather than dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Craven &amp; Lee 2007"&gt;Lee, R.E., &amp; Craven, P. (2007). Reply to Pignotti and Mercer: Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions.  Research on Social Work Practice, 17(4),  pp 520-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears from the reports that attachment therapy techniques may have been used in addition to standard DDP. The therapist in Becker-Weidman's study instructed parents to use the "[[Attachment therapy#Parenting techniques|attachment parenting methods]]" of two authors who are described by Jean Mercer as advocating "coercive and intimidating approaches to children in treatment", specifically physical restraint and withholding of food and drink. Because of this deviation from the modern presentation of DDP, Mercer argues that the study cannot be considered a test of DDP in its current form.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Mercer cites Becker-Weidman's research as an example of the [[Woozle effect]], in which "flawed, limited, or exaggerated data" is uncritically repeated and republished until it achieves popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt;

'''Ecocity Builders''' is a 501c non profit located in [[Oakland, California]] that provides advocacy, consulting, and education in [[Urban planning#Sustainable development and sustainability|sustainable city planning]] with a focus on access by proximity and pedestrian-oriented development. Ecocity Builders also implements urban design projects utilizing a large network of alliances with city governments, businesses and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. Ecocity Builders' approach is based the work of founder [[Richard Register]], an American artist, peace activist and urban theorist.

==Core Principles==

Ecocity Builders is primarily concerned with promoting the creation of [[ecocity|ecocities]], a phrase first coined by Richard Register at the 1st International Ecocity Conference in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/2014/07/14/firsts-observing-our-ecocity-influence-unfolding/ |title=Firsts: Observing our ecocity influence unfolding |author=Richard Register |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.T.A. Pickett, M.L. Cadenasso, and Brian McGrath, ‘’Resilience in Ecology and Urban Design: Linking Theory and Practice for Sustainable Cities.’’ (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013), pp. 290-219&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders defines an ecocity as an "ecologically healthy human settlement modeled on the self-sustaining resilient structure and function of natural [[ecosystem]]s and living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/why-ecocities/ecocity-definition/ |title=Ecocities: Definition |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecocity can encompass any size of settlement, from neighborhood or village up to metropolis, that functions in harmony with the ecosystems of which it is part. These greater environmental systems include the [[Drainage basin|watershed]], [[bioregion]], and ultimately, of the planet, as well as human social systems such as local, regional, national and world economic, governmental, and cultural exchange systems.

[[Biometrics]] is central to the Ecocity concept through the analogy of the cities as living organisms. Cities (including their inhabitants) exhibit and require systems for movement (transport), respiration (processes to obtain energy), sensitivity (responding to its environment), growth (evolving/changing over time), reproduction (including education, construction, planning and development, etc.), excretion (outputs and wastes), and nutrition (need for air, water, soil, food for inhabitants, materials, etc.).

Ecocities exhibit characteristic design elements such as pedestrian-oriented "nodes" or centers of resources and social interaction, mixed-use planning, pervasive natural features (gardens, urban agriculture, parks), de-emphasis on individual vehicular transit, and equitable access to resources. Register's ecocities are influenced by the [[arcology]] movement including an emphasis on hyperstructures—large, complex interconnected buildings. Register has published collections of his extensive drawings of ecocity plans and interventions in several books (see “Sources”).

==History and Early Years==

Ecocity Builders was founded by Richard Register in 1992 in order to further specific aims of the first International Ecocity Conference (Berkeley, 1990). The first conference was convened by the Urban Ecology group, an organization also founded by Richard Register. Ecocity Builders went on to involve many of the same key actors as Urban Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us: History |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/about-us/history/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders' early years were characterized by a number of local projects in the [[San Francisco East Bay]], primarily [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. These projects included creek daylighting Cordonices Creek, Slow Streets, and community projects.

===Creek Daylighting===

Ecocity Builders flagship project included one of the earliest daylighted and [[Stream restoration|restored creek beds]] in the United States. The [[Codornices Creek]] project, 1994, removed the water channel from its cement culvert along the Albany/Oakland border and created a mile-long park. Ecocity Builders collaborated with the [http://urbancreeks.org/ Urban Creeks Council], who applied for and received $25,000 from the Department of Water Resources Board to fund the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codornices Creek |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/codornices-creek/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving the World |author=Richard Register |url=http://www.culturechange.org/issue10/rregister.html |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second lower half of the creek park was restored in 2004 on a budget of $2.1 million under the auspices of the [http://www.codornicescreekwatershed.org/projects.htm Codornices Creek Watershed Council].

===Depaving===

Ecocity Builders helped plan and provided support for a variety of small to medium-sized depaving projects in Berkeley. Examples include removing five parking spaces at University Avenue Homes' low income residence for a garden, and Halcyon Commons.&lt;ref name="Richard Register, 2006"&gt;Richard Register, ''Ecocities: Building Cities in Balance with Nature'' (Gabriola Island, BC, Canada: New Society Publishers, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The latter converted a 28 space parking lot into a community-designed mini-park featuring a large grassy area surrounded by flowering shrubs and trees, a picnic area, and a tire swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/depaving/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow Streets===

Starting in 1979 Richard Register and other Berkeley activists began advocating the City of Berkeley for traffic-calming street plans based on the Australian "slow ways" streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/milvia-slow-street/&lt;/ref&gt; The Milvia Slow Street, part of the City of Berkeley's Bicycle Boulevard network, was finally designed under their guidance in 1990. The design covers roughly six blocks of residential street in which 30 curb bulb-outs were placed to narrow the street at intersections and mid-block locations. These bulb-outs and planted islands create a serpentine design, which requires vehicles to slow and negotiate a winding path along the street. Official studies confirmed the Milvia Slow Street to have a significant calming impact on vehicle speed and volume along the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berkeley Bicycle Boulevard Design Tools and Guidelines, Chapter 5, pp. 5.1-5.3 |date=2000-04-13 |url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_General/ch5.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecocity District Mapping===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ecocity Builders urban villages map Berkeley.jpg|thumbnail|Urban villages mapping of Berkeley, CA]] --&gt;Richard Register piloted a method for identifying “urban villages” in large urban areas in his book ''Ecocity Berkeley'' (1987). He proposed the eventual densification of these areas to create more compact, efficient urban entities where goods and services can be accessed via walking and biking. Ecocity Builders conducted early GIS mapping projects to formalize this process.&lt;ref name="Miller and Smith, 2013"&gt;Kirstin Miller and Richard Smith, ''Ecocity Mapping Using GIS: Introducing a Planning Method for Assessing and Improving Neighborhood Vitality,'' '''Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education and Action.''' Vol 7., Issue 1, (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The results identified actual active urban nodes (clusters of commercial, social and transit activity) as opposed to the on-the-book zoning for commercial/transit centers. They also identified barriers in these areas to being “complete” service access, such as a lack of large grocery store in [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]], and lack of integrated transit in [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecocity Mapping |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/current/ecocity-mapping/ |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and Advocacy===

In Berkeley Ecocity Builders successfully co-authored and lobbied for policies that are currently enforced, including the Ecocity Amendment to the 2001 General Plan, the Solar Greenhouse Ordinance, and the Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===International Ecocity Framework and Standards (IEFS)===

The [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]'s [https://www.bcit.ca/construction/ School of Construction and the Environment] and Ecocity Builders worked together to develop a scientific rubric for evaluating the Ecocity status of a human settlement. The rubric is based on 12 environmental, social, and resource-based indicators of urban health. The [http://www.ecocitystandards.org/ IEFS] forms the basis for several other partnerships and projects aiming to measure, map, and act on these indicators.

===Ecocitizen World Map Project===

The Ecocitizen World Map Project is a suite of tools and methods that uses PUMIS and GIS technology to explore, understand, and measure holistic urban health from a citizen’s perspective. The project provides an online mapping platform allowing residents to access and combine local, community-uploaded data with open-government data on key indicators such as air and water quality, access to transit, crime, and cultural amenities. The indicators measured by mapping align with the IEFS and can be used to evaluate a city or neighborhood’s ecocity status.

The first Ecocitizen World Map Project pilots were conducted in April 2014 in the cities of Cairo and Casablanca. Students and community members participated in "bootcamps" to learn PUMIS surveying techniques and conducted parcel audits in the neighborhoods of Roches Noires and Imbaba. Initial surveying focused on water use.

The participatory approach to data collection enables stakeholders to acquire previously unknown data and is designed to empower local communities to engage in relevant issues, giving them incentive to become involved in finding solutions to existing problems.

This Ecocitizen World Map Project is a public-private partnership led by Ecocity Builders in collaboration with principal initial partners the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Esri]], the Association of American Geographers, Eye on Earth (a partnership of [[UNEP]] + [[Abu Dhabi]] Environmental Data Initiative), along with local academic partners, [[NGO]]s and community organizations. The project's initial three pilot cities include [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]] (supported by a grant from the OAS’ Sustainable Communities in the Americas Initiative), [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] (supported by a grant from [http://www.eoesummit.org/ Eye on Earth).]

===Advising and Consulting===

Ecocity Builders provides a set of [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/ policy development and advocacy tools] as well as contracting as an adviser for projects worldwide. Ecocity Builders and Richard Register have consulted on construction, planning and development in [[Auroville]], [[India]]; [[Changwon]], [[South Korea]], [[Willits, California|Willits]], [[California]], [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Huaibei]], [[China]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], and [[Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city|Tianjin Ecocity]], [[China]].

===Ecocity World Summit Series===

Chief ongoing project of Ecocity Builders is the biennial conference series known as the [http://www.ecocityworldsummit.com|Ecocity World Summit] (formerly the [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Ecocity Conference Series]). The series focuses on key actions cities and citizens can take to rebuild human habitat in balance with living systems. The conference focuses on design, planning, data-gathering, and governance of creating sustainable, equitable cities. This Ecocity Summit series, begun in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in 1990, was a first of its kind and is now the longest continuously running conference on ecological towns, cities and villages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Conference Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Past World Summits have featured a wide range of leaders and innovators, including environmentalist [[David Brower]]; Apollo 14 astronaut [[Edgar Mitchell]]; [[Rusong Wang]], member of the Chinese Peoples Congress and head of the environmental sciences division of the Chinese Academy of Science; India’s animal rights champion Ambika Shukla; CEO and Chairperson of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Dr. Naoko Ishii; former San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], architect/philosopher [[Paolo Soleri]]; and [[Denis Hayes]], director of the original national Earth Day in 1970 and keynote for the first Ecocity Conference.

The 2015 Summit will take place in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in October 2015.

The '''European University Institute''' ('''EUI''') in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], is an international [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] and [[postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] teaching and research institute established by [[European Union]] [[European Union member states|member states]] to contribute to cultural and scientific development in the social sciences, in a European perspective.

==History and member states==
The European University Institute (EUI) has been founded in 1972 by the Member States of the European Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/servizi/stranieri/opportunita/progetti-speciali/istitut_europeo_firenze.html
|title=European University Institute|publisher=Farnesina|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was born out of an atmosphere of cooperation, with notable advocacy for a European institute at the Hague Conference in 1948 and the European Cultural Conference the following year.

Other priorities persisted however until the 1955 Messina Conference; a series of constructive talks responding to the widening of Europe. With all six members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) were present, the German Secretary of State Walter Hallstein took the opportunity to call for a training centre for nuclear sciences. This was proposed under the Euratom Treaty which had established Europe's atomic energy community; Hallstein's vision would create an instrument of integration and move away from the nationalism of the past.

The Italian government was enthusiastic and, recognising an academic need to study Europe, made determined action along with the European Commission and the European Parliament. However it was not until over a decade later that the idea began to bear fruit, when in 1969 leaders met in The Hague and resolved to fund a European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. By this point the idea had evolved from a centre for nuclear sciences to one focused on the human sciences, promoting a cultural exchange between member states.

Plans were put into motion with conferences in Florence and Rome in 1970 and 1971, when it was decided that the institute would be reserved for post-graduate studies and not directly a Community institution.

The six member states – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – signed a convention in 1972 which cemented their commitment to creating the EUI as a pillar for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1436893428665&amp;uri=CELEX:41976A0209(01)|title= Convention setting up a European University Institute|year=1976 |accessdate=|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|volume=С|number=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the Community and became involved in founding the Institution.

The EUI opened its doors to its first 70 researchers in 1976. The mission, laid down in the 1970s, is to “foster the advancement of learning in fields which are of particular interest for the development of Europe”.

{{as of|2018|June}}, the EUI Member States are:

==Departments and centres==
===Department of Economics===
The Economics Department provides teaching and supervision to PhD students. The research activities of the Department reflect the interests of the faculty and are concentrated in micro, macro and econometrics. Weekly research seminars are given by scholars from around the world. The teaching in the doctoral programme is based on formal coursework at a level which will allow researchers to pursue academic careers in universities or to follow professional opportunities in international organisations. In their third and fourth years researchers work on their thesis projects under the guidance of their supervisor while attending research workshops and seminars.

===Department of History and Civilization===
The Department of History and Civilization (HEC) offers a programme of transnational and comparative European history. The doctoral programme studies the construction of Europe's boundaries and the diversity and complexity of experiences within them.

The department's central concerns are the interlinking of European societies since the Renaissance and the complex cultural legacies that have shaped contemporary Europe. The HEC community is also committed to exploring the place of Europe in the world through the study of empires, global processes and institutions.

The variety of research approaches and themes, as well as the broad background of its professors, enable the Department to recruit high-quality Ph.D. candidates and to host outstanding research fellows.

===Department of Law===
The Department of Law is European and international in character. It is committed to the study of law in a comparative and contextual manner, with a special focus on European and international law.

Courses and seminars are interactive, research-oriented and designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work. Researchers gain experience in presenting their work, and are encouraged to participate in conferences, workshops and the Department's Working Groups.

Within the department, the Academy of European Law (AEL) offers advanced-level summer courses in Human Rights Law and EU Law. It also manages research projects and runs a publications programme.

The EUI Law Department also jointly hosts, with Harvard Law School, the Summer School on Law and Logic.  This summer school was launched in 2012 and is also sponsored by CIRSFID-University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), the European Academy of Legal Theory, and a grant from the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme.

===Department of Political and Social Sciences===
The research programme of the Department of Political and Social Sciences (SPS) places emphasis on political and social change within Europe at the national, sub-national and transnational level.
The research interests of the Department range across the four sub-disciplines of comparative politics, sociology, international relations, and social and political theory.
 
Courses in both quantitative and qualitative methods are available as options in the first and second year, while field work and data collection normally take place in the second and third year.

===Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies===
The Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies was launched by the European University Institute in 1993 building up on the experience of an already existing Policy Unit, created by [[Joseph Weiler]]. It is named for [[Robert Schuman]]. The first Director of the newly established Centre was {{illm|Yves Mény|fr||it}} (1993-2001), followed by [[Helen Wallace]] (2001-2006), {{ill|Stefano Bartolini|de}} (2006-2013) and Brigid Laffan (2013-). The initial set up was rather modest: one director, one assistant and two secretaries, but over the years the Centre has grown into a large research centre pursuing interdisciplinary research into the key political challenges facing Europe and the EU today and bringing together academics and practitioners, in both policy dialogues and executive training. The Centre's mission is to “contribute to research on the major issues facing contemporary European society, including questions associated with the construction of Europe.”
The Centre has several main programmes.

====Global Governance Programme====
The Global Governance Programme brings together academics, diplomats, public officers and officials from international organisations to connect the worlds of research and policy-making. It tackles a wide range of issues, including human rights, international trade, development, climate change, internet governance and regional integration.

The programme hosts a series of events, including High-Level Policy Seminars, where participants can exchange ideas.

====Florence School of Regulation====
The [http://fsr.eui.eu/ '''Florence School of Regulation'''] (FSR) is a centre of excellence for independent research, training and policy dialogue. The FSR has been founded in 2004 as a partnership between the EUI's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, the Council of the European Energy Regulators (CEER) and the Independent Regulators Group (IRG). The school also works closely with the [[European Commission]].

The FSR organises '''policy events''' dealing with key regulatory issues, provides academic '''training for practitioners''', produces regulation '''research''' and promotes networking and the exchange of ideas in the areas of:

* [http://fsr.eui.eu/energy/ Energy and Climate] 
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/communications-media/ Communications and Media]
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/transport/ Transport]
* [http://fsr.eui.eu/water/ Water]

Policy and business decision-makers, regulators, regulated companies and academics from different countries are encouraged to share their experiences through the school.

====European Union Democracy Observatory====
The European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO), launched in 2006, is an independent and interdisciplinary academic organisation whose goal is to produce an assessment of democratic practices within the EU. EUDO gathers documentation and data, provides basic and applied research reports for EU institutions, and fosters dialogue between policy-makers, academics and EU citizens.

====Migration Policy Centre====
The Migration Policy Centre has been founded in January 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-is-new/news/news/2012/20120625_en
|title=New Migration Policy Centre|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducts advanced policy-oriented research on global migration, asylum and mobility. It serves governance needs at European and global levels, from developing, implementing and monitoring migration-related policies to assessing their impact on the wider economy and society.

====Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom====
The Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF) was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Co-financed by the European Union, it is composed of experts in legal studies, new media policies, media markets and economics, political science and political communications. 
Through its programme of research, debate, training and dissemination of results, the CMPF works with academics, policy makers, regulators, market stakeholders, journalists and others interested in the debate.

== Historical Archives of EU ==

The [[Historical Archives of the European Union]] (HAEU) preserves and makes accessible the documents produced by the European Union's institutions according to the thirty year rule governing public access to archival material. The HAEU was established following decisions of the European Coal and Steel Community's (ECSC) and the Council in 1983 to open their historical archives to the public. An agreement between the European Commission and the European University Institute in 1984 led to the creation of the HAEU. The Archives are administered by the EUI and are operative in Florence since 1986.

==Doctoral and master programmes==

===[http://www.eui.eu/Phd/ Doctoral Programme]===
The EUI prepares researchers for developing and defending a doctoral thesis in the fields of economics, history and civilization, law, and political and social sciences. Around 150-160 research grants are awarded annually by the EU Member States and other European national authorities to successful candidates. A Ph.D. from the European University Institute is an internationally recognised qualification.

While each department structures its own four-year programme, in all researchers are involved in seminars and other events where they are encouraged to participate and present their work. During their Ph.D. students may travel within the EU and further afield to conduct research, while there are also exchange opportunities.

====Grants and fees====
There are  funding options available to researchers, with the majority of EU member states offering grants which cover living costs and tuition fees. There are additional agreements with non-EU member states, while the Italian and Spanish ministries of foreign affairs provide grants to a number of countries. Academics not covered by grants pay €12,000 each year in tuition fees and be able to guarantee at least €1,200 monthly to cover living costs, although fees may be reduced or waived for candidates from developing countries.

===[https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/MasterofLaws/LL.M.Programme Masters Programme in Law]===
Since 1984 the European University Institute has offered law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of '''Master in Comparative, European and International Law''' ([[LL.M.]] degree level).

===Languages===
The majority of students and professors are multilingual; all are required to have a good knowledge of English although French and Italian are also regular working languages and the Institute is committed to accommodating other languages where possible.

==Postdoctoral fellowships==
The EUI has several post-doctoral fellowships in the [[social sciences]]

===Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellowships===

The Max Weber Programme is Europe's largest postdoctoral programme in the social sciences and is funded by the European Commission.

Max Weber Fellowships are designed for junior post-docs who would like to pursue an academic career, concentrate on their own research and enhance their academic practice in a multidisciplinary environment. Max Weber Fellowships are for one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate in the social sciences (economics, law, political science, sociology, history and related fields) within the last five years.

===Jean Monnet Fellowships===
Through its Jean Monnet Fellowship Programme the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies offers fellowships to mid- and late-career scholars (while previously the Jean Monnet was a post-doctoral fellowship, it is now available only to those who received their PhD at least five years prior). During their stay at the RSCAS, fellows work on a research topic that fits well in the overall research profile of the RSCAS and participate in the academic life of the Centre and of the EUI. Jean Monnet Fellowships have a duration of one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate more than five years prior.

===Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships===
Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships provide a framework for established academics with an international reputation to pursue their research at the EUI. Fellowships last for up to ten months in one of the EUI's four Departments which in turn invite fellows to participate in departmental activities (seminars, workshops, colloquia, etc.).

===Marie Curie Fellowships===
The EUI (the Departments and the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies) acts as a host institution for Marie Curie Fellowships which are awarded by the European Commission.

===Canon Foundation Fellowships===
The Canon Foundation and the EUI jointly award one Canon Foundation Fellowship each year for post-doctoral research at the EUI. The fellowship is open to candidates of Japanese nationality or permanent residents of Japan.

===Academy of Finland Fellowships===
The Academy of Finland awards fellowships for post-doctoral research at the EUI. A project to be funded shall serve Finnish research and society or international collaboration.

===Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc===
The Australian European University Institute Fellowships Association Inc awards annually one six-month Postdoctoral Fellowship for the period January–June. The Postdoctoral Fellowship is available to those who have graduated with a PhD qualification within the last five years, and is open only to Australian citizens or residents employed in Australian universities.

==Rankings==
The EUI is one of the leading [[social science]] research institutions in Europe, and with around 1,000 researchers at various levels in their careers also one of the largest [[graduate schools]]. The EUI Political and Social Science department was ranked first in Europe and fifth worldwide in the Hix ranking of such departments (which was published in 2004 and covered the period 1998–2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf Simon Hix (2004) 'A Global Ranking of Political Science Departments', Political Studies Review 2(3) 293-313.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041221043317/http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/psr/hix.pdf |date=December 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the same department was included in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;'CHE Excellence Ranking'&lt;/nowiki&gt; for political science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excellenceranking.org/eusid/EUSID CHE Excellence Ranking 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[emphasis in original]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:In a subsequent ruling on another OPCA case, ''Gauthier v. Starr 2016 ABQB 213'', Justice Rooke noted that, following the ruling, Meads had abandoned OPCA strategies and concluded the litigation in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20160419203650/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb213/2016abqb213.html Gauthier v Starr, 2016 ABQB 213]''  (CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 14 April 2016, para. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself.

==Factors influencing extracellular enzyme activity==
Extracellular enzyme production supplements the direct uptake of nutrients by microorganisms and is linked to nutrient availability and environmental conditions.  The varied chemical structure of [[organic matter]] requires a suite of extracellular enzymes to access the carbon and nutrients embedded in [[detritus]].  Microorganisms differ in their ability to break down these different substrates and few organisms have the potential to degrade all the available plant cell wall materials.&lt;ref name="AllisonLeBauer2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Steven D.|last2=LeBauer|first2=David S.|last3=Ofrecio|first3=M.

Benefits of exoenzyme production can also be lost after secretion because the enzymes are liable to denature, degrade or diffuse away from the producer cell.

Enzyme production and secretion is an energy intensive process &lt;ref name="Schimel2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schimel|first1=J|title=The implications of exoenzyme activity on microbial carbon and nitrogen limitation in soil: a theoretical model|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=35|issue=4|year=2003|pages=549–563|issn=0038-0717|doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because it consumes resources otherwise available for reproduction, there is evolutionary pressure to conserve those resources by limiting production.&lt;ref name="AllisonWeintraub2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Steven D.|last2=Weintraub|first2=Michael N.|last3=Gartner|first3=Tracy B.|last4=Waldrop|first4=Mark P.|title=Evolutionary-Economic Principles as Regulators of Soil Enzyme Production and Ecosystem Function|volume=22|year=2010|pages=229–243|issn=1613-3382|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-14225-3_12|journal=Soil Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while most microorganisms can assimilate simple monomers, degradation of polymers is specialized, and few organisms can degrade recalcitrant polymers like cellulose and lignin.&lt;ref name="BaldrianKolařík2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldrian|first1=Petr|last2=Kolařík|first2=Miroslav|last3=Štursová|first3=Martina|last4=Kopecký|first4=Jan|last5=Valášková|first5=Vendula|last6=Větrovský|first6=Tomáš|last7=Žifčáková|first7=Lucia|last8=Šnajdr|first8=Jaroslav|last9=Rídl|first9=Jakub|last10=Vlček|first10=Čestmír|last11=Voříšková|first11=Jana|title=Active and total microbial communities in forest soil are largely different and highly stratified during decomposition|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=6|issue=2|year=2011|pages=248–258|issn=1751-7362|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.95|pmc=3260513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each microbial species carries specific combinations of [[genes]] for extracellular enzymes and is adapted to degrade specific [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]s.&lt;ref name="AllisonLeBauer2009"/&gt;  In addition, the expression of genes that encode for enzymes is typically regulated by the availability of a given substrate.

'''Fur massage''' is a form of touch that is used in partner massage. It involves using a fur glove to touch one's partner in an attempt to arouse.&lt;ref name="my-other-self" /&gt; In therapeutic usage, [[professional boundaries]] do not permit that the therapist (giver) be emotionally involved in a massage.&lt;ref name="mosby" /&gt; Fur massage mitts are sometimes recommended by professionals as a sensual toy rather than sexual toy.&lt;ref name="toys" /&gt; Use of fur gloves for massage is considered a ''[[safe sex]]'' practice by the [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]].&lt;ref name="safer-sex" /&gt;

Couples employ [[fur]] [[massage]] to focus their attention on the importance of [[touch]] and to sensitize specific areas of the [[skin]].&lt;ref name="lip-service" /&gt; Couples use fur massage to stimulate the [[lymphatic system]] by exciting the skin. While traditional massage requires strong tissue rubs and technical expertise, fur massage stirs the imagination and highlights the [[Eroticism|erotic]] nature of touch. Special mitts are available.&lt;ref name="advanced-techniques" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tantra" /&gt;

'''High availability''' is a characteristic of a system, which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually [[uptime]], for a higher than normal period.

Modernization has resulted in an increased reliance on these systems.  For example, hospitals and data centers require high availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. [[Availability]] refers to the ability of the user community to obtain a service or good, access the system, whether to submit new work, update or alter existing work, or collect the results of previous work. If a user cannot access the system, it is – from the users point of view – ''unavailable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Floyd Piedad, Michael Hawkins|title=High Availability: Design, Techniques, and Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHB0HdQ98qYC&amp;dq=high+availability+floyd+piedad+book&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gs0LSrLvBKjm6gOT3ISPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7|isbn=9780130962881|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the term ''[[downtime]]'' is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.

==Principles==
There are three principles of [[systems design]] in [[reliability engineering]] which can help achieve high availability.

# Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding redundancy to the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system.
# Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure.  Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover.
# Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must.

==Scheduled and unscheduled downtime==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
A distinction can be made between scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Typically, scheduled downtime is a result of maintenance that is disruptive to system operation and usually cannot be avoided with a currently installed system design. Scheduled downtime events might include patches to [[system software]] that require a [[booting|reboot]] or system configuration changes that only take effect upon a reboot. In general, scheduled downtime is usually the result of some logical, management-initiated event. Unscheduled downtime events typically arise from some physical event, such as a hardware or software failure or environmental anomaly. Examples of unscheduled downtime events include power outages, failed [[CPU]] or [[RAM]] components (or possibly other failed hardware components), an over-temperature related shutdown, logically or physically severed network connections, security breaches, or various [[Application software|application]], [[middleware]], and [[operating system]] failures.

If users can be warned away from scheduled downtimes, then the distinction is useful.  But if the
requirement is for true high availability, then downtime is downtime whether or not it is scheduled.

Many computing sites exclude scheduled downtime from availability calculations, assuming that it has little or no impact upon the computing user community. By doing this, they can claim to have phenomenally high availability, which might give the illusion of [[continuous availability]]. Systems that exhibit truly continuous availability are comparatively rare and higher priced, and most have carefully implemented specialty designs that eliminate any [[single point of failure]] and allow online hardware, network, operating system, middleware, and application upgrades, patches, and replacements. For certain systems, scheduled downtime does not matter, for example system downtime at an office building after everybody has gone home for the night.

==Percentage calculation==
Availability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year. The following table shows the downtime that will be allowed for a particular percentage of availability, presuming that the system is required to operate continuously. [[Service level agreement]]s often refer to monthly downtime or availability in order to calculate service credits to match monthly billing cycles. The following table shows the translation from a given availability percentage to the corresponding amount of time a system would be unavailable.

[[Uptime]] and [[availability]] can be used synonymously as long as the items being discussed are kept consistent.  That is, a system can be up, but its services are not available, as in the case of a [[network outage]].  This can also be viewed as a system that is available to be worked on, but its services are not up from a functional perspective (as opposed to software service/process perspective). The perspective is important here - whether the item being discussed is the server hardware, server OS, functional service, software service/process...etc.  Keep the perspective consistent throughout a discussion, then uptime and availability can be used synonymously.

Percentages of a particular order of magnitude are sometimes referred to by the [[List of unusual units of measurement#Nines|number of nines]] or "class of nines" in the digits.  For example, electricity that is delivered without interruptions ([[Power outage|blackout]]s, [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s or [[Voltage spike|surge]]s) 99.999% of the time would have 5 nines reliability, or class five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~walker/classes/aos.s00/lectures/L25.ps Lecture Notes] M.

Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then "five", so 99.95% is "three nines five", abbreviated 3N5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Precious metals, Volume 4|last=|first=|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1981|isbn=9780080253695|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22four+nines+five%22 page 262]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}&lt;!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually referred to as "three and a half nines",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems |first1=Niall Richard |last1=Murphy |first2=Betsy |last2=Beyer |first3=Jennifer |last3=Petoff |first4=Chris |last4=Jones |year=2016 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4rPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22three+and+a+half+nines%22 38]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is incorrect: a 5 is only a factor of 2, while a 9 is a factor of 10, so a 5 is 0.3 nines (per below formula: &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.3&lt;/math&gt;):{{efn|See [[Mathematical coincidence#Concerning base 2|mathematical coincidences concerning base 2]] for details on this approximation.}} 99.95% availability is 3.3 nines, not 3.5 nines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshdeprez.com/post/67-nines-of-availability/ |title=Nines of Nines |author=Josh Deprez |date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, going from 99.9% availability to 99.95% availability is a factor of 2 (0.1% to 0.05% unavailability), but going from 99.95% to 99.99% availability is a factor of 5 (0.05% to 0.01% unavailability), over twice as much.{{efn|"Twice as much" on a logarithmic scale, meaning two ''factors'' of 2: &lt;math&gt;\times 2 \times 2 &lt; \times 5&lt;/math&gt;}}

A formulation of the ''class of 9s''  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  based on a system's [[unavailability]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be

:&lt;math&gt; c := \lfloor  - \log_{10} x  \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

(cf. [[Floor and ceiling functions]]).

A [[Nine (purity)|similar measurement]] is sometimes used to describe the purity of substances.

In general, the number of nines is not often used by a network engineer when modeling and measuring availability because it is hard to apply in formula. More often, the unavailability expressed as a [[probability]] (like 0.00001), or a [[downtime]] per year is quoted. Availability specified as a number of nines is often seen in [[marketing]] documents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The use of the "nines" has been called into question, since it does not appropriately reflect that the impact of unavailability varies with its time of occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid5_gci921823,00.html Evan L. Marcus, ''The myth of the nines'']&lt;/ref&gt; For large amounts of 9s, the "unavailability" index (measure of downtime rather than uptime) is easier to handle. For example, this is why an "unavailability" rather than availability metric is used in hard disk or data link [[bit error rate]]s.

==Measurement and interpretation==

Availability measurement is subject to some degree of interpretation. A system that has been up for 365 days in a non-leap year might have been eclipsed by a network failure that lasted for 9 hours during a peak usage period; the user community will see the system as unavailable, whereas the system administrator will claim 100% [[uptime]]. However, given the true definition of availability, the system will be approximately 99.9% available, or three nines (8751 hours of available time out of 8760 hours per non-leap year). Also, systems experiencing performance problems are often deemed partially or entirely unavailable by users, even when the systems are continuing to function. Similarly, unavailability of select application functions might go unnoticed by administrators yet be devastating to users&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a true availability measure is holistic.

Availability must be measured to be determined, ideally with comprehensive monitoring tools ("instrumentation") that are themselves highly available. If there is a lack of instrumentation, systems supporting high volume transaction processing throughout the day and night, such as credit card processing systems or telephone switches, are often inherently better monitored, at least by the users themselves, than systems which experience periodic lulls in demand.

An alternative metric is [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF).

==Closely related concepts==
Recovery time (or estimated time of repair (ETR), also known as [[recovery time objective]] (RTO) is closely related to availability, that is the total time required for a planned outage or the time required to fully recover from an unplanned outage. Another metric is [[mean time to recovery]] (MTTR).  Recovery time could be infinite with certain system designs and failures, i.e. full recovery is impossible. One such example is a fire or flood that destroys a data center and its systems when there is no secondary [[disaster recovery]] data center.

Another related concept is data availability, that is the degree to which databases and other information storage systems faithfully record and report system transactions. Information management specialists often focus separately on data availability in order to determine acceptable (or actual) data loss with various failure events. Some users can tolerate application service interruptions but cannot tolerate data loss.

A [[service level agreement]] ("SLA") formalizes an organization's availability objectives and requirements.

==System design==
Paradoxically, adding more components to an overall system design can undermine efforts to achieve high availability. That is because complex systems inherently have more potential failure points and are more difficult to implement correctly. While some analysts would put forth the theory that the most highly available systems adhere to a simple architecture (a single, high quality, multi-purpose physical system with comprehensive internal hardware redundancy), this architecture suffers from the requirement that the entire system must be brought down for patching and operating system upgrades. More advanced system designs allow for systems to be patched and upgraded without compromising service availability (see [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[failover]]).

High availability requires less human intervention to restore operation in complex systems; the reason for this being that the most common cause for outages is human error.&lt;ref name=humanerror&gt;{{cite web|date=October 27, 2010|url=http://www.gartner.com/id=1458131|title=Top Seven Considerations for Configuration Management for Virtual and Cloud Infrastructures |publisher=[[Gartner]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]] is used to create systems with high levels of availability (e.g. aircraft flight computers). In this case it is required to have high levels of failure detectability and avoidance of common cause failures. Two kinds of redundancy are passive redundancy and active redundancy.

Passive redundancy is used to achieve high availability by including enough excess capacity in the design to accommodate a performance decline. The simplest example is a boat with two separate engines driving two separate propellers. The boat continues toward its destination despite failure of a single engine or propeller. A more complex example is multiple redundant power generation facilities within a large system involving [[electric power transmission]]. Malfunction of single components is not considered to be a failure unless the resulting performance decline exceeds the specification limits for the entire system.

Active redundancy is used in complex systems to achieve high availability with no performance decline. Multiple items of the same kind are incorporated into a design that includes a method to detect failure and automatically reconfigure the system to bypass failed items using a voting scheme. This is used with complex computing systems that are linked. Internet [[routing]] is derived from early work by Birman and Joseph in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active redundancy may introduce more complex failure modes into a system, such as continuous system reconfiguration due to faulty voting logic.

Zero downtime system design means that modeling and simulation indicates [[mean time between failures]] significantly exceeds the period of time between [[planned maintenance]], [[upgrade]] events, or system lifetime. Zero downtime involves massive redundancy, which is needed for some types of aircraft and for most kinds of [[communications satellite|communications satellites]]. [[Global Positioning System]] is an example of a zero downtime system.

Fault [[instrumentation]] can be used in systems with limited redundancy to achieve high availability. Maintenance actions occur during brief periods of down-time only after a fault indicator activates. Failure is only significant if this occurs during a [[mission critical]] period.

[[Modeling and simulation]] is used to evaluate the theoretical reliability for large systems. The outcome of this kind of model is used to evaluate different design options. A model of the entire system is created, and the model is stressed by removing components. Redundancy simulation involves the N-x criteria. N represents the total number of components in the system. x is the number of components used to stress the system. N-1 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where one component is faulted. N-2 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where two component are faulted simultaneously.

==Reasons for unavailability==
A survey among academic availability experts in 2010 ranked reasons for unavailability of enterprise IT systems. All reasons refer to '''not following best practice''' in each of the following areas (in order of importance):&lt;ref&gt;Ulrik Franke, Pontus Johnson, Johan König, Liv Marcks von Würtemberg: Availability of enterprise IT systems – an expert-based Bayesian model, ''Proc. Fourth International Workshop on Software Quality and Maintainability'' (WSQM 2010), Madrid, [http://www.kth.se/ees/forskning/publikationer/modules/publications_polopoly/reports/2010/IR-EE-ICS_2010_047.pdf?l=en_UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Monitoring of the relevant components
# [[Requirements management|Requirements]] and procurement

# Avoidance of network failures
# Avoidance of internal application failures
# Avoidance of external services that fail
# Physical environment
# Network redundancy
# Technical solution of backup
# Process solution of backup
# Physical location
# Infrastructure redundancy
# Storage architecture redundancy

The factors themselves are based on the work of [[Evan Marcus]] and [[Hal Stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Marcus |first2=H. |last2=Stern |title=Blueprints for high availability |edition=Second |location=Indianapolis, IN |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2003 |isbn=0-471-43026-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs of unavailability==
In a 1998 report from IBM Global Services, unavailable systems were estimated to have cost American businesses $4.54 billion in 1996, due to lost productivity and revenues.&lt;ref&gt;IBM Global Services, ''Improving systems availability'', IBM Global Services, 1998, [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~irl/docs/availabilitytutorial.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

High availability is one of the primary requirements of the control systems in unmanned vehicles&lt;ref&gt;[[Ground Combat Vehicle]]&lt;/ref&gt; and autonomous maritime vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[[ACTUV]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the controlling system becomes unavailable, the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) or ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) would be lost.

The history of [[perpetual motion]] machines dates at least back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Ross |title=Perpetual Motion Is Impossible... Right? |url=https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/perpetual-motion.html |website=realclearscience.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of [[thermodynamics]] have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as "overunity", to describe their inventions.

There are two types of perpetual motion machines:
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the first kind'' are those devices that violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the principle of conservation of energy, creating energy out of nothing. Most attempts fall into this category.
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the second kind'' are devices that violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Even though they obey the principle of conservation of energy, they attempt extraction of work from a single heat reservoir, violating the principle of no [[entropy]] decrease in an isolated macroscopic thermodynamic system.

===Pre-19th century===
There are some unsourced claims&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Eberhart(2007):''Feeding the fire: the lost history and uncertain future of mankind's energy'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; that a perpetual motion machine called the "magic wheel" (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century [[Bavaria]]. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.

Early designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]]–[[Indian astronomy|astronomer]] [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara II]], who described a wheel ([[Bhāskara's wheel]]) that he claimed would run forever.&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (April 1960). "Tibet, India, and Malaya as Sources of Western Medieval Technology", ''The American Historical Review'' '''65''' (3), p. 522-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of [[Villard de Honnecourt]], a 13th-century  French master [[stonemason|mason]] and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with [[mechanics]] and [[architecture]]. Following the example of Villard, [[Peter of Maricourt]] designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic [[armillary sphere]].&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free [[energy]]. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Time-Life Books (1991). ''Inventive Genius''. 143 pages. Page 125. {{ISBN|0-8094-7699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Mark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=022yYXnS_GQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Directions+for+constructing+a+Perpetual+Motion+Machine+without+the+Use+of+Water+or+a+Weight%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0CRBPA8XUb&amp;sig=HG5hN7WSjTWvjywmNe5Qs4lIFtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E-R7TfqZCqKD0QGHkKXrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Directions%20for%20constructing%20a%20Perpetual%20Motion%20Machine%20without%20the%20Use%20of%20Water%20or%20a%20Weight%22&amp;f=false |title=Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession |first=Arthur W.

Various scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 [[Cornelius Drebbel]] in "Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh" dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to [[James I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Wondervondt.pdf |title=Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310193332/http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] devised the "perpetual vase" ("perpetual goblet" or "hydrostatic paradox") which was discussed by [[Denis Papin]] in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1685.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pascal.html "Inventor of the Week Archive: Pascal : Mechanical Calculator"], May 2003. "Pascal worked on many versions of the devices, leading to his attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. He has been credited with introducing the roulette machine, which was a by-product of these experiments."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Bernoulli]] proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, [[Georg Andreas Böckler]], designed a "self operating" self-powered [[water mill]] and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of [[Archimedes' screw]]s. In 1712, [[Johann Bessler]] ([[Orffyreus]]), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simaneck |first1=Donald E. |title=Perpetual Futility |url=https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/museum/people/people.htm |website=lockhaven.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1760s, [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and [[John Joseph Merlin]] developed [[Cox's timepiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Arthur W. J. G. Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-60131-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] via a [[mercury barometer]], this is not the case.

In 1775, the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris]] made the statement that the Academy "will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scaffer |first1=Simon |title=The Show That Never Ends: Perpetual Motion in the Early Eighteenth Century |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=June 1995 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=157 - 189 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027676?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

====19th century====
In 1812, [[Charles Redheffer]], in [[Philadelphia]], claimed to have developed a "generator" that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/nov/13/research.highereducation2|title=Too good to be true|last=Radford|first=Tim|date=2003-11-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Clifford B. (April 1961). "Why won't they work?". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage Magazine]]''. American Heritage Publishing Company. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Robert Fulton]] exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a [[catgut]] belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/redheffer.html|title=This page has moved|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information originally at www.skepticfiles.org/skep2/pmotion2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi438.htm|title=No. 438: Redheffer's PMM-I|author=|date=|website=www.uh.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet]] devised a machine running on [[capillary action]] that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perpetual Motion |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/perpetual-motion-1911-11-18/ |website=scientificamerican.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a "thrust key-type [[gear]]ing" of a [[rotary engine]]. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device's levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-gramatke.de/pmm_physics/german/page0300.htm|title=HPs Perpetuum Mobile Physik.

In 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a "proprietary" perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' article "The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made". Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogyimagesofhistory.com/images/amotion.JPG|title=Image of Scientific American|author=|date=|website=genealogyimagesofhistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ernst Worrell Keely]] claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used "etheric technology". In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of [[tuning fork]]s. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, [[venture capitalist]]s accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely's machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Keely's Secret Disclosed.; Scientists Examine His Laboratory and Discover Hidden Tubes in Proof of His Deception. | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | pages =  | year =  | date = 20 January 1899 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/01/20/102408633.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1900 to 1950====
In 1900, [[Nikola Tesla]] claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the [[Perpetual motion classification#Classification|second kind]].

[[David Unaipon]], Australian inventor, had a lifelong fascination with perpetual motion. One of his studies on Newtonian mechanics led him to create a [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] machine in 1910 that converted curvilineal motion into straight line movement. The device is the basis of modern mechanical shears.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Jenkin, ''Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri'' (1979), pp. 234-236, {{ISBN|0-7270-1112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, Harry Perrigo of Kansas City, Missouri, a graduate of [[MIT]], claimed development of a free energy device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 Harry E.

Energy source of "invention" supposedly "from thin air" or from "ether waves" but in actually from a hidden battery."&lt;/ref&gt; Perrigo claimed the energy source was "from thin air" or from aether waves. He demonstrated the device before the Congress of the United States on December 15, 1917. Perrigo had a pending application&lt;ref&gt;filed December 31, 1925; Serial Number 78,719&lt;/ref&gt; for the "Improvement in Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and Transforming Ether Electric Energy". Investigators report that his device contained a hidden motor battery.&lt;ref&gt;Citations originally at www.kclibrary.org resources Subject area ID 77176&lt;/ref&gt;

====1951 to 1980====
During the middle of the 20th century, [[Viktor Schauberger]] claimed to have discovered some special vortex energy in water. Since his death in 1958, people are still studying his works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010409231732/http://www.frank.germano.com/viktorschauberger.htm Who was Viktor Schauberger?] frank.germano.com. (archived version).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Josef Papp]] (sometimes referred to as Joseph Papp or Joseph Papf) supposedly developed an alternative [[car engine]] that used [[noble gas|inert gases]]. He gained a few investors but when the engine was publicly demonstrated, an explosion killed one of the observers and injured two others. Papp blamed the accident on interference by  physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who later shared his observations in an article in ''Laser'', the journal of the Southern Californian Skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/comments/papparticle2.html|title=Feynman on Papp|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papp continued to accept money but never demonstrated another engine.

On December 20 of 1977, Emil T. Hartman received {{US patent|4215330}} titled "Permanent magnet propulsion system". This device is related to the [[Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy]] (SMOT).

[[Guido Franch]] reportedly had a process of [[Alchemy|transmuting]] water molecules into high-[[octane]] [[gasoline]] compounds (named [[Mota fuel]]) that would reduce the price of gasoline to 8 cents per gallon. This process involved a green [[Powder (substance)|powder]] (this claim may be related to the similar ones of John Andrews (1917)). He was brought to court for [[fraud]] in 1954 and [[acquittal|acquitted]], but in 1973 was convicted. [[Judge|Justice]] William Bauer and Justice Philip Romiti both observed a demonstration in the 1954 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_399.html|title=Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?|author=|date=14 December 1984|website=straightdope.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Otis T. Carr]] from [[Oklahoma]] formed a company to manufacture [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]-styled [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[hovercraft]]. Carr sold [[stock]] for this [[Commerce|commercial]] endeavour. He also promoted [[Second law of thermodynamics|free energy]] [[machine]]s. He claimed inspiration from [[Nikola Tesla]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keelynet.com/gravity/carr3.htm|title=Otis Carr Flying Machine - KeelyNet 12/23/01|author=|date=|website=www.keelynet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] discussed a [[Brownian ratchet]] that would supposedly extract meaningful work from [[Brownian motion]], although he went on to demonstrate how such a device would fail to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Feynman" &gt;{{cite book | last = Feynman | first = Richard P. | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1963 | location = Massachusetts, USA | pages = Chapter 46 | isbn =0-201-02116-1 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, David Hamel produced the Hamel generator, an "[[antigravity]]" device, supposedly after an [[alien abduction]]. The device was tested on ''[[MythBusters]]'' where it failed to demonstrate any lift-generating capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/12/episode_68_christmas_tree_ligh.html|title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV|author=|date=|website=kwc.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[MythBusters]] Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV {{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109031748/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |archivedate=2008-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USPatent4151431-2.png|thumb|222px|right|Howard R. Johnson's US Patent 4151431]]
[[Howard Robert Johnson]] developed a permanent magnet motor and, on April 24, 1979, received {{US patent|4151431}}.[The United States Patent office main classification of his 4151431 patent is as a "electrical generator or motor structure, dynamoelectric, linear" (310/12).] Johnson said that his device generates motion, either rotary or linear, from nothing but permanent magnets in rotor as well as stator, acting against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Science &amp; Mechanics|author=Jorma Hyypia|title=Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor |date= Spring 1980|url=http://www.newebmasters.com/freeenergy/sm-pg45.html }} (Cover illustration is [http://www.rexresearch.com/johnson/1johnson.htm#scimech here].)&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that permanent magnets made of proper hard materials should lose less than two percent of their magnetization in powering a device for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qsYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6671,6264163 |title=Industrial Engineer Gets Patent for a Device Powered by Magnets |date=April 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Joseph Westley Newman]] applied for a patent on a [[direct current]] electrical motor which, according to his book ''[[The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman]]'' did more mechanical work than could be accounted for by the electrical power supplied to it.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman | publisher=Joseph Newman Publishing Company | author=Newman, Joseph | year=1998 | location=Scottsdale, AZ, USA | isbn=0-9613835-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newman's patent application was rejected in 1983.&lt;ref name="USPTO_Newman"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1983000963 | title=Patent Application: "ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEM HAVING HIGHER ENERGY OUTPUT THAN INPUT" (failed) | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | date=17 March 1983 | accessdate=7 September 2016 | author=Newman, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USPTO_MPEP_2107.01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2107_01.htm | title=Manual of Patent Examining Procedure | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | work=2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections (R-5) - 2100 Patentability.

====1981 to 1999====
Dr. Yuri S. Potapov of [[Moldova]] claims development of an  [[over-unity]] electrothermal water-based generator (referred to as "Yusmar 1"). He founded the YUSMAR company to promote his device.

The motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) was built by Tom Bearden.

'''Inclusive fitness in humans''' is the application of [[inclusive fitness]] theory to human social behaviour, relationships and cooperation.

Inclusive fitness theory (and the related [[kin selection]] theory) are general theories in [[evolutionary biology]] that propose a method to understand the evolution of social behaviours in organisms. While various ideas related to these theories have been influential in the study of the social behaviour of non-human organisms, their application to human behaviour has been debated.

Inclusive fitness theory is broadly understood to describe a ''statistical'' criterion by which social traits can ''evolve'' to become widespread in a population of organisms. However, beyond this some scientists have interpreted the theory to make predictions about how the ''expression'' of social behavior is mediated in both humans and other animals – typically that genetic relatedness determines the expression of social behaviour. Other biologists and anthropologists maintain that beyond its statistical evolutionary relevance the theory does not necessarily imply that genetic relatedness ''per se'' determines the ''expression'' of social behavior in organisms. Instead, the expression of social behavior may be mediated by correlated conditions, such as shared location, shared rearing environment, &lt;!--should this item have an "and" before it, as last item in the list? Let us allow that the word 'or' here provides the grammatical conjunction--&gt;familiarity or other contextual cues which correlate with shared genetic relatedness, thus meeting the statistical evolutionary criteria without being deterministic. While the former position still attracts controversy, the latter position has a better empirical fit with anthropological data about human [[kinship]] practices, and is accepted by cultural anthropologists.

==History==

Applying evolutionary biology perspectives to humans and human society has often resulted in periods of controversy and debate, due to their apparent incompatibility with alternative perspectives about humanity. Examples of early controversies include the [[Reactions to On the Origin of Species|reactions to ''On the Origin of Species'']], and the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Examples of later controversies more directly connected with inclusive fitness theory and its use in [[sociobiology]] include physical confrontations at meetings of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] and more often intellectual arguments such as Sahlins' 1976 book ''The use and abuse of biology'', Lewontin et al.'s 1984 ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', and Kitcher's 1985 ''Vaulting Ambition:Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature''. Some of these later arguments were produced by other scientists, including biologists and anthropologists, against Wilson's 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'', which was influenced by (though not necessarily endorsed by) Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness theory.

A key debate in applying inclusive fitness theory to humans has been between biologists and anthropologists around the extent to which human [[kinship]] relationships (considered to be a large component of human solidarity and altruistic activity and practice) are necessarily based on or influenced by genetic relationships or blood-ties ('consanguinity'). The position of most [[Social anthropology|social anthropologists]] is summarized by Sahlins (1976), that for humans "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' [kin] vary independently of consanguinal distance and that these categories organize actual social practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;112). Biologists wishing to apply the theory to humans directly disagree, arguing that "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' do not 'vary independently of consanguinal distance', not in any society on earth." (Daly et al. 1997, p282).

This disagreement is central because of the way the association between blood ties/genetic relationships and altruism are conceptualized by many biologists. It is frequently understood by biologists that inclusive fitness theory makes predictions about ''how behaviour is mediated'' in both humans and other animals. For example, a recent experiment conducted on humans by the evolutionary psychologist [[Robin Dunbar]] and colleagues was, as they understood it, designed "to test the prediction that altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule" (inclusive fitness theory) and more specifically that "If participants follow Hamilton's rule, investment (time for which the [altruistic] position was held) should increase with the recipient's relatedness to the participant. In effect, we tested whether investment flows differentially down channels of relatedness." From their results, they concluded that "''human altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule ... humans behave in such a way as to maximize inclusive fitness: they are more willing to benefit closer relatives than more distantly related individuals.''" (Madsen et al. 2007). This position continues to be rejected by social anthropologists as being incompatible with the large amount of ethnographic data on kinship and altruism that their discipline has collected over many decades, that demonstrates that in many human cultures, kinship relationships (accompanied by altruism) do not necessarily map closely onto genetic relationships.

Whilst the above understanding of inclusive fitness theory as necessarily making predictions about how human kinship and altruism is mediated is common amongst evolutionary psychologists, other biologists and anthropologists have argued that it is at best a limited (and at worst a mistaken) understanding of inclusive fitness theory. These scientists argue that the theory is better understood as simply describing an ''evolutionary'' criterion for the emergence of altruistic behaviour, which is explicitly statistical in character, not as predictive of ''proximate'' or ''mediating'' mechanisms of altruistic behaviour, which may not necessarily be determined by genetic relatedness (or blood ties) ''per se''. These alternative non-deterministic and non-reductionist understandings of inclusive fitness theory and human behavior have been argued to be compatible with anthropologists' decades of data on human kinship, and compatible with anthropologists' perspectives on human kinship. This position (e.g. [[nurture kinship]]) has been largely accepted by social anthropologists, whilst the former position (still held by evolutionary psychologists, see above) remains rejected by social anthropologists.

== Theoretical background ==
{{see also|Inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}

===Theoretical overview ===

Inclusive fitness theory, first proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]] in the early 1960s, proposes a selective criterion for the potential evolution of social traits in organisms, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism's survival and reproduction could nevertheless emerge under certain conditions. The key condition relates to the statistical likelihood that significant benefits of a social trait or behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait. [[Inclusive fitness]] theory is a general treatment of the statistical probabilities of social traits accruing to any other organisms likely to propagate a copy of the same social trait. [[Kin selection]] theory treats the narrower but more straightforward case of the benefits accruing to close genetic relatives (or what biologists call 'kin') who may also carry and propagate the trait. Under conditions where the social trait sufficiently correlates (or more properly, ''regresses'') with other likely bearers, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an "altruism gene" (or complex of genes or heritable factors) that influence an organism's behavior in such a way that is helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior can also increase the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. In formal terms, if such a complex of genes arises, Hamilton's rule (rb&gt;c) specifies the selective criteria (in terms of relatedness (r), cost (c) benefit (b)) for such a trait to increase in frequency in the population (see [[Inclusive fitness]] for more details). Hamilton noted that inclusive fitness theory does not by itself predict that a given species will necessarily evolve such altruistic behaviors, since an opportunity or context for interaction between individuals is a more primary and necessary requirement in order for any social interaction to occur in the first place. As Hamilton put it, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start." (Hamilton 1987, 420).&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;Hamilton, W.D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In ''Kin recognition in animals'', edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies a set of necessary criteria for the evolution of certain altruistic traits, it does not specify a sufficient condition for their evolution in any given species, since the typical ecology, demographics and life pattern of the species must also allow for social interactions between individuals to occur, before any potential elaboration of social traits can evolve in regard to those interactions.

===Initial presentations of the theory===

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s, see ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]'') focused on making the general mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution. However, since many [[Ethology|field biologists]] mainly use theory as a guide to their observations and analysis of empirical phenomena, Hamilton also speculated about possible proximate behavioural mechanisms that might be observable in organisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to [[inclusive fitness]] would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964 1–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1964 |title=[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]] |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton here was suggesting two broad proximate mechanisms by which social traits might meet the criterion of correlation specified by the theory:

'''[[Kin recognition]] (active discrimination)''': if a social trait enables an organism to distinguish between different degrees of genetic relatedness when interacting in a mixed population,  and to discriminate (positively) in performing social behaviours on the basis of detecting genetic relatedness, then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough to meet the criterion. In another section of the same paper (page 54) Hamilton considered whether 'supergenes' that identify copies of themselves in others might evolve to give more accurate information about genetic relatedness. He later (1987, see below) considered this to be wrong-headed and withdrew the suggestion.

'''Viscous populations (spatial cues)''': even indiscriminate altruism may achieve the correlation in 'viscous' populations where individuals have low rates of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] or short distances of dispersal from their home range (their location of birth). Here, social partners are typically genealogically closely related, and so altruism can flourish even in the absence of [[kin recognition]] and kin discrimination faculties – spatial proximity and circumstantial cues provide the necessary correlation.

These two alternative suggestions had important effects on how field biologists understood the theory and what they looked for in the behavior of organisms. Within a few years biologists were looking for evidence that 'kin recognition' mechanisms might occur in organisms, assuming this was a necessary prediction of inclusive fitness theory, leading to a sub-field of 'kin recognition' research.

===Later theoretical refinements===
{{See also|kin recognition}}

A common source of confusion around inclusive fitness theory is that Hamilton's early analysis included some inaccuracies, that, ''although corrected by him in later publications'', are often not fully understood by other researchers who attempt to apply inclusive fitness to understanding organisms' behaviour. For example, Hamilton had initially suggested that the statistical correlation in his formulation could be understood by a correlation coefficient of genetic relatedness, but quickly accepted [[George R. Price|George Price's]] correction that a general regression coefficient was the more relevant metric, and together they published corrections in 1970. A related confusion is the connection between inclusive fitness and [[multi-level selection]], which are often incorrectly assumed to be mutually exclusive theories. The regression coefficient helps to clarify this connection:

{{quote|Because of the way it was first explained, the approach using inclusive fitness has often been identified with 'kin selection' and presented strictly as an alternative to 'group selection'. But the foregoing discussion shows that kinship should be considered just one way of getting positive regression of genotype in the recipient, and that it is this positive regression that is vitally necessary for altruism. Thus the inclusive-fitness concept is more general than 'kin selection'.(Hamilton 1996 [1975], 337)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1975 |title=Innate social aptitudes of man: an approach from evolutionary genetics |journal=Biosocial anthropology |volume=133 |pages=155 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton also later modified his thinking about likely mediating mechanisms whereby social traits achieve the necessary correlation with genetic relatedness. Specifically he corrected his earlier speculations that an innate ability (and 'supergenes') to recognise actual genetic relatedness was a likely mediating mechanism for kin altruism:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees. (Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"/&gt;}}

The point about inbreeding avoidance is significant, since the whole genome of sexual organisms benefits from avoiding close inbreeding; there is a different selection pressure at play compared to the selection pressure on social traits (see [[Kin recognition]] for more information).

{{quote|It does not follow… that ability to discriminate degrees of relatedness automatically implies that kin selection is the model relevant to its origin. In fact, since even earlier than Darwin, it had been realised that most organisms tend to avoid closely inbred matings. The reasons must have to do with the function of sexuality and this is not quite yet resolved (see e.g. Bell, 1982; Shields, 1982; Hamilton, 1982); but whatever the function is, here must be another set of reasons for discriminating. Some animals clearly do use discrimination for purposes of mate selection. Japanese quail for example evidently use an early imprinting of their chick companions towards obtaining, much later, preferred degrees of consanguinity in their mates (Bateson 1983). (Hamilton 1987, 419)}}

Since Hamiton's 1964 speculations about active discrimination mechanisms (above), other theorists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] had clarified that there would be negative selection pressure against mechanisms for genes to recognize copies of themselves in other individuals and discriminate socially between them on this basis. Dawkins used his '[[Green-beard effect|Green beard]]' thought experiment, where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there would be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed via [[Meiotic Drive|meitoic drive]].

===Ongoing misconceptions===

Hamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed, and because of the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition, some theorists have later tried to clarify the position:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991).  In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways – kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971,1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p.243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;West et al. 2011. Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans. Evolution and Social Behaviour 32 (2011) 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The assumption that 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' has obscured the more parsimonious possibility that spatial-cue-based mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context are commonly found in many organisms that have been studied, including in social mammal species. As Hamilton pointed out, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start" (Hamilton 1987, see above section). Since a reliable context of interaction between social actors is always a [[necessary condition]] for social traits to emerge, a reliable context of interaction is necessarily present to be leveraged by context-dependent cues to mediate social behaviours. Focus on mediating mechanisms of limited dispersal and reliable developmental context has allowed significant progress in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety of species, including humans,&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;Holland, Maximilian. (2012) ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of cue-based mediation of [[Social bonding and nurture kinship|social bonding and social behaviours]] (see below).

== Mammal evidence ==

In [[mammal]]s, as well as in other species, [[ecological niche]] and demographic conditions strongly shape typical contexts of interaction between individuals, including the frequency and circumstances surrounding the interactions between genetic relatives. Although mammals exist in a wide variety of ecological conditions and varying demographic arrangements, certain contexts of interaction between genetic relatives are nevertheless reliable enough for selection to act upon. New born mammals are often immobile and always totally dependent (socially dependent if you will) on their carer(s) for nursing with nutrient rich milk and for protection. This fundamental social dependence is a fact of life for all mammals, including humans. These conditions lead to a reliable spatial context in which there is a statistical association of replica genes between a reproductive female and her infant offspring (and has been evolutionary typical) for most mammal species. Beyond this natal context, extended possibilities for frequent interaction between related individuals are more variable and depend on group living vs. solitary living, mating patterns, duration of pre-maturity development, dispersal patterns, and more. For example, in group living [[primate]]s with females remaining in their natal group for their entire lives, there will be lifelong opportunities for interactions between female individuals related through their mothers and grandmothers etc. These conditions also thus provide a spatial-context for cue-based mechanisms to mediate social behaviours.

{{quote|The most widespread and important mechanism for kin recognition in mammals appears to be familiarity through prior association (Bekoff, 1981; Sherman, 1980). During development, individuals learn and respond to cues from the most familiar or most commonly encountered conspecifics in their environment. Individuals respond to familiar individuals as kin and unfamiliar individuals as nonkin. (Erhart et al. 1997, 153–154)}}

{{quote|Mammalian young are born into a wide variety of social situations, ranging from being isolated from all other individuals except their mother (and possibly other siblings) to being born into large social groups. Although siblings do interact in a wide variety of species having different life histories, there are certain conditions, almost all of which have to do with the developmental environment, that will favor a biased occurrence of interactions between littermates and/or different-aged siblings. It will be argued later that it is these, and perhaps other, conditions that ''predispose'' (in a probabilistic way) siblings to interact with one another. However, if two (or more) very young unrelated individuals (assume conspecifics for simplicity) are exposed to these conditions, they too will behave like siblings. That is, although [relatedness] and [familiarity] are tightly linked in many mammals, it is [familiarity] that can override [relatedness], rather than the reverse. (Bekoff 1981, 309)}}

In addition to the above examples, a wide variety of evidence from mammal species supports the finding that shared context and familiarity mediate social bonding, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; Cross-fostering studies (placing unrelated young in a shared developmental environment) strongly demonstrate that unrelated individuals bond and cooperate just as would normal littermates. The evidence therefore demonstrates that bonding and cooperation are mediated by proximity, shared context and familiarity, not via active recognition of genetic relatedness. This is problematic for those biologists who wish to claim that inclusive fitness theory predicts that social cooperation is ''mediated'' via genetic relatedness, rather than understanding the theory simply to state that social traits can ''evolve'' under conditions where there is ''statistical'' association of genetically related organisms. The former position sees the expression of cooperative behaviour as more or less deterministically caused by genetic relatedness, where the latter position does not. The distinction between cooperation mediated by shared context, and cooperation mediated by genetic relatedness ''per se'', has significant implications for whether inclusive fitness theory can be seen as compatible with the anthropological evidence on human social patterns or not. The ''shared context'' perspective is largely compatible, the ''genetic relatedness'' perspective is not (see below).

==Human kinship and cooperation==

The debate about how to interpret the implications of Inclusive fitness theory for human social cooperation has paralleled some of the key misunderstandings outlined above.  Initially, evolutionary biologists interested in humans wrongly assumed that in the human case, 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' along with their colleagues studying other species (see West et al., above). In other words, many biologists assumed that strong social bonds accompanied by altruism and cooperation in human societies (long studied by the anthropological field of kinship) were necessarily built upon recognizing genetic relatedness (or 'blood ties'). This seemed to fit well with historical research in anthropology originating in the nineteenth century (see [[Kinship#History of kinship studies|history of kinship]]) that often assumed that human kinship was built upon a recognition of shared blood ties.

However, independently of the emergence of inclusive fitness theory, from 1960s onwards many anthropologists themselves had reexamined the balance of findings in their own ethnographic data and had begun to reject the notion that human kinship is 'caused by' blood ties (see [[Kinship]]). Anthropologists have gathered very extensive [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] data on human social patterns and behaviour over a century or more, from a wide spectrum of different cultural groups. The data demonstrates that many cultures do not consider 'blood ties' (in the genealogical sense) to underlie their close social relationships and kinship bonds. Instead social bonds are often considered to be based on location-based shared circumstances including living together (co-residence), sleeping close together, working together, sharing food (commensality) and other forms of shared life together. Comparative anthropologists have shown&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; that these aspects of shared circumstances are a significant component of what influences kinship in most human cultures, notwithstanding whether or not 'blood ties' are necessarily present (see [[Nurture kinship]], below).

Although blood ties (and genetic relatedness) often correlate with kinship, just as in the case of mammals (above section), evidence from human societies suggests that it is not the genetic relatedness ''per se'' that is the mediating mechanism of social bonding and cooperation, instead it is the shared context (albeit typically consisting of genetic relatives) and the familiarity that arises from it, that mediate the social bonds. This implies that genetic relatedness is not the ''determining mechanism'' nor required for the formation of social bonds in kinship groups, or for the expression of altruism in humans, even if statistical correlations of genetic relatedness are an ''evolutionary criterion'' for the emergence of such social traits in biological organisms over evolutionary timescales. Understanding this distinction between the ''statistical role of genetic relatedness in the evolution of social traits'' and yet its ''lack of necessary determining role in mediating mechanisms of social bonding and the expression of altruism'' is key to inclusive fitness theory's proper application to human social behaviour (as well as to other mammals).

===Nurture kinship===
{{Main article|Nurture kinship}}

Compatible with biologists' emphasis on familiarity and shared context mediating social bonds, the concept of [[nurture kinship]] in the anthropological study of human social relationships highlights the extent to which such relationships are brought into being through the performance of various acts of sharing, acts of care and performance of [[nurture]] between individuals who live in close proximity. Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. The concept stands in contrast to the earlier anthropological concepts of human kinship relations being fundamentally based on "blood ties", some other form of shared substance, or a proxy for these (as in [[fictive kinship]]), and the accompanying notion that people universally understand their social relationships predominantly in these terms.

The nurture kinship perspective on the ontology of social ties, and how people conceptualize them, has become stronger in the wake of [[David M. Schneider]]'s influential ''Critique of the Study of Kinship''&lt;sup&gt;[[Nurture kinship|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and Holland's subsequent ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological approaches'', demonstrating that as well as the ethnographic record, ''biological theory and evidence'' also more strongly support the ''nurture'' perspective than the ''blood'' perspective. Both Schneider and Holland argue that the earlier ''blood'' theory of kinship derived from an unwarranted extension of symbols and values from anthropologists' own cultures (see [[ethnocentrism]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">'''Information manipulation theory''' ('''IMT''') (McCornack 1992) &amp; (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a  sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of information—but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is ''deceit''. The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called ''information manipulation''. Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.

==History and central themes==

Information manipulation theory (IMT) was formulated by Steven A. McCornack while an assistant professor and a Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellow at Michigan State University. In 1992, McCornack published two articles that are recognized as the seminal works in information manipulation theory.  In his first article, McCornack lays out the basic foundation of this theoretical option for examining the phenomenon of creating and relaying deceptive messages. As stated, IMT “suggests that deceptive messages function deceptively because they violate the principles that govern conversational exchanges” (McCornack 1992). The second article (McCornack et al. 1992) provided an empirical test of the theory.

Timothy Levine (PhD, Michigan State University, 1992) was present for the first empirical test for information manipulation theory, has been a significant contributor to the development of IMT, and is a leader in developing new paradigms for [[deception]] detection research. IMT provided impetus to the development of a message-based theory of deception detection that calls into question psychophysical and emotion-based theories of deception detection as well as the interaction-based IDT.

==Operational context==

Information manipulation theory, not unlike [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) is a subset and functional manifestation of interpersonal communication. According to David Buller and Judee Burgoon, “Deception is conceptualized as a form of information management, something that is fundamental to human communication (Buller &amp; Burgoon 1998).”  IMT is concerned with the way that relational goals and situational pressures influence the interpersonal communication process, and ultimately leads to the formation and implementation of deceptive verbal messages.

==Conceptual foundation==

Prior to the introduction of information manipulation theory as a potential way to observe the phenomenon of verbally controlling information there was literature on the subject of information control and deception in general. McCornack cites Turner, Edgley and Olmstead (1975) and how they “noted several forms of information control in their study of conversations (e.g. “lies,” “exaggerations,” “half-truths,” “secrets,” and diversionary responses) (McCornack et al. 1992).”  Buller and Burgoon again draw upon Turner et al. when referring to deception as “a very common form of information management in human interaction (Buller and Burgoon 1998).” With the notion of deception already being established in circles of communication studies and behavioral science as a topic of discussion and analysis by the 1980s, we have the development of conceptual constructs regarding the topic. In 1984, Hopper and Bell introduce a typology of deceptive types using English terms. The types noted in McCornack’s work are listed as follows: unlies, playings, fiction, masks, lies, and crimes (McCornack et al. 1992). In another oft-cited work from the 1980s, we are given another typology. In 1986, Metts and Chronis proposed another four types and in 1989 Metts asserted that regardless of the differences in semantics, all the “taxonomies” to date reflected a similarity in the formulation of deceptive messages. Metts states “the observable variation in deceptive message design reflects “a continuum of covert to overt misrepresentation of information.” (McCornack et al., 1992) Finally, you have [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) introduced in 1988 by David Buller and Judee Burgoon, which proposes that deception is a distinct communicative process that relies on interaction between the sender and receiver. IDT focuses on emotion both as a motivator and message in the process as well as the mechanical aspects of how that communication takes place (Buller and Burgoon 1998).

==Theoretical perspective==

Information manipulation theory departs from [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] in the substance of the focus of its studies.  Whereas Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) spends more time studying the physiological challenges and channels of communication involved in the detection of deceptive messages, information manipulation theory is more involved with the content of the messages and why they are employed. This is a distinction that can be examined in terms of how these theories approach the divergence from communication norms. IDT is more involved with the physical and biological deviation of normal behavior exhibited in communication. IMT is more fixed on the departure from conversational standards. Both theories aimed at discovering more about the relational effect of discovering that an act of deception has taken place.

==Previous research==

Before the advent of information manipulation theory, researchers were not interested in the formulation or design of the deceptive message. Previous studies on deception were more concerned with the mode of communication because deception was thought to occur in typical human interactions in unnatural polarized ways. Additionally, use of recollection as a method generating “normal” cognitive examples of deception scenarios further led to this dichotomous perspective. Truth in communication was thought to be clear or unclear. Bavelas et al. (1990) speak to this issue (McCornack 1992). Deception was also viewed to have manifested as either one of two of things: a type or a strategy. McCornack sought to depart from that and present another argument for how deceptive messages might be analyzed. IMT recognizes deception as a unique mode of communication that departs from more traditional, rational communicative behavior. IMT is more directed at answering the question of how a sender might go about engaging in the development and dispensation of a deceptive message and what about that process makes it more or less deceptive (McCornack 1992).

==Theoretical framework==

Information manipulation theory proposes that in any given conversation there exists a set of basic, reasonable assumptions about how transmission of information occurs. This premise is based on the work of [[Paul Grice]]. Taken from his speeches in 1967 to writings in 1975 and 1989, Grice promoted notions regarding language usage that has come to be known as his theory of “conversational implicature” (CI) (McCornack 1992).
*''Conversational implicature''

Jacobs, Dawson and Brashers (1996) recount Grice stating “communication is made possible by communicators’ mutually orienting toward general principles of cooperation and rationality.” The vehicles that deliver CI are what Grice refers to as conversational maxims (CM).  CM can be used as dimensions to determine the degree of deceptiveness.

*''Conversational maxims''

These maxims are as follows:
# Quantity &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the reasonable amount of information that should be provided in a given message
# Quality &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the veracity (truthfulness) of information that is presented in a given message
# Relation &amp;mdash; relates to relevancy expectations regarding the constraints of the conversation established by earlier remarks
# Manner &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the way something is said
(McCornack 1992)

*''Cooperative principle''

Grice posits that the resulting ‘norm’ that arises from adherence to CM is by virtue of what is called the Cooperative Principle (CP).

These maxims are only totally adhered to in what is called ‘a philosopher’s paradise’ but generally these maxims can be adhered to within a conversational context. Grice calls the obvious real world violation of a CM as “flouts”; when one CM opposes another, this is referred to as a “clash” (Jacobs et al. 1996).  In the case of the former this violation can happen “quietly.”
 
It is a major tenet of IMT that the subtle and covert nature of these violations of conversational norm assumptions is precisely what makes a message deceptive. A message can be identified in terms of its deceptiveness dependent on where it is measured according to the dimensions of the conversational maxims (McCornack 1992).

==Major experimental findings==

* The initial experiments regarding information manipulation theory confirmed that the degree to which a message can be determined to be deceptive can be coded and measured along the dimensions of its violations of CM. The deception by the receiver is experienced when the CP understood to occur is not adhered to by the sender. This experiment also questioned the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure of available information compared to social goal or consequences (McCornack et al. 1992).
* The second set of experiments measure the effect of the dimensions compared to each other. It was discovered some violations were considered “more deceptive” than others. Another discovery was that the nature of the relationship has an effect on the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure. In regard to romantic relationships, full disclosure is more ‘competent’ because relational honesty was considered paramount (McCornack 1992).
* Another significant experiment was performed to see if the results of McCornack’s theory could be generalized outside of Western cultures. This was examined through the lens of the individualist vs. collectivist debate. These two cultural poles are regarded as the most overarching themes of cultural identity and perspective. With the U.S. regarded as being representative of the Individualist perspective, Hong Kong was chosen to represent the Collectivist perspective. The dimensions of quality and relevance were regarded as deceptive, but not the other dimensions.  This experiment concluded that what is seen as '''truthful'', what violations are acceptable, the motivation for those violations and what is understood to be a conversational maxim is dependent on cultural identity (Yeung, Levine, &amp; Nishiyama 1999).
* Another experiment performed by L. Zhou and S. Lutterbie followed the work of the aforementioned tests of IMT. This experiment concluded that the best way to apply the principles of IMT across cultures is to take a multi-directional, multi-prong approach. This subject of normative actions in conversation should be approached with a top-down and bottom-up approach (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).

==Influential factors==

*''Cultural concept''

IMT as it is applied in cultural contexts varies. When evaluating Western culture it was discovered that all methods of manipulation were viewed as deceptive with manipulation of quality rated as most deceptive.  Conversely, IMT participants in Hong Kong only rated statements involved with quality and/or relevance as more manipulative and deceptive (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).  Both researchers agree that the Bottom-Up approach is an effective method for examining general patterns of deception across cultures while the Top-Down approach can account for situational variations to explain deceptive behavior patterns in order to create an applicable cross-cultural IMT model.

*''Moral judgment''

Research suggests young children's view of how information is perceived as deceptive varies as children grow older.  This variation in moral judgment suggests that moral development is critical in perceptions of right or wrong.  As individuals experience a series of (moral) developmental stages such as avoiding punishment, gaining rewards, identifying individual duty role in society to meet expectations of others (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005), different behavior modeling criteria is established through communication situations that cognitively stimulates and challenges moral judgment. These stages, frequency and types of development models are theorized to be more or less universal across cultures.  However, moral judgment in IMT should be reserved for other communication theory that more distinctly addresses broad, generic cultural criteria patterns and specific requirements of societies to establish what does or does not covertly violate global conversational maxims.
 
*''Consequence resulting from the deceptive message''

IMT supports the idea that deception may or may not be detectable. When participants are asked to rate message features like how much information was false, omitted, equivocal and/or irrelevant, researchers can reasonably measure and describe such multidimensional deceptive messages.  However, the measurability results and conceptual meaning of degrees of deception and its impact is unclear (Levine, Asada &amp; Lindsey 2003).  Information that is manipulated on a continuum from trivial deception to important deception can range from socially acceptable to morally reprehensible.  The more severe lies are rated, the more deceptive the lies than inconsequential ones. Deceiving others about important information is more likely to result in adverse moral judgment and/or moral condemnation.

==Criticism of IMT==

The most significant criticism of information manipulation theory has come in the form of the following two arguments:

* IMT does not correctly interpret the  writings of [[Paul Grice]]'s notion of Conversational Implicature, Conversational Maxims or Cooperation Principle.  This issue was addressed in a critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT provides an explanation for the multiple ways deception can occur. However, it does not predict what conversational maxims a person may violate—only that the violation will occur within the certain realm of possibilities or scenarios provided.  IMT predicts and analyzes the methods of deception a person uses by determining what information is eliminated.
* IMT testing predictions can be made more accurate by use of a different set of information dimensions.  This issue was also addressed in the critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT is a value conscious communication theory.  The researcher must judge and develop criteria for what may be considered deceptiveness.  While violations of the maxim of quality and quantity are more or less objectively derived, violations of relation and manner are largely subjectively assessed. For this reason the researcher must be aware of his/her own bias, value and belief systems and incorporate these predispositions when making these judgments.  Researchers must also construct sound, qualitative/quantitative evaluative criteria to optimize and legitimize the integrity and credibility of their work.

An '''isochrone map''' (or chart/diagram) in [[geography]] and [[urban planning]] is a map showing areas related to [[wikt:isochrone|isochrone]]s between different points. An isochrone is defined as "a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/7633e871-05b8-428f-bbcd-cf6d9163bab8/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/c7b45b1f-d4f4-413c-b5aa-b0579c87049f/Isochrones-Desai_Iss2_1108.pdf |title=Isochrones: Analysis of  Local Geographic Markets |last=Desai |first=Kiran |date=17 October 2008 |website=Mayer Brown |access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a map is sometimes termed simply an '''isochrone''' (iso = equal, chrone = time).

===Transport planning===

Isochrone maps in the context of transport planning are essentially maps of [[Accessibility (transport)|accessibility]] where travel time is used as the cost the metric.

A '''liberal education''' is a system or course of education suitable for the cultivation of a [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] (Latin: ''liber'') human being. It is based on the [[Medieval university|medieval]] concept of the [[liberal arts]] or, more commonly now, the [[liberalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Liberal Arts Education|url=http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215125841/http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/liberal-arts-education|archivedate=15 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as "a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ... characterised by challenging encounters with important issues, and more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study" by the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Liberal Education?|url=http://www.aacu.org/resources/liberaleducation/index.cfm|publisher=Association of American Colleges &amp; Universities|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Usually global and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] in scope, it can include a general education [[curriculum]] which provides broad exposure to multiple disciplines and learning strategies in addition to in-depth study in at least one [[Academia|academic]] area.

Liberal education was advocated in the 19th century by thinkers such as [[John Henry Newman]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]].
[[Wilfred Griffin Eady|Sir Wilfred Griffin Eady]] defined liberal education as being education for its own sake and personal enrichment, with the teaching of values.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison]] (1954); ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854–1954)'', p. 191; Routledge Kegan Paul. {{ISBN|0-415-43221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of liberal education is often attributed to mobilization during the Second World War. The premium and emphasis placed upon mathematics, science, and technical training caused the loss of its prominent position in higher education studies. However, it became central to much undergraduate education in the United States in the mid-20th century, being conspicuous in the movement for 'general education'.

==Definition==
The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] describes a liberal education in this way: "Ideally, a liberal education produces persons who are open-minded and free from provincialism, dogma, preconception, and ideology; conscious of their opinions and judgments; reflective of their actions; and aware of their place in the social and natural worlds."{{sfn|Project on Liberal Education and the Sciences|1990|p=xi}} Liberally educated people are skeptical of their own traditions; they are trained to think for themselves rather than conform to higher authorities.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=10}}

It also cultivates "active citizenship" through off-campus community service, internships, research, and study abroad.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=6–8}} Some faculty see this movement towards "civic engagement" as more pedagogically powerful than traditional classroom teaching, but opponents argue that the education occurring within an academic institution must be purely intellectual and scholarly.{{sfn|Freeland|2009|pp=10–11}}

A liberal education combines an education in the [[classics]], [[English literature]], the [[humanities]], and moral virtues.{{sfn|Van Doren|1943|p=43}} The term ''liberal education'' in the modern sense should not be confused with ''[[liberal arts education]]''; the latter deals with academic subjects, while the former deals with ideological subjects. Indeed, a liberal arts education does not necessarily include a liberal education, and a liberal arts program may even be as specialized as a vocational program.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=56}} For practical purposes, liberal education is not actually differentiated from liberal arts education today, except by scholars.

Unlike a professional and vocational education that prepares students for their careers, a liberal education prepares students to utilize their leisure time. Such an education helps the individual navigate internal and external conflicts in life. For example, a liberal education aims to help students be self-conscious and aware of their actions and motivations. Individuals also become more considerate for other beliefs and cultures. According to James Engel, the author of ''The Value of a Liberal Arts Education'', ''"A liberal education provides the framework for an educated and thoughtful citizen."''{{sfn|The Value of a Liberal Arts Education||}}

==History==
Definitions of a liberal education may be broad, generalized, and sometimes even contradictory.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=52}} "It is at once the most enduring and changeable of academic traditions."{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} Axelrod, Anisef, and Lin suggest that conceptions of liberal education are rooted in the teaching methods of [[Ancient Greece]],{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=50}} a slave-owning community divided between slaves and freemen. The freemen, mostly concerned about their rights and obligations as citizens, received a non-specialized, non-vocational, [[liberal arts]] education that produced well-rounded citizens aware of their place in society. At the same time, [[Socrates]] emphasized the importance of [[individualism]], impressing upon his students the duty of man to form his own opinions through reason rather than indoctrination. [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] education also provided a balance between developing the mind and the body. Another possibility is that liberal education dates back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]], where the teachings of [[Confucianism]] focused on propriety, morality, and social order. Hoerner{{who|date=January 2015}} also suggests that [[Jesus]] was a liberal educator, as "he was talking of a free man capable of thinking for himself and of being a responsible citizen," but liberal education is still commonly traced back to the Greeks.{{sfn|Valerio, Jim Ellis|1970|pp=2–3}}

While liberal education was stifled during the barbarism of the [[Early Middle Ages]], it rose to prominence once again in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, especially with the re-emergence of [[Aristotelian philosophy]]. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw a revolt against narrow spirituality and educators started to focus on the human, rather than God. This [[humanism|humanist]] approach favored reason, nature and aesthetics.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=4–6}}

Study of the [[Classics]] and [[humanities]] slowly returned in the fourteenth century, which led to increased study of both [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, liberal education focused mostly on the classics. Commoners, however, were not too keen on studying the classics, so they instead took up vernacular languages and literature, and also the sciences. Until at least the twentieth century, both humanist and classicist influences remained in the liberal education, and proponents of a [[progressive education]] also embraced the humanist philosophy. Study of the classics continued in the form of the [[Great Books]] program.{{sfn|Hoerner|1970|pp=7–8}} [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] brought this program to the [[University of Chicago]]. Upon Hutchins' resignation, the university got rid of the program, but an adapted version still exists at [[Shimer College]].

While liberal education is a Western movement, it has been influential in other regions as well. For example, in Japan during the general liberalism of the [[Taishō period]], there was a liberal education movement that saw the establishment of a number of schools based on liberal education in the 1920s – see [[:ja:大正自由教育運動|大正自由教育運動]].

==Relationship with professional education==
Liberal education and professional education have often been seen as divergent. [[German universities]] moved towards more professional teaching in the nineteenth century, and unlike American students, who still pursued a liberal education, students elsewhere started to take professional courses in the first or second year of study.{{sfn|Ofer|2007|p=47}} In the early twentieth century, [[American liberal arts colleges]] still required students to pursue a common curriculum, whereas public universities allowed a student to move on to more pragmatic courses after having taken general education courses for the first two years of study. As an emphasis on specialized knowledge grew in the middle of the century, colleges began to adjust the proportion of required general education courses to those required for a particular major.{{sfn|Fong|2004|pp=8–9}}

As [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] points out, standardized testing has placed more emphasis on honing technical knowledge, and its quantitative, multiple-choice nature prompts rote learning in the classroom. At the same time, humanistic concepts such as imagination and critical thinking, which cannot be tested by such methods, are disappearing from college curricula.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|p=13}}

Thirty percent of college graduates in the United States are likely to eventually work in jobs that do not exist yet.{{sfn|Fong|2004|p=9}} Proponents of a liberal education therefore argue that a postsecondary education must prepare students for an increasingly complex labor market. Rather than provide narrowly designed technical courses, a liberal education would foster critical thinking and analytical skills that allow the student to adapt to a rapidly changing workforce.{{sfn|Geary Schneider|2009}} The movement towards career-oriented courses within a liberal education has begun at places like [[Dartmouth College]], where a journalism course combines lessons on writing style with reading and analyzing historical journalism.{{sfn|Jaschik|2004}} An American survey of CEOs published in 1997 revealed that employers were more focused on the long-term outcomes of education, such as adaptability, than college students and their parents, who were more concerned with the short-term outcomes of getting a job.{{sfn|Axelrod|Anisef|Lin|2001|p=56}}

==Provision==
Ronel B. Esquivel said only eight percent of colleges provide a liberal education to four percent of students in the United States.{{sfn|Shoenberg|2009|p=59}} Liberal education revived three times in the United States during periods of industrialization and shifts of social preoccupations—before [[World War I]], after [[World War II]], and in the late 1970s—perhaps as a reaction against overspecialization in undergraduate curricula.{{sfn|Xin|2004|p=1}}

Currently, pressures from employers, parents and governments have defined the type of education offered at educational institutions. Such trends have curtailed the role of education offered in America. Universities have now provided education for the sole purpose to prepare students for the workforce. This idea has negatively influenced the credibility of liberal education which has impacted how students view higher education. The negative impact being a focus on specific disciplinary practices separating it from the original ideology of liberal education as a "...a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement ..." {{sfn|"The parent factor: how parents view their school-aged children's options for college."||}} Politicians have influenced the type of education provided at universities. These politicians have been recently cutting the funds for universities applying immense pressure on higher educational institutions. Lack of funds have caused many to abandon the liberal arts curricula. Therefore, universities have been forced to provide a curriculum useful for providing a vocational education. The lack of funds to maintain a balanced education system has caused American universities to provide an education with a lack of emphasis on liberal values.{{sfn| Kiener Robert|2013|p=63-64}}

The disappearance of liberal education can also be traced to Liberal Art Colleges. Students are beginning to view higher education as a preparation for careers. This has then led to the natural selection of colleges. Obviously, the thought of having education that instructs to enhance the individual for the purpose of improving society does not meet current demands. Thus, as a result, Liberal Art Colleges are diminishing along with the emphasis on providing a liberal education. .{{sfn|Di Leo|2011|pp=1-2}}

Chinese universities began to implement liberal curricula between the 1920s and 1940s, but shifted to specialized education upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. Higher education reform in the 1990s returned to liberal education. In 2000 [[Peking University]] started to offer a liberal education curriculum to its undergraduate students, followed by other institutions throughout the country.{{sfn|Xin|2004|pp=1–2}}

Some of the universities in [[India]] have started offering Liberal Arts Education. [[Ahmedabad University]] is one such young university which offers students a&amp;nbsp;[[Liberal arts education|liberal education]]&amp;nbsp;focused on research and interdisciplinary learning.

'''''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Pagan]] and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that practiced [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in London, England during the 1990s. It was written by English anthropologist Susan Greenwood based upon her doctoral research undertaken at [[Goldsmiths' College]], a part of the [[University of London]], and first published in 2000 by [[Berg Publishers]].

Greenwood became involved in the [[Western esotericism|esoteric movement]] during the 1980s as a practitioner of [[Dianic Wicca|a feminist form of Wicca]]. Devoting her doctorate to the subject, her research led her to join [[Kabbalistic]] orders and two [[Wicca]]n [[coven]]s, during which she emphasised that she was both an "insider" (a practising [[occultist]]) and an "outsider" (an anthropological observer). Reacting against the work of [[Tanya Luhrmann]], who had authored the primary anthropological study of the London occult scene, ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft]]'' (1989), Greenwood argued against studying magical beliefs from a [[rationalism|western rationalist]] perspective, instead adopting a theoretical approach informed by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenology]] and [[cultural relativism|relativism]]. Greenwood's research focused on Pagan and magical conceptions of the "[[otherworld]]". The book's first chapter summarises the Pagan magical conception of the otherworld, and subsequent chapters detail Greenwood's experiences with Kabbalistic magic and Wicca. The work goes on to discuss issues of [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]], [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[morality]] and [[ethics]] within London's esoteric community, and the manner in which the community's members' views on these issues are influenced by their beliefs regarding an otherworld.

''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was reviewed by various figures involved in both academia and the Pagan community including Douglas Ezzy and [[Phil Hine]]. Greenwood herself would go on to author several other books on the relationship between magic and anthropology.

==Background==

===Anthropological fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Greenwood's work, several academic researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom. First among these was the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders based in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and Wiccan literary critic Shirley Stave undertook fieldwork in the Ravenwood coven of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], over several months across 1990 and 1991 as the basis for ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]'', published by Praeger in 1994,&lt;ref name="Scarboro"&gt;[[#Sca94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt; while anthropologist and Wiccan Loretta Orion investigated the Pagan movement in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the U.S. for ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'', published by Waveland Press in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenwood and her research===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is a study of certain ideas, philosophies, practices and groups within the [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric tradition]] in the last decade of the twentieth century. I explore, through issues concerning magical identity, gender, and morality, aspects of what magicians term the 'otherworld'."|source=—Susan Greenwood, 2000.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
As a child, Greenwood had found a greater spiritual connection with the natural world than with [[organised religion]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; During the late 1970s, she embraced [[second-wave feminism]] and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics|Dreaming the Dark]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; Attracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality. Exploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby conducting the research underpinning ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld''.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt;

Although initially planning to gather data through formal taped interviews with participants, she rejected this method, believing it solidified her "outsider" status among the subculture she was studying. Instead, her data was collected through informal conversations with practitioners, during which she tried to make clear that she was an anthropologist and would use their comments in her work.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the course of her research, Greenwood gained many friends within the city's Pagan community, and became sexually and emotionally attached to one magician.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"/&gt; Greenwood's research was funded using grants from the University of London Central Research Fund and from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; She devoted the published work to her children, Adrian and Lauren.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[Image:RWS Tarot 05 Hierophant.jpg|thumb|150px|Greenwood includes in her work an image of Tarot card "The Hierophant", which she was taught to meditate on while working with Qabalistic magic.]]

Chapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines "the otherworld". It discusses London's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s, and Greenwood's relationship with it. Admitting to being an "insider", she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second chapter examines the community's conceptions of the otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and [[altered states of consciousness]] and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] or [[relativism|relativist]] perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her third chapter, Greenwood examines her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her training in the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], a "magical language" for exploring the otherworld. Adopting Luhrmann's concept of "[[interpretative drift]]", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences. However, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn "the language of another mode of reality" through their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four details Greenwood's early involvement in Wicca, through three separate covens. Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the [[Great Rite]] and the [[Gnostic Mass]] as evidence. The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|left|Greenwood's work is based upon her fieldwork within the practicing Pagan community.]]

Chapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners, and its uses for [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]]. Greenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against [[Christianity]], and their construction of a "magical identity", believing this to be "organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld". She also looks at magic and the acquisition of [[power (philosophy)|power]], and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 117&amp;ndash;149.&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth chapter focuses on notions of [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] on this issue; the former emphasised harmony and balance between "masculine" and "feminine" magical forces, while the latter advocated "magical anarchy" or spiritual autonomy for each individual, irrespective of gender. Greenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic (ceremonial magic), Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft. Drawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion [[Susan J. Palmer]], she argues that High Magic emphasises "sex polarity", a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different, whereas Wicca holds to a position of "sex complementarity", in which men and women are seen as different yet equal, and Feminist Witchcraft advocates "sex unity", in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 151&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter seven deals with conceptions of [[morality]] and [[ethics]], arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] world view of [[Good and evil|good versus evil]], Wicca adheres to a [[monism|monistic]] worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe as a part of moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the [[Qliphoth]], before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 179&amp;ndash;208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central arguments==
Greenwood states that western esotericists have a [[holism|holistic]], [[animism|animistic]] view of [[cosmology]], considering the universe to be alive and interconnected with [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energies]]. According to such beliefs, many of these energies operate in "a time and space distinct from, but also very closely connected to, everyday reality", and it is this area that is termed the "otherworld" in Pagan discourse.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; She relates that western esotericists believe in forces who inhabit this otherworld, and who are personalized as deities, animal guides, or spirit beings.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She furthermore states that these individuals see themselves as [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]s of the universal [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt;

Greenwood highlights the practitioners' belief that they can interact with this otherworld and the entities which inhabit it through rituals that facilitate their own [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She notes that western magicians make use of [[mythology]] as a form of "cognitive map" to "structure their otherworldy experience".&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 24"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that this otherworld is closely linked to [[dream]]s and the [[imagination]] in western magical belief.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 25-26"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwood argues that the academic discipline of [[anthropology]], being a product of the western [[rationalism]] developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is innately skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld, either among non-western cultures or western subcultures. In contrast to this attitude, she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that "reality is culturally constructed" and that there are "multiple ways of experiencing the world", including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality. For this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that "it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic===
Greenwood's text was reviewed by Patric V. Giesler of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] for peer-reviewed academic journal ''[[American Ethnologist]]''. Giesler describes Greenwood's work as "provocative", noting that it represents a "native's account" of Paganism, with Greenwood being "a native gone anthropologist." He characterises Greenwood's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical, because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end; the classic definition of magic. Unconvinced by her argument that practitioner's notions of identity, gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld, he considers other sources for such notions, but otherwise recommended the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gie02|Giesler 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also reviewed by religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] of [[Bath Spa University]] for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. Labelling it an "enormously engaging, provocative, and rich book", he notes that readers may wish that Greenwood had more explicitly presented "the antipatriarchal assumptions and their shortcomings" of Feminist Witchcraft. Comparing it with Luhrmann's ''Persuasions of the Witch's Craft'', York comments that it is a "discerningly astute, nonretreating, thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended work."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor01|York 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah M. Pike of the [[California State University, Chico]] reviewed the book for ''Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', describing it as an "accessible and personal account". Believing that it made an "important contribution" to Pagan studies and the anthropological study of magic, she nevertheless thought that Greenwood's subjective attitude was the book's shortcoming as well as its strength. Pike finds problems in Greenwood's insider-outsider status, believing that it has not been sufficiently theorised, and that Greenwood was unaware of her own bias in favour of Feminist Witchcraft, which in turn affects her interpretation of other forms of Wicca and ceremonial magic. She also critiques the book's lack of commentary or detailed analysis, complaining that many subsections lack conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pik02|Pike 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Galina Lindquist of the [[University of Stockholm]] published a review in ''[[The Australian Journal of Anthropology]]'', referring to ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' as "a welcome contribution" containing "valuable" [[ethnographic]] material. Noting that it joins the work of anthropologists like [[Jeanne Favret-Saada]], [[Paul Stoller]], and E. Turner, Lindquist praises the manner in which Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective, and how she illuminates the "strains and contradictions" within the magical milieu. She believes that Greenwood's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in-depth ethnographic study of magical morality, and considers it unfortunate that Greenwood had not touched on [[ritual studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lin02|Lindquist 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pagan and esoteric community===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is one of the most stimulating and rewarding ethnographies of contemporary Witchcraft I've read. Greenwood has worked hard, and it shows in the quality of her findings and analysis. Her
writing is clear, insightful, and draws on a sophisticated theoretical framework. She describes herself as a communicator between
the worlds of academia and magical counterculture. She is clearly widely read both in the academic literature and the magical texts, more than competent in both worlds, and skilled at revealing one to the other."|source=—Reviewer Douglas Ezzy, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Greenwood's work was independently reviewed by two separate individuals in ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought]]'' &amp;ndash; then a scholarly but not yet academic publication. The first reviewer, Daniel Cohen of ''Wood and Water'' magazine, praises Greenwood's theoretical approach, claiming that she had been "braver" than Luhrmann in maintaining a "creative tension" as both an insider and outsider. Asserting that Greenwood's use of anthropological terminology made for "hard reading", he suspects that her use of the word "magician" would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it. In conclusion, he recommends it as a "valuable but inexpensive book".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coh01|Cohen 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pomegranate'''s second review came from Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the [[University of Tasmania]], who praises Greenwood's research, theoretical approach and style of writing. He notes that her "truly ground breaking" approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had "fascinated and thrilled" him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection ''Being Changed'' by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made him think about these issues "in much sharper focus."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing it for his own website, prominent chaos magician [[Phil Hine]] described Greenwood's work as "fascinating", arguing that it should interest students of anthropology as well as practising occultists. He praises the author's descriptions of her own experiences within esoteric groups, and the manner in which she highlighted the power struggles that take place within them, before recommending it as "an engaging and thought-provoking read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin|Hine n.d.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[thermal equilibrium]] the product of the [[Valence and conduction bands|free electron]] concentration &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the free hole concentration &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is equal to a constant square of intrinsic carrier concentration &lt;math&gt;n_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of temperature.

The equation for the mass action law for [[semiconductor]]s is:&lt;ref name="JNTU"&gt;{{Cite book | last = S | first = Salivahanan |author2=N. Suresh Kumar | title = Electronic Devices &amp; Circuits | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill Education Pvt Ltd | year = 2011 | location = India | pages = 1.14 | isbn = 0-07-070267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;np = n_{i}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Carrier concentrations==
In semiconductors, free electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] are the [[charge carrier|carriers]] that provide [[electrical conduction|conduction]]. For cases where the number of carriers are much less than the number of band states, the carrier concentrations can be approximated by using [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|Boltzmann statistics]], giving the results below.

===Electron concentration===
The free electron concentration ''n'' can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;n=N_c\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_c-E_F)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|conduction band]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvin
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_c=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_e^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; being the electron [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Hole concentration===
The free hole concentration ''p'' is given by a similar formula
:&lt;math&gt;p=N_v\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_F-E_v)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|valence band]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvins 
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the valence band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_v=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_h^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; being the hole [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Mass action law===
Using the carrier concentration equations given above, the mass action law can be stated as
:&lt;math&gt;np = N_cN_v\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_g}{kT}\right) = n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the bandgap energy given by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Master of IT in Business (MITB)''' is a master's degree emphasizing on the application of [[information technology]] to create business impact and value. The MITB degree originated in the early [[21st century]] as the [[digital transformation]] of businesses took place leaving industries to compete with each other on their technological capacity and advancement. The MITB is typically a sandwich course of two distinct horizontals targeted at providing a holistic view and understanding of both [[technology]] and [[management]] alike. The MITB offers a more specialized and niche course selection for [[technology]] and [[business]] education aspirants alike. Students on completion of such degrees typically pursue careers in various verticals leveraging [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbs.rutgers.edu/ |title=Rutgers MBS |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.sg/courses-and-study/courses/course/master-of-information-technology-business-informatics |title=James Cook MITBI |publisher=James Cook University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgrad.com.sg/master-of-it-in-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109110054/http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc200/#pageId=overview |title=RMIT MBIT |publisher=RMIT University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/programs-courses/postgraduate-coursework/agsm-master-business-technology-mbt |title=UNSW MBT |publisher=UNSW |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The degree is offered under various names by:
* [[Singapore Management University]] as Master of IT in Business (MITB) 
* [[Rutgers University]] as Master of Business &amp; Science (MBS)
* [[James Cook University]] as Master of IT in Business Informatics (MITBI)
* [[RMIT]] as Master of Business Information Technology (MBIT) 
* [[UNSW]] as Masters of Business &amp; Technology (MBT)

and by many other universities worldwide.

==Admissions==
Many programs base their admission decisions in a very similar fashion to the [[MBA]] programs, on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work, and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MITB programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MITB programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission.

A '''mechanical joint''' is a section of a [[machine]] which is used to connect one or more mechanical part to another. Mechanical joints may be temporary or permanent, most types are designed to be disassembled. Most mechanical joints are designed to allow relative movement of these mechanical parts of the machine in one degree of freedom (insert LINK), and restrict movement in one or more others.  Mechanical joints are much cheaper and are usually bought ready assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Blake | first1 = Alexander | title = Design of mechanical joints | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-8247-7351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(please add other joints like: U-joint, ball joint, prismatic joint)

==Knuckle joint==
{{main|Knuckle joint (mechanical)}}

A knuckle joint is used to connect the two rods which are under the tensile load, when there is requirement of small amount of flexibility or angular movement is necessary. There is always axial or linear line of action of load.

The knuckle joint assembly consist of following major components:

1. Single eye.

2. Double eye or fork

3. Knuckle pin.

At one end of the rod the single eye is formed and double eye is formed at the other end of the rod. Both, single and double eye are connected by a pin inserted through eye. The pin has a head at one end and at other end there is a taper pin or split pin. For gripping purpose the ends of the rod are of octagonal forms. Now, when the two eyes are pulled apart, the pin holds them together. The solid rod portion of the joint in this case is much stronger than the portion through which the pin passes.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=R.S. Khurmi, J.K.|title=A textbook of machine design (S.I. units) : [a textbook for the students of B.E. / B.Tech., U.P.S.C. (Engg. Services); Section 'B' of A.M.I.E.

'''The modes of failure are:'''

1.Shear failure of pin (single shear).

2.Crushing of pin against rod.

3.Tensile failure of flat end bar.

'''Application:'''

1.Tie rod joint of roof truss.

2.Tension link in bridge structure.

3.Link of roller chain.

4.Tie rod joint of jib crane.

5.The knuckle joint is also used in tractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandari|first=V.B.|title=Introduction to machine design|year=2001|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-07-043449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''

===Design of knuckle joint===
'''&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

The assembly diagram of knuckle joint is as shown in fig.

The dimension of knuckle joints are

Diameter of rod = '''d'''

Diameter of knuckle pin = '''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Outside diameter of single eye = '''d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Outside diameter of double eye = '''d&lt;sub&gt;od&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Thickness of single eye = '''t'''

Thickness of fork = '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Axial tensile force on rod = '''P'''

'''(1) Diameter of rod'''

Consider the rod is subjected to a direct tensile stress

'''ς = P /πd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

From above equation, diameter of rod 'd' is obtained.

'''(2) Design of pin (d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

(a) Consider the failure of pin under double shear due to tensile force.

Therefore, direct shear stress induced in knuckle pin is given by Equation

'''ς= P/ 2A = (P/2) / (π/4)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2P/ πd&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

(b) Failure of knuckle pin in bending

Assume there is no clearance or slack but in actual, knuckle pin is loose in forks to permit angular moment of one with respect to other, so it is subjected to bending moment in addition to shear, consider uniformly distributed load along the portion of pin.

Taking moment about axis XX

'''M = [(-P/2) × (t/4)] + { (P/2) × [ (t/2)+(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3) ] }'''

'''= P/2 [(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/2)-(t/4) ]'''

'''=P/2 [ (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/4) ]'''

Section modulus,

'''Z=(π/ 32)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Maximum bending stress, '''σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;= M/Z = { P/2 [(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/4)] } / {(π/ 32)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}'''

Here,we check the pin in bending and find the value of '''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(3) Design of single eye :'''

(a) To find the outside diameter of single eye (d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;) The single eye is subjected to a direct tensile stress, due to this single eye under tear.

'''σt = P/A = P/ (d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)× t'''

(b) Due to direct tensile strength, the single eye is subjected to double shear.

'''Resisting shearing area = 2(d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)×(t/2)'''

The direct shear stress induced is

'''ς=P/(d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)×t'''

From this equation the outside diameter of single eye '''d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;''' is obtained.

(C) Failure of single eye or pin due to tensile load in crushing

'''Resisting crushing area = d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; × t'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = P/(d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;×t)'''

Form this equation  crushing stress checked if fail, increase the thickness of eye '''(t)'''.

'''(4) Design of fork (double eye):'''

(a) The tearing of the double eye at weakest section due to tension

'''Area resisting tear = (d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =    p/ [(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''

From this equation, find the outside diameter of fork '''(dof)'''.

(b) Failure of double eye (fork) in double shear due to tensile load.

'''Area resisting shear  = 4 × [(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) ]/2 × t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''= 2 × (d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''The shear stress is given by,'''

'''ς = p/[(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''

From this equation, check shear stress if less than design, increase thickness of fork '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

(c) Failure double eye in crushing (thickness of fork)

Double eye may fail in crushing due to tensile load

'''The crushing stress is given by,'''

'''σc = P/( 2×d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ×t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

Check crushing stress or find '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

==Turnbuckle==
{{main|Turnbuckle}}
The buckle or a coupler is a mechanical joint used to connect two members which are subjected to tensile loading which require slight adjustment of length or tension under loaded conditions. It consist of central hexagonal nut called coupler and tie rod having right hand and left hand threads. A coupler of hexagonal shape is to facilitate the turning of it with a spanner or sometime a hole is provide in the nut so that tommy bar can be inserted for rotating it. As coupler rotate, the tie rod are either pulled together or pushed apart depending upon the direction of the rotation coupler normally the tie rods are made of steel, while coupler is made of steel or C.I.

'''Application :'''

1. To tighten the members of the roof truss.

2. Used to connect link in a mechanism to transfer motion

3. Used between the two railway wagon or bogies.

4. To tighten the cable or stay ropes of electric distribution poles.

'''

===Design of turnbuckle===
'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27822626/Design-of-Turnbuckle|title=Design-of-Turnbuckle|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a turnbuckle, subjected to an axial tensile force P. The various dimensions of the turnbuckle are calculated as follows:

'''(1) Diameter of tie rod ‘d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; :'''

Due to axial tensile load p, the rod is subjected to tensile stress. Also due to twisting moment in the tie rod.

The tie rod is design for direct tensile load of P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=1.25P

The tensile stress induced in tie rod is given by

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 4P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;/ (π×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

From above equation the core diameter of the tie rod is obtained. The nominal diameter can be selected from I.S.O metric screw threads table or it can be found by,

'''d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/ 0.84'''

'''(2) Length of couple nut (l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) :'''

Consider the direct shearing of the thread at the root of the coupler nut and the screw.

(a) The direct shear stress induced in screw thread is

'''ς&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =  P/(π×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

(b) The direct shear stress induced in nut

'''ς&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; =  P/ (π×d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

Where,

ς&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and ς&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  = shear stress in screw and nut respectively in N/mm2

d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  =   Nominal diameter of the screw

d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; =  Core diameter of the screw

l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; =  Length of the coupler nut

(c) Check of crushing of the thread

'''crushing resistance of the thread = (π/4) × [d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ×n×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;× σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Where,

n  =   number of threads per length  = l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/p

σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = crushing stress induced in the coupler

p = pitch of the thread in mm

Equating the design load with crushing resistance

'''p&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;  = (π/4) × [d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ×n×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;× σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
'''

'''(3) Outside diameter of the coupler nut (D) :'''

The coupler nut is subjected to a direct tensile load P and a torque T.

Consider tearing of the coupler nut due to tensile stress induced in it. In order to account for the torque, the tensile load is taken as P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

The tensile stress induced in coupler nut is given by

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 4P/(π×(D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))'''

By empirical relation, the outside diameter of the coupler nut D is taken as

'''D = 1.25 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; or 1.5 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(4) Outside diameter of coupler (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):'''

Let,D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= Inside diameter of the coupler

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Outside diameter of the coupler

Consider a coupler is subjected to direct tensile load P and a torque T.So for design the coupler outside diameter, the design load is consider.

By empirical relation,

The outside diameter of the coupler D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as,

'''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; or 1.75 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(5) Length of the coupler nut (L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

'''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  = 6 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(6) Thickness of the coupler = t = 0.75 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(7)Thickness of the coupler nut = t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

==Pin joint==
{{main|Revolute joint}}

==Cotter joint==
{{main|Cotter (pin)}}
This is used to connect rigidly two rods which transmit motion in the axial direction, without rotation. These joints may be subjected to tensile or compressive forces along the axes of the rods. The very famous example is the joining of piston rod's extension with the connecting rod in the cross head assembly.
Advantages:-
1.Quick assembly and disassembly is possible
2.It can take tensile as well as compressive force.
Application:-
1.Joint between piston rod and cross head of a steam engine
2.Joint between valve rod and it's steam
3.A steam engine connecting rod strap end 
4.Foundation bolt

'''Medieval technology''' is the technology used in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] under [[Christendom|Christian rule]]. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]], the invention of vertical [[windmill]]s, [[spectacles]], [[mechanical clock]]s, and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques ([[Gothic architecture]], [[medieval castle]]s), and [[agriculture]] in general ([[three-field crop rotation]]).

The [[List of early medieval watermills|development of water mills]] from their [[List of ancient watermills|ancient origins]] was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone. By the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in [[England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-power was also widely used in [[mining]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], [[China]], and [[History of India|India]]. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though [[gunpowder]] along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.

Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted [[ship]]s with [[lateen]] sails, the [[Rudder|sternpost-mounted rudder]] and the skeleton-first [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the [[Compass|dry compass]], the [[Jacob's staff]] and the [[astrolabe]], these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning [[Age of Exploration]].

At the turn to the [[Renaissance]], [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s invention of [[Printing press|mechanical printing]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers [[Guido da Vigevano]] and [[Villard de Honnecourt]] can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as [[Taccola]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]].

== Civil technologies ==
The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).

=== Agriculture ===

'''[[Carruca]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)
[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|thumb|340x340px|Carruca (Heavy Plough )]]
A type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a [[Coulter (agriculture)]] at the bottom of the plough.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the [[plowshare]] to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ard (plough)]]''' (5th century)

An early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the [[carruca]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horse collar]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)

Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the [[yoke]] became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The rigid collar was "placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horseshoe]]s''' (9th century)

Allowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crop rotation]]''' (8th century)

Also called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Three-field system]]''' (8th century)
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|An individual grape stomping as a form of wine pressing.]]
The ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This system increases agricultural productivity over the [[Two-field system]] by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine press]]''' (12th century)

This device was the first practical means of [[Pressing (wine)]] on a plane surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The method of [[Grape stomping]] was often used as a less expensive alternative.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qanat]]''' (5th century)

An underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an [[aquifer]] or [[water well]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Folk Astronomy and Agriculture in Arabia and the Yemen|last=Varisoc|first=Daniel Martin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|year=1997|isbn=0-86078-651-X|location=Brookfield, Vermont|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.

=== Architecture and construction ===
'''[[Pendentive]] architecture''' (6th century)

A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 200s, it was in the 6th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]] that its potential was fully achieved.

'''[[Artesian well]]''' (1126)

A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.

'''[[Central heating]] through [[Underfloor heating|underfloor channels]]''' (9th century)

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman [[hypocaust]] at some places. In [[Reichenau Abbey]] a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=456–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|Rib vault]]''' (12th century)

An essential element for the rise of [[Gothic architecture]], rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older [[groin vault]].

'''[[Chimney]]''' (12th century)

The earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.

'''[[Arch bridge|Segmental arch bridge]]''' (1345)

The [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.

[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Treadwheel crane]]]]
'''[[Treadwheel crane]]''' (1220s)

The earliest reference to a [[treadwheel]] in archival literature is in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[List of historical harbour cranes|Stationary harbour crane]]''' (1244)

Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; '''Slewing cranes''' which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crane vessel|Floating crane]]'''

Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Crane (machine)|Mast crane]]'''

Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Wheelbarrow]]''' (1170s)

The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by [[Matthew Paris]] in the mid-13th century.

=== Art ===
[[File:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', oil painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1433)]]
'''[[Oil paint]]''' (by 1125)

As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]] developed the use of a stable oil mixture for [[panel painting]] around 1410.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel van Mander]] propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques. {{cite book|authorlink=Ernst Gombrich|last=Gombrich|first=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|pages=236–39|publisher=Phaidon|year=1995|isbn=0-7148-3355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clocks ===
'''[[Hourglass]]''' (1338)

Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in [[Siena]], Italy).

'''[[Clock|Mechanical clocks]]''' (13th to 14th centuries)

A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.

=== Mechanics ===
'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Compound crank]]'''

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] combines in his 1335 ''Texaurus'', a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle wheel boats]]. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metallurgy ===
'''[[Blast furnace]]''' (1150–1350)

Cast iron had been made in China before the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Dürstel in Switzerland and the Märkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193313/http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm |date=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in some places according to recent research even before 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen.

Metalle und Macht 1000-1600'', Berlin 1997, p.389f. {{ISBN|3-549-05633-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milling ===
{{Further|List of early medieval watermills}}
'''[[Ship mill]]''' (6th century)

The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800.
'''[[Paper mill]]''' (13th century)

The first certain use of a water-powered [[paper mill]], evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]] 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim paper making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates to 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rolling mill]]''' (15th century)

Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[tin]]. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.

'''[[Tide mill|Tidal Mill]]s''' (6th century)

The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main [[waterwheel]] types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near [[Waterford]] was powered by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tide changes at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=17, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight [[horsepower]] at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Nendrum Monastery mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Windmill|Vertical windmill]]s''' (1180s)

Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.

'''[[Trip hammer|Water hammer]]''' (12th century at the latest)

Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[Catalan forge]]s, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by [[steam hammer]]s in the 19th century.

=== Navigation ===
'''[[History of the compass#Dry compass|Dry compass]]''' (12th century)

The first European mention of the directional compass is in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''On the Natures of Things'', written in Paris around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, “Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,” ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368&lt;/ref&gt; It was either [[Compass#Question of diffusion|transmitted from China or the Arabs]] or an [[Compass#Question of independent European invention|independent European innovation]]. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Compass|Astronomical compass]]''' (1269)

The French scholar [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes in his experimental study ''Epistola de magnete'' (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1951|pp=2ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|180px|Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder]]
'''[[Rudder|Stern-mounted rudders]]''' (1180s)

The first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with [[Cog (ship)|cog]]s in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the [[age of discovery]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing, paper and reading ===
'''[[Movable type]] [[printing press]]''' (1440s)

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in [[woodblock printing]], he used separate letters (''types'') from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.

'''[[Paper]]''' (13th century)

Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see [[paper mill]]).

[[File:Friedrich Herlin, Reading Saint Peter (1466).jpg|thumb|180px|Reading [[Saint Peter]] with eyeglasses (1466)]]

'''[[Rotating bookmark]]''' (13th century)

A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text.  Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.

'''[[Spectacles]]''' (1280s)

The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.

'''[[Watermark]]''' (1282)

This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in [[Bologna]], Italy.

=== Science and learning ===

'''[[Theory of impetus]]''' (6th century)

A scientific theory that was introduced by [[John Philoponus]] who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to [[Galileo Galilei]]  who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

'''[[Arabic numerals]]''' (13th century)

The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] with his ''Liber Abaci''.

'''[[University]]'''

The first [[medieval universities]] were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1970|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry and garments ===
'''[[button|Functional button]]''' (13th century)

German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.

'''[[Loom|Horizontal loom]]''' (11th century)

Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.

'''[[Silk]]''' (6th century)

Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the [[Silk Road]] since antiquity. The technology of "silk throwing" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.

'''[[Spinning wheel]]''' (13th century)

Brought to Europe probably from India.

=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:KnightsTemplarPlayingChess1283.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar]] playing chess, ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' (1283)]]
'''[[Chess]]''' (1450)

The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.

'''[[Forest glass]]''' (c. 1000)

This type of glass uses [[wood ash]] and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Grindstone]]s''' (834)

Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]'', illustrated between 816 and 834.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hägermann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=425f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the ''[[Luttrell Psalter]]'' from around 1340.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Liquor]]''' (12th century)

Primitive forms of distillation were known to the [[Babylonia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levey |first=Martin |title=Chemistry and Chemical Technology in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=1959 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76ILAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of distillation also comes from [[Alchemy|alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|pages=57, 89|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220084813/http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Arabs]] adopted the distillation process,&lt;ref name="Gorak"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distillation: Fundamentals and Principles|page=5-10|editor=Andrzej Gorak, Eva Sorensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=9780123865489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in [[Salerno]] and [[Cologne]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Gorak" /&gt;

Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|"national" drinks]] of Europe, including  [[gin]] (England) and ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy). In 1437, "burned water" ([[brandy]]) was mentioned in the records of the [[County of Katzenelnbogen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com/begriffe.html graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com], ''Trinkglas.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Magnet]]s''' (12th century)

Magnets were first referenced in the ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'', composed between 1155 and 1160.

'''[[Mirror]]s''' (1180)

The first mention of a "glass" mirror is in 1180 by [[Alexander Neckham]] who said "Take away the lead which is behind the [[glass]] and there will be no image of the one looking in."

'''Illustrated surgical atlas''' (1345)

Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 − 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His ''Anathomia'' provides [[picture]]s of [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of [[trephination]], and depictions of the [[meninges]], [[cerebrum]], and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Di Ieva|2007|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Quarantine]]''' (1377)

Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.

'''[[Mouse trap|Rat trap]]s''' (1170s)

The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]].

'''[[Soap]]''' (9th century)

Soap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.

== Military technologies ==

=== Armour ===
'''[[Gambeson|Quilted Armour]]''' (pre 5th - 14th Century)

There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. 
Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=72|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boiled_leather|Cuir Bouilli]]''' (5th-10th Century)

Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flank|first1=Lenny|title=A History of European Armor|journal=Hidden History|date=May 24, 2016|url=https://lflank.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/a-history-of-european-armor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.

'''[[Chain mail|Chain Mail]]''' (11th-16th Century)

The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the '''[[Hauberk]]''', also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technologies|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=64|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century '''[[banded mail]]''' became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Banded_Mail_Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Banded Mail Armour Construction]]

'''[[Jazerant]]''' (11th century)

The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andre-Driussi|first1=Micheal|title=Lexicon Urthus|date=2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=0964279517|page=192|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. 

'''[[Scale Armour]]''' (12th century)

A type of '''[[Lamellar armour]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medievil Militay Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=70|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. 

[[File:KHM Wien S XIII - Jousting armour by Jörg and Lorenz Helmschmid front.jpg|thumb|180px|Jousting armor commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1494]]

'''[[Plate armour|Plate Armour]]''' (14th century)

Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Components of medieval armour]]''' that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=74|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henery|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.

=== Cavalry ===
'''[[Saddle|Arched saddle]]''' (11th century)

The arched saddle enabled mounted [[knight]]s to wield [[lance]]s underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock [[cavalry]], enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.

'''[[Spur]]s''' (11th century)

Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn his spurs" by proving his or her worthiness.

'''[[Stirrup]]''' (6th century)

Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.

=== Gunpowder weapons ===
'''[[Cannon]]''' (1324)

Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote "these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms."&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Volley gun]]'''

See [[Ribauldequin]].

'''[[Gunpowder|Corned gunpowder]]''' (late 14th century)

First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Scottish bombard [[Mons Meg]]]]
'''[[Supergun]]''' (late 14th century)

Extant examples include the wrought-iron [[Pumhart von Steyr]], [[Dulle Griet]] and [[Mons Meg]] as well as the cast-bronze [[Faule Mette]] and [[Faule Grete]] (all from the 15th century).

=== Mechanical artillery ===
'''[[Trebuchet|Counterweight trebuchet]]''' (12th century)

Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the [[Crusader states]] and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf Paul E. Chevedden, "The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205183303/http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missile weapons ===
'''[[Greek fire]]''' (7th century)

An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)]]

'''[[Grenade]]''' (8th century) [[File:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]

Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]], as the Byzantine soldiers learned that [[Greek fire]], a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by [[flamethrower]]s at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. 

'''[[English longbow|Longbow]] with massed, disciplined archery''' (13th century)

Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval [[knight]] class{{dubious|date=July 2016}}. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453).

'''[[Arbalest|Steel crossbow]]''' (late 14th century)

European innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.

=== Miscellaneous ===
'''[[Combined arms]] tactics''' (14th century)

The [[battle of Halidon Hill]] 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows
. Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the [[battle of Flodden]] 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14425">[[Image:que lengua.jpg|thumb|right|The [[tongue]] is a muscular hydrostat]]

A '''muscular hydrostat''' is a biological structure found in [[animal]]s. It is used to manipulate items (including food) or to move its host about and consists mainly of [[muscle]]s with no [[skeletal]] support. It performs its [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] movement without [[fluid]] in a separate compartment, as in a [[hydrostatic skeleton]]. 

A muscular hydrostat, like a hydrostatic skeleton, relies on the fact that [[water]] is effectively [[Properties_of_water#Compressibility|incompressible]] at [[physiology|physiological]] pressures.  In contrast to a hydrostatic skeleton, where muscle surrounds a fluid-filled cavity, a muscular hydrostat is composed mainly of muscle tissue.  Since muscle tissue itself is mainly made of water and is also effectively incompressible, similar principles apply.

==Muscular anatomy==
[[File:Elephas Maximus Trunk Closeup.jpg|thumb|upright 0.6|Closeup of the trunk of an [[Asian elephant]]]]
Muscles provide the force to move a muscular hydrostat.  Since muscles are only able to produce force by contracting and becoming shorter, different groups of muscles have to work against each other, with one group relaxing and lengthening as the other group provides the force by contracting.  Such complementary muscle groups are termed [[Antagonist (muscle)|antagonist muscles]].

The muscle fibers in a muscular hydrostat are oriented in three different directions: parallel to the long axis, perpendicular to the long axis, and wrapped obliquely around the long axis.&lt;ref name=Kier&amp;Smith1985&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kier | first1 = W. M. | last2 = Smith | first2 = K. K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1985.tb01178.x | title = Tongues, tentacles and trunks: The biomechanics of movement in muscular-hydrostats | journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–324| year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&amp;Kier1989&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kathleen K.|author2=William M. Kier|title=Trunks, tongues, and tentacles: Moving with skeletons of muscle|journal=American Scientist|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=77|issue=1|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscles parallel to the long axis are arranged in longitudinal bundles.  The more peripherally these are located, the more elaborate bending movements are possible.  A more peripheral distribution is found in [[mammal]]ian tongues, [[octopus]] arms, [[nautilus]] tentacles, and [[elephant]] proboscides.  Tongues that are adapted for protrusion typically have centrally located longitudinal fibers.  These are found in [[snake]] tongues, many [[lizard]] tongues, and the mammalian [[anteater]]s.

The muscles perpendicular to the long axis may be arranged in a transverse, circular, or radial pattern. A transverse arrangement involves sheets of muscle fibers running perpendicular to the long axis, usually alternating between horizontal and vertical orientations. This arrangement is found in the arms and tentacles of squid, octopuses, and in most mammalian tongues.  A radial arrangement involves fibers radiating out in all directions from the center of the organ.  This is found in the tentacles of the [[chambered nautilus]] and in the elephant [[proboscis]] (trunk). A circular arrangement has rings of contractive fibers around the long axis. This is found in many mammalian and lizard tongues along with squid tentacles.

Helical or oblique fibers around the long axis are generally present in two layers with opposite [[chirality]] and wrap around the central core of musculature.

==Mechanism of operation==
In a muscular hydrostat, the musculature itself both creates movement and provides skeletal support for that movement. It can provide this support because it is composed primarily of an incompressible “liquid" and is thus constant in volume. The most important biomechanical feature of a muscular hydrostat is its constant volume. Muscle is composed primarily of an aqueous liquid that is essentially incompressible at physiological pressures. In a muscular hydrostat or any other structure of constant volume, a decrease in one dimension will cause a compensatory increase in at least one other dimension.&lt;ref name=Kier1985 /&gt;  The mechanisms of elongation, bending and torsion in muscular hydrostats all depend on constancy of volume to effect shape changes in the absence of stiff skeletal attachments.&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;Wainwright, P. C.; Bennett, A. F. (1992). "[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/168/1/23.short The mechanism of tongue projection in chameleons: II. Role of shape change in a muscular hydrostat]". ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''168''': 23–40.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since muscular hydrostats are under constant volume when the diameter increases or decreases, the length must also decrease or increase, respectively. When looking at a cylinder the volume is:
V=πr²l.
When the radius is differentiated with respect to the length:
dr/dl=-r/(2l).
From this, if a diameter decreases by 25%, the length will increase by approximately 80% which may produce a large amount of force depending on what the animal is trying to do. &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, R. McN. (2003). Principles of Animal Locomotion. Princeton, NJ: Princeton
University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Elongation and shortening===

[[File:Abralia veranyi tentacles.jpg|thumb|Arms and tentacles of the squid ''[[Abralia veranyi]]'']]
Elongation in hydrostats is caused by the contraction of transverse or helical musculature arrangements. Given the constant volume of muscular hydrostats, these contractions cause an elongation of the longitudinal muscles. Change in length is proportional to the square of the decrease in diameter.&lt;ref name=Kier1985 /&gt; Therefore, contractions of muscles perpendicular to the long axis will cause a decrease in diameter and while keeping a constant volume will elongate the organ length-wise. Shortening, on the other hand, can be caused by contraction of the muscles parallel to the long axis resulting in the organ increasing in diameter as well as shortening in length.

The muscles used in elongation and shortening maintain support through the constant volume principle and their antagonistic relationships with each other. These mechanisms are seen often in prey capture of [[shovelnose frog]]s and [[chameleon]]s, as well as in the [[human tongue]] and many other examples. In some frogs, the tongue elongates up to 180% of its resting length.&lt;ref&gt;Nishikawa, K. C.; Kier, W. M.; Smith, K. K. (1999). "[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/7/771.short Morphology and mechanics of tongue movement in the African pig-nosed frog ''Hemisus marmoratum'': a muscular hydrostatic model http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/7/771.short]". ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''202''': 771–780.&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-oral tongues show higher length/width ratios than intra-oral tongues, allowing for a greater increase in length (more than 100% of resting length, as compared to intra-oral tongues at only about 50% of resting length increase). Greater elongation lengths trade off with the force produced by the organ; as the length/width ratio is increased elongation increases while force is decreased.&lt;ref name=Kier&amp;Smith1985 /&gt; Squids have been shown to use muscular hydrostat elongation in prey capture and feeding as well.&lt;ref name=Kier1982 /&gt;

===Bending===
The bending of a muscular hydrostat can occur in two ways, both of which require the use of [[antagonistic muscle]]s.&lt;ref name=Kier&amp;Smith1985 /&gt; The unilateral contraction of a longitudinal muscle will produce little or no bending and will serve to increase the diameter of the muscular hydrostat because of the constant volume principle that must be met. To bend the hydrostat structure, the unilateral contraction of longitudinal muscle must be accompanied by contractile activity of transverse, radial, or circular muscles to maintain a constant diameter. Bending of a muscular hydrostat can also occur by the contraction of transverse, radial, or circular muscles which decreases the diameter. Bending is produced by longitudinal muscle activity which maintains a constant length on one side of the structure. 

The bending of a muscular hydrostat is particularly important in animal [[tongue]]s. This motion provides the mechanism by which a [[snake]] flicks the air with its tongue to sense its surroundings, and it is also responsible for the complexities of [[human speech]].&lt;ref name=Smith&amp;Kier1989 /&gt;

===Stiffening===
The stiffening of a muscular hydrostat is accomplished by the muscle or connective tissue of the hydrostat resisting dimensional changes.&lt;ref name=Kier1985 /&gt; The human [[pharynx]] has been proposed to be a muscular hydrostat in which stiffening provides an important function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kairaitis|first=Kristina|title=Is the pharynx a muscular hydrostat?|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=2010|volume=74|pages=590–595|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The muscles of the pharynx act together to stiffen the structure and prevent its collapse.  A better understanding of how those muscles interact may help to treat conditions such as [[obstructive sleep apnea]].

===Torsion===
Torsion is the twisting of a muscular hydrostat along its long axis and is produced by a helical or oblique arrangement of musculature&lt;ref name=Kier1985&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kier | first1 = W. M. | title = The musculature of squid arms and tentacles: Ultrastructural evidence for functional differences | doi = 10.1002/jmor.1051850208 | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 185 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–239| year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have varying direction. For a counter-clockwise torsion it is necessary for a right-hand helix to contract. Contraction of a left-hand helix causes clockwise torsion. The simultaneous contraction of both right and left-hand helixes results in an increase in resistance to torsional forces. The oblique or helical muscle arrays in the muscular hydrostats are located in the periphery of the structure, wrapping the inner core of musculature, and this peripheral location provides a larger moment through which the torque is applied than a more central location. The effect of helically arranged muscle fibers, which may also contribute to changes in length of a muscular hydrostat, depends on fiber angle—the angle that the helical muscle fibers make with the long axis of the structure.

The length of the helical fiber is at a minimum when the fiber angle equals 54°44′ and is at maximum length when the fiber angle approaches 0° and 90°.&lt;ref name=Kier1985 /&gt; Summed up, this means that helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle greater than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and elongation while helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle less than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and shortening.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, J. J.; O'Reilly, J. C.; Monroy, J. A.; Nishikawa, K. C. (2004). "[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/1/21.full Mechanism of tongue protraction in microhylid frogs]. ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''207''': 21–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The fiber angle of the oblique or helical muscle layers must increase during shortening and decrease during lengthening. In addition to creating a torsional force, the oblique muscle layers will therefore create a force for elongation that may aid the transverse musculature in resisting longitudinal compression.

==Technological applications==
Kier along with a group of engineers and biologists have collaborated to develop robotic arms that are able to manipulate and handle various objects of different size, mass, surface texture and mechanical properties. These robotic arms have many advantages over previous robotic arms that were not based on muscular hydrostats.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I.D.; Dawson, D.M.; Flash, T.; Grasso, F.W.; Hanlon, R.T.; Hochner, B.; Kier, W.M.; Pagano, C.C.; Rahn, C.D.; Zhang, Q.M.

The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes.

The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to [[ecologist]]s because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]].

== Processes ==
Nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), [[nitrite]] (NO{{su|b=2|p=−}}), [[nitrate]] (NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[nitric oxide]] (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, [[humus]] or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by [[microorganism|microbes]], either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the [[metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous wastes]] in animal [[urine]] are broken down by [[nitrifying bacteria]] in the soil to be used as new. The diagram {besides} alongside shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
{{Main article|Nitrogen fixation}}
The conversion of nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation. 
Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or "[[nitrogen fixation|fixed]]", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 10x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; g per year are fixed by [[lightning]] strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] known as [[diazotrophs]]. These bacteria have the [[nitrogenase]] [[enzyme]] that combines gaseous nitrogen with [[hydrogen]] to produce [[ammonia]], which is converted by the bacteria into other [[organic compound]]s. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some [[Archaea]]. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component [[enzyme]] that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.&lt;ref name= MoirJWB&gt;{{cite book | author= Moir, JWB (editor) | year=2011 | title=Nitrogen Cycling in Bacteria: Molecular Analysis | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-86-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of free-living bacteria is ''[[Azotobacter]]''.  Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' usually live in the root nodules of [[legumes]] (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for [[carbohydrate]]s. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such [[symbiosis|symbioses]]. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the [[Haber-Bosch]] process,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., R. L. Richards, and W. E. Newton. 2004. Catalysts for nitrogen fixation : nitrogenases, relevant chemical models and commercial processes.

=== Assimilation ===
{{Main article|Assimilation (biology)|Nitrogen assimilation}}
Plants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between ''Rhizobia'' bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willey|first=Joanne M.|title=Prescott's Microbiology 8th Ed|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-07-337526-7|pages=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many animals, fungi, and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of [[amino acid]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many [[bacteria]]) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources.  Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.

=== Ammonification ===
When a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is [[organic matter|organic]]. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), a process called ammonification or [[Mineralization (soil)|mineralization]]. Enzymes involved are:
* GS: Gln Synthetase (Cytosolic &amp; Plastic)
* GOGAT: Glu 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase ([[Ferredoxin]] &amp; NADH-dependent)
* GDH: Glu Dehydrogenase:
** Minor Role in ammonium assimilation.
** Important in amino acid catabolism.

=== Nitrification ===
{{Main article|Nitrification}}
The conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}) is performed by bacteria such as the ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' species, which converts ammonia to [[nitrites]] ({{NO2-}}). Other bacterial species such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites ({{NO2-}}) into [[nitrates]] ({{NO3-}}).&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; It is important for the ammonia ({{NH3}}) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.

Due to their very high [[solubility]] and because soils are highly unable to retain [[anions]], nitrates can enter [[groundwater]]. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause [[methemoglobinemia]] or blue-baby syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nitrogen Cycle|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/p/WQ252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitousek&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |title= Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: Sources and consequences |journal=Issues in Ecology |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |author1=Vitousek, PM |author2=Aber, J |author3=Howarth, RW |author4=Likens, GE |author5=Matson, PA |author6=Schindler, DW |author7=Schlesinger, WH |author8=Tilman, GD | doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:HAOTGN]2.0.CO;2 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to [[eutrophication]], a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen [[fertilizer]] has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.

=== Denitrification ===
{{Main|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively (meaning optionally) anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.

=== Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ===
{{Main|Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium}}
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium&amp;nbsp;(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an [[anaerobic respiration]]&amp;nbsp;process.&amp;nbsp;Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to&amp;nbsp;[[nitrite]], then&amp;nbsp;[[ammonium]]&amp;nbsp;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Phyllis and Kuypers, Marcel M. M.|first=|date=2011|title=Microbial Nitrogen Processes in Oxygen Minimum Zones|url=|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=3|pages=317–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marchant, H. K., Lavik, G., Holtappels, M., and Kuypers, M. M.

=== Anaerobic ammonia oxidation ===
{{Main article|Ammonia}}
In this biological process, [[nitrite]] and [[ammonia]] are converted directly into molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans.  The balanced formula for this "[[anammox]]" chemical reaction is:  NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} + NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} &amp;rarr; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Δ''G''° = {{val|-357 |u=kJ.mol-1}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anammox|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Anammox|website=Anammox - MicrobeWiki|publisher=MicrobeWiki|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other processes ===
Though nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]], in areas with nitrogen-rich [[bedrock]], the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/06/140206913/discovery-forces-scientists-to-rethink-nitrogen|title=Nitrogen Study Could 'Rock' A Plant's World|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuur | first1 = E.

==Marine nitrogen cycle==

[[File:Marine Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|A schematic representing the Marine Nitrogen Cycle]]
The nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moulton |first1=Orissa M |last2=Altabet |first2=Mark A |last3=Beman |first3=J Michael |last4=Deegan |first4=Linda A |last5=Lloret |first5=Javier |last6=Lyons |first6=Meaghan K |last7=Nelson |first7=James A |last8=Pfister |first8=Catherine A |title=Microbial associations with macrobiota in coastal ecosystems: patterns and implications for nitrogen cycling |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=May 2016 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=200–208 |doi=10.1002/fee.1262 |url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.1262 |language=en |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by [[phytoplankton]] as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological Oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gruber|first=Nicolas|title=Nitrogen in the Marine Environment|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|location=30 Corporate Drive, Suite 400, Burlington, MA 01803|isbn=978-0-12-372522-6|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter.  Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the [[Photic zone|euphotic zone]] by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonification or [[Mineralization (geology)|Mineralization]] is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. [[Nitrification]] can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyes, Elliot|first=Susan, Michael|title=Learning Unit: Nitrogen Cycle Marine Environment|url=http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415123617/http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be returned to the atmosphere through [[denitrification]].

Ammonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a [[redox]] reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction ([[nitrate reductase]]). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include [[Prochlorococcus]] and some [[Synechococcus]].&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.

The nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in [[oligotrophic]] waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.

Nitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and [[chlorophyll]] levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as [[HNLC]] (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean.

Ammonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50–80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.

===New vs. regenerated nitrogen===
Nitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer.&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"/&gt; The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.&lt;br /&gt;New production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological Oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.

==Human influences on the nitrogen cycle==
{{Main article|Human impact on the nitrogen cycle}}
As a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly [[soy]], [[alfalfa]], and [[clover]]), growing use of the [[Haber–Bosch process]] in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms.&lt;ref name="Vitousek"/&gt; In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and [[industrial agriculture]] are highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Elisabeth A.|last2=Dentener|first2=Frank J.|last3=Braswell|first3=Bobby H.|last4=Sulzman|first4=James M.|title=Contemporary and pre-industrial global reactive nitrogen budgets|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=46|page=7|year=1999|doi=10.1007/BF01007572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources.&lt;ref name=Chapin&gt;Chapin, S. F. III, Matson, P. A., Mooney H. A. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OOH1H779-7EC&amp;pg=PA345 ''Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology.''] Springer, New York 2002 {{ISBN|0-387-95443-0}}, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has deleterious effects in the [[stratosphere]], where it breaks down and acts as a [[catalyst]] in the destruction of atmospheric [[ozone]]. Nitrous oxide is also a [[greenhouse gas]] and is currently the third largest contributor to [[global warming]], after [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE)'' International Biofuels Project Rapid Assessment, 22–25 September 2008, Gummersbach, Germany, R. W. Howarth and S. Bringezu, editors. 2009 [http://cip.cornell.edu/biofuels/ Executive Summary, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an [[aerosol]], decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in [[nitric acid]] ([[Hydrogen|H]][[nitrate|NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) that produces [[acid rain]]. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems.

The very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but high-temperature [[combustion]] has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is produced. [[Fossil fuel]] combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

Ammonia and nitrous oxides actively alter [[atmospheric chemistry]]. They are precursors of [[troposphere|tropospheric]] (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], damages [[plant]]s and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Smil04&gt;{{cite book |author=Smil, V |year=2004|isbn=978-0-7567-7350-2 |title=Cycles Of Life: Civilization And The Biosphere |publisher=Diane Pub Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecosystem]] processes can increase with [[nitrogen fertilization]], but [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans.&lt;ref name=Vitousek/&gt;

Decreases in [[biodiversity]] can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species-diverse [[Heath (habitat)|heathlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20038308|author1=Aerts, Rien  |author2=Berendse, Frank |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Vegetatio|volume=76|year=1988|issue=1/2|title=The Effect of Increased Nutrient Availability on Vegetation Dynamics in Wet Heathlands|pages=63–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts===
Increasing levels of [[Deposition (aerosol physics)|nitrogen deposition]] are shown to have a number of negative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobbink|first=R.|last2=Hicks|first2=K.|last3=Galloway|first3=J.|last4=Spranger|first4=T.|last5=Alkemade|first5=R.|last6=Ashmore|first6=M.|last7=Bustamante|first7=M.|last8=Cinderby|first8=S.|last9=Davidson|first9=E.|date=2010-01-01|title=Global assessment of nitrogen deposition effects on terrestrial plant diversity: a synthesis|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=30–59|doi=10.1890/08-1140.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen gases and aerosols can be directly toxic to certain plant species, affecting the aboveground physiology and growth of plants near large [[Point source pollution|point sources]] of nitrogen pollution. Changes to plant species interactions may also occur, as accumulation of nitrogen compounds increase its availability in a given ecosystem, eventually changing the species composition, plant diversity, and nitrogen cycling. Ammonia and ammonium - two reduced forms of nitrogen - can be detrimental over time due to an increased toxicity toward sensitive species of plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Britto|first=Dev T.|last2=Kronzucker|first2=Herbert J.|title=NH4+ toxicity in higher plants: a critical review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0176161704702667|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=159|issue=6|pages=567–584|doi=10.1078/0176-1617-0774|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those that are accustomed to using nitrate as their source of nitrogen, causing poor development of their roots and shoots. Increased nitrogen deposition also leads to soil acidification, which increases base cation leaching in the soil and amounts of aluminium and other potentially toxic metals, along with decreasing the amount of [[nitrification]] occurring and increasing plant-derived litter. Due to the ongoing changes caused by high nitrogen deposition, an environment's susceptibility to ecological stress and disturbance - such as pests and pathogens - may increase, thus making it less resilient to situations that otherwise would have little impact to its long-term vitality. 

Additional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; [[eutrophication]] of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Camargo, J.A. &amp; Alonso, A. (2006). Ecological and toxicological effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution in aquatics ecosystems: A global assessment. Retrieved December 10, 2010, from http://www.aseanenvironment.info/Abstract/41013039.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]] near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150513|author=[[Nancy Rabalais|Rabalais, Nancy N.]], R.

Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via [[aeration]] prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.

'''Noisy text analytics''' is a process of [[information extraction]] whose goal is to automatically extract structured or semistructured information from [[noisy text|noisy unstructured text data]]. While [[Text analytics]] is a growing and mature field that has great value because of the huge amounts of data being produced, processing of noisy text is gaining in importance because a lot of common applications produce noisy text data. Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as [[online chat]], [[Text messaging|text messages]], [[e-mail]]s, [[message boards]], [[newsgroups]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]] and [[web pages]]. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech using [[automatic speech recognition]] and printed or handwritten text using [[optical character recognition]] contains processing noise. Text produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing spelling errors, [[abbreviation]]s, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing [[punctuation]]s, missing [[letter case]] information, pause filling words such as “um” and “uh” and other texting and [[speech disfluencies]]. Such text can be seen in large amounts in [[contact centre (business)|contact centers]], [[chat room]]s, [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) of text documents, [[short message service]] (SMS) text, etc. Documents with [[historical language]] can also be considered noisy with respect to today’s knowledge about the language. Such text contains important historical, religious, ancient medical knowledge that is useful. The nature of the noisy text produced in all these contexts warrants moving beyond traditional text analysis techniques.

== Techniques for noisy text analysis ==
Missing punctuation and the use of non-standard words can often hinder standard [[natural language processing]] tools such as [[part-of-speech tagging]]
and [[parsing]]. Techniques to both learn from the noisy data and then to be able to process the noisy data are only now being developed.

== Possible source of noisy text ==
* [[World wide web]]: Poorly written text is found in web pages, [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[discussion forum]]s, [[newsgroups]]. Most of these data are unstructured and the style of writing is very different from, say, well-written news articles. Analysis for the web data is important because they are sources for market buzz analysis, market review, [[trend estimation]], etc. Also, because of the large amount of data, it is necessary to find efficient methods of [[information extraction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[automatic summarization]] and analysis of these data.
* [[Contact centre (business)|Contact centers]]: This is a general term for help desks, information lines and customer service centers operating in domains ranging from computer sales and support to mobile phones to apparels. On an average a person in the developed world interacts at least once a week with a contact center agent. A typical contact center agent handles over a hundred calls per day. They operate in various modes such as voice, [[online chat]] and [[E-mail]]. The contact center industry produces gigabytes of data in the form of [[E-mails]], chat logs, voice conversation [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s, customer feedback, etc. A bulk of the contact center data is voice conversations. Transcription of these using state of the art [[automatic speech recognition]] results in text with 30-40% [[word error rate]]. Further, even written modes of communication like online chat between customers and agents and even the interactions over email tend to be noisy. Analysis of contact center data is essential for customer relationship management, customer satisfaction analysis, call modeling, customer profiling, agent profiling, etc., and it requires sophisticated techniques to handle poorly written text.
* Printed Documents: Many libraries, government organizations and national defence organizations have vast repositories of [[hard copy]] documents. To retrieve and process the content from such documents, they need to be processed using [[Optical Character Recognition]]. In addition to printed text, these documents may also contain handwritten annotations. OCRed text can be highly noisy depending on the font size, quality of the print etc. It can range from 2-3% [[word error rate]]s to as high as 50-60% [[word error rate]]s. Handwritten annotations can be particularly hard to decipher, and error rates can be quite high in their presence.
* [[Text messaging|Short Messaging Service]] (SMS): Language usage over computer mediated discourses, like chats, emails and SMS texts, significantly differs from the standard form of the language. An urge towards shorter message length facilitating faster typing and the need for semantic clarity, shape the structure of this non-standard form known as the texting language.

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

== Matrix structure ==
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all process } i:\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}\dot{\rho_j} = 0 \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric relation]].

Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all component } j: \frac{\partial C_j}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} r_i \; ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rates of each process.

== Example ==
A system of a third [[Order of reaction|order reaction]] followed by a [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzyme reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;
{A} + 2B -&gt; S
&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
{E} + S &lt;=&gt;[k_f][k_r] ES -&gt;[k_\mathrm{cat}] {E} + P
&lt;/chem&gt;

where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S (S = AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
Production rates for each substance is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d [\ce A]}{d t} &amp;= -k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce B]}{d t} &amp;= -2 k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce S]}{d t} &amp;= k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2 - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce E]}{d t} &amp;= - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}] + k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\\
\frac{d [\ce ES]}{d t} &amp;= k_f[\ce E][\ce S] - k_r[\ce{ES}] - k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce P]}{d t} &amp;= k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Petersen matrix reads as
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{Diagonal split header|Process | Components&lt;br/&gt;(kmol/m³)}} !! A !! B !! S !! E !! ES !! P !! Reaction rate  
|-
| P1: 2nd order formation of S from A and B || -1 || -2 || +1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P2: Formation of ES from E and S|| 0 || 0 || -1 || -1 || +1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_f[\ce E][\ce S]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P3: Back decomposition of ES into E and S|| 0 || 0 || +1 || +1 || -1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_r[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P4: Forward decomposition of ES into E and P || 0 || 0 || 0 || +1 || -1 || +1 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The Petersen matrix can be used to write the system's rate equation

:&lt;math chem&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix} 
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce A] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce B] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce S] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce E] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce{ES}] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce P]
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\

==Electron excitation==
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|210px|right| After absorbing energy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited state.]]

[[Electron excitation]] is the movement of an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy state]]. This can either be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the original electron absorbs the photon and gains all the photon's energy or by electrical [[Excited state|excitation]] (EE), where the original electron absorbs the energy of another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to move electrons to a higher [[energy band]]. When an excited electron falls back to a lower energy state again, it is called electron relaxation. This can be done by radiation of a photon or giving the energy to a third spectator particle as well.&lt;ref name=2-electron&gt;

In physics there is a specific technical definition for [[energy level]] which is often associated with an atom being excited to an [[excited state]]. The excited state, in general, is in relation to the [[ground state]], where the excited state is at a higher [[energy level]] than the ground state.

==Photoexcitation==
{{See also|Photoelectric effect}}

[[Photoexcitation]] is the mechanism of [[electron excitation]] by [[photon]] absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory.

Photoexcitation plays role in photoisomerization. Photoexcitation is exploited in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s, [[photochemistry]], [[luminescence]], optically [[laser pumping|pumped]] lasers, and in some [[photochromic]] applications.
[[file:Military laser experiment.jpg|Military laser experiment|thumb]]

==Photoisomerization==
[[File:Azobenzene isomerization.svg|thumb|Photoisomerization of azobenzene]]
In [[chemistry]], '''photoisomerization''' is [[molecule|molecular]] behavior in which structural change between [[isomer]]s is caused by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerization reactions exist. However, the word "photoisomerization" usually indicates a reversible process. Photoisomerizable molecules are already put to practical use, for instance, in [[pigment]]s for [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]], [[DVD-RW|DVDs]], and [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. In addition, recent interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular electronics.

Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are ''trans-cis'' (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include [[stilbene]] and [[azobenzene]]. This type of compounds has a double [[chemical bond|bond]], and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include [[fulgide]] and [[diarylethene]]. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the [[Di-pi-methane rearrangement]].

==Photoionization==
{{See also|Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}}

[[Photoionization]] is the physical process in which an incident [[photon]] ejects one or more [[electron]]s from an [[atom]], [[ion]] or [[molecule]]. This is essentially the same process that occurs with the photoelectric effect with metals. In the case of a gas or single atoms, the term photoionization is more common.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"&gt;

 | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]

 | accessdate =2009-11-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ejected electrons, known as [[photoelectron]]s, carry information about their pre-ionized states. For example, a single electron can have a [[kinetic energy]] equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the [[electron binding energy]] of the state it left. Photons with energies less than the electron binding energy may be absorbed or [[scattering|scattered]] but will not photoionize the atom or ion.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

For example, to ionize [[hydrogen]], photons need an energy greater than 13.6 [[electronvolt]]s, which corresponds to a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometer|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; { mv^2 \over 2 } = h \nu - 13.6 eV&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the photon.

This formula defines the [[photoelectric effect]].

Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the [[Photoionisation cross section|photoionization cross-section]], which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of infrared or visible light), [[non-perturbative]] phenomena such as ''barrier suppression ionization''&lt;ref&gt;

===Multi-photon ionization===
{{See also|Fluorescence spectroscopy| Fluorescence| Photoionization mode}}

Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing ''N'' photons depends on the laser-light intensity ''I'' as ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of multi-photon ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher [[kinetic energy]] than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its [[photoelectron spectrum]] which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.

==Photo-Dember==
{{Main|Photo-Dember}}

In semiconductor physics the [[Photo-Dember]] effect (named after its discoverer H. Dember) consists in the formation of a charge [[dipole]] in the vicinity of a [[semiconductor]] surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface.&lt;ref name=photodember&gt;

==Grotthuss–Draper law==
The '''Grotthuss–Draper law''' (also called the '''Principle of Photochemical Activation''') states that only that light which is absorbed by a system can bring about a photochemical change. Materials such as [[dye]]s and [[phosphor]]s must be able to absorb "light" at optical frequencies. This law provides a basis for [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]]. The law was first proposed in 1817 by [[Theodor Grotthuss]] and in 1842, independently, by [[John William Draper]].&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

This is considered to be one of the two basic laws of [[photochemistry]]. The second law is the [[Photoelectrochemical processes#Stark–Einstein law|Stark–Einstein law]], which says that primary chemical or physical reactions occur with each [[photon]] absorbed.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

==Stark–Einstein law==
The '''Stark–Einstein law''' is named after German-born physicists [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who independently formulated the law between 1908 and 1913. It is also known as the '''photochemical equivalence law''' or '''photoequivalence law'''. In essence it says that every photon that is absorbed will cause a (primary) chemical or physical reaction.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw&gt;
{{Cite web
 |title=Photochemical equivalence law
 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/457732/photochemical-equivalence-law
 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]
 |accessdate=2009-11-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photon is a quantum of radiation, or one unit of radiation. Therefore, this is a single unit of EM radiation that is equal to Planck's constant (h) times the frequency of light. This quantity is symbolized by γ, hν, or ħω.

The photochemical equivalence law is also restated as follows: for every [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance that reacts, an equivalent mole of quanta of light are absorbed. The formula is:&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{mol} = N_A h \nu &lt;/math&gt;

where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]].

The photochemical equivalence law applies to the part of a light-induced reaction that is referred to as the primary process (i.e. [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[fluorescence]]).&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

In most photochemical reactions the primary process is usually followed by so-called secondary photochemical processes that are normal interactions between reactants not requiring absorption of light. As a result, such reactions do not appear to obey the one quantum–one molecule reactant relationship.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

The law is further restricted to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light sources such as those used in [[flash photolysis]] and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

==Absorption==
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}

In [[physics]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of electromagnetic radiation is the way by which the [[energy]] of a [[photon]] is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. Thus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy, for example, to heat. The absorption of light during [[wave propagation]] is often called [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in [[optics]]), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and the [[Saturable absorption]] (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

==Photosensitization==
[[Photosensitization]] is a process of transferring the [[energy]] of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) [[reactant]]s. This is part of the work of [[photochemistry]] in general. In particular this process is commonly employed where reactions require light sources of certain [[wavelength]]s that are not readily available.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] absorbs radiation at 1849 and 2537 [[angstrom]]s, and the source is often high-intensity [[arc lamp|mercury lamps]]. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with [[ethylene]], and the compound is [[irradiated]] with a mercury lamp, this results in the photodecomposition of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

[[Cadmium]]; some of the [[noble gas]]es, for example [[xenon]]; [[zinc]]; [[benzophenone]]; and a large number of organic dyes, are also used as sensitizers.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization&gt;
{{Cite web

 |accessdate =2009-11-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photosensitiser]]s are a key component of [[photodynamic therapy]] used to treat cancers.

==Sensitizer==
{{For|the particulate material used to create voids that aid in the initiation or propagation of an explosive's detonation wave|Explosive sensitiser}}

A '''sensitizer''' in [[chemiluminescence]] is a chemical compound, capable of [[light emission]] after it has received energy from a molecule, which became excited previously in the chemical reaction. A good example is this:

When an alkaline solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] and a concentrated solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are mixed, a reaction occurs:

:ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*(g) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*is excited oxygen&amp;nbsp;– meaning, one or more electrons in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule have been promoted to higher-energy [[molecular orbital]]s. Hence, oxygen produced by this chemical reaction somehow 'absorbed' the energy released by the reaction and became excited. This energy state is unstable, therefore it will return to the [[ground state]] by lowering its energy. It can do that in more than one way:

*it can react further, without any light emission
*it can lose energy without emission, for example, giving off heat to the surroundings or transferring energy to another molecule
*it can emit light

The intensity, duration and color of emitted light depend on [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetical]] factors. However, excited molecules are frequently less capable of light emission in terms of brightness and duration when compared to sensitizers. This is because sensitizers can store energy (that is, be excited) for longer periods of time than other excited molecules. The energy is stored through means of [[quantum vibration]], so sensitizers are usually compounds which either include systems of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] rings or many conjugated double and triple [[covalent bond|bonds]] in their structure. Hence, if an excited molecule transfers its energy to a sensitizer thus exciting it, longer and easier to quantify light emission is often observed.

The color (that is, the [[wavelength]]), brightness and duration of emission depend upon the sensitizer used. Usually, for a certain chemical reaction, many different sensitizers can be used.

===List of some common sensitizers===
*[[Violanthrone]]
*[[Isoviolanthrone]]
*[[Fluorescein]]
*[[Rubrene]]
*[[9,10-Diphenylanthracene]]
*[[Tetracene]]
*[[13,13'-Dibenzantronile]]
*[[Levulinic acid|Levulinic Acid]]

==Fluorescence spectroscopy==
[[Fluorescence spectroscopy]] aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sym-spectroscopy/&gt;

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Absorption spectroscopy==
[[Absorption spectroscopy]] refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy&gt;

[[File:The upper part of plankton net.jpg|thumb|The upper part of a plankton net consisting of (1) towing line connected to (2) three-point bridle, which are responsible for holding the plankton net]]
A '''Plankton net''' is equipment used for collecting [[Sampling method|samples]] of plankton  in standing bodies of water. It consists of a towing line and bridles, [[nylon]] [[mesh]] net, and a cod end.  Plankton nets are considered one of the oldest, simplest and inexpensive methods of sampling plankton .&lt;ref name="Gutkowska"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutkowska|first1=Agnieszka|last2=Paturej|first2=Ewa|last3=Kowalska|first3=Ewa|title=Qualitative and quantitative methods for sampling zooplankton in shallow coastal estuaries|journal=Ecohydrology &amp; Hydrology|date=2012|volume=12|pages=253–263|doi=10.2478/v10104-012-0022-2|url=http://ecohydro.pl/files/archieves/2012_3/EH2012-3_252-263_Gutkowska.pdf|doi-broken-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plankton net can be used for both [[Vertical direction|vertical]] and [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] sampling.&lt;ref name="Gutkowska" /&gt; It allows researchers to analyse plankton both [[quantitative research|quantitatively]] (cell density, cell colony or biomass) and [[qualitative property|qualitatively]] (e.g. Chlorophyll-a as a primary production of phytoplankton) in water samples from the environment.

[[File:A simple plankton net.jpg|thumb|A simple plankton net]]

[[File:An outlet valve with bucket of the plankton net.jpg|thumb|Cod end—an outlet valve with collecting cylinder]]

== Components ==

'''Towing line and bridles'''

The towing line and bridle is the upper part of a plankton net and used to hold it. The towing lines connected to the triangle bridles are made of [[nylon]] [[rope]] and can be adjust to a level suitable for the user.

'''Nylon mesh net '''

The nylon mesh [[net (device)|net]] is the middle part of the plankton net and is used to [[filter feeder|filter]] the plankton in the water sample in accordance with the size of the mesh. In addition, its [[funnel]] shape makes it possible to effectively capture plankton of various sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of Marine Programs|title=Plankton nets|url=http://www.coml.org/edu/tech/collect/planktonnets.htm|website=Census of Marine Life|publisher=University of Rhode Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various mesh sizes for nets, depending on the target [[microorganism]] to be collected and the condition of the [[water body]]. The narrower the mesh size, the smaller the plankton in the water sample.

For example, in order to obtain small [[invertebrates]] measuring 50 to 1500 [[μm]], a net mesh size between 25 and 50 [[μm]] [[diameter]] should be selected, which is sufficient to effectively [[filter feeder|filter]] only the target [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valdecasas|first1=Antonio G.|last2=Aboal|first2=Marina|last3=Cirujano|first3=Santos|last4=Iepure|first4=Sanda|last5=Jaume|first5=Damia|last6=Proctor|first6=Heather|last7=Velasco|first7=Jose Luis|title=Sampling continental freshwater|url=http://imedea.uib-csic.es/damiajaume/DamiaJaumewebpage_archivos/PDFs/Sampling%20methods.pdf|publisher=The Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a [[eutrophic]] water condition, a plankton net with a mesh larger than 100 [[μm]] should be chosen to avoid clogging the net.

'''Cod end '''

The cod end is located in the lower part of the plankton net at the end of the funnel. It has a collecting [[cylinder]] and a valve for opening and closing it.

==Use==
One common method for collecting a [[plankton]] sample is to tow the net horizontally using a low-speed boat. Before collecting the plankton, the net should be rinsed with the sample water. The user should ensure that the cod end is completely closed by turning the valve into a vertical position. Then the plankton net is then lowered horizontal to the water surface at the side of the slowly moving [[boat]]. Sampling is done for 1.5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuney|first1=Inci|last2=Maroulakis|first2=Michalis|title=Technical assistance for capacity building on water quality monitoring-Phytoplankton sampling methods|url=http://www.suyonetimi.gov.tr/Libraries/su/Training_on_Phytoplankton_sampling_methods_-_EN.sflb.ashx|publisher=The European Union and the Republic of Turkey|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, the plankton sample is collected in a sample bottle by opening the cod end above it by turning the valve horizontally.

When the sample is collected it can be analyzed using a [[microscope]] to identify the type of [[zooplankton]] or [[phytoplankton]], or a [[cell count]] can be undertaken to determine the plankton cell density of the water source.

==History==
[[John Vaughan Thompson]] developed a plankton net during his return voyage from Mauritius, which reached the UK in 1816. Impressed by marine [[bioluminescence]] in small crustacea he later named ''[[Sapphirina]]'', he felt "under great obligations to this beautiful little animal, which by its splendid appearance in the water induced me to commence the use of a muslin hoop-net, which when it failed to procure me a specimen, brought up such a profusion of other marine animals altogether invisible while in the sea, as to induce a continued use of it on every favourable opportunity."  He published his research in a series of six memoirs from 1828 to 1834.&lt;ref name="1927 bio"&gt;{{cite web | title=John Vaughan Thompson (1779 - 1847) | date=30 January 1927 | url=http://www.bellsite.id.au/gdbtree/HTMLFiles/HTMLFiles_60/P11242.html | accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second recorded use of a plankton net was by [[Charles Darwin]] on 10 January 1832, during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle#Atlantic islands|''Beagle'' survey voyage]]. His diary included a sketch of the net, which appears to have been based on a trawl net described by [[John Coldstream]] in a letter to Darwin. It is possible that Thompson's idea had earlier been drawn to Darwin's attention by [[Robert Edmond Grant]] in Edinburgh. Darwin describes this "contrivance" as "a bag four feet deep, made of bunting, &amp; attached to [a] semicircular bow this by lines is kept upright, &amp; dragged behind the vessel". The next day he remarked that "The number of animals that the net collects is very great &amp; fully explains the manner so many animals of a large size live so far from land. — Many of these creatures so low in the scale of nature are most exquisite in their forms &amp; rich colours. — It creates a feeling of wonder that so much beauty should be apparently created for such little purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

While numerous strategies exist, one underlying theme is constant: plants must make [[trade-off]]s when responding to their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. These trade-offs and responses lay the groundwork for classifying the strategies that emerge.

== Background ==
The concept of plant strategies started gaining attention in the 1960s and 1970s. At this time, strategies were often associated with [[Genotype|genotypic]] changes, such that plants could respond to their environment by changing their “genotypic programme” (i.e., strategy).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Around this same time, the [[r/K selection theory]] was introduced, which classifies plants by [[Life history theory|life history]] strategies, particularly reproductive strategies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the relationship between r/K selection and environmental carrying capacity: A new habitat templet for plant life history strategies|last = Taylor|date = 1990|journal = Oikos |volume=58 |issue = 2|pages=239–250|doi = 10.2307/3545432|pmid = |access-date = |jstor = 3545432}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, plants alter their reproductive strategies (i.e., number of [[offspring]]) and their growth rate to respond to their [[ecological niche]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The theory is still popular in the 21st century and frequently taught in science curricula. However, plant strategies really gained notoriety in 1977 with the introduction of [[J. Philip Grime|Grime]]’s [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|C-S-R Triangle,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which categorizes plants according to how they respond under varying levels of [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[Competition (biology)|competition]]. According to [[J. Philip Grime|Grime]], plants develop strategies that demonstrate resource trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The association between genotypic change and strategies was also still present in Grime’s theories, as he noted that the “genotypes of the majority of plants appear to represent compromises between the conflicting selection pressures” that generally classify plants into three strategy types.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The C-S-R Triangle remained the dominant plant strategy for several decades. However, in the early 1980s David Tilman introduced the R* theory, which focused on resource partitioning as strategies to deal with competition.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; More recently, additional strategies have been introduced. In 1998, the L-H-S strategy scheme was introduced as an alternative to Grime’s C-S-R scheme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The L-H-S strategy focuses on [[leaf]] and [[Seed|seed mass]] traits to classify plant strategies, noting that these traits can be measured and compared between species, which cannot easily be done with Grime’s abstract categories.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The goal of the L-H-S scheme was to develop an international network that could provide quantifiable comparisons between plant strategies. This started a movement towards incorporating functional traits in plant strategies, and understanding how plant functional traits and [[environmental factor]]s are related.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While Grime’s C-S-R Triangle is still frequently referenced in [[plant ecology]], new strategies are being introduced and gaining momentum in the 21st century.

== Grime's C-S-R Triangle /  Universal Adaptive Strategy Theory (UAST)  ==
{{main article|Universal adaptive strategy theory}}

[[J. Philip Grime|J. P. Grime]] identified two factor gradients, broadly categorized as [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and [[Stress (biology)|stress]], which limit plant biomass. Stresses include factors such as the availability of water, nutrients, and light, along with growth-inhibiting influences like temperature and toxins. Conversely, disturbance encompasses [[Herbivore|herbivory]], [[pathogen]]s, [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] interactions, [[fire]], [[wind]], etc. Emerging from high and low combinations of stress and disturbance are three life strategies commonly used to categorize plants based on environment: (1) C-competitors, (2) S-stress tolerators, and (3) R-[[Ruderal species|ruderals.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evidence for the existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory.|last = Grime|first = J.P.|date = 1977|journal = American Naturalist|volume = 111|issue = 982|pages = 1169–1194|doi = 10.1086/283244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no viable strategy for plants in high stress and high disturbance environments, therefore categorization for this habitat type is absent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each life strategy varies in trade-offs of resource allocation to seed production, [[Leaf shape|leaf morphology]], leaf [[longevity]], [[relative growth rate]], and other factors, which can be summarized as allocation to (1) growth, (2) [[reproduction]], and (3) maintenance. Competitors are primarily composed of species with high relative growth rate, short leaf-life, relatively low seed production, and high allocation to leaf construction. They persist in high nutrient, low disturbance environments, and “rapidly monopolize resource capture by the spatially-dynamic foraging of roots and shoots.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Plant Strategies, Vegetation Processes, and Ecosystem Processes|last = Grime|first = J.P.|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress-tolerators, found in high stress, low disturbance habitats, allocate resources to maintenance and defenses, such as anti-herbivory. Species are often [[evergreen]] with small, long-lived leaves or needles, slow resource turnover, and low [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] and relative growth rate. Due to high stress conditions, vegetative growth and reproduction are reduced. Ruderals, inhabiting low stress, high disturbance regimes, allocate resources mainly to seed reproduction and are often [[Annual plant|annuals]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennials]]. Common characteristics of ruderal species include high relative growth rate, short-lived leaves, and short statured plants with minimal lateral expansion.

== Tilman’s R* Rule ==
{{main article|R* rule (ecology)}}

[[G. David Tilman]] developed the [[R* rule (ecology)|R* rule]] in support of [[Competitive exclusion principle|resource competition theory]]. Theoretically, a plant species growing in [[monoculture]], and utilizing a single limiting resource, will deplete the resource until reaching an [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] level where growth and losses are balanced.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Resource competition and community structure|last = Tilman|first = D.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of the resource at the equilibrium level is termed R*; this is the minimum concentration at which the plant is able to persist in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constraints and tradeoffs: toward a predictive theory of competition and exclusion|last = Tilman|first = D.|date = 1990|journal = Oikos |volume=58 |pages=3–15|doi = 10.2307/3565355|pmid = |access-date = |jstor = 3565355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Population growth]] is indicated by values greater than the R*. Conversely, population decline is associated with values lower than the R*.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on Plant Competition|journal = Perspectives on Plant Competition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122944529500114|publisher = Academic Press Inc.|date = 1990-01-01|isbn = 978-0-12-294452-9|pages = 117–141|doi = 10.1016/b978-0-12-294452-9.50011-4|last = Grace J.B., D. Tilman|editor-first = |editor-last = Grace J.B., D. Tilman}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two species are competing for the same limiting [[Resource (biology)|resource]], the superior competitor will have the lowest R* value for that resource. This will eventually lead to the displacement of the inferior competitor, regardless of initial plant densities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Displacement rate depends on the magnitude of the difference in R*.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Resource use patterns predict long‐term outcomes of plant competition for nutrients and light|jstor = 519857|journal = The American Naturalist|date = 2007-09-01|pages = 305–318|volume = 170|issue = 3|doi = 10.1086/519857|pmid = 17879183|first = R.|last = Dybzinski|first2 = D.|last2 = Tilman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater differences lead to a faster exclusion. Every plant species differs in R* values due to differences in plant morphology and [[Plant physiology|physiology]]. The realized R* level is dependent on physical factors that vary by habitat, such as temperature, [[pH]], and [[humidity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== Westoby’s L-H-S Strategy ==
In 1998, Mark Westoby proposed a plant ecology strategy scheme (PESS) to explain species distributions based on traits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The dynamic model incorporated a three axes trade-off among [[specific leaf area]] (SLA), [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] height at maturity, and seed mass. SLA is defined as the area per unit dry mass of mature leaves, developed in the fullest natural light of the species.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These traits were selected for incorporation because of their trade-off functionality. Resource allocation to one trait is only possible by diverting resources from the others. Similarly to Grime’s C-S-R triangle, each gradient represents different strategic responses to the environment; variation in disturbance adaptation is represented by canopy height and seed mass (Grime’s R-axis), whereas SLA reflects variation in growth in response to stress (Grime’s C-S axis).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The L-H-S strategy avoids the assumption that high disturbance, high stress environments lack viable plant strategies, unlike Grime's model. However, Westoby's model is at a disadvantage when predicting potential variation in plant strategies since the axes only include single variables, compared to Grime's multivariable axes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== r/K Selection &amp;nbsp; ==
{{Main article|R/K selection theory|l1=r/K selection}}

This linear model, first introduced by MacArthur and Wilson (1967),&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; has been commonly applied to both plants and animals to describe reproductive strategies. Representing opposing extremes of a continuum, r-species commit all energy into maximizing seed production with minimal input to individual propagules, whereas K-species allocate energy into a few, highly [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] individuals; this is a spectrum of quantity versus quality.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On r- and K-Selection|last = Pianka|first = Eric R.|date = 1970|journal = The American Naturalist|volume = 104|issue = 940|pages = 592–597|doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes that perfect r-species function under competitive-free environments with no density effects and K-species under maximum competitive and density saturation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Most species are categorized as intermediates between both extremes.

== Summary &amp;nbsp; ==
The term “plant strategies” has many definitions, and includes several different mechanisms for responding to one’s environment. While different strategies focus on different plant characteristics, all strategies have an overarching theme: ''plants must make trade-offs between where and how to allocate resources''. Whether that’s allocation to growth, reproduction, or maintenance, plants are responding to their environment by employing strategies that allow them to persist, survive, and reproduce. Plants may have multiple strategies to survive at different life-stages and therefore be subject to multiple trade-off throughout their life-cycle &lt;ref name="VisserBruijning2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Bruijning|first2=Marjolein|last3=Wright|first3=S.

'''''Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families''''' is a 2005 book by American writer [[Pamela Paul]], discussing the impact of ready access to [[pornography]] on Americans.

The book was selected as one of the best books of 2005 by ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' and was a ''New York Times Book Review'' Editor's Choice. Social conservatives such as [[Albert Mohler]], President of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], endorsed the book enthusiastically,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosswalk.com/1346936/ Pornified America--The Culture of Pornography]&lt;/ref&gt; though he predicted it might "find a chilly reception in a society increasingly given over to the [[sexual arousal|titillation]], perversion, and profits offered by pornography".

The ''Washington Post Book World'' characterized the book as "A persuasive argument that today's pornography is not the [[Playboy]] centerfold or the Deep Throat of yesteryear...Paul's remedy charts a sensible middle ground between restraints and free speech." Sex columnist [[Amy Sohn]], on the other hand, cared less for the book and argued in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' that "Paul never gives credence to the many women who enjoy consuming porn, alone or with partners".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/books/review/11sohn.html "Pornified - Dirty Minds," Amy Sohn, ''New York Times Book Review,'' September 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eno Hall.gif|thumb|400px|left|Eno Hall (1924)]]
In 1893, fourteen years after [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first psychology [[laboratory]] in the world, a Psychology Laboratory was built in [[Nassau Hall]], the oldest building in the university, under the leadership of [[James Mark Baldwin|J. Mark Baldwin]]. In 1915, psychology received recognition in the title when the department was renamed Department of Philosophy and Psychology. It was not until 1920, however, that the Department of Psychology was established with Howard Warren as its first chairman.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; In 1924, Eno Hall was constructed to house the department. The building was named in honor of [[Henry Lane Eno|Henry Eno]], the principal donor and research associate in psychology. Warren was also a donor, but he chose to keep his donation anonymous at the time. He commented that it was "the first laboratory in this country, if not in the world, dedicated solely to the teaching and investigation of [[experimental psychology|scientific psychology]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs.cgi?id=2&amp;link=http%3a%2f%2fetcweb%2eprinceton%2eedu%2f%43ampus%57%57%57%2f%43ompanion%2feno%5fhall%2ehtml&amp;file=%2fvar%2flocal%2fasweb%2fwww%2fapps%2fglimpse%2fwg2%2farchives%2f2%2f%2ecache%2f182%5f201011121511%2eabra&amp;line=8&amp;highlight=eno%7chall#mfs Eno Hall] from {{cite book|last1=Leitch|first1=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400870011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to university president [[John Grier Hibben|John Hibben]], the laboratory was the realization of a dream that Warren had cherished for a long time.

University president [[James McCosh]] was primary professor of psychology in the early days of the department.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Maier, B. N. (2004).

An Office of Public Opinion Research was established when [[Hadley Cantril]] was department head:
:Already by the mid-1930s, Cantril made contact with [[George Gallup|Gallup]], who, welcoming recognition of his new methods by an academic scholar, offered the Princeton man the full use of his facilities at cost. Later, in 1940, Cantril secured a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant to set up the Office of Public Opinion Research at Princeton. The objectives of this new institute included not only learning how to measure [[public opinion]] systematically and accurately but also understanding the psychology of public opinion, "how and why it changes, what motivates large segments of the public."&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 183, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office’s 1947 report ''Gauging Public Opinion'' noted the arrival of a new [[discipline (academia)|discipline]]:
:Within the past decade the field of public opinion research has been transformed from an academic hobby and commercial toy to a discipline of its own. The enormous possibilities of the sampling technique used in market research have been avidly exploited by American business. Newspaper and magazine publishers were quick to sense the news value of reports on what the nation thinks. And now responsible public officials have learned to take opinion polls seriously for their contribution to modern statecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadley Cantril]] and associates of the Office of Public Opinion Research (1947) : [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.275054 Gauging Public Opinion], page vii, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the department relocated to Green Hall on the corner of Washington St. and William St. The building, which had been previously occupied by the School of [[Engineering]], was redesigned by university alumnus Francis W. Roudebush for the use of the psychology and [[sociology]] departments.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/green_hall.html Green Hall] from {{cite book|last1=Leitch|first1=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400870011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Princeton Psychology Colloquium Committee, which schedules weekly speeches and discussions for psychology students, invited [[Richard Herrnstein]], psychology professor at [[Harvard University]] to speak about the vision of pigeons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=245084 Herrnstein feels threatened, cancels Princeton appearance].

Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Princeton's University Action Group, a radical student organization, threatened to sabotage the event on the grounds that Herrnstein was a [[racist]], the Harvard professor canceled his appearance. Kamin asserted that "the climate in which [Herrnstein's] decision was made raises serious questions about [[freedom of speech]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Most of the department's graduates from the classes of 2004 to 2007 had placements in the faculties of [[research universities]] and post-doctoral positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Thanks to a group of faculty and students who work across traditional disciplines and departments, interdisciplinary research and scholarship in the department has grown significantly since the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

==Psychology Library==

In 1963, the department moved to Green Hall; a room located next to the lobby in the first floor served as the department's [[academic library]]. In 1968, two more rooms were added to house [[monographs]] and journal stacks. In 1990, the third journal room was moved into the basement to accommodate compact shelving. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100614205703/http://psychlib.princeton.edu/ Psychology Library], a branch of [[Princeton University Library]], underwent significant renovations in 2002. The basement room was no longer used because the library gained a Reading Room, which has become a popular study space for psychology concentrators. A ramp that leads to the second room was built to ease the reshelving of materials. A librarian’s office was built next to one of the computer clusters.

Some pair-bonded female penguins copulate with males who are not their mates and then take pebbles for their own nests.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Chimpanzees who appear to be trading food for sex have also been described as engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

==Penguins==
{{see also|Adélie penguin}}
[[File:Manchot Adelie - Adelie Penguin.jpg|thumb|Adélie penguin]]
Prostitution in animals was first reported in 1998 by Fiona Hunter, a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]], and Lloyd Davis of the [[University of Otago]], who had spent five years observing the mating behavior of Adélie penguins. The study was conducted as part of an [[Antarctica New Zealand]] programme on the [[Ross Island]], approximately {{convert|800|mi}} from the [[South Pole]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to the report about the study published by [[BBC News Online]], some female penguins sneak around on their partners.  These prostitutes have sex with unattached males and take a pebble from the male's nest after having sex. In an actual study the researchers speculate that the female has bent over to grab a stone and the male has misinterpreted the gesture—she hasn't changed her mind or performed a trick. But researchers are still studying the phenomenon, and a consensus has not yet been reached; it is assumed that either the female is baiting, or that the male deliberately chooses to misinterpret the gesture, as coercive sexual copulation is common among these penguins. The BBC further reported Hunter as saying that the female penguins probably didn't engage in prostitution only for stones. Hunter believed "what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well. We don't know exactly why, but they are using the males".  This behavior was also suggested as a [[mate choice]] process by which the females might find a possible future mate.  This would provide a female penguin with another male penguin should their current mate die. The male penguins, the study speculates, were engaged in sex with the prostitute females only for sexual satisfaction. According to Hunter's observation, the number of prostitute penguins was very low, and she approximated this as "only a few percent".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

While the sensationalized versions of the study emphasize prostitution, the research data itself is less sensational. The data show that when extrapair copulation occurs at the male's nesting site, the female takes one or more stones; but when the extrapair copulation occurs at the female's nesting site, the male never takes a stone.  Clearly a male who has copulated with a female benefits his progeny when she takes a stone.  Sometimes copulation doesn't occur, but the female still takes a stone.  But both males and females steal stones: sometimes they get away with it and sometimes they are attacked.  The benefit of gaining stones without a fight is clear, but the female is not always willing to copulate to avoid a fight.  The researchers speculate about the possible genetic fitness advantages and disadvantages of the practice, and aren't altogether sure that the female copulates mainly in order to obtain a stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=E.M.|author2=Davis, S.L. |year=1998|title=Female Adélie Penguins Acquire Nest Material from Extrapair Males after Engaging in Extrapair Copulations |journal=The Auk|volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=526–528|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v115n02/p0526-p0528.pdf|doi=10.2307/4089218|jstor=4089218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chimpanzees==
[[File:Schimpanse zoo-leipig.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pan troglodytes]]'', similar to those observed in the [[Taï National Park]].]]
A study conducted by the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], and published online in the [[Public Library of Science]], attempted to support the meat-for-sex behaviour hypothesis, according to which, in early human societies the best male hunters had the maximum number of sexual partners. Unable to study early humans, researchers studied chimpanzees. Researchers observed chimpanzees in the [[Taï National Park]] and concluded that a form of prostitution exists among the chimpanzees in which females offer sex to males in exchange for meat. According to Cristina Gomes of the Institute, the study "strongly suggests that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex, and do so on a long-term basis".  The data reveal that chimps enter into communities of hunting and sharing meat with each other over long periods of time and females within the meat-sharing community tend to copulate with males of their own meat-sharing community.  Direct exchange of meat for sex has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cristina M. Gomes and Christophe Boesch |year=2009 |title=Wild Chimpanzees Exchange Meat for Sex on a Long-Term Basis |journal=PLOS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005116 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5116 |pmid=19352509 |pmc=2663035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]] trains [[capuchin monkey]]s to use silver discs as money in order to study their economic behavior. The discs could be exchanged by the monkeys for various treats. During one chaotic incident, a researcher observed what appeared to be a monkey exchanging a disc for sex. The monkey that was paid for sex immediately traded the silver disc for a grape. The researcher took steps to prevent any possibility of coins being traded for sex after his suspicions were aroused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html  Monkey Business], by [[Stephen J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">[[File:National Radio Quiet Zone.svg|thumb|right|200px|A map showing the extent of the [[United States National Radio Quiet Zone]].]]
A '''radio quiet zone''' is an area where [[radio]] transmissions are restricted in order to protect a [[radio telescope]]&lt;ref name="ska_au" /&gt; or a communications station&lt;ref name="nrao" /&gt; from [[radio frequency interference]]. The Radio Regulations of the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) define interference as being detrimental to radio astronomy if it increases measurement uncertainty by 10%. In particular, the applicable regulation is known as ITU-R Recommendation RA.769, "Protection criteria used for radio astronomical measurements".&lt;ref name=vanDriel2011/&gt; Equipment that can cause interference includes [[mobile phone]]s, [[television transmitter]]s, and [[CB radio]]s, as well as other [[electrical equipment]].&lt;ref name="ska_au" /&gt;

Quiet zones are located in areas that are sparsely populated, and may be enforced by government legislation.&lt;ref name="ska_au" /&gt; A radio quiet zone is often divided into two zones: an exclusion zone where all radio emissions are prohibited, and a larger coordination zone of up to 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where the power levels of radio transmissions are suitably limited so as not to interfere with the radio telescope.&lt;ref name=vanDriel2011/&gt;

Formal radio quiet zones exist around many observatories,&lt;ref name="Umar_aip" /&gt; including the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] in Australia,&lt;ref name="ska_au" /&gt; the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] and the [[Sugar Grove Station]] in West Virginia, United States (the [[United States National Radio Quiet Zone]]),&lt;ref name="nrao" /&gt; and the [[Itapetinga Radio Observatory]] in Brazil,&lt;ref name="itapetinga" /&gt; as examples. The ITU has recommended designating two locations in space as radio quiet zones: the shielded zone on the [[Far side of the Moon|Moon's far side]], and the Sun-Earth [[Lagrangian point]] L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Cohen2003/&gt;

'''Rossall School''' is a British, fee paying [[Coeducation|co-educational]], [[independent school]], between [[Cleveleys]] and [[Fleetwood]], [[Lancashire]]. Rossall was founded in 1844 by [[St. Vincent Beechey|St Vincent Beechey]] as a sister school to [[Marlborough College]] which had been founded the previous year. Its establishment was "to provide, at a moderate cost, for the sons of Clergymen and others, a classical, mathematical and general education of the highest class, and to do all things necessary, incidental, or conducive to the attainment of the above objects."&lt;ref name="trr"&gt;''The Rossall Register 1844–1894'' - Anguline Research Archives - p.44&lt;/ref&gt; 
Along with [[Cheltenham College|Cheltenham]], [[Lancing College|Lancing]] and [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], Rossall was part of a flurry of expansion in education during the early [[Victorian period]]. These schools were later complemented by others such as [[Clifton College|Clifton]], [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]], [[Malvern College|Malvern]] and [[Radley College|Radley]].

Set in a {{convert|161|acre|km2|sing=on}} estate next to Rossall Beach, Rossall is also a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and was granted a [[royal charter]] on 21 October 1890.&lt;ref name="trr" /&gt; It accepts students between the ages of 2 and 18 and also has an associated [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]]. Rossall's campus has a large array of facilities for extracurricular activities and the school is home to the Lawrence House Space Science and Astronomy Centre, the only facility of its type in the UK. Over the years, Rossall has adapted itself to changing attitudes in education, and was the first school in the UK to have a [[Combined Cadet Force]] and one of the first to introduce the [[International Baccalaureate]] and host a dedicated international study centre on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice.jsp?id=advice_overseas_choosing_school_international UK Boarding Schools - private schools, public schools and boarding schools in the UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807002243/http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice.jsp?id=advice_overseas_choosing_school_international |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of founding a boarding school on the Fylde coast originates with a [[Corsican people|Corsican]] man named Zenon Vantini.  As the owner of the [[North Euston Hotel]] in [[Fleetwood]],&lt;ref name="GalePolden4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vantini opened his hotel expecting many visitors but few people arrived.  To boost the number of visitors to Fleetwood and help his hotel and the local economy, Vantini opened two schools in the vicinity of Fleetwood, one for boys and another for girls, totalling 1,000 students.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt;  The early Victorian period was marked by high child mortality rates, and Vantini expected that in the long term, the schools could be funded by a form of [[tontine]] insurance scheme, whereby the cost to educate children who reached their teenage years was offset by those who had died in infancy.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt;

Vantini called a meeting at the North Euston Hotel to discuss the foundation of the schools with local businessmen and clergy.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt; It was decided that any school that was to be founded would be directly affiliated to the Church of England. This was to be the first major Church of England school in the north of England and a sister school to [[Marlborough College]] which had opened the previous year. It was soon established that there was little hope of founding the girls' school and this idea was abandoned, with the boys' school pupil numbers reduced to 200.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Vantini's involvement with the scheme steadily dissipated, [[St. Vincent Beechey|Rev. St. Vincent Beechey]], the parish priest of Fleetwood, took over.

Beechey set about finding the funds required to set up such a school. Beechey got the financial support of [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood]], [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] as patron, the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] as vice-president and [[John Bird Sumner]], then [[Bishop of Chester]] and later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], as visitor.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5" /&gt; As a result of [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood|Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood's]] financial problems from over-investing in the development of Fleetwood, he agreed to lease his ancestral home of Rossall Hall to the school for 21 years, with the option of buying it for £7,000 after ten years.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5" /&gt; The Northern Church of England Boarding School, renamed Rossall College under the reign of William Osborne, opened on 22 August 1844,

===1844 to 1914===
Initial problems were not unusual for boarding schools of the time, though Rossall nearly shut down in its infancy because of huge outbreaks of [[scarlet fever]]. The foundation stone to the school chapel, now the Sumner Library, was laid in 1848 by the first ever [[Bishop of Manchester]], [[James Prince Lee]] - the diocese having only been created that same year. Rossall's swift and successful development can be seen by its inclusion in the book ''The Great Schools of England'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staunton|first=Howard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage|title=The Great Schools of England|publisher=Sampson Low, Son, and Marston|date=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chapel was constructed in the 1860s and the school underwent further development from the 1880s to 1900 to accommodate more students and to create further facilities such as the gym which still stands. In 1874 Rossall became the first [[Church of England]] school to play a [[Catholic school]], [[Stonyhurst College]], in an inter-school sports fixture, at cricket. Protestant newspapers warned against such activities advising Rossall parents to be wary of encroaching papism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Athleticism in the Victorian and Edwardian Public School |last=Mangan|first=J.A.|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location= |isbn=0-7146-8043-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irW3lfgplM4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=stonyhurst+rossall+|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, roughly one hundred O.R.s served in the Boer War, nearly half of them winning distinctions or [[mentions in despatches]]. Seventeen old boys died in active service, all of whom are now commemorated in the stalls of the school chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossall was widely considered to be in top 30 public schools in the UK by the end of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign also earning itself a place in the [[independent school (UK)#Public Schools Yearbook|Public Schools Yearbook]] and the Public School News section of the [[Cambridge Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080/0046760032000151492|author=William Whyte|date=6 November 2003|title=Building a public school community 1860–1910|doi=10.1080/0046760032000151492|journal=History of Education|volume=32|pages=601–626|issue=6|access-date=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204937/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080%2F0046760032000151492|archive-date=30 September 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some financial difficulties as a result of fund embezzling by a bursar, by the end of the 1920s Rossall's academic results were amongst the best in the country with record numbers achieving scholarships to [[Oxbridge]] and attaining distinctions in the Higher Certificate examinations.&lt;ref name="GalePolden96"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914 to 1945===
During the world wars large numbers of Old Rossallians lost their lives in combat, 297 in World War I alone&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the majority of whom are now commemorated in the extension memorial chapel. Rossall has a memorial plaque at St Georges Chapel by the [[Menin Gate]] in honour of its fallen, alongside schools such as [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2007/11/12/1041286.html |title=This Is Lancashire - Memorial for Great War pupils |publisher=Archive.thisislancashire.co.uk |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  1,617 ORs fought in World War I,&lt;ref&gt;'The Tide Flows On' - Derek Winterbottom (2006, Manx Press), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 300 of whom received war honours.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Rossall had made plans to accommodate [[Westminster School]]&lt;ref name="cent"&gt;''A Centenary History of Rossall School'' - William Furness - (Gale and Polden, 1944) p.170&lt;/ref&gt; however these plans were scrapped when the government requisitioned the campus for several departments of the [[Office of Works]], the [[Board of Education]] and the [[Ministry of Pensions]]. As a result, the school moved to [[Naworth Castle]].&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt; The government departments put up prefabricated buildings and found other premises close by as soon as possible, and left in 1940. The school returned and took in a school from the south-east, as the Westminster School had found an alternative solution. The eventual choice was that of [[Alleyn's School|Alleyn's]] who had to be evacuated from London as a result of the risk of bombing.&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt; Another side effect of the war was that there was only one centenary dinner celebrating the 100th year of Rossall. It was conducted by Old Rossallians imprisoned in [[Changi Prison]], a notorious [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp in Singapore during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref name="rossallianclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/about/|title=About the Rossallian Club|accessdate=15 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007162633/http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/about/|archive-date=7 October 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945 to present===
[[Benjamin Britten]] gave a concert in Big School in 1954. It continued to thrive and in the 1970s, in a bid to ensure the highest standards during a period of declining boarding, girls were allowed to enrol. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the school pushed on with a development programme and had royal visits including the Queen in 1994 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its foundation. The school went through great financial difficulty at the turn of the millennium.

Rossall has since had more investment than previously, with the boarding houses including Maltese Cross currently undergoing varying degrees of refurbishment. The middle school now runs from years 7 to 9, one year longer than traditionally. As a part of the modernising of the school the [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was introduced as an alternative to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] in 1998, being only the 3rd school in the UK to do so, and there is now an international boarding contingent.

Rossall promotes relatively affordable private education in relation to the rest of the UK - 80% of those who attend the school are the first in their family to attend an independent school and a large number of [[scholarships]] and [[bursaries]] are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/uploads/pubdownloads/newsletter12-04.pdf |title={title} |access-date=27 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927121524/http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/uploads/pubdownloads/newsletter12-04.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2007 saw the return of the Rossall Summer School - developed to give children from outside the UK the opportunity to develop their English speaking skills as well as being a chance for those thinking of going to a boarding school to consider whether they are suited to the lifestyle.

===Architecture===

====The Archway====
This was erected in 1867, under the reign of William Osborne, with the foundation stone being laid by [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rossall Register 1844–1894'' - Anguline Research Archives - p.28&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been designed by [[Edward Graham Paley]]. It is clearly modelled on the entrance gates of the [[Oxbridge]] colleges and originally had large wooden doors which were locked at night; these have since been removed for improvements in access.&lt;ref name="TourRossall5"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chapel====
In the 1860s a new school chapel was built to cope with the increasing number of students, the old chapel serving, as it does today, as the school library. The new chapel was designed by [[Edward Graham Paley]],&lt;ref name="TourRossall2"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; extended by [[Robert Lorimer]] and includes carvings by [[Eric Gill]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall3"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel organ was designed by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall3" /&gt; Rossall celebrated the chapel's 150th Anniversary on 1 April 2012.

====The Dining Hall====
The original school dining hall burnt down in the 1920s. The replacement, the current dining hall, was designed by [[Thomas Worthington (architect)#Legacy|Sir Hubert Worthington]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall6"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The design was not without fault however - it was constructed from bricks encased in a weatherable coating that would dissolve away to leave it looking in the same condition as the rest of the square.

The most notable tournament is the fives competition which in 2005 included [[Lancing College]], [[Malvern College]], [[Uppingham School]] and [[Shrewsbury School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Dominique|date=19 January 2006|url=http://etonfives.co.uk/tournaments/reports.and.results/2005-2006/rossall.schools.2006.html|work=Eton Fives Association Tournament Reports|title=Rossall Schools International 2005–2006: Youth Fives Handball Championship Played at Blackpool Sunday 9th October 2005|accessdate=15 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907235850/http://www.etonfives.co.uk/tournaments/reports.and.results/2005-2006/rossall.schools.2006.html|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Combined Cadet Force====
Rossall was the first school in the United Kingdom to form a [[Combined Cadet Force]] (CCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/cadets/victorian.htm|title=Victorian Cadets|accessdate=15 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070502081839/http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/cadets/victorian.htm |archivedate = 2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in February 1860 when the threat of a French/Irish Catholic invasion was at its height.&lt;ref name="WardLockCo240"&gt;"Our Great Public Schools, Their Traditions, Customs and Games" - F. A. M. Webster - (Ward, Lock and Co., London, 1937) p.240&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Rugby School]] claims to have raised a company of Volunteer Riflemen in 1804&lt;ref name="WardLockCo240" /&gt; Rossall's is the oldest contingent continually in existence and the one from which many other schools drew the inspiration of founding theirs. Other schools such as [[Eton College]] formed their corps a few months after Rossall. From 1890 to 1908 the corps was affiliated to the [[1st Lancashire Engineers|1st Lancashire Engineer Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Monthly Army List''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Westlake, ''Royal Engineers (Volunteers) 1859–1908'', Wembley: R.A. Westlake, 1983, {{ISBN|0-9508530-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is still present in the school today with around 100 [[cadet]]s currently enlisted. In recent years the shooting team has excelled with notable victories in the Home Guard Cup and Loyal’s Regimental Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.privateschoolnews.co.uk/?p=681|publisher=Private School News|title=School’s High Calibre Hot Sots|date=8 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112074202/http://www.privateschoolnews.co.uk/?p=681|archivedate=12 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCF at Rossall received the Queens colours on Tuesday 29 June 2010, to celebrate its 150th anniversary and to acknowledge its status as the oldest cadet corps in the UK.

Through the Cadet Vocational Qualifications Organisation ([[Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation (CVQO)|CVQO]]) the School [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] offers cadets (aged 16–19) and above the opportunity to gain internationally recognised [[BTEC First Diploma]] qualifications in Public Services and Music. Each BTEC First Diploma is the equivalent of 4 GCSEs, grade C - A*.

====Miscellaneous====
Other societies include the [[Astronomy]] club which makes use of the school's telescope and planetarium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/sporting_and_activities/ |title=Rossall School - Sporting and Activities |publisher=Rossall.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927184330/http://www.rossall.co.uk/sporting_and_activities/ |archive-date=27 September 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Literary Society, called the Farrell Society, after the writer J.G.

==Lawrence House Astronomy and Space Science Centre==
[[File:RossallObservatory.jpg|thumb|left|The refurbished Rossall Observatory. (Inset - the observatory before restoration)]]
Rossall is also home to the Lawrence House Astronomy and Space Science Centre - the only centre dedicated solely to the teaching of [[Astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/ | title=School website: Astronomy | accessdate=20 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531063829/http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/ | archive-date=31 May 2007 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project consists of the telescope in Rossall's Assheton Observatory as well as a building of its own containing a lecture theatre, classrooms and a portable planetarium. The telescope is of particular note - being {{convert|12|ft|m}} long, 18&amp;nbsp;inches wide and dating from 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Lancashire Evening Telegraph|url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2003/12/5/517430.html|title=Space is the star at school centre|date=5 December 2003}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective diameter of the telescope is 6.5&amp;nbsp;inches and it has a focal length of f/13.5.&lt;ref name="AAG: News 10-2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/aag_October00/aag504.htm |title=AAG: News 10-2000 |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518003200/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/aag_October00/aag504.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project has been funded by the [[Lawrence House Trust]] and predominantly run by Dr. Nick Lister, originally the head of design and technology at the school and now Astronomer in Residence. Dr. Lister studied at [[Plymouth University]] before getting his PhD from University College London. He is a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and was recently appointed as vice-president of the [[Association for Astronomy Education]], where he succeeded Dr Robert Massey of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], who has now become president of the organisation.&lt;ref name="astronomy169"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/169 |title=Rossall School Astronomy - About Dr Nick Lister |publisher=Rossall.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021192222/http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/169 |archive-date=21 October 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When initial assessments were being made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition as a result of years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from [[brass]] and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration.&lt;ref name="AAG: News 10-2000"/&gt; This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them [[Syd Little]]. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope to go ahead with the project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to go forward with their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal [[Francis Graham Smith|Sir Francis Graham Smith]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpoolcitizen.co.uk/display.var.937403.0.starring_role_for_top_astronomer.php |title=Starring Role For Top Astronomer (from Blackpool Citizen) |publisher=Blackpoolcitizen.co.uk |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Ethnomusicology''' is, with the [[International Council for Traditional Music]] and the [http://www.bfe.org.uk/ British Forum for Ethnomusicology], one of three major international associations for [[ethnomusicology]]. Its mission is "to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Officially founded in 1955, its origins extend back to November, 1953 at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in Philadelphia with an informal agreement between [[Willard Rhodes]], [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], and [[Alan P. Merriam]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1953. "Introduction." ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'' 1 (December), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These three traveled together to the annual meeting of the [[American Musicological Society]] in New Haven to enlist the support of musicologist [[Charles Seeger]] in their endeavor to create a new academic society. This meeting resulted in the launch of the ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'', ethnomusicology's first dedicated serial publication, containing notes about current field research projects, a bibliography, and list of recordings of interest to the nascent discipline. The first annual meeting of the society was in [[Philadelphia]], in September 1955.

Over the decades, The Society for Ethnomusicology has created a setting that allows scholars to publish and present their work from the field, better communicate and connect with fellow researchers, and provides leadership opportunities for those striving to improve the field of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Nettl, “We’re on the Map: Reflections on SEM in 1955 and 2005,” ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The society currently publishes a quarterly newsletter, a quarterly journal entitled ''Ethnomusicology'', and an extensive set of "ographies" (bibliography, discography, filmography, videography). It organizes an annual international conference and over a dozen regional conferences, maintains an active website, and presents more than a dozen awards for scholarship and service, such as the [[Jaap Kunst]] prize for the best published article in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/general/custom.asp?page=Prizes_Kunst |title=Jaap Kunst Prize - Society for Ethnomusicology |publisher=Ethnomusicology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of SEM==

===Before 1953===

The founding of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ Society for Ethnomusicology] was not the first attempt at an organization focusing on the music of the world. Before the work of SEM’s founders in the 1950s, several efforts in Europe had taken place through the work of dozens of musicologists and those who would eventually be considered ethnomusicologists, including [[Frances Densmore]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], and [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]]. These and other scholars found inspiration in Viennese [[Guido Adler]] and Englishman [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], who both produced articles in 1885 discussing “ethnological studies” of music and the equal treatment of every society’s music.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"&gt;Nettl 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, scholars turned to Austrian [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]], credited with inventing the musical instrument categorization system still used today, and his 1905 article outlining "The Problems of Comparative Musicology."&lt;ref name="Nettl180"&gt;Nettl 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ethnomusicology, though casually used towards the mid-1900s, was not widely used officially. The word first appeared in publication in [[Jaap Kunst]]'s book, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods representative personalities'', which wasn’t published in 1955.&lt;ref name="Nettl180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Kunst, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods and representative personalities; to which is added a bibliography'', Martinus Nijhoff, The Hauge, Netherlands, 1955, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works are a few of the examples of some of the musical thought taking place at the turn of the century. However, many European thinkers found fewer resources and more censorship with the incoming Second World War. In response, Charles Seeger helped found the American Society for Comparative Musicology to house the number of musicologists fleeing the rise of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willard Rhodes, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924574 A Decade of Progress]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 178, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM History"&gt;William Rhodes, "[http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=History_Founding SEM History]", The Society for Ethnomusicology Website, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953===

In November 1953, [[David P. McAllester]], [[Alan P. Merriam]], and [[Willard Rhodes]] attended the 52nd Annual Meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] taking place in the city of [[Philadelphia]]. The three found they shared a common interest, particularly in North American Indian music, but also had productive conversation about, "the problems of ethnomusicology, historical, theoretical and methodological, and above all, a need for association and communication with persons with similar interests."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; The scholars believed that the ever-evolving field of ethnomusicology would be better navigated if the scholars, musicologist, anthropologists, and anyone with passion for ethnomusicology formed a society. The three agreed that producing a newsletter was the first step in founding a society, as it would unite the wider community of scholars to better communicate research and ideas of their fellow scholars. Rhodes suggested seeking out colleague [[Charles Seeger]] as a fellow conspirator. Following the American Anthropology Association meeting, the team traveled to the [[American Musicological Society]] annual meeting the following December. Seeger became the fourth member of the group and, under his consultation and Merriam’s editorship, the Newsletter began to take shape.

Ignited and led by McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, and Seeger, Ethno-musicology Newsletter No. 1 was mailed to about 300 individuals and institutions. While the initial effort towards the creation of the Newsletter lies solely with these four men, many other scholars were working towards the goals the Newsletter set out to promote. A letter separate from the Newsletter signed by the aforementioned four, but also [[Manfred Bukofzer]], [[Frances Densmore]], Mieczslaw Kolinksi, [[Curt Sachs]] (who worked alongside Hornbostel), [[Harold Spivacke]], and Richard Waterman, was sent to about 70 individuals. The letter stated, "It must be emphasized that the present effort is the prerogative of no individual or group of individuals rather, the project is conceived as the joint effort of all those interested in seeing contact reestablished among ethnomusicologists."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt;

===1955-1962===

The popularity of the Newsletter increased dramatically, jumping to 472 recipients by April 1955.&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; With the intense interest in ethnomusicology, it was felt that the society could soon be founded. The September Newsletter announced that an organized meeting of ethnomusicologists would take place at the 54th Annual Meeting of American Anthropology Association in [[Boston]] on November 18, 1955. McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, Seeger, and several others, nearly all recipients of the Newsletter, founded the Society for Ethnomusicology and elected its first council:

President: Williard Rhodes,

Honorary President: Curt Sachs

Vice President: Mieczlaw Kolinki

Sectretary-Treasurer: David McAllester

Editor: Alan Merriam

The first official annual conference for the Society for Ethnomusicology was held the following year in alongside the 5th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences on September 5, 1956 in Philadelphia. The constitution was drafted, officer positions expanded, and mission statement defined: “…to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; It was also decided that the hyphen would be removed from ethno-musicology with some disapproval."&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/852423 Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992)]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 37 (1993): 251-262, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, it was recorded that 25% of the Society’s membership was made up of non-U.S. residents and only 7% of that were Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Newsletter expanded and added David McAllester and [[Bruno Nettl]] as editors. In 1962, [[Wesleyan University]] took over the publication of the printed pamphlet newsletter, which had until this point been sponsored by the founding four.

===1963-1955===

In 1963, The Society for Ethnomusicology produce a special, tenth anniversary issue with articles that looked back at the Newsletter and Society’s accomplishments. Challenged to find a way to measure these successes, David McAllester and Donald Winkelman both commented on the impressive efforts made at academic institutions around the country to include courses entirely or partially related to ethnomusicology.  In McAllester’s “Ethnomusicology: The Field and the Society” article, he quoted Winkelman’s finding that about 30 institutions offered anywhere from one to fourteen courses related to ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924575 Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 182, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an incredible number when compared to the findings of [[Bruno Nettl]], who had been charged to construct a survey of the institutions that offered courses in ethnomusicology in 1954, which showed that only fourteen institutions made the list.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Winkelman found that the number had doubled in about ten years.

Among these institutions, a few stood out as academic leaders in ethnomusicology in 1963. [[UCLA]] offered one of the largest graduate program, which believed that the “actual performance of an exotic music is essential to the full understand of its structure and purpose."&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society,” 183.&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA was also praised for sending its graduate students abroad to be immersed in a culture and its music. The [[University of Hawaii]] was well known for its ability to harmonize the relationship between the anthropology and music departments, drawing from both to create well-rounded ethnomusicology courses. Alan Merriam had made significant headway at Indiana University, having been made a Professor of Anthropology in 1962, equipped with skills in African music, music analysis, and Indian music. He worked closely with music professor and ethnomusicologist, [[Walter Kaufmann (ethnomusicologist)|Walter Kaufmann]]. At [[Columbia University]], Willard Rhodes had already been teaching some ethnomusicology course since he was made full Professor in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the ethnomusicology depart alongside Nicholas England, but later traveled to Africa and Asia to conduct and bring back research.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] and Richard Waterman were able to bridge the gap between the anthropology and music departments by teaching across both departments, bringing up [[Wayne State University]] as one of the countries strongest ethnomusicology institutions.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"&gt;McAllester, "Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society," 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, [[Wesleyan University]] had already proven its great strength and devotion to ethnomusicology by printing the Newsletter, but McAllester continued to develop the ethnomusicology department throughout his time there.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie C., Wade, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20174447 Fifty Years of SEM in the United States: A Retrospective]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006): 192, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the rise in institutions teaching ethnomusicology courses, Williard Rhodes found that students were able to produce more dissertations that ever before. Rhodes believed that this was because the Newsletter’s Bibliographies and Reviews sections had given students access to material and research that had previously been unavailable to them: “In comparison with the limited ethnomusicological literature in English that appeared during the first half of the present century, the production of books and monographs during the past decade is remarkable in quantity, quality, and range of subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes found that Frank Gillis’ 1962 supplement (Ethnomusicology 6: 191-214) written for Alan Merriam’s 1960 “Annotated Bibliography of Theses and Dissertations in Ethnomusicology and Folk Music Accepted at American Universities” (''Ethnomusicology'' 4: 21-35) showed an increase from 180 to 197 titles nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Governance===

The Society is governed by a Constitution, Board of Directors, Council Members, and stands by its strict Bylaws. There are several standing committees that members can participate, ranging in size from 4-15 members. Some of these committees organize national events, such as the annual conference, while others operate local events, nominations, awarding of prizes, publications, and student concerns.

===Membership===

The Society offers Individual and Institution Memberships, which offer benefits and additional resources not available to the public. Individual membership fees are determined by annual income and academic enrollment (full-time student), but also one-time lifetime memberships are also available. Members receive copies of SEM publications, such as the Newsletter and Journal, gain voting rights, can submit papers for meetings and conferences, can access a members-only section of the website, and receive discounts for certain databases, such as [[JSTOR]].

==Annual Conferences==

The first official SEM meeting was September 2–9, 1956, and since then, the Society of Ethnomusicology has continued to host annual conferences throughout the country and occasionally abroad. Locations for these large-scale gatherings require a host university with a strong ethnomusicology department, hotels that can house the huge number of attendees ranging, which ranges from 800-1000 people, at an affordable price, and has access to air travel. Locations are typical chosen three years in advance by the SEM Board. The conference is then executed by the Program Committee, Local Arrangements Committee, and Business Office. 
 
The Annual Meetings are made up of programs, paper presentations, lectures, banquets, and special events, which include diverse performances, formal concerts, and dances. Video-streaming will be available for several paper presentations. 
 
The 58th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], from November 14–17, hosted by [http://www.iub.edu/ Indiana University Bloomington]. The programs and schedule are available [http://www.indiana.edu/~semhome/2013/index.shtml here].

The 59th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] from November 13–16, 2014. It will be hosted by [http://www.pitt.edu/ The University of Pittsburgh].
 
The 60th Annual Meeting will be in [[Austin, Texas]] from December 3–6, 2015 and will be hosted by [http://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin].

==Publications==

Alongside the '''''Ethnomusicology''''' journal, The Society for Ethnomusicology publishes a variety of works, nearly all of which are peer-reviewed. The SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ website] itself serves as a communicative and archival device, enabling members to discuss the latest news, share project updates, and gives digital access to many of the print publications. The SEM website offers free access to the last fifteen issues of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Journal journal] (currently volumes 43-57 from 1999-2013), the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_StudentNews student newsletter], and on-going lists of [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_JournalOgraphies Ographies], including bibliographies, discographies, and dissertations. Issues of the SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Newsletter Newsletter] are also available from between 2002-2010, volumes 36-44, however, the latest digital copies are only available to members. A full list of SEM’s publications available through the website can be found [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=Publications_Home here].

==Prizes==

SEM awards prizes on national, chapter, and sectional levels. These awards are designed to recognize the work of individuals in the field of ethnomusicology. Awards vary in purpose, financial prize (if any), eligibility, where and how often the prize is awarded, and application deadline.

'''Spontaneous glass breakage''' is a phenomenon by which [[toughened glass]] (or tempered) may spontaneously break without any apparent reason. 
The most common causes are:
:* Minor damage during installation such as nicked or chipped edges later developing into larger breaks normally radiating from point of defect.
:* Binding of the glass in the frame, causing stresses to develop as the glass expands and contracts due to thermal changes or deflects due to wind
:* Internal defects within the glass such as [[nickel sulfide inclusion]]s
:* Thermal stresses in the glass
:* Inadequate glass thickness to resist wind load

== Installation damage ==

While glass is being moved and installed, it is easy for the glaziers to nick or chip the edges of the glass with various tools. It is also possible for fasteners such as nails or screws used to attach glass stops to nick the glass edges if these fasteners are installed at an improper angle. These small nicks or chips may not result in immediate breakage. However, over time, as the glass expands and contracts, stress concentrations can develop around the nick, leading to breakage. In the case of [[tempered glass]] the entire unit usually breaks.

== Binding in the frame ==

Glass expands and contracts with changes in temperature and deflects due to wind, so almost all modern glass is set on resilient blocks at the bottom and with space for expansion at the sides and top. The gaskets holding the glass in the frame are also usually resilient to cushion the glass against wind buffeting. If no space is provided at the perimeter of the unit, the glass will bind against the frame, causing internal stresses to develop in the glass which can exceed the strength of glass, resulting in breakage.

== Internal defects and inclusions in the glass ==

[[Nickel sulfide inclusion]]s ("stones") can be present in the glass. The most common cause of these inclusions is the use of stainless-steel machinery in the glassmaking and handling process. Small shavings of [[stainless steel]] containing [[nickel]] change structure over time and grow, creating internal stresses in the glass. When these stresses exceed the strength of the glass, breakage results. This type of breakage is almost always found in tempered glass and is indicated by a distinctive "figure eight" pattern, with each "loop" of the figure eight approx. 30mm in diameter.

Alternatively, small pieces of refractory brick can be eroded by the molten glass from the internal walls of the furnace during processing and become embedded in the finished glass. These are also known as "stones", and can also break the glass when the glass is heated, as they create thermal anomalies.

== Thermal stresses ==

Breakage due to thermal stress is most common in large pieces of [[sealed insulating glass]] with heavy heat-absorbing (reflective) coatings. The coating is usually applied to the "number two" surface (the inside face of the outside lite). This causes the outside lite of glass to heat up more than the inside lite as the coating converts radiant heat from the Sun into sensible heat. As the outer lite expands due to heating, the entire unit bends outward. If the spacer bar or other edge condition connects the two lites of glass in a very rigid manner, bending stresses can develop which exceed the strength of the glass, causing breakage. This was the cause of extensive glass breakage at the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston.

== Inadequate glass thickness ==

A pane that is too large or thin, having not been properly engineered for wind loads on the site, can be broken by the wind. See [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's Principle]] on wind.

== Remedies ==

Any breakage problem has more severe consequences where the glass is installed overhead or in public areas (such as in high-rise buildings). A [[Safety and security window film|safety window film]] can be applied to the tempered panes of glass to protect from its falling. An old-fashioned precaution was to install metal screens below skylights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10086">'''Static timing analysis''' (STA) is a simulation method of computing the expected timing of a digital circuit without requiring a simulation of the full circuit.

High-performance [[integrated circuit]]s have traditionally been characterized by the [[clock frequency]] at which they operate. Measuring the ability of a circuit to operate at the specified speed requires an ability to measure, during the design process, its delay at numerous steps. Moreover, [[delay calculation]] must be incorporated into the inner loop of timing optimizers at various phases of design, such as [[logic synthesis]], layout ([[Placement (EDA)|placement]] and [[Routing (EDA)|routing]]), and in in-place optimizations performed late in the design cycle. While such timing measurements can theoretically be performed using a rigorous [[SPICE|circuit simulation]], such an approach is liable to be too slow to be practical. Static timing analysis plays a vital role in facilitating the fast and reasonably accurate measurement of circuit timing. The speedup comes from the use of simplified timing models and by mostly ignoring logical interactions in circuits. This has become a mainstay of design over the last few decades.

One of the earliest descriptions of a static timing approach was based on the [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]] (PERT), in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=PERT as an aid to logic design

== Purpose ==
In a [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous digital system]], data is supposed to move in [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]], advancing one stage on each tick of the [[clock signal]]. This is enforced by synchronizing elements such as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] or [[Latch (electronic)|latches]], which copy their input to their output when instructed to do so by the clock. Only two kinds of timing errors are possible in such a system:
*A '''setup time violation''', when a signal arrives too late, and misses the time when it should advance;
*A '''hold time violation''', when an input signal changes too soon after the clock's active transition.

The time when a signal arrives can vary due to many reasons. The input data may vary, the circuit may perform different operations, the temperature and voltage may change, and there are manufacturing differences in the exact construction of each part. The main goal of static timing analysis is to verify that despite these possible variations, all signals will arrive neither too early nor too late, and hence proper circuit operation can be assured.

Since STA is capable of verifying every path, it can detect other problems like [[glitches]], slow paths and [[clock skew]].

* The '''critical path''' is defined as the path between an input and an output with the maximum delay. Once the circuit timing has been computed by one of the techniques listed below, the critical path can easily be found by using a '''traceback method'''.
* The '''arrival time''' of a signal is the time elapsed for a signal to arrive at a certain point. The reference, or time 0.0, is often taken as the [[arrival time]] of a clock signal. To calculate the arrival time, [[delay calculation]] of all the components in the path will be required. Arrival times, and indeed almost all times in timing analysis, are normally kept as a pair of values - the earliest possible time at which a signal can change, and the latest.
* Another useful concept is '''required time'''. This is the latest time at which a signal can arrive without making the clock cycle longer than desired.  The computation of the required time proceeds as follows: at each primary output, the required times for rise/fall are set according to the specifications provided to the circuit. Next, a backward topological traversal is carried out, processing each gate when the required times at all of its fanouts are known.
* The '''slack''' associated with each connection is the difference between the required time and the arrival time. A ''positive slack'' '''s''' at some node implies that the arrival time at that node may be increased by '''s''', without affecting the overall delay of the circuit. Conversely, ''negative slack'' implies that a path is too slow, and the path must be sped up (or the reference signal delayed) if the whole circuit is to work at the desired speed.

==Corners and STA==
Quite often, designers will want to qualify their design across many conditions. Behavior of an electronic circuit is often dependent on various factors in its environment like temperature or local voltage variations. In such a case either STA needs to be performed for more than one such set of conditions, or STA must be prepared to work with a range of possible delays for each component, as opposed to a single value. 

With proper techniques, the patterns of condition variations are characterized and their extremes are recorded. Each extreme condition can be termed as a corner. Let us say, each extreme in cell characteristics as ‘PVT corner’ and net characteristics as ‘extraction corner’. Then each combination pattern of PVT extraction corners is referred to as a ‘timing corner’ as it represents a point where timing will be extreme. If the design works at each extreme condition, then under the assumption of [[monotonic]] behavior, the design is also qualified for all intermediate points.

The use of corners in static timing analysis has several limitations. It may be overly optimistic, since it assumes perfect tracking: if one gate is fast, all gates are assumed fast, or if the voltage is low for one gate, it is also low for all others. Corners may also be overly pessimistic, for the worst case corner may seldom occur. In an IC, for example, it may not be rare to have one metal layer at the thin or thick end of its allowed range, but it would be very rare for all 10 layers to be at the same limit, since they are manufactured independently. Statistical STA, which replaces delays with distributions, and tracking with correlation, offers a more sophisticated approach to the same problem.

==The most prominent techniques for STA ==
In static timing analysis, the word ''static'' alludes to the fact that this timing analysis is carried out in an input-independent manner, and purports to find the worst-case delay of the circuit over all possible input combinations. The computational efficiency (linear in the number of edges in the graph) of such an approach has resulted in its widespread use, even though it has some limitations. A method that is commonly referred to as [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT]] is popularly used in STA. However, PERT is a misnomer, and the so-called PERT method discussed in most of the literature on timing analysis refers to the [[critical path method]] (CPM) that is widely used in project management. While the CPM-based methods are the dominant ones in use today, other methods for traversing circuit graphs, such as [[depth-first search]], have been used by various timing analyzers.

== Interface Timing Analysis ==
Many of the common problems in chip designing are related to interface timing between different components of the design. These can arise because of many factors including incomplete simulation models, lack of test cases to properly verify interface timing, requirements for synchronization, incorrect interface specifications, and lack of designer understanding of a component supplied as a 'black box'. There are specialized CAD tools designed explicitly to analyze interface timing, just as there are specific CAD tools to verify that an implementation of an interface conforms to the functional specification (using techniques such as [[model checking]]).

==Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) ==
[[Statistical static timing analysis]] (SSTA) is a procedure that is becoming increasingly necessary to handle the complexities of process and environmental variations in integrated circuits.

'''''Ut pictura poesis''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase literally meaning "as is [[painting]] so is [[poetry]]". The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, "bonus dormitat Homerus", or "[[Homeric nod|even Homer nods]]" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse):
:Poetry resembles painting. Some works will captivate you when you stand very close to them and others if you are at a greater distance. This one prefers a darker vantage point, that one wants to be seen in the light since it feels no terror before the penetrating judgment of the critic. This pleases only once, that will give pleasure even if we go back to it ten times over. (Quoting from English translation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Horace|last=Golden|first=Leon|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-5540-3|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Gregson|location=Oxford, UK|pages=400|chapter=Reception of Horace's Ars Poetica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, "imaginative texts") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting.

Some centuries before [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides of Keos]]( c. 556 – 468 BC) had stated, "Poema pictura loquens, pictura poema silens," which translates into, "Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/utpict.html.|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. [[Plato]], through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding so disregarded the whole concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up of which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, painting took precedence because sight was higher ranking to people than hearing was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmt.uchicago.edu/gloassary/2004/utpicturapoesis.htm|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] opens his ''[[Laocoön|Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry]]'' (1766){{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} by observing that "the first who compared painting with poetry &amp;#91;[[Simonides of Ceos]]&amp;#93; was a man of fine feeling,"&lt;ref&gt;Simonides, who wrote "poema pictura locguens, pictura poema silens" (poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent [mute] poetry) was quoted by [[Plutarch]], ''De gloria Atheniensium'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0234%3Astephpage%3D346f 3.346f].&lt;/ref&gt; though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated "as two equitable and friendly neighbors."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[W. J. T. Mitchell]] trenchantly observed that "We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a [[metaphor]], while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth."&lt;ref&gt;Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (University of Chicago Press, 1986) page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Pope ==
18th-century British poet [[Alexander Pope]] was partial to ''ut pictura poesis.'' He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and "it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert W.|date=1983-1984|title=Alexander Pope and Ut Pictura Poesis|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSE/article/view/396/365|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=9|pages=61–75|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is note of Pope finding himself "in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"/&gt; ''Ut pictura poesis'' surfaces in regards to Pope's [[The Rape of the Lock|"Rape of the Lock"]] through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay "'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's "Rape of the Lock", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda’s character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: "Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body," and

&lt;blockquote&gt;The belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both her body and her allure in the reader's eye. (Ferguson)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Rebecca|date=1992|title=Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix’d as those’: objectification and seeing in  Pope’s "Rape of the Lock"|url=|journal=Critical Survey|volume=4|pages=14–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.

When U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was in Cairo in June 2009, Hawass gave him personal tours of the sites of ancient Egypt.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At the end of 2009, he was promoted by President [[Hosni Mubarak]] to the post of Vice Minister of Culture.&lt;ref name="vice-minister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/dr-hawass-named-vice-minister-culture-egypt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724162948/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/dr-hawass-named-vice-minister-culture-egypt |archivedate=July 24, 2014 }}{{third-party-inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 protest vandalism===
On January 29, 2011, in the midst of the [[2011 Egyptian protests|Egyptian protests of that year]], Hawass arrived at the [[Egyptian Museum]]  to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged, so police were brought in to secure the museum.&lt;ref name="Joffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Joffe | first = Alex | date = 2011 | title= Arts Link: Egypt's Antiquities Fall Victim to the Mob | format = online | issue = February 1 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703833204576114580200904212 | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | quote = "Subtitle: A definitive answer to the question: Should the Elgin Marbles be returned to Greece?" }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Lawler, reporting for ''Science,'' Hawass "faxed a colleague in Italy that 13 cases were destroyed.

"My heart is broken and my blood is boiling," the U.S.-trained archaeologist lamented." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawass later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects, including two sculptures of Tutankhamun, and took two skulls from a research lab, before being stopped as they left the museum.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor|first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Antiquities Chief Says Sites Are Largely Secure | format = online | issue = February 1 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "A vast majority of Egypt’s museums and archaeological sites are secure and have not been looted, Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s chief antiquities official, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

He also appeared on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' during a segment on the curse of Tutankhamun's tomb. In 2010, Hawass appeared on a reality-based television show on The History Channel called ''[[Chasing Mummies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/chasing-mummies/bios/dr-zahi-hawass |title=History Channel: '&amp;#39;"Chasing Mummies"'&amp;#39; Archaeologist Profile: Dr. Zahi Hawass |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002163155/http://www.history.com/shows/chasing-mummies/bios/dr-zahi-hawass |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of artifacts to Egypt===
Hawass spearheaded a movement to return many prominent unique and/or irregularly taken [[Ancient Egyptian]] artifacts, such as the [[Rosetta Stone]], the [[Nefertiti Bust|bust of Nefertiti]], the [[Dendera zodiac]] ceiling painting from the [[Dendera]] Temple, the [[Ankhhaf (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Ankhhaf]] (the architect of the [[Khafra]] [[Pyramid of Khafre|Pyramid]]), the faces of [[Amenhotep III]]'s [[WV22|tomb]] at the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Luxor Obelisk|Luxor Temple's obelisk]] at the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the statue of [[Hemiunu]], nephew of the Pharaoh Khufu, builder of the largest pyramid, to Egypt from collections in various other countries. In July 2003 the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the [[British Museum]]. Hawass, as Secretary General of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in [[Cairo]], told the press, "If the British want to be remembered, if they want to restore their reputation, they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charlotte Edwardes|author2=Catherine Milner|last-author-amp=yes|title=Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=July 20, 2003|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html|accessdate =August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Huttinger|title = Stolen Treasures: Zahi Hawass wants the Rosetta Stone back, among other things|work=Cairo Magazine|date=July 28, 2005|url=http://www.cairomagazine.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=1238&amp;format=html|accessdate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to antiquities at the British Museum, Hawass said “These are Egyptian monuments. I will make life miserable for anyone who keeps them.” Britain has refused to return them.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-26/egypt-relics-chief-pulls-in-revenue-as-he-fights-for-nefertiti.html|title=Egypt Relics Chief Pulls in Revenue as He Fights for Nefertiti|last=Williams|first=Daniel|date=Jan 27, 2010|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Joffe of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' expressed the opinion that the looting of antiquities during the [[2011 Egyptian protests|2011 civil unrest]] in Egypt made Hawass' quest to return Egyptian antiquities to Egypt "misguided or at least poorly timed."&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt;

===DNA testing of Egyptian mummies===
Hawass has been skeptical of the DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, "From what I understand," he has said, "it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate, we will not use it in our research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530114926/http://www.tutankhamunexhibition.com/tutankhamun-blog/2010/02/17/dna-identifies-tutankhamuns-parents/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, a joint team from [[Waseda University]] in Japan and Cairo's [[Ain Shams University]] tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]], but was denied by the [[Egyptian Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=99437&amp;page=1|title=DNA Tests Halted on King Tut's Mummy|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=January 7, 2006|website=ABC News|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214080708/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of [[Tutankhamun]] and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture.&lt;ref name=RobertsBBC10&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Michelle | date = 2010 | title= 'Malaria and Weak Bones' May Have Killed Tutankhamun | journal = [[BBC News]] | format = online | volume = | issue = February 16 | doi = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8516425.stm | accessdate= 25 January 2016 | quote = "The Egyptian "boy king" Tutankhamun may well have died of malaria after the disease ravaged a body crippled by a rare bone disorder, experts say. / The findings could lay to rest conspiracy theories of murder.

We are sceptical towards this elucidation of the cause of death… and discuss alternative and differential diagnoses, among them, …sickle cell disease and Gauche’s disease." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that [[Ramses III]] had a haplogroup that is associated with the [[Bantu expansion]] and is the most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, [[E1b1a]].&lt;ref name=HawassZinkBMJ12&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hawass, Zahi | author2 = Somaia Ismail | author3 =  Ashraf Selim | author4 =  Sahar N.

Unknown man E also had an unusual mummification procedure.

==Controversies==

===Relationships with other archaeologists===
Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour, forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings, and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because, according to Hawass, they were too amateurish.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | last=Waxman | first=Sharon | date = 2005 | title= Art &amp; Design: The Show-Biz Pharaoh of Egypt's Antiquities | format = online | issue = June 13 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "The King Tut exhibition set to open on June 16 in Los Angeles, bringing the boy king's treasures to the United States for the first time in a quarter-century, is in just about every sense a reflection of Zahi Hawass, the man who made the show possible. / Dr. Hawass, who controls Egypt's vast archaeological trove as secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, is part Indiana Jones, part P.T. Barnum -- intent on dusting off Egypt's holdings through a mix of entertainment, commerce and archaeology." }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few, however, have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics, and when asked about it he indicated that what he does is for the sake of [[Egypt]] and the preservation of its antiquities.&lt;ref name = ParkerNYer09&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Parker, Ian | date = 2009 | title = Letter from Cairo, The Pharaoh: Is Zahi Hawass bad for Egyptology? | format = print, online | issue = November 16 | pages =53–63 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/16/the-pharaoh  | access-date = 25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Jews and Israel===
Hawass has been a long-standing opponent of normalized relations between Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Slap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief: I gave the Zionist enemy a slap in the face |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331133005/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 Hawass wrote in ''[[Al-Sharq Al-Awsat]]'' that "The concept of killing women, children, and elderly people&amp;nbsp;... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine" and that "the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment&amp;nbsp;— so much so that they have become artists in this field."  He explained that he was not referring to the Jews' "[original] faith" but rather "the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.memritv.org/report/en/3213.htm |title=The Middle East Media Research Institute |publisher=Memritv |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009 Hawass stated that "although Jews are few in number, they control the entire world" and commented on the "control they have" of the American economy and the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/04/20/the-jews-secret-weapon-bickering.aspx ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/2049.htm?auth=5bbfe6252b977abf4f8cb54219acbdb |title=MEMRI: Renowned Egyptian Archeologist Zahi Hawass: Jews Control the Entire World |publisher=Memritv.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2049.htm |title=Clip Transcript |publisher=Memritv.org |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs and that he does not believe in a "Jewish conspiracy to control the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129064750/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/clarification-remarks-jewish-history |date=November 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of 2011 protests===
Criticism of Hawass, in Egypt and more broadly, increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. On July 12, 2011, ''The New York Times'' reported on a story on page A1 that Hawass receives an honorarium each year "of as much as $200,000 from [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] to be an explorer-in-residence even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports."&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Kate | date = 2011 | title= Middle East: Revolution Dims Star Power of Egypt's Antiquities Chief | format = print, online | page = A1ff | issue = July 12 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/arts/design/the-showbiz-pharaoh-of-egypts-antiquities.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Until recently Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s antiquities minister, was a global symbol of Egyptian national pride. A famous archaeologist in an Indiana Jones hat, he was virtually unassailable in the old Egypt, protected by his success in boosting tourism, his efforts to reclaim lost artifacts and his closeness to the country’s first lady, Suzanne Mubarak. / But the revolution changed all that. / Now demonstrators in Cairo are calling for his resignation as the interim government faces disaffected crowds in Tahrir Square." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

On April 17, 2011, Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; relating to a contract for the gift shop at the [[Egyptian Museum]] to a company with links to Hawass.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt; The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141720122512511.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief faces jail time - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the National Council of Egypt’s Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the court's original ruling, specifying that he would serve no jail time, and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103163004/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me |date=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the running of the gift shop.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Association with Mubarak===
As its Minister of Antiquities, Hawass has been closely associated with the government of former President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. His resignation as minister on March 3, 2011 and his re-appointment to the Ministry on March 30, 2011 have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubarak's resignation. It has been reported that his re-appointment has angered numerous factions, who have opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=214426|title=Breaking News |work=Jerusalem Post|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Egyptian protests]] resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation, and the upheaval has increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.&lt;ref name="Times-7-14"/&gt;

===Commercial endeavours===
Hawass has lent his name to a line of men's apparel, described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark "back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century"; the clothing was first sold at [[Harrods]] department store in London, in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Kate | date = 2011 | title= Art &amp; Design: Using History to Sell Clothes? Don’t Try It With the Pharaohs | format = online | issue = April 18 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/arts/design/egyptian-antiquities-official-defends-fashion-line.html | accessdate= 25 January 2016 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | quote = "Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s longtime chief antiquities official, has been criticized in recent months for many things: his closeness to former President Hosni Mubarak, some inconsistent reports on the safety of archaeological sites during the uprising and for his role in a dispute over an Egyptian museum bookstore, for which he now possibly faces jail time. / But the source of the latest controversy to beset Mr. Hawass resembles something straight from the mouth of J. Peterman, the character on 'Seinfeld' based on the clothing catalog retailer of the same name. / Mr. Hawass has lent his name to a men’s wear brand: a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark 'back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century.' "}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history, and objected to their understanding that "models had sat on or scuffed priceless ancient artifacts during the photo shoot," an accusation that was denied by Hawass and the clothing manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt; Hawass already sells a line of Stetson hats reproducing the ones he wears, which "very much resemble" the ones worn by [[Harrison Ford]] in the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' movies.&lt;ref name="Taylor2"/&gt;
