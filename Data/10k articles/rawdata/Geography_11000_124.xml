The '''5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA''' is a [[Canadian Army]] Reserve [[artillery]] regiment based at the [[Bay Street Armoury]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. It is part of the [[3rd Canadian Division]]'s [[39 Canadian Brigade Group]]. Although having served for nearly sixty years as a field artillery unit, the early history of the regiment is inextricably intertwined with the defences of the naval base at Esquimalt. The regiment is currently equipped with [http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/weapons/c3-105mm-howitzer.page  C3 towed 105mm gun-howitzers].

The [[5th (BC) Artillery Regiment Museum|regiment's museum]] is located in the Bay Street Armoury and is open to the public on Tuesday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site|url=http://www.5thartilleryregiment.ca/|publisher=5th (BC) Artillery Regiment Museum|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Abruzzi e Molise in Italy.svg|thumb]]
'''Abruzzi e Molise''' (known as ''Abruzzi'' when part of the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]]) was formerly one of the [[regions of Italy]] encompassing a total of {{convert|16600|km2|abbr=on}} and including [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]] and Circondario di Cittaducale (presently a part of Lazio).

== History ==
From the time of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], this region was considered a single entity with the regional capital at [[L'Aquila]]. At this time, the region was further divided into four provinces: Abruzzo Ultra I, Abruzzo Ultra II, Abruzzo Citra, and Molise.

In 1852, the [[Papal States]] annexed [[Ancarano]], then further changes occurred during the formation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] including the annexation of [[Venafro]] and adjustments of the border with [[Campania]].

In 1927 an additional adjustment was made when the [[Cittaducale]] was assigned to [[Rieti]].

== Transformation into separate regions==
In 1963, the province of [[Province of Campobasso|Campobasso]] was split from the region to form [[Molise]], with the remaining four provinces, [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] and [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], comprising the present day [[Abruzzo]].

The '''Avenue of the Baobabs''' or '''Alley of the Baobabs''' is a prominent group of [[baobab]] (''[[Adansonia grandidieri]]'') trees lining the dirt road between [[Morondava]] and [[Belon'i Tsiribihina]] in the [[Menabe]] region of western [[Madagascar]]. Its striking landscape draws travelers from around the world, making it one of the most visited locations in the region. It has been a center of local conservation efforts, and was granted temporary protected status in July 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests—the first step toward making it Madagascar's first [[natural monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allée des Baobabs: Un site classé aire protégée |author= |publisher=''Madagascar Tribune'' |date=2007-08-01 |url=http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Un-site-classe-aire-protegee,1372.html |accessdate=2008-03-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the Avenue, over some 2633 metres, are 200-250 grandidieri trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Af/Madagascar/Menabe/AvenueofBaobabs.htm|title= Avenue of the Baobabs|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 30 metres in height, [[endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar.&lt;ref name=geographical&gt;{{cite journal|title=The land of the giants |authorlink=Helen Scales |last=Scales |first=Helen |date= |journal=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]] |volume= |issue=March 2007 |url=http://www.geographical.co.uk/Magazine/Baobabs_-_Mar_2007.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220036/http://www.geographical.co.uk/Magazine/Baobabs_-_Mar_2007.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another 20–25 trees of this species grow in nearby rice paddies and meadows.

Baobab trees, up to 2800 years old, known locally as ''renala'' ([[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] for "monkey of the forest"), are a legacy of the dense tropical forests that once thrived on Madagascar. The trees did not originally tower in isolation over the [[sere (ecology)|sere]] landscape of scrub but stood in dense forest. Over the years, as the country's population grew, the forests were cleared for agriculture, leaving only the baobab trees, which the locals preserved as much for their own sake as for their value as a food source and building material.&lt;ref name="geographical" /&gt;

The area is not a national park, and the trees are threatened by further deforestation, effluent from encroaching [[rice paddies]] and [[sugarcane]] plantations, and bush and forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madagascar's baobab avenue gains monumental status |author= |publisher=Deutsche Presse-Agentur |date=2007-08-14 |url=http://lifestyle.monstersandcritics.com/travel/news/article_1342760.php/Madagascars_baobab_avenue_gains_monumental_status |accessdate=2008-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226114304/http://lifestyle.monstersandcritics.com/travel/news/article_1342760.php/Madagascars_baobab_avenue_gains_monumental_status |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its popularity as a tourist destination, the area has no visitor center or gate fees, and local residents receive little income from tourism. [[Conservation International]] in partnership with Fanamby, a Malagasy NGO, has launched an [[ecotourism]] project aimed at conservation of the area and economic improvement for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baobab band-aid |author=Nicole Johnston |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian Online]]'' |date=2007-08-15 |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=316545&amp;area=/insight/monitor/ |accessdate=2008-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006095000/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?area=%2Finsight%2Fmonitor%2F&amp;articleId=316545 |archivedate=2007-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 7 km to the northwest are the famous Baobab Amoureux, which are two ''[[Adansonia za]]'' trees twisted together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Af/Madagascar/Menabe/BaobabAmoreux.htm|title= Baobab Amoureux - baobabs in love|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend these two loving baobabs came and grew together across the centuries. Baobabs found themselves after an impossible love between a young man and young woman of the nearby village. Both youths already had designated partners and had to marry separately in their respective villages. However, the impossible couple dreamed of a life and child together and asked the help of their god. Both baobabs were born and now live there for eternity as one as the couple always wished.

In [[West Africa]], the '''Dahomey Gap''' refers to the portion of the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] that extends all the way to the coast in [[Benin]], [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]], thus separating the [[forest zone]] that covers much of the south of the region into two separate parts. The forest region west of the gap is called the [[Upper Guinean forests]] or Guinean forest zone, and the portion east of the gap is called the [[Lower Guinean forests]], Lower Guinean-Congolian forests, or Congolian Forest Zone.

The major city in the Gap is [[Accra]]. Several other cities, such as [[Kumasi]], exist on the fringe of the Gap.

==Causes of dryness==
The dryness of the Dahomey Gap is unusual, given that it lies surrounded by a very wet [[monsoon]] belt on all sides, and no mountains block moisture. Yet, Accra in the heart of the Gap receives only 720 millimetres (28&amp;nbsp;inches) of rainfall per year — less than half the amount needed to sustain tropical rainforest (which would be expected at a latitude of 6°&amp;nbsp;N).

The cause of the dryness of the Dahomey Gap can simply be explained thus:

* In northern winter, high pressure centred on the [[Sahara]] sends dry northeasterly [[trade winds]] over West Africa, creating a general dry season, including over the Gap.
* In northern summer, an enormous low pressure system known as the ''[[monsoon]]'' forms over the huge Africa-Asia-Europe landmass. Centred over approximately [[Rajasthan]] and prevented by the huge barrier of the [[Himalaya]]s from moving further west, it extends a strong trough over West Africa. This trough sends warm and saturated westerly winds over West Africa, creating a wet season peaking in June on the coast (as the trough moves north) and in August inland.
* The coast in the region of the highest rainfall ([[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]]) slopes from southeast to northwest. This [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] means that the moist westerlies are forced to shed enormous quantities of moisture, allowing rainforest to thrive despite a distinct [[dry season]].
* In the Dahomey Gap, however, the coast slopes in such a way (northeast to southwest) that the rain-bearing westerlies flow [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the coast. This means they are not forced to give up nearly so much moisture, and thus the climate is much drier, with only a brief rainy season in May and June. Consequently, an open [[savanna]] prevails adapted to the moderate rainfall and high [[evaporation]] in the hot temperatures.

==Geological history==
Evidence from biogeography suggests that the Dahomey Gap has had significance for up to 90 million years. Murphy and Collier, in their analysis of the [[Aplocheilidae|Aplocheiloid]] fishes show a split in the African species which they attribute to the presence of an [[Inland sea (geology)|epicontinental sea]] between the late [[Cenomanian]] and early [[Eocene]].

&lt;/ref&gt; This discontinuity had earlier been noted in plant species by White&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|last=White|first= F. |title=The vegetation of Africa. A descriptive memoir to accompany the Unesco/AETFAT/UNSO vegetation map of Africa. |publisher=Paris: Unesco;|year= 1983 }}

The Dahomey Gap has existed in its present form for only about four thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first=William |last=Weber |title=African Rain Forest Ecology and Conservation: An Interdisciplinary Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNwfN5ASigUC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-08433-7 |page=75}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the [[Quaternary]], dry conditions due to a much colder [[Atlantic Ocean]] (aided by extensive cold currents from ice sheets in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]) have meant that the present-day forest zone has supported very little or no rainforest. In [[interglacial]] periods, however, rainfall throughout West Africa has often been so heavy that the Gap has become wet enough to support rainforest, thus eliminating the savanna.

'''Ellsworth Huntington''' (September 16, 1876 – October 17, 1947) was a professor of [[geography]] at [[Yale University]] during the early 20th century, known for his studies on [[environmental determinism]]/climatic determinism, [[economic growth]] and [[economic geography]]. He served as President of the Ecological Society of America in 1917, the Association of American Geographers in 1923 and President of the Board of Directors of the [[American Eugenics Society]] from 1934 to 1938.

He taught at [[Euphrates College]], [[Turkey]] (1897&amp;ndash;1901); accompanied the [[Raphael Pumpelly|Pumpelly]] (1903) and Barrett (1905&amp;ndash;1906) expeditions to [[central Asia]]; and wrote of his Asian experiences in ''Explorations in Turkestan'' (1905) and ''The Pulse of Asia'' (1907). He taught geography at Yale (1907&amp;ndash;1915) and from 1917 was a research associate there, devoting his time chiefly to [[climatology|climatic]] and [[anthropogeography|anthropogeographic]] studies. He was the 1916 recipient of the Elisha Kent Kane Gold Medal from the [[Geographical Society of Philadelphia]].

In 1909, Huntington led the Yale Expedition to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was his mission to determine "step by step the process by which geologic structure, topographic form, and the present and past nature of the climate have shaped man's progress, moulded his history; and thus played an incalculable part in the development of a system of thought which could scarcely have arisen under any other physical circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.yale.edu/judaica/exhibits/webarch/front/Huntingtoncollection.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511234941/http://www.library.yale.edu/judaica/exhibits/webarch/front/Huntingtoncollection.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on the original standing committee of the [[Foundation for the Study of Cycles]] from 1941.

'''Dame Evelyn Mary Stokes''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|DNZM}} (née '''Dinsdale''', 5 December 1936 – 15 August 2005) was a professor of [[geography]] at the [[University of Waikato]] in [[New Zealand]] and a member of the New Zealand government's [[Waitangi Tribunal]]. Throughout her life she worked for recognition of marginalised groups including women and [[Māori people|Māori]], and she published extensively on New Zealand [[historical geography]] and on Māori land issues.&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{citation|title=Obituary: Stokes, Dame Evelyn Mary|publisher=Canterbury Magazine|date=December 2005|page=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Evelyn Mary Dinsdale was born in [[Tauranga]], [[New Zealand]], on 5 December 1936. She was educated at Tauranga Primary School and Tauranga College, where she was one of the first non-Māori to join the local [[kapa haka]] group.&lt;ref name="rigby"&gt;{{citation|title=Tribute to Dame Evelyn Stokes|last=Rigby|first=Barry|date=August 2005|publisher=Waitangi Tribunal}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She then went to [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]], earning a master's degree with first class honours in geography in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Author's biography from ''A History of Tauranga County''.&lt;/ref&gt; After earning this degree, she took a postgraduate teacher training course from Christchurch Teachers' College and taught briefly at [[Te Kuiti]] high school, fulfilling the requirements of the post primary teachers' bursary that had funded her education.

Dinsdale was awarded a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Travel Grant]] and a Smith-Mundt Grant from the United States government in 1960, freeing her to travel to [[Syracuse University]], where she received her PhD in 1963 under the supervision of [[D. W. Meinig|Donald Meinig]].&lt;ref name="b01"&gt;{{citation|title=Dame Evelyn Stokes: distinguished New Zealand geographer|last=Bedford|first=Richard|editor1-last=Bedford|editor1-first=R.|editor2-last=Longhurst|editor2-first=R.|department=Honouring New Zealand's geographers|journal=New Zealand Geographer|volume=57|issue=2|pages=1–5|year=2001|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2001.tb01603.x|url=http://www.nzgs.co.nz/download/Oration_Stokes.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014075857/http://www.nzgs.co.nz/download/Oration_Stokes.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}. Reprinted in ''Datum: Newsletter of the New Zealand Map Society'', no. 23, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{citation|last=Stokes|first=Evelyn|title=Evelyn's Letters from America|publisher=University of Waikato|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While in America, she demonstrated [[Poi (juggling)|long poi swinging]] on television.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby (2005) states that she appeared on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], but her letters from the time (''Evelyn's Letters from America'', p. 181) only mention a local television show hosted by Phil Markert, and there is no other record of an Ed Sullivan appearance.&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after her return to New Zealand, in 1964, she married Brian Stokes, changing her name to Evelyn Stokes; they had two children, Donald and Philip. Although Evelyn and Brian Stokes later divorced, Dr. Stokes continued to use her married name professionally for the rest of her career.

Stokes was appointed to a lecturership with the [[Auckland University]], and taught for a year for their Waikato branch before becoming a member of the geography department at Waikato University when that university was founded in 1964.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt; At Waikato, she worked hard to promote Māori studies and to integrate local Māori communities into the university's activities,&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cant | first = Garth | title = Windows into the work of a geographical educator: Evelyn Stokes from the University of Waikato | journal = New Zealand Geographer | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | year = 2005 | pages = 89–91 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00030.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and she continued to serve as a faculty member for nearly 41 years, the longest tenure among the Waikato staff.&lt;ref name="b05"&gt;{{citation|last=Bedford|first=Richard|year=2005|title=Obituary – Evelyn Mary Stokes (nee Dinsdale) DNZM, MA (NZ), PhD (Syr) 5 December 1936–11 August 2005|journal=New Zealand Geographer|volume=61|issue=3|pages=242–249|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00040.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 she was promoted to Senior Lecturer, and in 1975 to Reader.&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; In the early 1970s, unusually for geography departments in New Zealand, the department at Waikato split into two, with physical geography moving to the Department of Earth Sciences; Stokes remained with the renamed Department of Human Geography and Environmental Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;{{citation|title=Editorial: Evelyn Stokes and Geography at the University of Waikato|journal=New Zealand Geographer|volume=61|issue=2|year=2005|pages=87–88|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00028.x|author=Bedford, Richard|last2=Longhurst|first2=Robyn}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Johnson | first = Louise | title = Stoking the fires of enquiry – Evelyn Stokes’ contribution to Waikato and New Zealand geography, 1988–90 | journal = New Zealand Geographer | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | year = 2005 | pages = 92–93 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00031.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; recalls her as "a wise but stroppy woman, someone who would have no truck with fools but who opened her heart, her mind and her home to those whose intellect and politics she respected", and she was known as the "kuia" (a Māori word for a wise old woman) of the geography department.&lt;ref name="b05"/&gt;

==Academic work==
Stokes was founding editor of the ''New Zealand Journal of Geography'', which she formed from what was previously a pamphlet, the ''New Zealand Geographical Society Record'', and for 10 years she served as its editor.&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{citation|title=Dame Evelyn devoted her life to public service|last=Henshaw|first=Gail|journal=Hamilton Press|date=17 August 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two major areas of Stokes' academic publication were on the history of the Tauranga area of New Zealand and of the Māori. She edited ''Te Raupatu o Tauranga Moana'', a collection of written works related to the Tauranga area, her Masters thesis work was on settlements in the Tauranga area, and in 1980 she published a book on the history of Tauranga County which Bedford calls "the definitive history" of the area and for which she received the J. M. Sherrard "Major Award" in regional history.&lt;ref name="b05"/&gt; Māori resource use more generally was the subject of over 30 of her papers.&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;

Another of Stokes' many interests was geography education at the secondary school level. She published a series of 20 papers aimed at the curricular needs for this level in both the ''New Zealand Journal of Geography'' and the ''New Zealand Geographer'', and served from 1976 to 1987 as a member of New Zealand's National Geography Curriculum Committee.&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;

An early experience that shaped Stokes' [[feminism|feminist]] views was her service as a high school teacher, for which she was paid £100 less per year than men with equivalent levels of experience due to her gender.&lt;ref name="letters"/&gt;
With Anne Magee, Stokes helped establish gender studies and feminist studies at the University of Waikato in the late 1970s,&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; and from an early date she pushed for feminist perspectives in geography.&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt; In 1987 Stokes and four colleagues published a "collective statement" on feminist geography in the ''New Zealand Geographer''; Longhurst and Johnston provide a retrospective look at her work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Longhurst|first1=Robyn|last2=Johnston|first2=Lynda|title=Changing bodies, spaces, places and politics: Feminist geography at the University of Waikato|journal=New Zealand Geographer|volume=61|issue=2|year=2005|pages=94–101|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00023.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stokes also played an important part in building up the map collection of the University of Waikato:&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt; in 1964 she and [[Michael Selby]] transferred the New Zealand Geographic Society's collection to Waikato, she was the society's map librarian from 1966 to 1983,&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; and she frequently added to the library with purchases from her travels abroad.&lt;ref name="robson"&gt;{{citation|title=Obituaries|journal=Datum: Newsletter of the New Zealand Map Society|last=Robson|first=John|volume=23|date=November 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Robson&lt;ref name="robson"/&gt; writes that "without her Waikato may never have had a Map Library or, at least, it would have been only a much poorer one", and Bedford&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; adds that "her passion for maps has kept a tradition of cartography very much alive for almost 40 years in Waikato's Geography Department". Bedford also states that "her publications are renowned for the meticulous and innovative cartography", and that her skills in this area were put to good use in her service on the editorial committee for the ''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' (1991–1997).

==Public service==
In Stokes' capacity as a member of the [[Ngāti Tahu]] Tribal Trust (on which she served from 1980 to 1991) she helped negotiate a major lease of Māori land for the Ohaaki [[geothermal power]] plant, a change from previous practices in which the land ownership was transferred to the government.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ohaaki: A Power Station on Maori Land|journal=Te Matahauariki Newsletter|volume=8|date=September 2004|url=http://lianz.waikato.ac.nz/PAPERS/NEWSLETTER/Newsletter8revised.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked closely with two other
Māori tribes, the [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa]] and the [[Ngāti Hauā]], whose chief Wiremu Tamihana was the subject of a major biography published by Stokes.&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt;

For nearly 16 years, Stokes served as a member of the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], the New Zealand government commission that adjudicates Māori land claims with respect to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt; Stokes' research on the history of Tauranga County related closely to her work on an important tribunal case on the confiscation of land in the Tauranga area,&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;
and her experience with the Ngāti Tahu and Ngāti Tūwharetoa helped guide her work with the Waitangi Tribunal on other cases involving geothermal resources.&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; As part of the Waitangi Tribunal, Stokes worked on major reports on Pouakani, Muriwhenua, Te Maunga railways, [[Turangi#Treaty settlement|Turangi township]], Mohaka ki Ahuriri, Kaipara, and Hauraki, taking an important role in drafting the reports on these cases.&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt;

Stokes served as well for many years on the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]], the body charged with assigning official place names in New Zealand.

In 1990, the University of Waikato awarded Stokes a personal chair "in recognition of her outstanding contribution to research and teaching".&lt;ref name="memlec"/&gt; In the same year she was also awarded the [[New Zealand Honours Order of Precedence#Jubilee, Coronation and New Zealand Commemoration medals|New Zealand Commemoration Medal]].&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt; In 1999, the New Zealand government made her Dame Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] "for services to tertiary education and Māori;” she was the last woman in New Zealand to be made a dame before that title was replaced by "distinguished companion" in 2001.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

In 2001 the New Zealand Geographical Society honoured her with the Distinguished New Zealand Geographer Medal and with life membership in the society;&lt;ref name="b01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Life Members|publisher=New Zealand Geographical Society|url=http://www.nzgs.co.nz/LifeMembers.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004064330/http://www.nzgs.co.nz/LifeMembers.aspx|archivedate=4 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she was the second academic to be so honoured.&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt; At that time, Garth Cant remarked that "no one within geography has made a more substantial and sustained contribution to the wholeness and wellbeing of this nation we call Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s than Dame Evelyn Stokes".&lt;ref name="b05"/&gt;

A special issue of ''New Zealand Geographer'' (volume 61, issue 2, August 2005) was devoted to "Evelyn Stokes and Geography at the University of Waikato". Although the articles in it were written prior to Stokes' death, it was not published until soon after her death.&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=News from Around the World|journal=Newsletter of the International Geographical Union Commission on Gender and Geography|volume=35|date=November 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On her death, Stokes was honoured with a tangi, a formal three-day Māori funeral ceremony, on Te Kohinga Mārama marai.&lt;ref name="b05"/&gt;

In 2006, the University of Waikato inaugurated a lecture series and doctoral scholarship in Stokes' memory. The first lecture in the series, by Malcolm McKinnon, president of the Professional Historians' Association of New Zealand / Aotearoa, was entitled "Mapping the Past: Evelyn Stokes and the History of Aotearoa".&lt;ref name="memlec"/&gt;

Stokes Peak, a mountain in the [[Kaimai Ranges]] directly above the [[Kaimai Tunnel]] near Tauranga, was named in her honour in 2010 by the New Zealand Geographic Board; however the name was discontinued in 2012 after objections from the Ngāti Hinerangi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/consultation-decisions/a-to-z/stokes-peak/index.aspx Stokes Peak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522170301/http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/consultation-decisions/a-to-z/stokes-peak/index.aspx |date=22 May 2010 }}, [[Land Information New Zealand]], retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] 10-4''' standard, ''Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions'', was a list of two-letter country codes that were used by the U.S. Government for geographical data processing in many publications, such as the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]. The standard was also known as [[DAFIF]] 0413 ed 7 Amdt. No. 3 (November 2003) and as DIA 65-18 ([[Defense Intelligence Agency]], 1994, "Geopolitical Data Elements and Related Features"). 

The FIPS 10-4 codes are similar to (but sometimes incompatible with) the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] [[country code]]s. The standard also includes codes for the top-level subdivision of the countries, similar to but usually incompatible with the [[ISO 3166-2]] standard.

On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] as a Federal Information Processing Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, September 2, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 170), page 51276&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] has discontinued maintenance of FIPS 10-4 as of 31 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NGA: GNS Country Codes|url = http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/countrycodes.html|website = geonames.nga.mil|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/|title = Geopolitical Codes (Formerly FIPS PUB 10-4)|publisher = National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIPS 10-4 codes have been replaced with a list called "Geopolitical Entities and Codes".&lt;ref name="CIAWorldFactbook"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-d.html CIA World Factbook.

The territory of '''Franciacorta''' is a section of the [[Province of Brescia]] in the Italian Region of [[Lombardy]]. Franciacorta extends from Mount Orfano (south of [[Rovato]]) on the southwest area to the shores of [[Lake Iseo]], and from the river [[Oglio]] on the western border to the city of [[Brescia]] in the east. The geography of rolling hills was shaped by glacial action. The soil, [[Moraine|glacial moraines]] consisting of gravel and sand over limestone, drains well, and is ideal for the cultivation of grapes and winemaking. The weather is mild and constant due to its location south of the foothills of the [[Alps]] and the tempering presence of large lakes. To publicize [[enotourism]] the district established a ''Strada del Vino Franciacorta'' on the model of the famed [[German Wine Route]] (''Weinstraße'') in 2001.

The area has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times, with archaeological records left by [[Gaul]]s&amp;mdash; the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]] of ''Brixia'' (modern [[Brescia]]), Romans and [[Lombards]]. The name Franciacorta, attested in 1277, is thought to derive from ''curtes francae'', the fortified courts of the Frankish empire established in the 8th century.

[[Rodengo Saiano|Rodengo]] is home to a [[Cluniac]] foundation, the [[Abbey of St. Nicholas]], which has been inhabited by [[Olivetan]] monks since 1446. Other places of interest include [[Passirano]], with a castle, and [[Provaglio d'Iseo]], with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church.

Among the most respected [[Franciacorta wine|wine]] producers of Franciacorta [[sparkling wine|sparkling]] and still wines in the region are [[Berlucchi]], [[Bellavista (vineyard)|Bellavista]] and [[Ca' del Bosco]].  Others include Mosnel, Muratori, Lantieri, Majolini, Ferghettina and Cavalleri.

'''GEFEK''', the Association for the Promotion of Independent Disease Control in Developing Countries ("'''G'''esellschaft zur '''F'''örderung '''E'''igenständiger '''K'''rankheitsbekämpfung in Entwicklungsländern") was created by scientists of the [[University of Giessen]], [[Germany]], in 2004 and is officially registered as a [[non-profit organisation]]. The association aims at promoting the exchange of medical knowledge and [[biomedical]] technology between industry nations and countries with a low health standard, such as [[Mongolia]], [[Panama]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Yemen]].

[[Infectious diseases]] are worldwide a major cause of death, especially in [[developing countries]]. Next to inexpensive drugs, there is an urgent need for affordable diagnostic methods. Recent progress in biomedical research led to new techniques highly appropriate for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. These new methods are advantageous not only because they lead to results in short time, but also because they are affordable and applicable under conditions of poverty. Major objective of GEFEK is the transfer of this knowledge to scientists in low-income countries and to establish the new technology in a way that it can be performed without help from abroad. The transfer includes information on the theoretical background, the performance of molecular diagnostic methods and the knowledge for the production of the necessary test substances. The self-contained operation of this technology by the affected population is the best guarantee for their sustainable application.

In contrast to other organisations, which provide help directly in crisis regions, the contribution of GEFEK consists in the transfer of basic medical knowledge and technology, in order to help the people in poor countries according to the principle "help to self-help". A lot of health problems are not due in the first instance to a lack of medicines, but rather to the lack of appropriate methods for the diagnosis of the affecting diseases. Frequently, there are no adequate diagnostic methods available which could be used, or the available methods are inaffordable, this means, considerably more expensive than the needed drugs. GEFEK not only teaches physicians and technical personal but also the new scientific generation, i.e. students in medicine and other health-related disciplines.

==Mongolia==

Members of GEFEK are cooperating with doctors from the Health Science University of Mongolia in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. The objective of the common efforts is a countrywide evaluation of the distribution of most important infectious diseases, to enable specific control measures against these major causes of morbidity in the population. Within this cooperation and thanks to private donations, a laboratory in Ulaanbaatar was completely equipped with apparatuses needed for adequate performance of molecular diagnosis. Members of GEFEK were there repeatedly (2004 and 2005) to install the technology and to train Mongolian scientists. In this laboratory it is meanwhile possible to diagnose all important [[sexually transmitted diseases]], [[tuberculosis]], [[brucellosis]], several respiratory pathogens and several diarrhoeal diseases. All these methods are specially designed to be used under limited technical and economical conditions. In the long term it is planned to enable Mongolian scientists to produce all substances needed for the continuation of the diagnosis themselves, such as recombinant diagnostic antigens, or [[Taq polymerase]]. In the future, this may make the country independent from help from abroad.

==Bolivia==

The population of [[Bolivia]] suffers from a multiplicity of infectious diseases, such as [[Chagas disease]]. Because of its inapparent symptoms, the disease remains unrecognised most of the time and, untreated, leads after about 20 years to death, mainly due to heart pathologies. It is probably one of the major reasons for the extreme low average age of the population of 34 years only. Further prevalent existing diseases are [[malaria]] and, especially among young children, life-threatening diarrhoeal diseases, caused by [[entamoeba]], [[bacteria]] or [[rotavirus]]. [[Tuberculosis]], [[dengue fever]] and different forms of [[hepatitis]] are also wide spread. The diagnostic methods developed by GEFEK can be very useful for the fight against Chagas disease. A cooperation has been arranged with the national Chagas disease control initiative at the Universidad Mayor de San Simón, in [[Cochabamba]].

==Panama==

In July 2006, a one-week practical course was organised at the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí in [[David, Chiriquí|David]], [[Panama]]. About 20 students and 3 professors participated in the course. Although Panama belongs to the richest countries in [[Central America]], the general medical care – except of [[Panama City]] - is not well developed. Many infectious diseases are common, which are neither correctly diagnosed nor treated.

'''General Land Office Easements''' (also known as "government land office easements," and "GLO easements") were legal mechanisms which created [[right of way]] to ensure future access through, and to the interior of, lots or parcels created by the U.S. Small Tract Act of 1938, (52 Stat. 609, amended 1948, 62 Stat. 476; Not to be confused with the much later "Small Tracts Act" of 2002 which is applicable to handling and disposal of National Forest lands by the [[US Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sale of Forest Service Lands|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/land/staff/disposal.shtml|website=US Forest Service|publisher=US Forest Service|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Forests Small Tracts Act was amended in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small Tracts Reform Act|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-109hrpt169/html/CRPT-109hrpt169-pt1.htm|website=US Government Printing Office|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Forest Small Tracts Act Amendments Act of 2015 (H.R. 1214)|url=http://naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398879|website=House Committee on Natural Resources|publisher=US House of Representatives|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Lou Bellisi of [http://www.publicland.org/ PublicLands.org] writes:

{{quote|text=The Small Tract Act of 1938 was enacted in response to requests by primarily World War I Servicemen who wanted to move out in the desert for health and recreational purposes. Subsequently, after World War II, Southern Californians began looking for small acreages in the desert to get away from the smog and burgeoning population centers. The Small Tract Act was about the only method of making federal land available. Local counties were enthusiastic about "getting lands on the tax rolls", and were not concerned about infrastructure (roads, water, power, schools) to support such development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lou|first1=Bellisi|title=BLM and the Small Tract Act in the Southern California Desert - A Brief History|url=http://www.publicland.org/35_archives/documents/doc_1306_bellesi.html|website=PublicLand.org|publisher=Public Lands Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Small tract [[land patent]]s were granted by the [[General Land Office]] (which merged with the [[United States Grazing Service]] in 1946 to form the US [[Bureau of Land Management]]). These patents transferred property owned by the U.S. government to private ownership.

Like the [[Homestead Acts]] before it, the Small Tract Act created many problems. Among them were, according to Bellisi, the

{{quote|text=Failure to reserve proper road right-of-ways (ROW). In some cases no ROW's were set aside in classification orders, and in such cases reserves were made around the perimeter of each individual tract. This restricted the use of the entire tract when in reality only one side needed to be encumbered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lou|first1=Bellisi|title=BLM and the Small Tract Act in the Southern California Desert - A Brief History|url=http://www.publicland.org/35_archives/documents/doc_1306_bellesi.html|website=PublicLand.org|publisher=Public Lands Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As private owners of tracts patented to them by the GLO have subdivided and developed parcels of land, GLO easements continue to create controversy. For example, a recent application to develop land for a charter school in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] sought abandonment by the City of Scottsdale of its municipal interests in a GLO easement through the subject property (which is done without referencing any adjacent property owners' purported rights to the easement). The developer threatened to sue the city if the abandonment was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thornton|first1=Terrance|title=Abandonment anxiety clouds BASIS Scottsdale expansion|url=http://www.scottsdaleindependent.com/news/abandonment-anxiety-clouds-basis-scottsdale-expansion/|website=Scottsdale Independent|publisher=Independent News Media|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous GLO easement-related controversies have erupted between adjoining private landowners; and between private landowners and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bentley|first1=Linda|title=Council acts to avoid litigation|url=http://www.sonorannews.com/archives/2015/150603/news-litigation.html|website=Sonoran News|publisher=Sonoran News|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Scottsdale has stated its position on these issues in many GLO easement abandonment actions by the City Council:

{{quote|text=General Land Office Patent Easements (general information)
{{bulleted list |Within the city of Scottsdale there are General Land Office (GLO) lots or parcels of various sizes created by the Federal Small Tract Act. This act was passed in 1938 and repealed in 1976. 
|Most GLO lots were patented with 33 foot (or sometimes 50 foot) roadway and public utility easements typically "as near as practical to the exterior boundaries."
|The city has viewed these patent roadway and utility easements as assured access at least until a local circulation plan is established.
|As GLO lots come in for development (i.e., lot splits, subdivisions or requesting building permits) staff requires city right-of-way dedications per city circulation plans. The city's transportation plan establishes a street system to replace the grid pattern created by the GLO easements.
|Any patent easements in excess of the current requirements to the circulation plans (including trails), roadway standards, and not required to insure access to any other lot, may be requested to be abandoned.
|On 1981, City Ordinance 1386 was adopted delegating the authority for the release of GLO easements to the Engineering Services Director.
|On March 2, 1999, the City Council repealed Ordinance 1386 and adopted Ordinance 3219 which requires the abandonment of GLO patent roadway easements to go through the same public hearing process currently used for all rights-of-way, alley's and roadway easements. The City Attorney's office has concluded that this process for consideration of GLO roadway abandonment satisfies legal requirements.
|On August 12, 2005, Arizona Revised Statute section 9-500.4 became effective. This section gives the local municipality the right to abandon GLO patent easements, and concurs with the city's position on abandonment of GLO patent easements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Council Report, Gardener Abandonment|url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset52475.aspx|website=ScottsdaleAZ.gov|publisher=City of Scottsdale|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

The City of Scottsdale does not appear to have a position or policy on the monetary value of its interests in these easements, or the abandonment thereof.

[[Pima County, Arizona]] has a policy that includes:

{{quote|text=Pursuant to United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management Instruction Memorandum No. 91-196 and common law applications, it shall be the policy of Pima County to recognize all reservations for road and utility easements contained in the U.S. Patents to be public rights of way. As public rights of way, Pima County may establish county roadways within the easements as provided for in A.R.S. § 28-6701,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing, altering or abandoning local highway|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/28/06701.htm|website=azleg.state.az.us|publisher=Arizona State Legislature|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; vacate and abandon the easements as public rights of way under A.R.S. § 28-7201 [This section references definitions only, Pima County Policy may have intended to reference all sections under Article 8],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/28/07201.htm&amp;Title=28&amp;DocType=ARS|website=azleg.state.az.us|publisher=Arizona State Legislature|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and license, regulate and administer as public rights of way pursuant to A.R.S. § 11-251&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powers of board|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/11/00251.htm&amp;Title=11&amp;DocType=ARS|website=azleg.gov|publisher=Arizona State Legislature|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its authority as a political subdivision of the State of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small Tract Easements by Patent Reservation (Veteran Tracts Roads)|url=https://webcms.pima.gov/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6/File/Government/Clerk%20of%20the%20Board/Policies/F54-7.pdf|website=webcms.pima.gov|publisher=Pima County Arizona|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scottsdale resident, property owner, and GLO easement activist Leon Spiro has frequently lectured the Scottsdale city council and state agencies in opposition to abandonment of GLO easements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabrielson|first1=Ryan|title=Scottsdale seeks advice on U.S. easements|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/article_1222530e-c75c-54d1-9967-ff50407c7434.html|website=East Valley Tribune|publisher=East Valley Tribune|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiro has argued that the city's abandonment of the city's interest in GLO easements does not abandon the interests of adjacent landowners, for whom the easements were created.

Mr. Spiro says,

{{quote|text=This patent easement "interest right", in favor of City use, was decisioned [sic] in an Appellate Court Case, "Kennedy v. City of Phoenix", commonly referred to as, "Kennedy One", 138 Ariz. 406,675 P. 2d 293 (App). 1983(1). It is opinioned [sic] that upon the relinquishment of the "City's Interests only", in these "patent roadway easements", that these roadway and public utilities easements, now revert back to "private roadway easements".

We believe, if approved, this legal action taken by the Scottsdale City Council, with this recorded abandonment Resolution, "will now 'exclude' the public" from the "use of these now private roadways". If this request is approved, these private roadways, we believe, are now for the sole use of all Federal Land Patent Parcel Owners, or owners of portions of these patent parcels, due to Lot Splits", who are owners of parcels or parts of parcels, that were sold under the "Classification Order that created these Federal Land Patent Parcel Areas".

Please become familiar with the wording of this issued Federal Land Patent that encumbers this parcel, for this could well become "an integrity issue for all Council Members, Planning Commission Members and City Staff? Also, in the Arizona Appellate Court Case Bemal v. Loeks, please be advised, contrary to what many respected persons may have said, in reference to the Bemal v. Loeks Case, it Is written for the record, that "Bemal 'was not land locked".

A question for the Scottsdale City Attorney is this: Does the "City of Scottsdale, "after abandonment of the Cities Interest in these roadway easements", have the Legal Right, even with the signaturing [sic] of the "City required agreements", by owner, by lender and by interested parties, which are titled: "AGREEMENT AND RELEASE BY GLO ABANDONMENT PARCEL OWNER, and City document titled, AGREEMENT AND RELEASE BY GLO ABANDONMENT PARCEL LENDER, TENANT OR OTHER INTEREST HOLDER, does the City "have the Legal Right to then approve, and authorize, and permit any encroachment or construction upon these, now, private patent roadway easements"? We ask, is the City now a liable party, in the event that there is ever a "third party legal action" taken, due to the City Council or City Staff authorizing and permitting encroachment and construction upon these now private roadway easements?

We ask, does the owner of a property encroaching upon this Small Tract Act of 1938 Patent Parcel easement, now own a property with a "title defect?

We suggest further consideration regarding this abandonment approval request that is now before the Scottsdale City Council. We suggest further review of Arizona Appellate Court Case #1 CA-CV 06-0756, commonly referred to as Neal v. Brown, which has been referenced in a previously approved City of Scottsdale Federal Land Patent Roadway and Public Utilities Abandonment Request, Case, #22-AB-2005, for possible errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Council Report, Gardener Abandonment|url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset52475.aspx|website=ScottsdaleAZ.gov|publisher=City of Scottsdale|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cave Creek, Arizona]] attorney Noel Hebets has also opined on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hebets|first1=Noel|title=Legal access and how to get there|url=http://noelhebets.com/forms/Land5-AccessMemo.pdf|website=NoelHebets.com|publisher=Noel Hebets|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Hebets writes:

{{quote|text=The Government Land Office ("GLO"), was a forerunner to the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"), and it administered the sale of the small tracts ("GLO Lots") to the veterans.

The "Patent" is just what the US Government calls the document that transferred title to the veteran or a veteran's widow.  It is effectively the first deed to the ground; though they were often not recorded, and did not need to be.

Today "right of way" has come to be used to describe ground that the government, through reservation, condemnation or dedication, has acquired for its roadway system.  However, the older and more common meaning of "right of way" was the right to locate and build a "way" (roadway) later on.  Consistent with that older meaning of the term, the  "right of way" reserved to the government in that patent is another name for an easement that people call "GLO Easements".

The right to use the GLO Easements for roadways and utilities automatically flows to the local government (county, city or town).  The obvious intent of the creation of the GLO Easements was to allow the local governments to use that ground for roadways and utilities without having to come back and pay the veteran or his successor in interest to acquire that right through a condemnation process.

However, Bernal v. Loeks clarified that the GLO Easements also give local landowners the right to use that ground for their access and utilities as well, irrespective of whether the local government has yet begun such use of the ground, and especially before the local government has done so.  In a disappointing opinion, Neal v. Brown introduced a sort of necessity requirement for that use by private landowners.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Prof Gamal Hamdan.jpg|thumb|Prof Gamal Hamdan]]
'''Gamal Hamdan''' ({{Lang-ar|جمال حمدان}}) (February 2, 1928 – April 17, 1993) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[scholar]] and [[geographer]]. Among his most prominent books are ''The Character of Egypt'', ''Studies of the Arab World'', and ''The Contemporary Islamic World Geography'', which form a trilogy on Egypt's natural, economic, political and cultural character and its position in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Birth==

Hamdan was born in the [[Qalyubia Governorate]] on February 4, 1928. His father, a teacher of [[Arabic language]], had been discharged from Al Azhar educational institution on charges of participating in demonstrations in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]].

==Education==

At the age of eight, he joined the [[primary school]]. He then moved to the prestigious Tawfiqiyya [[secondary school]], which had a nationwide fame for its high educational standard and sports facilities. There, he became aware of his love and [[aptitude|innate talent]] for [[geography]].

Having completed his secondary education in 1944, with distinction, ranking sixth on the list of graduates nationwide, he joined the Department of Geography at the [[Cairo University]]. Faculty of Arts.

At the age of twenty, he obtained his B.A. with Distinction.

He was soon appointed a staff member at Faculty of Arts, where he was granted a scholarship at the [[University of Reading]], UK to obtain his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. There, he was a student of the eminent English geographer, [[professor]] Austen Miller.

==Career==

{{Empty section|date=January 2017}}

==Major viewpoints and thoughts==

Hemdan’s intellectual and geographical achievements constituted the most important accomplishment of the Egyptian geographical school,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} that stresses Egypt’s uniqueness and singularity in terms of time and place, of geography and [[history]]. In his works, he adopted a multi-disciplinary approach, encompassing geography, history, [[sociology]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

Hemdan’s writings clearly manifested a unique wealth of knowledge, an immense power of meditation and [[observation]] and a distinct, devoted love of Egypt. His was the [[connoisseur]]’s love of the components of a unique gem. Utilizing these exceptional resources, Hemdan could delineate and interpret the Egyptian personality as influenced by location and geographical considerations.

==Major works==

Hemdan left behind a rich legacy of writing in both Arabic and [[English language]]s, including seventeen books in Arabic and eight in English, in addition to several articles in Arabic, published in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and other publications.

It is worthy of note that he had a futuristic outlook in his writings. He predicted several events, which, he thought, were compatible or incompatible with the facts of geography. Chief of these was his prediction of the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]].

His encyclopedic work ''[[The Personality of Egypt]]'', the most outstanding of his intellectual achievements, was the product of ten years of dedicated efforts, during which time he used 245 Arabic language and 691 foreign [[reference book]]s in several languages. In this prestigious book, he elaborately expounded the constituent factors making-up the Egyptian personality since the early days of the [[Pharaoh]]s. To him, Egypt was the central chapter of the book of geography, that turned into the opening chapter of the book of history, maintaining all through a coherent civilization across history. Egypt, to Hemdan was a unique unrepetitive geographical anomaly. Apart from the “Description of Egypt”, which appeared in print during the French Expedition to Egypt, this book remains an unprecedented scientific masterpiece on Egypt.

==Main Prizes and Merit awards==

Dr. Gamal Hemdan won several scientific prizes and merit awards including:

State Incentive Prize for Arts and Letters, 1959.
State Merit Prize for Social Science, 1986.
Scientific Criticism Award, by the State of [[Kuwait]], 1986.
Order of Merit of the First Class for Science and Arts, 1988. In line with his full dedication to science and his almost ascetic attitude to formalities, he refused to break up with his self-imposed solitude. Apart from the first prize awarded to him in 1959, he refused to receive any of the other prizes.

Hemdan died on April 17, 1993. His works had a far-reaching impact on the entire field of social sciences that was almost tantamount to a revolution in geography.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} With his unique literary style, Dr. Hemdan turned the science of geography into a universal, encyclopedic social science. Taking geography as an access road to other branches, he skilfully used this multi-disciplinary approach to study Egypt’s location, history, culture and future.

==Death==
His body was found with its lower half burned, everyone thought that Dr.Hemdan died of his burns, but Dr.Yosef ElGendy "Giza health inspector" proved in his report that the deceased did not die from asphyxiation by gas, and the burns are not the cause of his death, because it did not reach the degree of causing death.

Close people to Dr.Hemdan discovered the disappearance of some of the drafts of the books he was about to finish, and on top of it was topics about [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]], knowing that the fire that broke out in the apartment did not turn up books and papers D. Hamdan, which means the disappearance of the drafts by the active and until this moment no one knew the cause of death, nor where drafts of the books about the [[Jews]].

Everybody was surprised when the former intelligence chief "Amin Howeidi" said he knew about how Dr.Hemdan died, and he assured that he had the evidence that confirmed that Dr.Hemdan was killed by the [[Mossad]] 'Israeli intelligence'.

'''[[Botswana]]''' is a landlocked country located in Southern [[Africa]], north of [[South Africa]].  [[Botswana]] occupies an area of {{Convert|581730|km2|mi2}}, of which {{Convert|566730|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} are land.  Botswana has land boundaries of combined length {{Convert|4347.15|km|mi}}, of which the constituent boundaries are shared with [[Namibia]], for {{Convert|1544|km|mi|abbr=on}}; [[South Africa]] {{Convert|1969|km|mi|abbr=on}}; [[Zimbabwe]], {{Convert|834|km|mi|abbr=on}} and [[Zambia]], {{Convert|0.15|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.

Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.&lt;ref name="Landsberg"&gt;General Survey of Climatology, Landsberg (ed.),Elsevier, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

Botswana is semi-arid, due to the short rain season. However, the relatively high altitude of the country and its continental situation gives it a subtropical climate. The country is remote from moisture-laden air flows for most of the year. The dry season lasts from April to October in the south and to November in the north where, however, rainfall totals are higher. The south of the country is most exposed to cold winds during the winter period (early May to late August) when average temperatures are around {{convert|14|°C|1}}. The whole country has hot summers with average temperatures around {{convert|26|°C|1}}. Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.&lt;ref name="Landsberg" /&gt;

==Geography==
The land is predominantly flat to gently undulating [[tableland]], although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The [[Kalahari Desert]] is in the central and the southwest.  The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland deltas, is in the northwest and the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]], a large [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]] lies in the north-central area.  The Makgadikgadi has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man; This large seasonal [[wetland]] is composed of several large component pans, the largest being [[Nwetwe Pan]], [[Sua Pan]] and [[Nxai Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&amp;mode=&amp;order=0 ''Makgadikgadi'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A.Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana's lowest elevation point is at the junction of the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and Shashe Rivers, at a height of {{Convert|513|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The highest point is [[Monalanong Hill]], at {{Convert|1494|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
The country is divided into four drainage regions, which are sometimes indistinct due to the arid nature of the climate:
* the [[Chobe River]] on the border with the [[Caprivi Strip]] of Namibia together with a small adjacent swampy area is part of the [[Zambezi]] basin;
* most of the north and central region of the country is part of the [[Okavango Basin|Okavango]] inland drainage basin;
* the easternmost part of the country falls into the [[Limpopo]] drainage basin;
* the southern and southwestern regions, which are the driest of all, are drained by the Molopo river along the South African border and the [[Nossob River|Nossob river]] through the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park|Kalahari Gemsbok National Park]], and are technically part of the basin of the [[Orange River]]. None of these rivers normally flows as far as the Orange, however. (The last recorded confluence was in the 1880s.)&lt;ref&gt;Times Comprehensive Atlas, (2007), Times Books, London&lt;/ref&gt;
Except for the Chobe, Okavango, [[Boteti]] and [[Limpopo river]]s, most of Botswana's rivers cease to flow during the dry and early rainy seasons.

==Natural hazards==
Botswana is affected by periodic droughts, and seasonal August winds blow from the west, carrying sand and dust, which can obscure visibility.

==Environment==

Current environmental issues in Botswana are overgrazing, desertification and the existence of only limited fresh water resources.

Research from the [[University of Botswana]] has found that the common practice of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|overstocking cattle]] to cope with drought losses actually depletes scarce [[biomass]], making ecosystems more vulnerable. The study of the Kgatleng district predicts that by 2050 the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter —18 months instead of two years—due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/sub-suharan-africa/news/sub-saharan-africa-news-in-brief-10-22-april-2008.html Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 10–22 April 2008 - SciDev.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International agreements==
Botswana is a party to the following international agreements:  Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection and Wetlands.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Botswana]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Zambia]] and [[Namibia]], [[Ngamiland District]]
* Easternmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]], [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]]
* Southernmost point - [[Bokspits]], [[Kgalagadi District]]
* Westernmost point - the western section of the border with [[Namibia]]*
* ''Note: Botswana does not have a westernmost point as the western section is formed by the 22nd meridian of longitude east of Greenwich.''

As a widely used international standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards and used by [[international organization]]s&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"/&gt; to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information.&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"/&gt; However, it is not the only standard for country codes. [[Country code#Other country codes|Other country codes]] used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1,&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"/&gt; although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.

==Criteria for inclusion==
Currently 249 countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest are assigned official codes in ISO 3166-1. According to the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA), the only way to enter a new country name into ISO 3166-1 is to have it registered in one of the following two sources:&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"/&gt;
* [[United Nations]] Terminology Bulletin ''Country Names'', or
* ''Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use'' of the UN Statistics Division.

To be listed in the bulletin ''Country Names'', a country must be at least one of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iana.org/help/eligible-tlds| title=Qualifying top-level domain strings: Eligible categories of top-level domains| publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[Member states of the United Nations|member state of the United Nations]]
* A member of one of its [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agencies]]
* A party to the ''[[Statute of the International Court of Justice]]''

The list of names in ''Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use'' of the UN Statistics Division is based on the bulletin ''Country Names'' and other UN sources.

Once a country name or territory name appears in either of these two sources, it will be added to ISO 3166-1 by default.

The ISO 3166/MA may [[#Reserved and user-assigned code elements|reserve code elements]] for other entities that do not qualify for inclusion based on the above criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/10faq/frequently-asked-questions.html#Q07| title=ISO 3166 &amp;ndash; FAQs &amp;ndash; General Questions| publisher=ISO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306080355/http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/10faq/frequently-asked-questions.html#Q07 |archivedate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because the [[European Union]] is not a country, it is not formally included in ISO 3166-1, but for practical reasons, the ISO 3166/MA has "reserved the two-letter combination {{mono|EU}} for the purpose of identifying the European Union within the framework of ISO 3166-1".&lt;ref name="faqs_specific"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166-faqs/iso_3166_faqs_specific.htm| title=ISO 3166 &amp;ndash; FAQs &amp;ndash; Specific| publisher=ISO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616044022/http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166-faqs/iso_3166_faqs_specific.htm |archivedate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information included==
ISO 3166-1 is published officially in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. Since the second edition of ISO 3166-1, the following columns are included for each entry:
# Country Name&amp;nbsp;– English (or French) short name (all upper-case)
# English (or French) short name lower case (title case)

===Coding===
The codes are chosen, according to the ISO 3166/MA, "to reflect the significant, unique component of the country name in order to allow a visual association between country name and country code".&lt;ref name="faqs_specific" /&gt; For this reason, common components of country names like "Republic", "Kingdom", "United", "Federal" or "Democratic" are normally not used for deriving the code elements. As a consequence, for example, the [[United Kingdom]] is officially assigned the alpha-2 code {{mono|GB}} rather than {{mono|UK}}, based on its official name "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" (although {{mono|UK}} is [[#Reserved and user-assigned code elements|reserved]] on the request of the United Kingdom). Some codes are chosen based on the native names of the countries. For example, [[Germany]] is assigned the alpha-2 code {{mono|DE}}, based on its native name "Deutschland".

==Current codes==

===Reserved and user-assigned code elements===
Besides the officially assigned codes, code elements may be expanded by using either reserved codes or user-assigned codes.&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"/&gt;

Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories ''(click on the links for the reserved codes of each category)'':
* [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Reserved code elements|Alpha-2]]: [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Exceptional reservations|exceptional reservations]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Transitional reservations|transitional reservations]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminate reservations]], and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Codes currently agreed not to use|codes currently agreed not to use]]
* [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#Reserved code elements|Alpha-3]]: [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#Exceptional reservations|exceptional reservations]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#Transitional reservations|transitional reservations]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminate reservations]], and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#Codes currently agreed not to use|codes currently agreed not to use]]
* Numeric: no reserved codes

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following codes can be user-assigned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html| title=Glossary for ISO 3166 - Codes for countries and their subdivisions| publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#User-assigned code elements|Alpha-2]]: {{mono|AA}}, {{mono|QM}} to {{mono|QZ}}, {{mono|XA}} to {{mono|XZ}}, and {{mono|ZZ}}
* [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3#User-assigned code elements|Alpha-3]]: {{mono|AAA}} to {{mono|AAZ}}, {{mono|QMA}} to {{mono|QZZ}}, {{mono|XAA}} to {{mono|XZZ}}, and {{mono|ZZA}} to {{mono|ZZZ}}
* [[ISO 3166-1 numeric#User-assigned code elements|Numeric]]: {{mono|900}} to {{mono|999}}

==Changes==
The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A country is usually assigned new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new alphabetic codes are assigned if a country changes a significant part of its name, while a new numeric code is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in [[ISO 3166-3]].

ISO used to announce changes in newsletters which updated the currently valid standard, and releasing new editions which comprise a consolidation of newsletter changes. As of July 2013, changes are published in the online catalogue of ISO only and no newsletters are published anymore. Past newsletters remain available through the search option on the ISO website.&lt;ref name="Updates on ISO 3166"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-1-new-access.html | title=ISO 3166-1 - New access| publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:BF''' is the entry for [[Burkina Faso]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Burkina Faso, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[regions of Burkina Faso|13 regions]]
* [[provinces of Burkina Faso|45 provinces]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BF}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Burkina Faso. The second part is either of the following:
* two digits (01&amp;ndash;13): regions
* three letters: provinces

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''ISO 3166-2:RU''' is the entry for [[Russia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for some of the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]]. ISO 3166-2:RU contains no codes for the Russian-administered [[Republic of Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol|Federal City of Sevastopol]], which are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine and do have codes in [[ISO 3166-2:UA|Ukraine's entry in ISO 3166-2]].

Currently for Russia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for the following [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]:
* [[republics of Russia|21 republics]]
* [[krais of Russia|9 administrative territories]]
* [[oblasts of Russia|46 administrative regions]]
* [[federal cities of Russia|2 autonomous cities]]
* [[autonomous oblasts of Russia|1 autonomous region]]
* [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|4 autonomous districts]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|RU}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Russia. The second part is either of the following:
* two letters: republics
* three letters: all other subdivisions

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).
* Subdivision name 1 &amp;mdash; Romanization system: [[BGN/PCGN romanization of Russian|BGN/PCGN]] 1947
* Subdivision name 2 &amp;mdash; Romanization system: [[GOST 16876-71|GOST]] 1983

'''John Dixon Hunt''' (born January 18, 1936 in [[Gloucester]]) is an English landscape historian. His work particularly focuses on the time between the turn of the seventeenth through the end of the 18th centuries in [[France]] and [[England]]. Professor Hunt began his academic career teaching English literature. He is the author of many articles [not only in landscape journals but also Apollo, [[Lincoln Center Theater]] Review, and Comparative Criticism], and chapters on topics including [[T. S. Eliot]] and modern painting, Utopia in and as garden, and garden as commemoration. He has written numerous books which include The Pre-Raphaelite Imagination: 1848-1900 (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1968), his Critical Commentary on [[Shakespeare]]’s “The Tempest” (Macmillan 1968), studies of [[Andrew Marvell|Marvell]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], and [[William Kent]], his classic Garden and Grove: The Italian Renaissance Garden in the English Imagination: 1600-1750 (J. M. Dent, 1986), Greater Perfections (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), Picturesque Garden in Europe (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002), and The Afterlife of Gardens (Reaktion Books, 2004), A World of Gardens (Reaktion Books, 2012) and The Making of Place: Modern and Contemporary Gardens (Reaktion Books, 2015).

==Early life==
In his youth he walked extensively in the mountains of the English Lake District and in Switzerland, and spent time with his maternal grandfather, Frank Dixon, a school headmaster and entomologist. His parents moved to Bristol from his native Gloucester so that he could attend Bristol Grammar School. Hunt's father Sydney led a company of amateur actors, and Hunt envisioned a career on the stage for a period of time. He won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, and studied English literature, completing a B.A. and M.A. there, followed by a Ph.D. at Bristol University.

==Education==
*[[Bristol Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/cms/go/hon-degree/july%2006%20hon%20grad/jul-hunt.html |title=Professor John Dixon Hunt |publisher=www.bris.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]].
*In 1964 he earned a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Bristol]] (UK).
*In May 2000 he was named Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the [[French Ministry of Culture]] for his exceptional endeavors in landscape architecture.
*In 2006 he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Bristol (UK).
* 2017 he received the Sckell-Ehrenring by the [[Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]]

==Career==
He began his career with teaching positions in English literature with emphasis on its relationships with the visual arts at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Vassar College]], [[Exeter]], [[York]], [[Leiden]], [[East Anglia]], [[Bedford College, London]] and then [[Dumbarton Oaks]] where he was the Director of Studies in Landscape Architecture. His route to the study of landscapes began with his research into the 18th-century of [[Alexander Pope]] and a trip to [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], where he toured the grounds for several days with the history master of the boys' school there. Hunt has founded two prestigious academic journals:  [[Word &amp; Image]] (since 1985), which focuses on the relationship between the visual and the verbal, and [[Studies in the History of Gardens and Other Designed Landscapes]] (1981, originally [[Journal of Garden History]]). He has also held a number of fellowships ranging including a tenure at the American Academy in Rome and has advised on Venetian garden restoration and botanical garden interpretive programs. (University of Pennsylvania)

He became a professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1994 and served as the department chair of landscape architecture and regional planning until June 2000. In June he went on sabbatical to pursue his interests in landscape architectural theory. When he returned Dean Gary Hack left for his sabbatical therefore leaving his position as Dean temporarily available and John Dixon Hunt was named to fill the position for a semester. John Dixon Hunt is a member of the Graduate Groups in Ph.D. architecture, historic preservation, history of art, comparative literature and Center for Italian Studies Committee. (University of Pennsylvania)

==Examples of his writings and thoughts==
*Hunt defines landscape architecture as exterior place-making and sees the garden as having a 'privileged position' within landscape architecture because gardens 'are concentrated or perfected forms of place-making.'(Greater Perfection)
*"The use of the term 'picturesque' today is generally limp, gesturing at best towards something visually attractive, perhaps old, quaint or scenic."(The Picturesque Garden in Europe)
*"Picturesque is the story that concerns the application of painterly art to the formation of gardens and landscapes; but understanding, presentation and augmentation of 'nature' in designed landscapes, and about their reception by all sorts of visitors, topics just as important in the annals of landscape architecture as a debt to painting."(The Picturesque Garden in Europe)

'''Lake Uniamési''' or the '''Uniamesi Sea''' was the name given by missionaries in the 1840s and 1850s to a huge lake or inland sea they supposed to lie within a region of Central East Africa with the same name.

Three missionaries, confined to the coastal belt, heard of the region of [[Unyamwezi]] in the northwest of what is now Tanzania and exaggerated its size to include a large part of the continental interior. They heard of a great lake, and imagined an enormous lake that would be the source of the [[Benue River|Benue]], [[Nile]], [[Zambezi]] and [[Congo River|Congo]] rivers. They drew a map showing a huge "Lake Uniamesi" that was published in 1855. The map spurred the expedition of [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke]] to investigate the [[African Great Lakes]] region, where they found that lakes [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi|Nyasa]] were separate bodies of water. It was not until 1877 that it was confirmed that these lakes did feed the Nile, Congo and Zambezi, albeit separately.

==Background==
[[File:Deutsch Ostafrika.PNG|thumb|German East Africa in 1894, showing lakes Nyasa, Tanganyika and Victoria. "Unjamwesi" is below the "D" in "Deutsch Ostafrika"]]
The Great Lakes of East Africa include lakes [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Albert]], [[Lake Edward|Edward]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], all of which lie in the western or [[Albertine Rift|Albertine]] branch of the East African rift system, [[Lake Victoria]] to the east of this chain and Lake Nyasa ([[Lake Malawi|Malawi]]) to the south. Lake Victoria is the third largest lake in the world, and lies on the plateau between the west and east rifts. Unlike the long, narrow and deep lakes of the rift, Lake Victoria is wide and relatively shallow.{{sfn|Griffiths|2013|p=3}}

[[Bantu peoples]] moved into the region between the Great Lakes and the Indian Ocean some time after 1000 BC and mingled with the local population.{{sfn|Taylor|1963|p=4}} By the first century AD ships from the Arabian peninsula were trading along the East African coast. Muslim [[Arab people|Arab]]s from [[Oman]] began to colonize the coast in the 8th century AD.{{sfn|Taylor|1963|p=5}} The coastal Bantu peoples intermarried with the Arabs to form the [[Swahili people]], with a language that combines Bantu, Arabic and Persian elements.{{sfn|Taylor|1963|p=6}} The Swahili culture incorporated many Arabic and Islamic aspects, while remaining essentially Bantu in nature.{{sfn|Fyle|1999|p=46}}

The [[Unyamwezi]] region lies around the modern town of [[Tabora]], between the coast and Lake Tanganyika, and includes the [[Tabora Urban District|Tabora]], [[Nzega District|Nzega]] and [[Kahama District|Kahama]] districts of the western plateau of modern [[Tanzania]]. In the 19th century the inhabitants were called [[Nyamwezi people]] by outsiders, although this term covered various different groups.{{sfn|Jerman|1997|p=111}} 
Unyamwezi lay at a juncture where a trade route from the coast split, with one branch continuing west to the port of [[Ujiji]] on Lake Tanganyika while another branch led north to the kingdoms of [[Buganda]] and [[Bunyoro]].{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1976|p=277}}
Coastal traders settled in Unyamwezi, some with hundreds of well-armed retainers.{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1976|p=316}}
The Nyamwezi provided most of the porters for the caravans organized by the coastal Arabs and [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], 
and also conducted their own caravans.{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1976|p=285}} The Nyamwezi  were long-distance traders throughout East Africa.{{sfn|Jerman|1997|p=111}}

Ivory was not widely used by the Nyamwezi, but at some point they became aware that there was an overseas market for the product, and began to carry ivory along the route from Tabora down to the Indian Ocean coast opposite Zanzibar. There are records of Sultan [[Sayyid Said]] of [[Zanzibar]] negotiating with envoys from Unyamwezi in 1839 for safe passage for caravans to the interior.{{sfn|Jerman|1997|p=112}}
The Nyamwezi did not sell their own people as slaves, since they needed manpower for the ivory trade, but after the 1850s the slave trade began to become important. Slaves brought from the [[Congo Basin]] or the Great Lakes region would be held at Tabora, then sent down to the coast in small groups for onward shipment.{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1976|p=300}}

==Early European contacts==
[[File:Johann Ludwig Krapf.jpg|[[Johann Ludwig Krapf]]|thumb]]
Early in 1844 Sultan Sayyid Said  gave the German missionary [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] (1810–1881) permission to establish a mission on the coast. Krapf arrived in [[Mombasa]] on 13 March 1844.{{sfn|Bursik|2008|p=36}} He was joined in 1846 by  [[Johannes Rebmann]] (1820–1876). On 12 November 1848 Rebmann started a journey into the interior. The ''Church Missionary Intelligencer'' reported that, "The ultimate object, which our Missionaries had in view, has been to reach Uniamési, that interior country where the roads to East Africa and West Africa diverge."{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|p=106}} Uniamési was said to lie about 150 to 200 hours to the west of the [[Chagga]] kingdom, which lay on the slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|p=107}}

On 10 June 1849 [[Jakob Erhardt]] (1823–1901) and John Wagner arrived at the [[Rabbai Mpia]] mission station near [[Mombasa]]. Wagner died on 1 August 1849. In the spring of 1850 Erhardt and Krapf traveled by [[dhow]] down the East African coast from Mombasa.{{sfn|Bursik|2008|p=45}} On the journey they met traders from Unyamwezi. Krapf recorded that caravans of three to four thousand men from Unyamwezi would arrive at the coast in December after a three-month journey, and would leave on the return journey in March or April.{{sfn|Jerman|1997|p=114}} The Arabs of [[Zanzibar]] were hostile to Europeans reaching Unyamwezi. In 1847 they arranged for Washenzis to kill a French trader, Mr. Maison, on his way to the interior.{{efn|"Washenzi" was a derogatory term used by the coastal Arabs for people of the interior who had failed to adopt any elements of Arab culture. It signified "barbaric savage".{{sfn|Mbogoni|2012|p=167}} }}{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|pp=112–113}}

The missionaries were impatient to learn more about "the great central country of Uniamési, whither converge the great rivers which have their embouchures on the western and eastern coasts... from which, according to the native conception, is an outlet to the four quarters of the globe." There seemed to be "no doubt that the Natives of this central land traffic with the western as well as the eastern coast."{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|pp=392–393}} In 1850 Krapf exclaimed that, "Had we sufficient pecuniary means at our command, and were it not our bounden duty to subordinate all secondary objects to our chief vocation, which consists in the preaching of the Gospel, the map of East Africa would soon wear another aspect."{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|p=128}}

Krapf wrote, "I have lately perused a paper making the lake Niassa and that of Uniamesi appear as one and the same volume of water... from other native authorities I know at least that the Natives clearly distinguish between the Niassa and the Uniamesi lakes. But as I have made it a rule to distrust all native reports, until they be confirmed by personal observation, I shall say nothing more on this point."{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|p=128}} Later that year the ''Church missionary intelligencer'' published an account by Krapf of a journey to [[Ukambani]]{{efn|Ukambani is a semi-arid region of today's Kenya, inland from Mombasa and to the east of today's [[Nairobi]].{{sfn|BMMK appeals... 2010}} }} that he had made in November and December 1849. He speculated that the [[Niger River|Niger]] and its tributary the Tshadda ([[Benue River|Benue]]), the [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Nile]] and Kilimani ([[Quelimane]] – near to the mouth of the [[Zambezi]]) would all provide access to the center of Africa.{{sfn|Church Missionary Intelligencer 1850|p=450}}

Uniamési was thought to contain a great lake. Krapf said, 
{{blockquote|"The sources of all these great rivers are not so distant from each other as our present geographical knowledge would make us believe... Certain it is, that he who reaches the sources of the Nile will have a more than probable chance of reaching the sources of the Tshadda, of the Congo, and of the Kilimani. All of them verge toward the equator—toward the extensive country of Uniamési, and the territories around Uniamési, which could be rendered by the interpretation "Possession of the Moon" ... I will ... simply remark, that the Tshadda, the Congo, the Nile, and the Kilimani rivers, either take their rise from the great lake in Uniamési, or very near to that lake..."{{sfn|Krapf|1852|p=456}} }}

Jakob Erhardt spent six months at [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] studying the [[Kisambara language]], where he heard the stories of ivory traders who had visited the interior.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=486}} According to Rebmann, whose account was published in Krapf's memoirs,
{{blockquote|They represented to him that the Sea of Uniamesi was simply a continuation of the Lake Niassa, the latter, according to them, striking out westward from its northerly direction, and then spreading itself out even to a greater expanse than hitherto, so as to approach the mountains which pass through the centre of the continent, and form a most important and impenetrable barrier and water-shed. The northern side of this barrier contains the sources of the Nile, of Lake Tsad, and of the river Chadda, while the south side sends its waters partly to the Atlantic Ocean, by the river Congo or Zaire, partly to the Indian Ocean by the Jub, Dana and Osi, and also, as I think highly probable, to the great lake of the interior itself.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=486}} }}

Erhardt  was struck by the fact that various travelers who had gone inland from different points on the east coast of Africa had all come to an inland sea, and made a map based on available information, including the findings of Krapf and Rebmann. 
In November 1854 while talking about the problem to Rebmann, "at one and the same moment, the problem flashed on both of us solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain-land, we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea."{{sfn|Godsall|2008|p=147}} On the map that he and Rebmann drew the three lakes are shown as one very large S-shaped lake.{{sfn|Bursik|2008|p=76}}

In 1855 Erhardt was repatriated due to poor health, and took the map with him.{{sfn|Heldring|2011|p=68}}
Rebmann wrote letters to the ''Calwer Missionary Intelligencer (Calwer Missionsblatt)'', received and published in 1855, in which he called the lake Uniamesi or Ukerewe.{{efn|Lake Ukerewe is another name for Lake Victoria Nyanza. According to Burton the name came from [[Ukerewe Island]].{{sfn|Burton|1860|p=214}} }} He said that according to accounts by traders, considered trustworthy by the missionaries, the lake extended from latitude 0.5°N to 13.5°S and from longitude 23.5°E to 36°E, and had an area of 13,600 German square miles, as compared to 7,860 German square miles for the Black Sea and 7,400 for the Caspian.{{sfn|The Lake Region in Central Africa 1862|p=17}}
The map was first published in the ''Calwer Missionsblatt'' later in 1855, and then in the ''Church Missionary intelligencer'' in 1856.{{sfn|Heldring|2011|p=68}} [[August Heinrich Petermann]] published the map in his ''Mittheilungen'', but warned that the missionaries may not have accounted sufficiently for exaggeration by their informants. He provided a supplementary sketch showing the lake extending from 7°S to 12°S and 22.5°E to 30.5°E, one third of Rebmann's estimated size.{{sfn|The Lake Region in Central Africa 1862|p=18}}

The map was reproduced with commentary in other publications.{{sfn|Cooley|Petermann|1856}}[[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]  saw a pen-and-ink version of the map made by "Mr. Rehman of Moubar, on the Zanguebar coast." In a letter of April 1857 to the ''[[Académie des Sciences]]'' of Paris he commented that the inland sea would be larger than the [[Black Sea]]. He said, "The existence of this sea was certified to me during my stay at [[Khartoum]] by a pilgrim from Mecca, who inhabits Central Africa, and who gave Mahmoud Pasha, one of the Viceroy's ministers, particulars corresponding to Mr. Rehman's map. This pilgrim added that he had seen larger vessels on the ''Uniamesi'' than that in which he had sailed down the Red Sea."{{sfn|Lesseps|1888|p=42}}

The reports of snow on mounts [[Mount Kilimanjaro|Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mount Kenya|Kenya]], near to the equator, caused considerable controversy.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=64}} Sir [[Francis Galton]], who had won the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s gold medal in 1853 for his southwest African explorations, had Erhardt's map published in the society's ''Proceedings''. Galton was pressed to travel to Africa to confirm the report about Mount Kilimanjaro. He declined on the basis that he had not yet fully recovered his health from his previous expedition.{{sfn|Wright|2001|p=110}} Instead, the Royal Geographical Society persuaded the British government to provide ₤1,000 for an expedition by [[Richard Francis Burton]] and [[John Hanning Speke]] to investigate the great lake, or lakes, and determine if they were the source of the Nile.{{sfn|Wright|2001|p=110}} The map came to be known as the "slug map" from the shape of the Uniamesi or Niassa inland sea. Burton called it the Mombas Mission Map.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=64}}

[[File:Johannes rebmann.gif|[[Johannes Rebmann]]|thumb]]
Burton and Speke reached Zanzibar on 20 December 1857, visited Rebmann at his Kisuludini mission station, and paid a visit to Fuga, capital of the [[Usambare]] kingdom.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxvii}} Burton met king [[Kimweri ye Nyumbai]], once a powerful warrior who had controlled the trade routes to the interior but now extremely old.{{sfn|Briggs|McIntyre|2013|p=175}} They left for the interior on 26 June 1858. After travelling through mountainous country they reached the inner plateau of Uniamesi. At the Arab trading post of Kazeh (now [[Tabora]]) they recorded an elevation of {{convert|3400|ft}}.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxviii}}

At Kazeh Burton and Speke found a mixed population of Nyamwezi, Tutsi and Arabs engaged in cattle farming and cultivation of foods such as rice, cassava, pawpaw and citrus. Burton called Unyamwezi the garden of inter-tropical Africa.{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1976|p=297}}
The land sloped down from there to Lake Takanyika [sic], or Uniamesi, which they reached on 3 March 1849 and where they recorded an elevation of {{convert|1843|ft}}.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxviii}}{{efn|Lake Tanganyika has a surface elevation of {{convert|2536|ft}} rather than {{convert|1843|ft}} recorded by Burton and Speke.}}

Burton and Speke found that the lake extended about {{convert|300|mi}} north from [[Ujiji]], where it was closed by a crescent-shaped mountain range.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxviii}} They were told by the local people that the lake reached down to latitude 8° south. Later [[David Livingstone]] was given consistent information by an Arab trader who had skirted the south of the lake, and a Swahili traveler also confirmed that the "Taganyika" was not connected to the Niassa to the south.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxviii}}
Burton and Speke returned to Kazeh, where Burton was forced to rest while Speke traveled north to explore [[Lake Victoria]] (also called Lake Ukerewe), reaching it on 3 August 1849. Speke recorded an elevation of {{convert|3788|ft}}{{efn|Lake Victoria has a surface elevation of {{convert|3717|ft}}, close to Speke's measurement of {{convert|3788|ft}}.}} and was told that a river left the north of the lake and flowed into the Nile.{{sfn|Krapf|Ravenstein|1860|p=xxix}}

There was continued controversy about the Great Lakes and the rivers that fed and drained them. Speke made a long journey with [[James Augustus Grant]] between October 1860 and February 1863, traveling from the coast opposite Zanzibar via Tabora and Uganda to Khartoum.{{sfn|Kokwaro|1994|p=3}} However, the question of whether the Nile issued from Lake Victoria was left uncertain.{{sfn|Kalb|2001|p=288}}
In 1866–73 [[David Livingstone]] left the coast at [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]], followed the [[Ruvuma River]] inland and walked to the southern end of Lake Nyasa, which he rounded to the west. He then traveled north to Lake Tanganyika.{{sfn|Moorehead|2000|p=98}} After lengthy explorations of the country southwest of Lake Tanganyika, with his health broken Livingstone reached Ujiji on the east of Lake Tanganyika, where he had his famous meeting with [[Henry Morton Stanley]] on 10 November 1871.{{sfn|Moorehead|2000|p=114-117}}

[[Verney Lovett Cameron]] was sent in 1873 to assist David Livingstone. Shortly after he left Zanzibar he learned that Livingstone had died, but continued to Ujiji. He circumnavigated Lake Tanganyika and found that it had its outlet to the west, feeding into a tributary of the Congo River. Cameron went on to the Atlantic, becoming one of the first Europeans to make an east-west crossing of Equatorial Africa.{{sfn|Koivunen|2008|p=216}} It was not until Stanley circumnavigated Lake Victoria in 1874–1875 that it was confirmed that the lake was the source of the White Nile.{{sfn|Kalb|2001|p=288}} With Stanley's return to Zanzibar in 1877 the last of the main questions surrounding the Great Lakes drainage had been settled.{{sfn|Moorehead|2000|p=139}} Krapf had conjectured there was one great lake feeding the Congo, Zambezi, Nile and Benue. There had turned out to be three great lakes, feeding the Congo, Zambezi and Nile.

A select number of decisions from the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] have proven to have a profound effect on legal and political situation in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The notable decisions of the Court are listed in chronological order.

==Decision on the constitutionality of the peace agreement==

On 13 October 1997, the Croatian 1861 Law Party and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 1861 Law Party requested the Constitutional Court to annul several decisions and to confirm one decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more importantly, to review the constitutionality of the [[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], since they alleged that the agreement violated the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in a way that it undermined the integrity of the state and that it may cause the dissolution of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Court reached the conclusion that it is not competent to decide the disputes in regard to the mentioned decisions, since the applicants were not subjects that were identified in Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution, in regard to those who can refer disputes to the Court. The Court also rejected the other request stating:

{{quotation|[T]he Constitutional Court is not competent to evaluate the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement as the Constitutional Court has in fact been established under the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to uphold this Constitution [...] The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted as Annex IV to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and consequently there cannot be a conflict or a possibility for controversy between this Agreement and the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-7/97, p. 2 and 3, [[Sarajevo]], 22 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was one of the early cases in which the Court had to deal with the question of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of ''[[obiter dictum]]'' concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually "established the ground for ''legal unity''"&lt;ref&gt;Vehabović, Faris (2006). Odnos Ustava Bosne i Hercegovine i Evropske konvencije za zaštitu ljudskih prava i osnovnih sloboda. Sarajevo: ACIPS, 24. {{ISBN|9958-9187-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the entire piece agreement, which further implied that all the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed this by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis and not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power, and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-1/03, Sarajevo, 25 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision on the constituency of peoples==

On 12 February 1998, [[Alija Izetbegović]], at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court for an evaluation of the consistency of the Constitution of the Republika Srpska and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The request was supplemented on 30 March 1998 when the applicant specified which provisions of the Entities’ Constitutions he considered to be unconstitutional. The four partial decisions were made in a year 2000, by which many of articles of the constitutions of entities were found to be unconstitutional, which had a great impact on politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, because there was a need to adjust the current state in the country with the decision of the Court. There was a narrow majority (5-4), in the favor of the applicant. In its third partial decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation| [T]he provisions of the Preamble are thus a legal basis for reviewing all normative acts lower in rank in relation to the Constitution of BiH for as long as the aforesaid Preamble contains constitutional principles delineating [...] spheres of jurisdiction, the scope of rights or obligations, or the role of the political institutions. The provisions of the preamble are therefore not merely descriptive, but are also invested with a powerful normative force thereby serving as a sound standard of judicial review for the Constitutional Court [...] [E]lements of a [[democracy|democratic]] state and society as well as underlying assumptions – [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], just procedures, peaceful relations that arise out of the Constitution – must serve as a guideline for further elaboration of the issue of the structure of BiH as a multi-ethnic state [...] Territorial delimitation [of Entities] must not serve as an instrument of ethnic segregation – on the contrary – it must accommodate ethnic groups by preserving linguistic pluralism and peace in order to contribute to the integration of the state and society as such [...] Constitutional principle of collective equality of constituent peoples, arising out of designation of Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs as constituent peoples, prohibits any special privileges for one or two constituent peoples, any domination in governmental structures and any ethnic homogenization by segregation based on territorial separation [...] [D]espite the territorial division of BiH by establishment of two Entities, this territorial division cannot serve as a constitutional legitimacy for ethnic domination, national homogenisation or the right to maintain results of [[ethnic cleansing]] [...] Designation of Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs as constituent peoples in the Preamble of the Constitution of BiH must be understood as an all-inclusive principle of the Constitution of BiH to which the Entities must fully adhere, pursuant to Article III.3 (b) of the Constitution of BiH.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-5/98 (Partial Decision Part 3), para. 26, 54, 57, 60, 61, [[Sarajevo]], 1 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court dealt with the following questions: the legal status entities, legal nature of the Constitution of B&amp;H, prohibition of discrimination, equality of constituent peoples, the status of the orthodox church in RS and equality of language and script. The formal name of this item is ''U-5/98'', but it is widely known as the "Decision on the constituency of peoples" ({{lang-bs|Odluka o konstitutivnosti naroda}}), referring to the Court's interpretation of the significance of the phrase "constituent peoples" used in the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was also the basis for other notable cases that came before the court.

==Decision on the Council of Ministers==

On 11 February 1999, Mirko Banjac, at the time Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted a request for, among other issues, the evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministries of Bosnia and Herzegovina (''Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina, No. 4/97'') which foresaw the existence of two Co-Chairs and a Vice-Chair of the Council of Ministers. In its decision the Court had, among other things, stated the following:

{{quotation|Article V.4 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina defines the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is composed of the Chair of the Council of Ministers and a certain number of ministers as may be appropriate, who are responsible for the implementation of the policy and the decisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina from within the competencies of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina appoints the Chair of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who assumes the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the Chair of the Council of Ministers appoints the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Trade and other ministers as may be appropriate (no more than two thirds of the ministers may be appointed from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives; also, the Chair appoints deputy ministers (who may not be from the same constituent people as their ministers), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives.
It follows from what has been stated above that the challenged provisions of the law defining the Co-Chairs and the Vice-Chair of the Council of Ministers are not in accordance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, since the Constitution clearly establishes the traditional function of a Prime Minister designate who also appoints the ministers according to Article V.4 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22294 U-1/99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215120/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22294 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 4 and 5, [[Sarajevo]], 14 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court gave the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina a three-month period from the date of publication of its decision on this matter in the "Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina" to bring the contested provisions of the Law in conformity with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the Parliamentary Assembly failed to do that the Court, acting upon the request of the applicant and pursuant to its decision of 14 August 1999 and the legal standpoint exemplified in the reasons of the decision, established that certain provisions of the Law on Ministers and Ministries shall cease to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22300 U-1/99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215211/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22300 |date=16 July 2011 }}, [[Sarajevo]], 29 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision on the relationship between the Court and the Human Rights Chamber for B&amp;H==

On 20 April 1998, the Office of the Public Attorney of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina challenged the Decision of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina in Case No. CH/96/30, claiming that it was not in conformity with the national laws and international conventions. The Constitutional Court had to decide whether it had an appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the later being an institution of a special nature also vested with judicial functions with respect to alleged violations of
human rights as provided for in Annex 6 to the [[Dayton Agreement]], unlike the Constitutional Court regulated in Annex 4 (the [[Constitution|Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) of the same Agreement. In its majority decision (4-1), the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation|The provisions of these two Annexes should [...] be considered to supplement each other, and in view of the link between these two Annexes, it can be
concluded with certainty that the rules contained in the Agreement on Human Rights cannot be contrary to the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] It is thus clear that human rights issues fall under the jurisdiction of both the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Chamber. There is no mention in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina or in any other law of a specific hierarchy or other relationship between the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Chamber [...] [C]orrect interpretation must be that the authors did not intend to give either one of these institutions the competence to review the decisions of the other, but rather considered that, in regard to human rights issues, the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Chamber should function as parallel institutions, neither of them being competent to interfere in the work of the other and it being left in some cases to the discretion of applicants to make a choice between these alternative remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22256 U-7/98] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220302/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22256 |date=16 July 2011 }}, p. 2 and 3, [[Sarajevo]], 26 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Thus, the Court held that it had no jurisdiction and that the appeal had to be rejected. The Court had recognized that the situation created by the Dayton Agreement might result in certain problems such as possible conflicting case law concerning some human rights issues, however it also concluded that the problem was mostly of a temporary nature since the Agreement foresaw the possibility of the transfer of the competence in this area to the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina dealing with human rights. The Human Rights Chamber of B&amp;H existed in the period of 1996-2003, and after 1 January 2004 new cases alleging human rights violations are decided by the Constitutional Court of B&amp;H.

==Decisions concerning the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina==
===Decision on the competency to review the laws enacted by the High Representative===

On 7 February 2000, eleven members of the House of Representatives of the
Parliamentary Assembly of B&amp;H initiated proceedings before the Constitutional Court for the evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on State Border
Service that was enacted by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative for B&amp;H]] on 13 January 2000, and later published in the Official Gazette of B&amp;H. Among other issues, the applicants contended that the High Representative did not have the normative powers to impose a law in the absence of a vote by the Parliamentary Assembly. In its majority decision (7-2), the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation|[T]he High Representative - whose powers under Annex 10 to the General Framework Agreement, the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the
Bonn Declaration as well as his exercise of those powers are not subject to review by the Constitutional Court - intervened in the legal order of Bosnia and Herzegovina substituting himself for the national authorities. In this respect, he therefore acted as an authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the law which he enacted is in the nature of a national law and must be regarded as a law of
Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] The competence given to the Constitutional Court to "uphold the Constitution" [...] confers on the Constitutional Court the control of the conformity with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina of all acts, regardless of the author, as long as this control is based on one of the competences
enumerated in Article VI.3 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] The competence of the Constitutional Court to examine conformity with the Constitution of
Bosnia and Herzegovina of the Law on State Border Service enacted by the High Representative, acting as an institution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is thus based on Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22419 U-9/00] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220353/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22419 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 5, 7 and 9, [[Sarajevo]], 3 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, although the Constitutional Court declined to review the "exercise" of the powers of the High Representative with regards the possible justification of his intervention in the legislative process of B&amp;H, the Court did declare that it has the competency to review his actions when he acts as a legislator. The Court subsequently determined that the law reviewed was in conformity with the Constitution.

===Decision on the authority of the High Representative to change the laws===

On 12 October 2000, thirty-four representatives of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska submitted a request to the Constitutional Court of B&amp;H for the evaluation of the conformity of the Decision on Amending the Law on Travel Documents of B&amp;H, adopted by the High Representative on 29 September 2000, with the Constitution of B&amp;H. Besides the general claims that the High Representative can only interpret laws, and thus cannot create them, the applicants, among other issues, asserted that the High Representative cannot amend the Law on Travel Documents by a decision, since a decision represents an act of weaker legal force than laws. In its majority decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation| The question whether it was necessary to adopt the Decision despite the fact that the Law on Travel Documents already existed is a question of legislative policy and not a constitutional question. In this respect, the High Representative substituted domestic authorities in taking the view that amendments to the existing law were required [...] As for the question of whether the decision of the High Representative is in conformity with Article 34 of the Law on Citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is sufficient to point out that the Law on Citizenship is not a constitutional regulation. Therefore, the Constitutional court may not use the Law as the legal basis for review of the constitutionality. Otherwise, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be interpreted on the basis of the ordinary law. This would alter the whole hierarchy of the legal system which follows from the provision of Article III.3 (b) on the supremacy of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51729 U-25/00] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220434/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51729 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 29, 33. [[Sarajevo]], 22 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the Court held that the High Representative has the authority not only to enact the laws, but also to change them, and although the Court could not review the authority of the High Representative in that regard it could review the laws that he had enacted or changed. It also held that the Decision Amending the Law on Travel Documents of Bosnia and Herzegovina was in conformity with the Constitution of B&amp;H.

===Decision on the competency to review decisions of the High Representative to remove public officials===

On 27 March 2001, 37 representatives of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Federation of B&amp;H, as well as Edhem Bičakčić, filed an appeal against the Decision of the High Representative for B&amp;H to remove Edhem Bičakćić from the office of director general of "Elektroprivreda BiH" (public company for distribution of electric energy) and to prohibit him from holding any public or appointed office unless or until such time as the High Representative may expressly authorize him to hold such office. Bičakćić was removed on the grounds of criminal offenses that were allegedly committed during the performance of his duties as the Prime Minister of the Federation of B&amp;H. The appellants alleged that the challenged Decision of the High Representative was unconstitutional in regard to both the competence to take such a decision and the substance of the decision, particularly because it was taken, in their opinion, without applying any criteria and without applying a fair procedure for establishing the truth. Thus, the applicants asked the Court to grant the appeals and quash the decision of the High Representative. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation| According to Article VI.3 (b) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Constitutional Court shall have appellate jurisdiction over issues under this Constitution arising out of a judgment of any other court in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Constitutional Court finds that the decision of the High Representative to remove Mr. E. B. from the office of director general of ’Elektroprivreda BiH’ and to prohibit him from holding public office cannot be considered a judgment by a court. It follows that the Constitutional Court has no appellate jurisdiction under Article VI.3 (b) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina concerning this decision.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51690 U-37/01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220507/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51690 |date=16 July 2011 }}, p. 4. [[Sarajevo]], 2 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the Constitutional Court held that it cannot review a decision of the High Representative to remove a public official under Article VI.3 (a) Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Decision on right to effective remedy after removal from public office by the High Representative===

In 2005, Milorad Bilbija and Dragan Kalinić lodged appeals before the Constitutional Court against decisions of ordinary courts that had dismissed their appeals against the decisions of the High Representative concerning them. Bilbija was removed by the decision of the High Representative from his position of Deputy Head of the Operative Administration of the Intelligence and Security Agency in Banja Luka and from other public and party positions, while Kalinić was removed from his position as Chairman of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska and President of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serbian Democratic Party]]. Both were also barred from other public and party duties that they were performing, and from holding any official, elective or appointive public office and from running in elections and from office within political parties unless or until such time the High Representative, by his subsequent decision, expressly authorizes them to do or hold the same, also ending any entitlements they had to receive remuneration or any privileges or status they had from those positions. Both complained that this violated their rights to effective legal remedy, to a fair trial, to no punishment without law, to freedom of expression, to freedom of assembly and association, to non-discrimination and to free elections. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation|In the case at hand the question is raised as to whether the appellants have an effective legal remedy available against the decision of the High Representative by which they could challenge the said decisions as referred to in Article 13 of the European Convention [...] Having regard to the said powers of the High Representative, the Opinion of the Venice Commission as well as the decisions of ordinary courts, which are adopted in the proceedings initiated by the appellants against the decisions of the High Representative, it follows that there is no effective legal remedy against the decisions of the High Representative available within the existing legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] However, the Constitutional Court must consider a further question. Does the special status of the High Representative or the sources of his authority in the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and various resolutions of the United Nations Security Council deprive the claimants of rights under the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina or prevent positive obligations attaching to the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina to protect any such rights? [...] [T]he Constitutional Court considers that the obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina in public international law to co-operate with the High Representative and to act in conformity with decisions of the UN Security Council cannot determine the constitutional rights of people who are within the jurisdiction of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] Court holds that there is nothing in the international legal context from which this case arises to compel it to reach a conclusion different from the one to which it would arrive merely on the basis of its interpretation of the rights in their national constitutional context. It follows from the aforesaid that the State has a positive obligation to ensure respect for fundamental human rights enshrined in ''the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina or arising from international treaties, however, the source of their legal force is in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it is in the present case the individual’s right to an effective legal remedy'' [...] The Constitutional Court notes that Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council and Security Council of the United Nations, a body in charge of nominating and confirming the appointment of the High Representative, was obliged to make an effort in pointing to the alleged violations of constitutional rights of individuals on the grounds of lack of an effective legal remedy and thus ensure the protection of constitutional rights of its citizens. Having regard to the aforesaid, the Constitutional Court established that there is no effective legal remedy available within the existing legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina against individual decisions of the High Representative concerning the rights of individuals, nor has Bosnia and Herzegovina undertaken the activities, required by its positive obligation, to ensure an effective legal remedy against the said decisions of the High Representative through the bodies in charge of nominating and appointing the High Representative.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=59843 AP-953/05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052927/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=59843 |date=28 September 2011 }}, para. 35, 51, 56, 68, 71, 72, 73, 74, [[Sarajevo]], 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the Court held that the appellants’ right to an effective legal remedy under Article 13 of the European Convention has been violated, and that Bosnia and Herzegovina had a positive obligation to protect the constitutional rights of appellants in that regard. Up until this decision the Court had been rejecting the appeals lodged against the Decisions of the High Representative, initially finding itself not competent and subsequently holding that those appeals were premature. The Court however did not decide in merits on what standard of human rights the High Representative was to comply with, nor did it order the establishment of independent judicial body to review decisions of the High Representative in similar cases. Decision of the Court led to a vigorous response from the High Representative: on 23 March 2007 he issued a decision removing any practical effect from the Courts decision.&lt;ref&gt;OHR (2007-03-23).

===Decision quashing the ruling of a court based on a decision by the High Representative===

On 15 October 2001, [[Ante Jelavić]] lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court against the ruling of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo which dismissed Jelavić's appeal against the ruling of an investigative judge of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo on the conduct of investigation against Jelavić. Although the judge confirmed that the alleged offenses were committed in [[Mostar]], he based his competency, among other things, on the Decision of the High Representative of 26 April 2001, on establishing the territorial and subject-matter competence of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo "for conducting investigation and first instance trial against perpetrators of all criminal acts" arising from certain events in which the appellant was allegedly involved. Jelavić raised an objection to the territorial competence of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo, stating that the Cantonal Court in Mostar was competent for conducting the proceedings and that his right to a fair trial was violated. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation|[...] Decision of the High Representative is regarded as the law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This Decision derogates the respective provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, which rather comprehensively specify the issue of territorial competence with regards to offenses. The restriction of legal rights in a democratic society may be effectuated by amending laws or in some other legitimate way. Undoubtedly, such is the legitimacy of the High Representative [...] Thus the High Representative shall have a sovereign authority in decision-making in that sense. However, the High Representative, interfering with the legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of “functional duality”, is, however, obliged to respect the Constitution and constitutional principles of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The acts passed by the High Representative have to have a positive reflection on the principle of democracy, legal state and on the guarantees of a fair trial. In the present case, the Decision of the High Representative does not contain a reasoning which would justify the general interest of restriction of the rights provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code. The reasons for the derogation of the respective provisions of this Law are not clearly specified in the Decision insofar as the events stated in paragraph 1 of this Decision are concerned. The Decision has been imposed, which is in breach of the principle of democracy and legal state, provided for in Article 112 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In view of the aforementioned, the Constitutional Court concludes that the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo, in its ruling No. KV-645/01 of 18 December 2001, incorrectly found itself territorially competent, thereby violating Article 6 of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=147296 U-13/02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052824/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=147296 |date=28 September 2011 }}, p. 40, 41, 42. [[Sarajevo]], 10 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court granted the appeal of Ante Jelavić, and quashed the rulings of the Cantonal Court of Sarajevo and designated the Cantonal Court in Mostar as territorially competent to conduct the investigation. This was also the first and the only time the Constitutional Court had determined that a legislative measure of the High Representative was unconstitutional.

===Decision on imposition of arbitration by the High Representative===

On 29 June 2001, [[Živko Radišić]], a member of the Presidency of B&amp;H submitted a request to the Constitutional Court for deciding the dispute between the Republika Srpska and Federation of B&amp;H on the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]] between Dobrinja I and Dobrinja IV and for review of the constitutionality of the Decision of the High Representative which ties both the Republika Srpska and the Federation of B&amp;H into final and binding arbitration on the Inter-Entity Boundary Line in the Sarajevo suburbs of Dobrinja I and IV, No. 84/01 of 5 February 2001 and the Arbitration Award by an independent Arbitrator for Dobrinja I and IV. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:

{{quotation|The High Representative is vested with general competence for implementation of civilian aspects of the Peace Agreement. He is authorized to oversee its implementation, to facilitate it and to judge whether any difficulties arising out of the civilian implementation of the Peace Agreement need to be resolved. He is also the final authority in theatre to interpret the said agreement [...] In the present case, the Constitutional Court notes that the Decision of the High Representative and the Arbitration Award did not interfere with the legislative prerogatives assigned to the domestic legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Constitution. As the dispute arises under the framework of Annex 2 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the challenged decisions were adopted according to the specific powers of the High Representative regarding the interpretation of the Agreement on the Civilian Implementation of the Peace Agreement [...] Considering that the challenged decisions do not have the characteristics of a law, the Constitutional Court is not competent to review their constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22795 U-41/01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052853/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22795 |date=28 September 2011 }}, p. 16, 19, 20. [[Sarajevo]], 30 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the Court rejected the submission as inadmissible, as it held that it is not competent to adopt a decision.

==Decision on jurisdiction to review the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina==

On 8 February 2002, thirty-three representatives of the People’s Assembly of the
Republika Srpska submitted a request to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a review of constitutionality of Article 18.8, paragraph 3 of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they considered to be discriminatory. In admissibility stage the Court had to consider the provisions of the Article VI.3 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina which does not expressly grant the jurisdiction to the Court to review the constitutionality of the laws adopted at the state level. The Court unanimously held the following:

{{quotation|Although the provision of Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina
does not provide for the Constitutional Court to have an explicit jurisdiction to review the
constitutionality of the laws or provisions of the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the substantial
jurisdiction specified by the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, indicates that the
Constitutional Court is entitled to exercise such jurisdiction, particularly having in mind the role of the Constitutional Court as the body which upholds the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The position adopted by the Constitutional Court in its jurisprudence in such cases clearly points to the conclusion that the Constitutional Court is competent to review the constitutionality of a law, or particular provisions of the laws, of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Merits,[http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51777 U-14/02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220234/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=51777 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 9, [[Sarajevo]], 30 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the Court had in the case no. U 1/99 implicitly held that it had jurisdiction to review the laws adopted at the state level, this was the first time it had expressly done so. In the merits stage the Court ruled against the applicants.

==Decision on the insignia of entities==

On 12 April 2004, [[Sulejman Tihić]], then Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the review of constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Coat of Arms and Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (''Official Gazette of Federation of BiH No. 21/96 and 26/96''), Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitutional Law on the Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem of the Republika Srpska (''Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 19/92''), Articles 2 and 3 of the Law on the Use of Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem (''Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 4/93'') and Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Family Patron-Saint’s Days and Church Holidays of the Republika Srpska (''Official Gazette of Republika Srpska No. 19/92''). On 2 December 2004 the applicant submitted a supplement to the request. Two partial decisions were made in a year 2006, when the Court found that the [[Coat of arms of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|coat of arms]] and [[Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|flag]] of the Federation of B&amp;H, and [[Coat of arms of Republika Srpska|coat of arms]], anthem, family patron-saint days and church holidays of Republika Srpska were unconstitutional. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|The Constitutional Court concludes that it is the legitimate right of the Bosniak and Croat people in the Federation of BiH and the Serb people in the Republika Srpska to preserve their tradition, culture and identity through legislative mechanisms, but an equal right must be given to the Serb people in the Federation of BiH and Bosniak and Croat peoples in Republika Srpska and other citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Constitutional Court further holds that it cannot consider as reasonable and justified the fact that any of the constituent peoples has a privileged position in preservation of tradition, culture and identity as all three constituent peoples and other citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina enjoy the rights and fulfil obligations in the same manner as provided for in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Constitutions of the Entities. Moreover, it is of a particular importance the fact that the identity of the constituent peoples, [[education]], [[religion]], [[language]], fostering culture, tradition and cultural heritage are defined in the Constitution of the Federation of BiH and Constitution of the Republika Srpska, as the vital national interests of the constituent peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-4/04, p.60 , [[Sarajevo]], 18 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The formal name of the item is ''U-4/04'', but it is widely known as "Decision on the insignia of entities" (Bosnian: ''Odluka o obilježjima entiteta''), since its merritum was about the symbols of entities. The Court has ordered the [[Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[National Assembly of Republika Srpska]] to bring the contested legal documents in line with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina within six months from the publishing date of its decision in the ''Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina''. Since the harmonisation was not done in that granted time-limit, that Court has, on January 27, 2007, adopted the Ruling on failure to enforce in which it established that the contested articles of the interpreted legal documents shall cease to be in force as of the date following the publishing date of the Ruling in ''Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/press/index.php?pid=1744&amp;sta=3&amp;pkat=507 "Press release"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903022156/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/press/index.php?pid=1744&amp;sta=3&amp;pkat=507 |date=3 September 2010 }}, Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007-03-31).

It had also decided to use the melody of its former anthem "[[Bože pravde]]" as its new intermezzo anthem, but the [[Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska]] has declared such use of melody as unconstitutional as well, so the new anthem, "[[Moja Republika]]" was adopted. Both the new anthem (in relation to words ''moja zemlja'' - "my land") and new coat of arms have been contested by Bosniak members of National Assembly of Republika Srpska in front of the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska. The Court declared the coat of arms to be unconstitutional since it did not represent Bosniaks in any way, while it rejected the claim in relation to the anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celinac.eu/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=528:novim-grbom-republike-srpske-povrijeen-vitalni-nacionalni-interes-bonjaka&amp;catid=35:regionalne&amp;Itemid=72 "Novim grbom Republike Srpske povrijeđen vitalni nacionalni interes Bošnjaka"].

==Decision on the names of the cities==

===Decision on removal of prefix "Srpski" ("Serbian") from names of the municipalities===

On 30 July 2001, Sejfudin Tokić, Deputy Chair of the House of Peoples of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of its filing request, filed with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina a request for a review of constitutionality of Articles 11 and 11(a) of the Law on Territorial Organization and Local Self-Government (''Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska Nos. 11/94, 6/95, 26/95, 15/96, 17/96, 19/96, and 6/97'') and the title itself of the Law on the Town of Srpsko Sarajevo as well as its Articles 1 and 2 (''Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska Nos. 25/93, 8/96, 27/96 and 33/97''). The Court made its decision in 2004, in which it declared the laws that changed the names of the cities to ones with prefixes "srpski" (Serbian), were unconstitutional and had to be changed (which was done later). In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|The groups which are to be compared are in this case the Bosniac, Croat and Serb citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who should, according to a basic constitutional principle, be granted equal treatment throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the change of names by adding the adjective "srpski" before the names of certain towns or municipalities, by replacing a previous name with a new name indicating a Serb affiliation, or by eliminating in some cases the prefix "bosanski" demonstrates a clear intention and a wish to make it clear that the towns and municipalities concerned are to be regarded as exclusively Serb [...] In any case, the constitutional arguments against the choice of names indicating a specific Serb affiliation are so strong that in this case no reasonable proportionality exists between the means used and the aim sought to be realized [...] The Constitutional Court therefore concludes that the contested legal provisions are not consistent with the constitutional principle of the equality of the constituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, they constitute discrimination contrary to Article II(4) in conjunction with Article II(5) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In view of the fact that the provision of Article II(5) is an integral part of certain rights under Article II(3) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Constitutional Court concludes that this Article was also violated in the present case.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22779 U-44/01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215353/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=22779 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 49, 53, 55, [[Sarajevo]], 27 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The formal name of the item is ''U-44/01'', but it is widely known as the "Decision on the names of the cities" (Bosnian: ''Odluka o nazivima gradova'').

This judgement is important not only because it was unanimous (no division according to ethnic lines inside the Court), but also because it elaborates the collective equality of the constituent peoples and accepts the symbolic importance of names.

===Decision on removal of prefix "Bosanski" ("Bosnian") from names of the municipalities===

On 7 September 2009, the Bosniak Caucus in the Council of Peoples of the Republika Srpska, represented by its President Edin Ramić, lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina against the decision of the Council for the Protection of Vital Interest of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska (the "Council") No. UV-2/09 of 8 July 2009. At the same time the appellant sought a review of the constitutionality of the Rules of Procedure on the Operations of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska and, within that request, sought adoption of an interim measure.

Previously the Chairman of the Council of Peoples of the Republika Srpska initiated the procedure for the protection of vital national interest of Bosniak people under the Law on Territorial Organization of the Republika Srpska before the Council since that Law did not include prefix "Bosnian" in front of the names of the municipalities of Brod and Kostajnica, which had such prefix before, and this prefix was also absent in the names of the municipalities whose names had been previously changed (Gradiška, Novi Grad, Šamac and Kozarska Dubica). The Council had determined that the Law had not violated the vital national interest of Bosniak people. The appellants claimed that the Council had violated the provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina relating to non-discrimination, right to return and right to a fair hearing, as well as provisions of [[ECHR]] relating to non-discrimination and a right to a fair hearing. The majority (7-1) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|Once it is accepted that the adjective "Bosnian" does not relate to any of the constituent peoples, it is not possible to claim that the omission of that adjective from the name of the locality discriminates directly or indirectly any of the constituent peoples [...] [T]he only threat relate[s] to what the applicants adequately describe, in point 6 of their application, as a danger ... to cultural and historical identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the country itself does not have a right to non-discrimination, even if discrimination could be established [...] There does not exist evidence that the refugees and displaced persons would probably regard the naming of some locality that does not relate to any constituent people or geographical location of the country Bosnia and Herzegovina as creating a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility, [http://www.ccbh.ba/bos/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=275171 AP 2821/09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215512/http://www.ccbh.ba/bos/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=275171 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 31, 34, [[Sarajevo]], 26 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court also decided that the decision of the Council for the Protection of Vital Interest of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska is to be regarded as a "judgment of the court" in the meaning of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, against which an application can be made to the Constitutional Court. However, the Court decided that it did not have the jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the Rules of Procedure on the Operations of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska since the collective right of the constitutional peoples of the protection of the vital national interests is a right of political nature that is not covered by the scope of "civil rights and obligations" as understood by the Constitution or the ECHR.

==Decisions on relation of the law of B&amp;H and European Convention on Human Rights==
===Decision on the conformity of certain provisions of the Constitution of B&amp;H with the ECHR and its Protocols===

On 27 April 2004, [[Sulejman Tihić]], at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court for a review of conformity of the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.1(a), IV.3(b) and V.1) of the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with the provision of Article 14 of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] (henceforth: European Convention) and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention. Since the noted Articles of the Constitution establish a ''de iure'' discrimination, especially in relation to "Others" (i.e. those that are not members of "constituent peoples"), a question arose about a possible conflict between international and domestic law, moreover since the Constitution itself states (in its Article II.2), that the European Convention "shall have the priority over all other law". The applicant argued that this meant that the European Convention has a priority even over the Constitution and not only sub-constitutional legal documents. The Court rejected the request as inadmissible, stating:

{{quotation|[I]n the present case an examination of conformity of certain provisions of the Constitution of BiH with the European Convention is requested, the Constitutional Court notes that the rights under the European Convention cannot have a superior status to the Constitution of BiH. The European Convention, as an international document, entered into force by virtue of the Constitution of BiH, and therefore the constitutional authority derives from the Constitution of BiH and not from the European Convention itself [...] The Constitutional Court must always hold on to the text of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which in the present case does not allow for wider interpretation of its jurisdiction, in view of the obligation of the Constitutional Court to “uphold this Constitution”.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=37994 U-5/04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053157/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=37994 |date=28 September 2011 }}, p. 8, [[Sarajevo]], 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With this decision the Court has upheld the discriminatory nature of the Constitution and laws that find their legal basis in it. As a result Jakob Finci, the president of Jewish community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dervo Sejdić, a Roma who has been legally abridged from becoming a member of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] or a member of [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], have filed separate [[Sejdić and Finci v.

===Decision on conformity of Election Law of B&amp;H with ECHR===

On 6 September 2005, Sulejman Tihić, Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a review of conformity of Article 8.1 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention, and Articles 2(1)(c) and 5(1)(c) of the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This particularly related to the manner in which the members of the Presidency of B&amp;H were elected, as well as total bar from the Presidency of the "Others" in the Election Law of B&amp;H, which reflected almost identical constitutional provisions. The majority (7-2) of the Court rejected the request as inadmissible. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|[A]lthough the subject matter of the case at hand is not a review of conformity of the provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina but of the Election Law, it cannot be ignored that the challenged provision of the Election Law, ''de facto'', derive fully from the provisions of Article V of the Constitution of BiH, which remove any doubts as to its unconstitutionality. For these reasons, the Constitutional Court has no competence to decide because this would otherwise imply a review of conformity of the constitutional provision with the provisions of the international documents relating to the human rights, and it has already took the position that these, i.e. the European Convention, could not have a superior status in relation to the Constitution of BiH [...]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=43087 U-13/05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215545/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=43087 |date=16 July 2011 }}, p. 10, [[Sarajevo]], 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike the case U-5/04, here three judges (Grewe and Palavrić dissenting and Feldman submitting separate opinion) thought that the case was admissible since it did not challenge the Constitutional provisions but the Election Law. Still, the majority decided not to go to the merits stage.

===Decision on the appeal of Ilijaz Pilav===

On 20 September 2006, [[Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Ilijaz Pilav filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Ruling of Court of BiH of 10 August 2006, and Decisions of Central Election Commission of 1 August 2006 and of 24 July 2006, which rejected the application for certification of the candidate Pilav on the Party’s candidate list for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as Serb member, stating that he cannot be elected from the territory of Republika Srpska as he declares himself as Bosniak. Pilav and the Party argued that their rights have been violated, particularly that Pilav was discriminated on national/ethnic basis. The majority (7-2) of the Court decided against the applicants. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|There is no dispute that the provision of Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the provision of Article 8 of the Election Law have a restrictive character in a way that they restrict the rights of citizens with respect to the candidacy of Bosniaks and Croats from the territory of Republika Srpska and the Serbs from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to stand for election as members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the purpose of those provisions is strengthening of the position of constituent peoples in order to secure that the Presidency is composed of the representatives from amongst these three constituent peoples. Taking into account the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the restriction imposed by the Constitution and Election Law, which exist with respect to the appellants’ rights in terms of differential treatment of the appellant’s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are the Serbs and are directly elected from the territory of the Republika Srpska, is justified at this moment since there is a reasonable justification for such treatment. Therefore, given the current situation in BiH and specific nature of its constitutional order as well as bearing in mind the current constitutional and law arrangements, the challenged decisions of the Court of BiH and CEC did not violate the appellants’ rights under Article 1 of the Protocol no. 12 to the European Convention and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since the mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on the law. It means that they serve a legitimate aim, that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants’ rights are proportional to the objectives of general community in terms of preservation of the established peace, continuation of dialogue, and consequently creation of conditions for amending the mentioned provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Election Law.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility and Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=67930 AP-2678/06] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215631/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=67930 |date=16 July 2011 }}, p. 22, [[Sarajevo]], 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this case the Court, for the first time, rejected the request on the merits, rather that declaring it as ''prima facie'' inadmissible. Two of the dissenting judges (Grewe and Palavrić) were of the opinion that differential treatment challenged by the appeal is not justified in an objective or in a proportionate manner.

==Decision regarding the general principles of international law==

On 30 June 2009, Ilija Filipović, Chairman of the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] filed a request for review of the constitutionality of the Law on Protection of Domestic Production under the [[CEFTA]]. He also requested the Constitutional Court to issue an interim measure whereby it would suspend the application of the challenged Law pending a decision on the request, which the Court granted.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Interim Measure, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=245988 U-5/09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215651/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=245988 |date=16 July 2011 }}, Sarajevo, 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the initial problems for the Court was the fact that the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] does not contain any explicit provision defining the rank of international treaties in domestic law or attributing competence in this field to the Constitutional Court. In addition, the Court had to interpret the Article III(3)(b) which provides that the "[[Sources of international law#General principles of law|general principles of international law]] shall be an integral part of the law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities". The majority (6-3) of the Court decided in the favor of the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|Firstly the internationalization is one of the most characteristic general principles of
this Constitution [...] Secondly, there is no constitutional provision regulating the introduction of international treaties in domestic law as condition for their applicability; in particular, the Constitution does not prescribe to "transform" international rules in domestic law through a law [...] In this provision [Article III(3)(b)], the supremacy of the Constitution is closely linked either to the general principles of international law either to the competencies of the Constitutional Court, since the latter is charged with the constitutional review of the laws and more generally with the Constitution’s upholding (Article VI). Consequently, the competence of the Constitutional Court cannot be generally excluded. The question is nonetheless whether the general principles of international law entail any indication on the relationship between domestic laws and ratified international treaties. The Constitutional Court observes that one of the fundamental principles of international law, as referred to by the applicant, is the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' [...] Pursuant to the rule of ''pacta sunt servanda'' which constitutes an ''integral part of the law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities'', within the meaning of Article III(3)(b) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the CEFTA Convention imposes obligations on Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of multilateral treaties entered into by SFRY and taken over by Bosnia and Herzegovina. In view of the aforesaid, the Constitutional Court concludes that it is at least competent to review the laws which are adopted on the subjects having been previously covered by ratified treaties with regard to Articles VI(3)(a) and VI(3)(c) [...] In view of the aforesaid, the Constitutional Court holds that, pursuant to the rule of ''pacta sunt servanda'', there is an indisputable obligation of the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and first of all of the legislator, to comply with the provisions of the treaties and to execute them in good faith. Consequently, there is an obligation of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring all laws into line with the provisions of the CEFTA.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility and Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=250407 U-5/09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215715/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=250407 |date=16 July 2011 }}, p. 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, [[Sarajevo]], 25 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the Court established that the Law on the Protection of the Domestic Production under the CEFTA is inconsistent with Article III(3)(b) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that it is quashed in its entirety.

In their Separate Joint Dissenting Opinion judges Feldman and Pantiru recognized the importance of ''pacta sunt servanda'' principle but still held that it has no more weight than laws passed by the legislators at the state or entity level and that it does not in any case entail giving provisions of treaties a status superior to that of Laws under the Constitution. Similarly, the President of the Court, Simović, in his dissenting opinion noted that "if interpreted in this manner, the entire international treaty law obtains a constitutional law level, which has not been the intention of the author of the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Separate Dissenting Opinion of the President, Prof. Dr. Miodrag Simović, U-5/09, p.5, [[Sarajevo]], 25 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision on proportional representation in legislature of B&amp;H==

On 16 November 2009, Sulejman Tihić, then Chairman of the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the review of constitutionality of several Articles of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Rules of Procedure of the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The applicant claimed that although the principle of proportional representation of the three constituent peoples and other citizens has been respected in the executive of the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska, as well as in the organs of the public authority and courts in the entities, it is not respected with regards the structure of the legislature in Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the state and entity levels) according to the [[Census#Bosnia-Herzegovina|census from 1991]], and that the particular voting procedure in the House of Representatives, popularly called "the entity voting", has thus been transformed into "ethnic voting" where the ethnic majority from one or the other entity can promote its interests, as opposed to the interests and will of the other two constituent peoples from either entities, as well as the will of other citizens from the territory of those entities. Thus, the applicant claimed that the indicated provisions of the Electoral Law are not in conformity with the lines 3, 8 and 9 of the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and with the Article I/2 of the Constitution. The Court unanimously decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|The Constitutional Court observes that neither the disputed Articles, nor the Election Law in general, contain any provision that grants any of the constitutional peoples the privileged status. Also, the Constitutional Court notes that there is no provision in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina that imposes an obligation on the legislator that the Election Law has to contain the provision on the mechanisms for ensuring the proportional representation of the constituent peoples regardless of the election results. In relation to the request of the applicant for assessment of the constitutionality of the disputed Articles of the Election Law because they do not contain provisions that, in the opinion of the applicant, they had to contain, the Constitutional Court emphasizes that the review of constitutionality cannot refer to something that the legislator had not prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility and Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/bos/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=266535 U-13/09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220130/http://www.ccbh.ba/bos/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=266535 |date=16 July 2011 }}, para. 34, [[Sarajevo]], 30 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Court had particularly reiterated its previous decisions in the cases U-5/98 and U-8/04, with regards the notion of "effective participation of the constituent peoples in state authorities" which in principle means that officials appointed to positions in institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be representative reflection of advanced co-existence of all peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but that if such participation falls outside the constitutional framework, it must never be carried out or imposed at the expense of efficient operation of the state and its authorities.

==Decisions on international position of entities==
===Decision on constitutionality of political lobbying of foreign governments and international organizations by RS===

On 15 September 2008, [[Haris Silajdžić]], at the time the Chairman of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency of B&amp;H]], lodged the request with the Constitutional Court in which it was requested that it should establish that the Decision of the [[Government of Republika Srpska|Government of RS]] granting consent to the Agreement entered into between [https://web.archive.org/web/20100530000058/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=3183894853-03 Hill &amp; Knowlton International Belgium] and the [[Republika Srpska|RS]] and the Memorandum of Agreement entered into between [[Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates]] and the RS, Conclusion of the RS Government, Memorandum of Agreement entered into between Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates and the RS and its Annex I, item 614700 of the RS Budget for 2008 and item 614700 of the RS Budget for 2009 (on the allocation of funds for the RS's representation abroad), and the activities of the RS carried out in the USA either directly or indirectly on the basis of the Memorandum of Agreement through the authorized Agent Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates and directed towards the government, institutions and officials of the USA and officials of some international organizations, are inconsistent with Articles III(1)(a) and (b), III(3)(b), V(3)(a) and (c) and V(4)(a) of the Constitution of B&amp;H. The majority (7-2) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|The Constitutional Court holds it unnecessary to define the Bosnia and Herzegovina’s foreign policy framework but it needs to underline the undisputed fact that foreign policy and foreign trade policy are the sole responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as stipulated in Article III(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of BiH. Also, the Constitutional Court of BiH recalls that the Entities have a constitutional basis for adopting their budgets, which determine a financial framework for revenue and expenditure. In the present case, the adoption of such a budget whereby the funds are allocated, inter alia, for the Republika Srpska’s representation abroad is not per se inconsistent with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as it does not constitute a takeover of or interference with foreign policy and foreign trade policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the Constitutional Court of BiH considers that the issue of compliance with the constitutional division of responsibilities between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities may be raised in case where the activities, which are undertaken by officials of the Entities and financed from the budgets of the Entities, constitute a takeover of or interference with some of the responsibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering the activities undertaken by the Republika Srpska in the present case, the Constitutional Court of BiH holds that it did not relate to the establishment of diplomatic relations with another country, the conclusion of an agreement with another country or international organisation, nor did the Republika Srpska, through the aforementioned activities, represented itself abroad as an independent state, which would bring into question the division of responsibilities in respect of foreign policy and foreign trade policy. The Constitutional Court of BiH holds that the aforementioned activities undertaken by the Republika Srpska were aimed at lobbying abroad for the interest of the Republika Srpska as an Entity. Therefore, the Constitutional Court of BiH holds that the activities undertaken by the Republika Srpska as well as the formal acts passed by the Republika Srpska as the basis for any such activities contain nothing that relates to the sole responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the field of foreign affairs or foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility and Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=246010 U-15/08] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053113/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=246010 |date=28 September 2011 }}, para. 35 and 36, [[Sarajevo]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An important aspect of the Decision was the fact that the request was unanimously found to be admissible since it was held that a series of formal acts and activities undertaken by one of the Entities may raise an issue of existence of a dispute between the Entity and B&amp;H over an issue under the Constitution of B&amp;H in respect of which the Constitutional Court of BiH has sole jurisdiction to decide.

In her dissenting opinion, joint by judge Mirsad Ćeman, judge [[Seada Palavrić]] criticized the Court for not giving a definition of foreign policy and foreign trade policy, since, in her opinion, only a detailed interpretation could assist in determination of the exclusive competence of B&amp;H in this area. She also reiterated the earlier decisions of the Court with regards the lack of international personality of the RS, while the analysis of the relevant documentation show that RS had acted not as an integral part of B&amp;H but as an independent state conducting its foreign policy in an nontransparent matter.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Separate Dissenting Opinion of the Vice-President Seada Palavrić, U-15/08, p. 17-19, Sarajevo, 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision on the constitutionality of communication of RS with United Nations Security Council===

On 24 November 2009, [[Beriz Belkić]], at the time the Deputy Chairman of the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]] of the Parliamentary Assembly of B&amp;H, filed a request with the Constitutional Court for review of the constitutionality of the Second Report of the [[Republika Srpska|RS]] submitted to the [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] on the Situation in B&amp;H of 16 November 2009, as well as for review of the constitutionality of the activities of the RS taken either directly or indirectly through its authorized agent and directed towards the UNSC. The majority (5-3) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

{{quotation|[...] Constitutional Court will not give a definition of foreign policy in the case at hand. However, while considering the activities taken by the Republika Srpska in the case at hand and taking into account the content of the challenged Second Report of the Republika Srpska to the Security Council on the Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. the submission of the mentioned Report to the UN Security Council, the Constitutional Court considers that the contested report and activities do not represent a report of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina nor they have in any way represented the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina before the UN Security Council in a way that would bring into question the constitutional division of competencies in terms of foreign policy. The Constitutional Court notes that there is nothing in the activities taken by the Government of the Republika Srpska by drafting and submitting the challenged Second Report to the UN Security Council on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina that could be considered foreign policy and thus included in the exclusive responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, the Constitutional Court holds that in the present case there is no violation of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular as to the division of responsibilities between the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its Entities, i.e. no legally relevant activity based on the challenged Report was taken to the detriment of the constitutional position of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Decision on Admissibility and Merits, [http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=318936 U-15/09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053136/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/odluke/povuci_html.php?pid=318936 |date=28 September 2011 }}, para. 42 and 43, [[Sarajevo]], 27 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Importantly, the Court held that the acts and activities taken by one of the Entities, even of political nature, may raise an issue as to the existence of a dispute between the Entity and B&amp;H over a matter under the Constitution of B&amp;H, which only the Constitutional Court is competent to resolve.

Judge Mirsad Ćeman filed a dissenting opinion, joint by judges Seada Palavrić and [[Valerija Galić]], in which he criticized the Court for not defining the term "foreign policy". Also, in his opinion the challenged activities of the RS included the matters and positions which, by their nature, fall within the scope of the foreign policy of B&amp;H and, as such, they are within the sole responsibility of the B&amp;H. He also held that the Government of RS, through the preparation and submission of the challenged Second Report, acted unilaterally on the international scene, which constituted an interference with the responsibilities of the State of B&amp;H by the Entity. Finally, he did not agree with the majority that no legally relevant activity based on the challenged Report was taken to the detriment of the constitutional position of the B&amp;H, since the preparation and submission of the challenged Second Report constituted such an activity and the damages for B&amp;H arising from that activity are reflected in damages to the constitutional capacity, sovereignty and international subjectivity of B&amp;H as a state.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Separate Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mirsad Ćeman, U-15/09, p. 21-23, Sarajevo, 27 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9924">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Mayotte'''. These are the [[mammal]] species in [[Mayotte]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 0 are endangered, 1 is vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

This article lists '''political parties in Wallis and Futuna'''.
[[Wallis and Futuna]] has a [[multi-party system]] with numerous [[political parties]], in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.

==The parties==
&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''.--&gt;

Some of the [[List of political parties in France|French political parties]] are active in Wallis and Futuna.

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

==Environment and evolution==

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

'''Plant collecting''' is the acquisition of plant specimens for the purposes of research, cultivation, or as a hobby. Plant specimens may be kept alive, but are more commonly dried and pressed to preserve the quality of the specimen. Plant collecting is an ancient practice with records of a Chinese botanist collecting roses over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plant Hunters|last=Whittle|first=T|publisher=Heinemann|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbaria]] are collections of preserved plants samples and their associated data for scientific purposes. The largest herbarium in the world exist at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], in Paris, France. Plant samples in herbaria typically include a reference sheet with information about the plant and details of collection. This detailed and organized system of filing provides horticulturist and other researchers alike with a way to find information about a certain plant, and a way to add new information to an existing plant sample file.

The collection of live plant specimens from the wild, sometimes referred to as '''plant hunting''',  is an activity that has occurred for centuries. The earliest recorded evidence of plant hunting was in 1495 BC when botanists were sent to [[Somalia]] to collect incense trees for [[Queen Hatshepsut]]. The [[Victorian era]] saw a surge in plant hunting activity as botanical adventurers explored the world to find exotic plants to bring home, often at considerable personal risk. These plants usually ended up in [[botanical garden]]s or the private gardens of wealthy collectors. Prolific plant hunters in this period included [[William Lobb]] and his brother [[Thomas Lobb]], [[George Forrest (botanist)|George Forrest]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], [[Charles Maries]] and [[Robert Fortune]].

== Plant pressing ==
Proper pressing and mounting techniques are critical to the longevity of a collected plant sample. Properly preserved plant samples can last for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/collecting-plants|title=Collecting Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Botanical Garden]] itself holds plant samples that date back to the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804–1806.

=== Sample gathering ===
The first step of plant pressing begins with the collection of the sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the date of collection or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing And Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/AgandNaturalResources/MT198359AG.pdf|title=How to Collect, Press and Mount Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compression ====
After cleaning the sample of any mud or dirt, the next step is to press the sample. Some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with tightened straps around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent [[Blotting paper|blotter]]. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7–10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/how-to-press-and-preserve-plants/|title=How to Press and Preserve Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mounting ====
After the plant sample has been sufficiently dried and pressed, it must be mounted. The quality of mounting not only impacts the appearance of the plant sample, but also determines the rate of deterioration the sample will experience. Herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper for the best protection against deterioration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/botany/resources/general-information/how-to-make-a-plant-collection/|title=Making a Plant Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper can either be 100% alpha cellulose paper or cotton “rag” paper. These types of paper are ideal for preserving plant samples because they are acid free and pH neutral. Samples can be strapped to the paper with linen tape, or glued onto the sheet. If glue is needed, it is recommended that Grade A [[methyl cellulose]] mixed with water be used for optimal deterioration resistance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Storage ====
In order for plant specimens to be kept in good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should be kept in a low light, low [[humidity]] environment. The temperature of the storage space should be kept cool, between 50 – 65 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brit.org/herbarium/plantcollecting/storage|title=BRIT Herbarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep the storage space free of harmful pest. It is recommended to protect the specimens by sheathing the sheets in sealed plastic bags. Various [[pesticide]]s may also be used to protect the storage space from pest infestation. If pest infestation has already occurred, the samples should be frozen for three to four days. Freezing new additions of plant samples is a suggested preventative measure against the introduction of pest to the storage space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collection of herbarium specimens ==
[[Herbarium]] specimens of plants are collected for a number of different uses. They can assist in  accurate identification and provide a species record for a time and place that can be used in distribution maps. They can also provide biological material for researchers, a reference point to document scientific names and vouchers for research and seed collections.&lt;ref name=qh&gt;{{cite paper|editor=Bean, A.R.|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, A Manual|url=http://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|publisher=
Queensland Herbarium, Environmental Protection Agency Biodiversity Sciences unit, Brisbane
|date=2006|isbn=1-920928-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA barcoding, a new method of identification of plant vouchers, is being used in herbaria across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/dnabarcode/index.htm|title=Plant DNA Barcode Project|website=botany.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] creates their barcodes from a short sequence of plant DNA, which can be easily identified from all healthy specimens of the species. This barcode is then printed and placed onto the plant mount. By creating these DNA barcodes, the process of organizing and loaning plant specimens becomes more streamlined and can be mechanized.

===Voucher specimens===
 
Voucher specimens are select herbarium specimens. What distinguishes these specimens from others is that a voucher specimen is a "representative sample of an expertly identified organism." These specimens are usually associated with a professional research article and are considered to be more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why vouchers matter in botanical research1|first=Theresa M.|last=Culley|date=29 October 2013|publisher=|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=1|issue=11|doi=10.3732/apps.1300076|pmid=25202501|pmc=4103463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant collecting as a hobby ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

Plant collecting may also refer to a hobby, in which the hobbyist takes identifiable samples of [[plant]] species found in nature, dries them, and stores them in a paper sheet album, a simple [[herbarium]], along with the information of the finding location, finding date, etc. necessary scientific information. As in many [[collecting]] hobbies, rarer specimens have been valued. However, when collecting living organisms, the [[Conservation ethic|conservation aspects]] must precede the collector's ambitions. This has led in some cases to a collector voluntarily taking part, helping scientists, in some research areas, provided he can store the "[[collectible]]". In fact, historically, many [[species]] have initially been found within a collection of a collector.

Usually, a plant can be identified in nature, since they are stationary.
The advent of [[digital camera]]s has led many plant collectors to switch totally to [[photography]]. Some have switched to collecting live specimens of various plant species in their gardens, building a sort of "private [[botanical garden]]". Some have specialized in a specific group, the [[orchid]]s and the [[rose]]s and their [[cultivar]]s are among the most collected.

== Poaching ==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
Illegal collection of plants is known as plant poaching. A report on the risk of rare plant [[poaching]] has provided data showing possible connections between geography and the rate of poaching in the [[Shenandoah National Park]], Virginia, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John A.|last2=Manen|first2=Frank T. van|last3=Thatcher|first3=Cindy A.|date=2011-09-01|title=Geographic Profiling to Assess the Risk of Rare Plant Poaching in Natural Areas|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=577–587|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|issn=0364-152X|bibcode=2011EnMan..48..577Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The openings for poaching were found to be increased in locations with easy accessibility, such as roads, trails, and developed areas. The condition of the environment can determine the levels of poaching, with regions of higher quality receiving more attention from poachers.

=== Ethics ===

The hobby and practice of plant collecting is known to have been the cause of declines in certain plant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=David A.|last2=Lord|first2=Janice M.|last3=Given|first3=David R.|last4=Lange|first4=Peter J. De|date=1994-01-01|title=Over-Collecting: An Overlooked Factor in the Decline of Plant Taxa|jstor=1222876|journal=Taxon|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–185|doi=10.2307/1222876}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the result of hobbyists being oblivious to the status of a particular species, collectors of valuable species for profit, or researchers over collecting to fill slots in herbaria. This issue can be solved with proper research on the status of species before a plant is collected and taking the smallest sample possible.

== Safety and precautions ==
While plant collecting may seem like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in [[hiking]] there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a [[National park]] of the [[United States]], plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the country of collection and to the destination country. The major herbaria can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;

If traveling to a remote location to access samples, it is safe practice to inform someone of your whereabouts and planned time of return. If traveling in hot weather, collectors should bring adequate water to avoid dehydration. Forms of sun protection such as sunscreen and wide brimmed hats may be essential depending on location. Travel to remote locations will most likely involve walking measurable distances in wild terrain, so precautions synonymous with those related to [[hiking]] should be taken.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, a manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Plant "discovery" means the first time that a new plant was recorded for science, often in the form of dried and pressed plants (a [[herbarium]] specimen) being sent to a botanical establishment such as [[Kew Gardens]] in London, where it would be examined, classified and named.&lt;ref name="Musgrave"&gt;{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | date=1999|pages= 10–11| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant "introduction" means the first time that living matter – seed, cuttings or a whole plant – was brought back to Europe. Thus, the [[Handkerchief tree]] (''[[Davidia involucrata]]'') was discovered by [[Père David]] in 1869 but introduced to Britain by [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest Wilson]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

[[File:Flamingo Flower Orchid.JPG|thumb|Flamingo Flower]]

Often, the two happened simultaneously: thus Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] discovered and introduced his Himalayan [[rhododendron]]s between 1849 and 1851.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

The '''Portland Bight Protected Area''' (PBPA) was created by the Jamaican government in 1999 to protect a large marine and terrestrial area on the island of [[Jamaica]] located southeast of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Nearby cays such as [[Little Goat Island]] are included. It is the largest protected area in Jamaica and comprises {{Convert|724|mi2}}. Although the first priority in forming the protected area was to protect the [[coral reef]]s,&lt;ref name=pbpa&gt;{{cite web|last=Linton|title=Preliminary Report of Coral Reef Monitoring of the Portland Bight Protected Area (PBPA)|url=http://www.icran.org/pdf/PBPA%20monitoring%20Report.pdf|work=PDF|publisher=Centre for Marine Sciences University of the West Indies|accessdate=20 October 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also serves to protect vulnerable and [[endemic]] species.  The PBPA includes {{Convert|32|mi2}} of [[wetlands]] on the island, and coastlines of [[mangroves]], as well as [[sea-grass]] beds that serve as a nursery for fish and shellfish breeding. The Caribbean Coastal Area Management Foundation (C-CAM) has been charged with managing zones within the protected area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai2.htm |title=CSI Activities (Portland Bight, Jamaica) |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seacology&gt;{{cite web|title=Secology Island Projects|url=http://www.seacology.org/projects/individualprojects/JAMAICA_PBPA.htm|publisher=Seacology|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On land there are {{Convert|81|mi2}} of dry limestone forests, 60 known caves,&lt;ref name=jco&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart, RS|title=The Caves of Portland Bight, Jamaica (C-CAM Report)|url=http://www.jamaicancaves.org/portland-bight-caves.pdf|work=PDF|publisher=Jamaican Caves Organisation|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes a population of 50,000. Part of the task in forming the PBPA going forward is to find a balance between protecting the ecosystem from destruction by economic development and allowing the human inhabitants a means to live and work.&lt;ref name=Serju&gt;{{cite news|last=Serju|first=Christopher|title=Stakeholders aim to preserve the Portland Bight Protected Area|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120519/lead/lead6.html|accessdate=20 October 2012|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 29, 2013, the PNP Government of Jamaica is proposing to develop the Goat Islands, in the PBPA, as a transhipment hub in conjunction with the Chinese government. Environmentalists argue that this will have a severe impact on the entire protected area.&lt;ref name=pbpa-pr&gt;{{cite web|last=JET|title=Press Release - Portland Bight Protected Area|url=http://www.jamaicancaves.org/portland-bight-press-release.htm|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Jamaican Caves Organisation|date=August 29, 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbpa-jo&gt;{{cite news|last=Jamaica Observer|title=Officials insist Goat Islands must be protected|url=http://www.jamaicancaves.org/portland-bight-observer.htm|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Jamaica Observer - JCO Mirror|date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 23, 2016, the current Prime Minister, Andrew Holness of the JLP, has stated that the Goat Islands are no longer being considered as a base for a transhipment hub.&lt;ref name=pbpa-jg&gt;{{cite news|last=Jamaica Gleaner|title=Transshipment project under consideration, but not for Goat Islands – PM|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20160923/transshipment-project-under-consideration-not-goat-islands-pm|publisher=Jamaica Gleaner - September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="741">'''Puentes Grandes''' (Spanish for "large bridges") is a neighborhood in the municipality of [[Playa, Havana|Playa]], [[Havana]], in [[Cuba]].

==Overview==
The old neighborhood of Puentes Grandes had its origin at the end of the 16th century. It formed in one of the first neighborhoods that were established in the surroundings of Havana.  The local amenity attracted several families of the capital, which there built summer mansions to swim in the pure waters of the [[Almendares River]].

'''Sabkhat Ghuzayyil''' is [[Libya]]'s lowest point at 47 meters (154 feet) below sea level, and is just southeast of the [[Gulf of Sidra]].  It is located in the [[Al Wahat District]] of the [[Cyrenaica]] region in northeastern Libya.

The area is dry today but in the [[Holocene Wet Phase]] it was flooded.

[[Ajdabiya]] is the main city in the area which is located just northeast of the coastal areas below sea level. [[Brega]] is a smaller city located more westerly near the shore and is wedged between the sea and these low-lying lands.

'''Shaba North''' was the launch site of the first [[rocket]]s launched by Orbital Transport und Raketen AktienGesellschaft, or Orbital Forwarding Company in [[English Language|English]] ("[[OTRAG]]").   It is located in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] at {{coord|8|00|S|28|30|E|display=inline,title}}.  

In 1977 and in 1978 three test flights of OTRAG rockets were launched from Shaba North.  

In 1979 OTRAG stopped launching rockets from Shaba North for political reasons. Its launching activities were later moved to [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], [[Libya]].

A '''skyline''' is the [[horizon]] created by a city's overall structure, or by human intervention in a non-urban setting or in nature. City skylines serve as a kind of [[fingerprint]] as no two skylines are alike. For this reason, news and sports programs, television shows, and movies often display the skyline of a city to set a location. The term ''The Sky Line of [[New York City]]'' was first introduced in 1896, when it was the title of a color [[lithography|lithograph]] by Charles Graham for the color supplement of the ''New York Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/art/print/exhibits/movingup/labelx.htm |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |title=Moving Uptown |quote="When Charles Graham's view of New York was published, the new term used in the title, "sky line," caught on immediately." |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229044701/http://web-static.nypl.org/exhibitions/movingup/labelx.htm |archivedate=2014-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul D. Spreiregen, [[FAIA]], has called a skyline "a physical representation [of a city's] facts of life ... a potential work of art ... its collective vista."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some natural skylines have been unintentionally modified for commercial reasons.

==Features==

===High-rise buildings===
{{Main|High-rise building}}

[[High-rise building]]s, including [[skyscraper]]s, are the fundamental feature of [[urban area|urban]] skylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tall Buildings and the Urban Skyline: The Effect of Visual Complexity on Preferences |first1=Tom |last1=Heath |first2=Sandy G. |last2=Smith |first3=Bill |last3=Lim |date=July 2000 |issn=0013-9165 |journal=Environment and Behavior |url=http://eab.sagepub.com/content/32/4/541.abstract |doi=10.1177/00139160021972658 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=541–556 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703064228/http://eab.sagepub.com/content/32/4/541.abstract |archivedate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Skyscraper geography |first=Donald |last=McNeill |doi=10.1191/0309132505ph527oa |journal=Progress Human Geography |date=February 2005 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=41–55 |quote=geographers have tended to neglect the substantial impact of skyscrapers on urban life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towers===
Towers from different [[era]]s make for contrasting skylines.

[[San Gimignano]], in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], has been described as having an "unforgettable skyline" with its competitively built towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/550|title=Historic Centre of San Gimignano|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|website=whc.unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804214722/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/550|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Stadium}}
The [[Colosseum]] and 2008 [[Beijing Olympic Stadium]] give varied sport stadium skylines.

===Remote locations===
Some remote locations have striking skylines, created either by nature or by sparse human settlement in an environment not conducive to housing significant populations.

==Architectural features==

===Notable architects influencing skyline===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|[[Nuremberg]] in September 1936.]]
[[Norman Foster]] served as architect for [[30 St Mary Axe|the Gherkin]] in [[London]] and the [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], and these buildings have to added to their cities' skylines.

[[Albert Speer]] made a notable night time skyline with searchlights at [[Nuremberg]].

==Use of skylines in media==
Skylines are sometimes used as backgrounds for movies, television shows, news [[website]]s, and in other forms of media.

==Subjective ranking of skylines==
Several services rank skylines based on their own subjective criteria. [[Emporis]] is one such service, which uses height and other data to give point values to buildings and add them together for skylines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4183">'''Ukupseni''', also called '''Playón Chico''', is one of the most populous islands in the [[Guna Yala]] territory of [[Panama]], {{convert|100|m}} from the mainland.  The literal translation for Ukupseni is "little beach" in [[English language|English]], or ''playa chica'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], thus ''Playón Chico'' is a mistranslation, which means roughly "Little Big Beach".

Ukupseni is a small island, roughly ¼–⅓&amp;nbsp;mi², or 300–400&amp;nbsp;yd². The population of the island is about 3,000, which gives Ukupseni a population density of 8,000–12,000 people per square mile.

== Housing ==
[[File:Thatched houses on Playón Chico (Ukupseni).jpg|right|270px|thumb|Houses on Playón Chico]]
Ukupseni is populated by [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]].  The typical housing structure is a "pole"-style thatch hut, which will house an entire family.  Building materials are tree trunks for the main pillars, bamboo poles for support, and various types of leaves for the roof.  Walls are typically lashed bamboo or ''caña blanca'' (cane).  A well-constructed hut can stand for as long as 30 years.

The elderly will often be cared for by their children, and so one family dwelling will often house several generations.

== Transportation ==
Ukupseni lays approximately {{convert|100|m}} from the Panama mainland. [[Playón Chico Airport]] {{airport codes|PYC}} is located on the mainland adjacent to the island. Ukupseni is only reachable by plane, boat, or by foot.  

There is no road to Ukupseni. There is now a bridge connecting Ukupseni to the mainland. This is extremely useful, as the majority of local agriculture, schooling, the airport, and potable water are on the mainland.

Aside from the bridge, the second most popular form of transportation is the ''kayuco'' (hollowed-out tree [[canoe]]).  Kayucos range in sizes and styles.  Extremely large kayucos, some more than 4&amp;nbsp;ft wide are used, and others vary in size down to one-person boats.  

A typical kayuco is similar to a Western-style canoe.  Even though kayukos travel in the ocean they do not have a lateral brace and balance as found on [[Outrigger canoe|Polynesian ocean-going craft]].  A distinct, low-profile kayuco is used for navigating rivers.

== Economy ==
[[File:YandupIsland.jpg|right|270px|thumb|Yandup island cabins]]
Ukupseni is mostly autonomous, in that it grows most of its own food.  Colombian ships travel through Kuna Yala, and Kunas sell coconuts in exchange for goods, including hammocks and other supplies. Lobster, crab, and fish are sold to seafood airplanes on the Ukupseni airstrip.

Community projects are conducted by the local government for various needs throughout the year, and every citizen is required to help.

There are two lodges in private islands nearby, Yandup island and Iskardup island. Both are owned and ran by Kunas from Ukupseni, as it is part of the Kuna law that only Kunas can own businesses in Kuna Yala. These lodges also provide jobs as guides, cooks, handymen, maids and other works to Ukupseni's inhabitants, plus a larger income for fishermen and handicraft sellers, being the Mola the most famous handicraft of the Kunas.

== Geography ==
Ukupseni, along with the vast majority of the rest of the [[San Blas Islands]] lies atop a [[coral reef]] that has broken the surface of the ocean.  This island is enlarged constantly by people depositing earth, rock, waste, or other debris in order to create a large living area on the island.  The elevation of these islands is about 1½&amp;nbsp;feet above sea level.  

Local tides in the area fluctuate the level of the water by 4–11&amp;nbsp;inches.  Occasionally a "super-high tide" of about 18&amp;nbsp;inches will saturate the outer parts of the island.

There are several reef islands in close proximity to Ukupseni.  Most are not inhabited, but some have tourist hotels on them.  The closest populated island is [[San Ignacio de Tupile]], a few miles due east.  The mainland communities of [[Irgandi]] and [[Ukupa]] lie to the northwest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52495">In addition to its [[Member states of the United Nations|{{UNnum}} member states]], the '''United Nations General Assembly''' may grant '''observer status''' to an [[international organization]], entity or non-member [[Sovereign state|state]], which entitles the entity to participate in the work of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], though with limitations. The General Assembly may determine what privileges it grants with the [[observer status]], such as a right to speak at General Assembly meetings, vote on procedural matters, serve as signatories on working papers, and sign resolutions,{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- do all observer get all of these rights automatically? --&gt; but not to sponsor resolutions or vote on [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution|resolutions]] of substantive matters. Exceptionally, the [[European Union|EU]] was granted in 2011 the right to speak in debates, to submit proposals and amendments, the right of reply, to raise points of order and to circulate documents, etc. {{As of|May 2011}}, the EU was the only international organisation to hold these enhanced rights, which has been likened to the rights of full membership,&lt;ref name="win"/&gt; short of the right to vote.

Observer status may be granted by a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution]]. The status of a permanent observer is based purely on practice of the General Assembly, and there are no provisions for it in the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="partlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/about-permanent-observers/index.html|title=United Nations - Permanent Observers|author=|date=|website=un.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502165825/http://www.un.org/en/members/aboutpermobservers.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction has been made between state and non-state observers. Non-member states, which are members of one or more [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agencies]], can apply for the status of permanent observer state.&lt;ref name="partlist"/&gt; Non-state observers are the [[international organizations]] and other entities.

==United Nations member state qualifications==
Article 4 of Chapter II of the [[United Nations Charter]] specifies the qualifications for membership in the United Nations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=UN Charter |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208031716/https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=UN Charter |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208031716/https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An [[member states of the United Nations#Membership terms|application for membership]] must be approved by the [[United Nations Security Council]]&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; (which is subject to a veto) and then the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/members/about.shtml |title=About UN Membership |publisher=United Nations |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092224/http://www.un.org/en/members/about.shtml |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-member observer states==
{{See also|Holy See and the United Nations|Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations}}

The General Assembly may invite non-member entities to participate in the work of the United Nations without formal membership, and has done so on numerous occasions. Such participants are described as observers, some of which may be further classified as non-member state observers. Most former non-member observer states accepted observer status at a time when they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto by one or more of the [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members of the Security Council]]. The grant of observer status is made by the General Assembly only, and not subject to a Security Council veto.

In some circumstances a state may elect to become an observer rather than full member. For example, to preserve its neutrality while participating in its work, [[Switzerland]] chose to remain a permanent non-member state observer from 1948 until it became a member in 2002. The Holy See did not wish to join the United Nations as a member because "Membership in the organization would not seem to be consonant with the provisions of Article 24 of the [[Lateran Treaty]], particularly as regards spiritual status and participation in possible use of force."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Crawford (jurist)|James Crawford]], The Creation of States in International Law, (1979) p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Since April 6, 1964, the Holy See has accepted permanent observer state status at the United Nations, which was regarded as a diplomatic courtesy, to enable the Vatican to participate in the UN's humanitarian activities and in the promotion of peace.

===Present non-member observer states===
As of 2015, there are two permanent non-member observer states at the United Nations: the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. The Holy See uncontroversially obtained its non-member observer state status in 1964 and Palestine was so designated in 2012, following an application for full membership in 2011&lt;ref name=palmember&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39722&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1=| title=Ban sends Palestinian application for UN membership to Security Council| publisher=United Nations| date=23 September 2011| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703164241/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39722&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1=| archivedate=3 July 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has not yet been put to a UN Security Council vote largely due to the U.S. pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/11/united-nations-delays-palestinian-statehood-vote|title=UN vote on Palestinian state put off amid lack of support|last=McGreal|first=Chris|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=27 October 2018|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Holy See and the State of Palestine are described as "Non-member States having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining permanent observer missions at Headquarters".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/members/nonmembers.shtml UN site on Permanent Missions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209033633/http://www.un.org/members/nonmembers.shtml |date=February 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The change of Palestinian observer status in 2012 from "non-member observer entity" to "non-member observer state" was regarded as an "upgrade" of their status. Many called the change "symbolic",&lt;ref&gt;American Society of International Law, 7 December 2012: [http://www.asil.org/insights/volume/16/issue/37/legal-implications-un-general-assembly-vote-accord-palestine-status Legal Implications of the UN General Assembly Vote to Accord Palestine the Status of Observer State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929222717/http://www.asil.org/insights/volume/16/issue/37/legal-implications-un-general-assembly-vote-accord-palestine-status |date=2015-09-29 }}, by John Cerone&lt;/ref&gt; but which was regarded as providing new leverage to the Palestinians in their dealings with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;CNN, November 30, 2012: [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/29/world/meast/palestinian-united-nations/ U.N. approves Palestinian 'observer state' bid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929111227/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/29/world/meast/palestinian-united-nations/ |date=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in the change in status, the [[United Nations Secretariat]] recognized Palestine's right to become a party to treaties for which the UN Secretary-General is the [[depositary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ola/media/info_from_lc/POB%20COJUR.pdf|title=EU Council Working Group on Public International Law - COJUR|last=O’Brien|first=Patricia|author-link1=Patricia O’Brien|date=2013-02-06|accessdate=2016-04-25|publisher=[[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911124208/http://legal.un.org/ola/media/info_from_lc/POB%20COJUR.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seating in the [[United Nations General Assembly Hall|General Assembly Hall]] is arranged with non-member observer states being seated immediately after [[List of United Nations member states|UN member states]], and before other observers.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES58314"/&gt;  On 10 September 2015, the General Assembly resolved to approve the raising at the UN of the flags of non-member observer states alongside those of the 193 UN member states.&lt;ref&gt;AP, The Big Story, 10 September 2015: [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a2eb7a4214a34269ae97f78a4efd204d/un-strongly-approves-palestinian-proposal-raise-flag UN strongly approves Palestinian proposal to raise flag] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150930115300/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a2eb7a4214a34269ae97f78a4efd204d/un-strongly-approves-palestinian-proposal-raise-flag |date=2015-09-30 }}, by Cara Anna and Edith M.

Most of the former non-member observer states accepted this status at a time when they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto of one or more of the [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members of the Security Council]]. The vetoes were later overcome either by changes in geopolitical circumstances, or by "package deals" under which the Security Council approved multiple new member states at the same time, as was done with a dozen countries in 1955 and with East and West Germany in 1973.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Entities and international organizations==
Many [[intergovernmental organization]]s and a few other entities ([[non-governmental organization]]s and others with various degrees of statehood or sovereignty), are invited to become observers at the General Assembly. Some of them maintain a permanent office in the United Nations headquarters in [[New York City]], while others do not; however, this is the choice of the organization and does not imply differences in their status.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/INF/63/6&amp;Lang=E {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110215713/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FINF%2F63%2F6&amp;Lang=E |date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations allowed by their member states to speak on their behalf===
In the resolution adopted in May 2011 granting additional rights to the [[European Union]] the UNGA decided that similar arrangements may be adopted for any other [[regional organization]] that is allowed to speak on behalf of its member states.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES65276"/&gt;

[[File:26th Session of UNGEGN 3.JPG|thumb|300px|Experts during the 26th Session of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (2–6 May 2011, [[United Nations Office at Vienna|United Nations Office, Vienna]])]]

The '''United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names''' ('''UNGEGN''') is one of the nine expert groups of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) and deals with the national and international [[standardization]] of geographical names. Every five years they hold the [[United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names]].

==History==
The question of standardizing geographical names was raised by the United Nations Cartographic Section of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in the late 1940s. After discussions in the 1950s and ECOSOC resolution 715A (XXVII) of 1959, the first meeting of a group of experts was convened in New York City in 1960. This group recommended that a UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names be held. In 1967 this took place in [[Geneva]], with the confirmation that national standardization should be the basis of international standardization.

==Mandate and tasks==
The remit of UNGEGN is to deal with the problems of domestic and international standardization of geographical names, and to offer suggestions and recommendations for (mainly linguistic) standardization. Being one of the seven expert groups of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, UNGEGN is mandated to follow up on the implementation of resolutions and to continue activities between the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names held every five years. UNGEGN aims to emphasize the importance of the standardization of geographical names at the national and international levels, to show the benefits of this, and to assist countries in standardization of geographical names where it is lacking. Furthermore, UNGEGN facilitates and encourages the discussion of the results of work on national standardization and arising issues, the dissemination of best
practices, and a wide user community awareness of nationally authorized geographical names.

==Structure==
UNGEGN reports to the UN Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names held at five-yearly intervals. It is supported by a Secretariat provided by the United Nations Statistics Division, and its Bureau. UNGEGN meets formally on two occasions between Conferences and works on names standardization through Working Groups and Special task teams, as well as through Divisions. These so-called Divisions are groups of countries with common interests based on geography and/or language. To interact with other scientific organizations, UNGEGN has appointed a number of liaison officers.

===Bureau===
The UNGEGN Bureau consists of a Chair, two Vice-Chairs and two Rapporteurs. The current Bureau is composed as follows:

*Chair: William Watt (Australia)
*Vice-Chairs: Naima Friha (Tunisia), Hasanuddin Abidin (Indonesia)
*Rapporteurs: Trent C. Palmer (USA), Sungjae Choo (Republic of Korea)

Former chairpersons:

*Meredith F. Burrill (USA, 1967–1977)
*[[Josef Breu]] (Austria, 1977–1982)
*Dirk Peter Blok (Netherlands, 1982–1987)
*Henri Dorion (Canada, 1987–1991)
*Peter E. Raper (South Africa, 1991–2002)
*Helen Kerfoot (Canada, 2002–2012)

===Divisions===
UNGEGN is composed of experts from various linguistic/geographical divisions that have been established by the UN Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names. Countries decide for themselves the division(s) to which they wish to belong; some belong to more than one division. A division chair is selected within a division and he/she is encouraged to stimulate activities in the standardization of geographical names within the division, through technical meetings, correspondence, etc.

Currently, there are 24 divisions that guide the work of UNGEGN during and between its sessions:

*Africa Central Division
*Africa East Division
*Africa South Division
*Africa West Division
*Arabic Division
*Asia East Division (other than China)
*Asia South-East Division
*Asia South-West Division (other than Arabic)
*Baltic Division
*Celtic Division
*China Division
*Dutch- and German-speaking Division
*East Central and South-East Europe Division
*Eastern Europe, Northern and Central Asia Division
*East Mediterranean Division (other than Arabic)
*French-speaking Division
*India Division
*Latin America Division
*Norden Division
*Pacific South-West Division
*Portuguese-speaking Division
*Romano-Hellenic Division
*United Kingdom Division
*USA/Canada Division

===Working Groups===
Under the umbrella of UNGEGN, several Working Groups have been created to follow up topics and issues which cut across the Divisional structure of UNGEGN. In addition, UNGEGN has a Task Team for Africa and coordinates the work of countries in developing their [[UNGEGN Toponymic Guidelines|Toponymic Guidelines]].

Currently there are 9 UNGEGN Working Groups:

*Working Group on Country Names
*Working Group on Toponymic Data Files and Gazetteers
*Working Group on Toponymic Terminology
*Working Group on Publicity and Funding
*Working Group on [[Romanization|Romanization Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;Working Group on Romanization Systems.[http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/ WGRS website]. United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Working Group on Training Courses in Toponymy
*Working Group on Evaluation and Implementation
*Working Group on Exonyms
*Working Group on Geographical Names as Cultural Heritage

The former Working Group on Pronunciation has been disbanded in 2017.

==Conference==
The '''United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names''' is a periodic international conference organised by the [[United Nations Statistical Commission]], the central purpose of which is to facilitate the standardization of national geographical names. The purpose of the Conference is not to settle political disputes between states on the use (or non-use) of particular geographical names.

The conference takes place every five years at [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City. It can be conducted at a different location, if a country offers to host the conference and to pay the additional costs of hosting the conference away from UN HQ. Each country may send a delegation. Members of these delegations are mainly experts on geographical names from their respective countries.

The most recent conference, the tenth, was held in New York in July/August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/ungegnConf10.html 10th Conference 31 July – 9 August 2012, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Urban and Regional Information Systems Association''' ('''URISA''') is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit association]] of professionals using [[geographic information system|geographic information systems]] (GIS) and other [[information technology|information technologies]] to solve challenges at all levels of [[government]].&lt;ref&gt;Geospatial Refarata Wiki [http://geospatial.referata.com/wiki/Urban_and_Regional_Information_Systems_(URISA) Urban and Regional Information Systems (URISA)]&lt;/ref&gt;  URISA promotes the effective and ethical use of spatial information and technology for the understanding and management of urban and regional systems.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. L. [http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/gis/Volume1/BB1v1_ch7.pdf The Organizational Home for GIS in the Scientific Professional Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
URISA was formed in 1966, evolving from a loosely associated group of professionals with a common interest in [[urban planning]] information systems. The organization emanated from annual conferences held from 1963 through 1966, known then as the Annual Conference on Urban Planning Information Systems and Programs. URISA has since evolved into an international organization supporting professionals with interests in a variety of topics related to development and effective management of geographic information systems (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Chrisman, Frank, McHaffie, Pickles [http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html The GIS History Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918043755/http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html |date=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urisa.org/about/history URISA History]&lt;/ref&gt;  URISA is currently headquartered in Des Plaines, Illinois, where professional staff handle the administrative functions of the association.

'''White Escarpment''' is an escarpment in the west part of the [[Heritage Range]], extending for 15&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (28&amp;nbsp;km) between the heads of the [[Splettstoesser Glacier|Splettstoesser]] and [[Dobbratz Glacier]]s. Named by the [[University of Minnesota]] Geological Party to these mountains, 1963–64, for Chief Warrant Officer Ronald B. White, pilot with the 62nd Transportation Detachment, who assisted the party.
