'''''A proper dyaloge betwene a Gentilman and a Husbandman eche complaynynge to other their miserable calamite through the ambicion of the clergye''''' was printed in two versions by "[[Hans Luft]]" (i.e., [[Johannes Hoochstraten]]) of [[Antwerp]] in 1529. This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as "Dialogue between gentleman &amp; plowman." While clearly in the [[Piers Plowman Tradition]], Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century [[Lollard]] anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. ''The English Works of Wyclif''.) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. 

The dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in [[purgatory]] and [[indulgences]] is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 "Reformation Parliament"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to [[Simon Fish]]'s ''[[A Supplicacyon for the Beggers]]'' and [[Thomas More]]'s rebuttal and defense of purgatory in ''[[The Supplycacyon of Soulys]]'' (1529). [[John I of England|King John]], [[Sir John Oldcastle]], and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of [[William Tyndale]]'s [[New Testament]] in 1526 and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s persecution of Lollards. To defend [[Lutherans]] and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of "newfangledness," the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices. (The husbandman places it in the time of Richard II.)

    Now I promyse the after my iudgement
    I haue not hard of soche an olde fragment
    Better groundyd on reason with Scripture.
    Yf soche auncyent thynges myght come to lyght
    That noble men hadde ones of theym a syght
    The world yet wolde chaunge perauenture
    For here agaynst the clergye cannot bercke
    Sayenge as they do thys is a newe wercke
    Of heretykes contryued lately.
    And by thys treatyse it apperyth playne
    That before oure dayes men did compleyne
    Agaynst clerkes ambycyon so stately.

The "I" of the husbandman at this point leads into the "I" of the Lollard treatise which is attached at the end with little done to make a transition; it is revised to function as contemporary anti-Roman polemic.

Al Wajiha is an Arabic drama, which was written by Asmahan Tawfik, directed by Saed Al Huwari and filmed in [[Kuwait]]. It originally aired for one season, or thirty episodes, on [[MBC_1_(Middle_East)|MBC1]] and [[OSN]] Ya Hala! starting from December 15, 2014 and ending on March 3, 2014. The drama deals with a series of modern day social issues plaguing the Gulf society, and enters the homes of conservative Kuwaiti families. The show touches on a variety of relationship, mostly marital, problems that end up getting lost in the corridors of the courts. The dangers of having a secret marriage are revealed as the leading actress is left fighting for her legal rights while trying not to destroy her and her family’s reputation.

Zeina has secretly been married to Rashid for three years but when she accidentally becomes pregnant, Rashid threatens to abandon her if she does not have an abortion. Zeina decides to leave Rashid and have the baby in secret. Her sister Laila and brother in law AbdulRahman raise the baby girl and allow Zeina to name her Omniya, which means wish.

'''''And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic''''' is a 1987 book by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalist [[Randy Shilts]]. The book chronicles the discovery and spread of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically [[gay]] disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease is caused by a biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.

The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism, written in the form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the [[epidemic]] are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of [[Grethe Rask]], a Danish doctor working in [[Africa]]. He ends with the announcement by actor [[Rock Hudson]] in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.

''And the Band Played On'' was critically acclaimed and became a best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the ''[[Library Journal]]'' called it "one of the most important books of the year", upon its release.&lt;ref name="eannarino"&gt;Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved."&lt;ref name="geiger"&gt;{{cite news | first=H Jack | last=Geiger | title= Plenty of Blame to Go Around | date= 1987-11-08 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/books/plenty-of-blame-to-go-around.html | work =The New York Times Book Review | page = 9 | accessdate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later adapted into an [[And the Band Played On (film)|HBO film of the same name]] in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.

==Background==
{{Quote box

| align = right
| quote = To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that...it was never something that happened to those other people. —[[Randy Shilts]] in 1983}}

Shilts decided to write ''And the Band Played On'' after attending an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer [[Bill Kurtis]] gave the keynote address and told a joke: "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're [[Haiti]]an."&lt;ref&gt;p. 384, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go in front of a journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people."&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt;

After publication of the book, Shilts explained his use of the title: "''And the Band Played On'' is simply a snappier way of saying 'business as usual'. Everyone responded with an ordinary pace to an extraordinary situation."&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;Engel, Margaret. "AIDS and Prejudice: One Reporter's Account of the Nation's Response." ''The Washington Post'', December 1, 1987, p. Z10.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is originally from [[The Temptations]]' popular 1970 song about encroaching chaos, ''[[Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)]]''; in the song, the phrase repeatedly signals that no one is paying proper attention to world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/The-temptations-ball-of-confusion-thats-what-the-world-is-today-lyrics|title=Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today) (lyrics by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong|website=Genius.com|date=2 April 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Shilts focuses on several organizations and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and were given the task of finding the cause of the disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an [[Third-person omniscient narrative|omniscient point of view]] to portray individuals' thoughts and feelings.

===Gay community===
AIDS in the United States first struck gay men and [[intravenous drug use (recreational)|IV drug users]] in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay community tried to remember the last time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976, when sailors came from all over the world to New York.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 142–143 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them carried [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: "Before" in 1980, and "After" by 1985. "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; "After" signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 585–590, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, particularly in the Castro District, gay community activists such as [[Bill Kraus]] and [[Cleve Jones]] found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 38–40, 154–155 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 152–154, 167, 180, 200, 209–210, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, men like [[Larry Kramer]] and [[Paul Popham]], who had previously shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] to raise money for medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with [[opportunistic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 133–134, 166–167, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor [[Ed Koch]] and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and [[sex education|preventive education]] about AIDS and [[unsafe sex]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 309–311, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In these cities, however, the sizable gay communities in most instances were responsible for raising the most money for research, providing the money for and subsequently the social services for the dying, and educating themselves and other high-risk groups. Kramer would go on to form [[ACT UP|AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT-UP), a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;"Larry Kramer." Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2009. Reproduced in [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Biography Resource Center]. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones formed the [[NAMES Project]] that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest folk art display in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Cleve Jones." Gay &amp; Lesbian Biography. St. James Press, 1997. Reproduced in [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Biography Resource Center]. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical community===
Doctors were the first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like [[Marcus Conant]], James Curran, [[Arye Rubenstein]], [[Michael S. Gottlieb]], and [[Mathilde Krim]]—would also realize their professional life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably [[lymphadenopathy]], [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]], [[Kaposi's Sarcoma]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[cryptosporidia]], and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised [[immune system]]. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 150, 321–322, 374–375 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts praised the Public Health Department of San Francisco's handling of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although some of them were living in different parts of the country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director [[David Sencer]] refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;p. 310, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time gay men were getting sick in the United States, doctors in Paris were receiving patients who were African or who had lived in Africa with the same symptoms as the Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi|Françoise Barre]], [[Luc Montagnier]], and doctor [[Willy Rozenbaum]] began taking biopsies of HIV-infected [[lymph nodes]] and discovered a new [[retrovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 219, 229, 237–238, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the [[Pasteur Institute]] sent a colleague to the [[National Cancer Institute]], where [[Robert Gallo]] was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 238, 239–240, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 264, 386–388, 401, 409, 418–420 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Departmental ego and pride, according to Shilts, also confounded research as the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]]s battled over funding and who might get credit for medical discoveries that were to come from the isolation of HIV, blood tests to find HIV, or any possible [[vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 429–430, 434–435, 444–445, 447–448, 450–452, 460–462, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Once AIDS became known as a "gay disease" there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were not gay, such as infants born from drug-using mothers,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 103–104, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; children and adults who had [[hemophilia]] (and later, their wives),&lt;ref&gt;pp.115–116, 160–161, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]]ans,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 124, 135–136, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; and people who had received [[blood transfusions]].

The discovery of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by [[blood bank]] leadership occurred as early as 1982,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 195, 220–223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was not until 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 307–309, 332–333, 344–346, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for [[hepatitis]] alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and governmental agencies===
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the agency responsible for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy in the face of mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.&lt;ref&gt;pp.292–293, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Reagan Administration officials like [[Health and Human Services]] Secretary [[Margaret Heckler]] and Assistant Secretary [[Edward Brandt]] spoke publicly about the epidemic, calling it in 1983 its "Number One Health Priority" no extra funding was given to the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health for research.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 293–4 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; What the U.S. Congress pushed through was highly politicized and embattled, and a fraction of what was spent on similar public health problems.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 294–298, 363–364, 455–456, 471–472, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts made comparisons to the government's disparate reaction to the [[Chicago Tylenol murders]], and the recent emergence of [[Legionnaire's Disease]] in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting [[cyanide]]-laced [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] capsules. The ''New York Times'' wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] employees worked on the case. [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] disclosed they spent $100&amp;nbsp;million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The ''New York Times'' wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;p. 191 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the [[American Legion]] died in 1976 at a convention in [[Philadelphia]]. The [[National Institute of Health]] spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;p. 186 And the Band Played On.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of neglecting to address AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson to tell him to get well.&lt;ref&gt;p. 588, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.&lt;ref&gt;587–598, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

On a civic level, the closure of [[gay bathhouse]]s in San Francisco became a bitter political fight in the gay community. Activists put pressure on the San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 153–154, 305–307, 314–317, 413–418, 436–439, 440–443, 481–482, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===News media===
Shilts was assigned to AIDS full-time at ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' in 1982. It was from this unique vantage point that he repeatedly criticized the U.S. [[news media]] for ignoring the medical crisis because it did not affect people who mattered, only gays and drug addicts.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name='Story in Closet'&gt;Shilts, Randy (August 3, 1985). [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/04/MNAIDS04SHILTS1.DTL&amp;hw=The+Story+in+the+Closet&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 "The Story in the Closet"] ''San Francisco Chronicle'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Shilts noted most newspapers would print stories about AIDS only when it affected heterosexuals, sometimes taking particular interest in stories about AIDS in [[prostitutes]]. AIDS was not reported in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' until it involved heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;p. 137, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stories called AIDS a "gay plague" or "homosexual disease" in articles that pointed to it showing up in new populations, like [[hemophiliacs]] or people who had received blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 353–354, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts recounted the irony of a reporter commenting on how little was reported about the disease, then linking it once more to rarer instances of transmission to non-drug-using heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 110, 183, 213, 267–268, 320 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the extreme, a general [[phobia]] of AIDS was exacerbated by the news media who erroneously reported that AIDS could be contracted by household contact, without checking any facts in their stories, which prompted mass hysteria across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 299–301, 320–321, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The book became a commercial success, contrary to Shilts' own expectations.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt; It remained on the ''[[New York Times Bestseller List]]'' for five weeks, was translated into seven languages, nominated for a [[National Book Award]], and made Shilts an "AIDS celebrity".&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;Grimes, William (February 18, 1994). [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/obituaries/randy-shilts-author-dies-at-42-one-of-first-to-write-about-aids.html "Randy Shilts, Author, Dies at 42; One of First to Write About AIDS"] ''The New York Times'', p. D.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Shilts is compared to great American writers whose careers were made by the circumstances surrounding them, such as [[Thomas Paine]] in the [[American Revolution]], [[Edward R. Murrow]] during [[the Blitz]], and [[David Halberstam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Writer Jon Katz explains, "No other mainstream journalist has sounded the alarm so frantically, caught the dimensions of the AIDS tragedy so poignantly or focused so much attention on government delay, the nitpickings of research funding and institutional intrigue".&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;Katz, Jon (May 27, 1993). "AIDS and the Media: Shifting Out of Neutral", ''Rolling Stone'', Issue 657, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', Howard Merkel characterizes ''And the Band Played On'' as the first volume of the [[historiography]] of AIDS.&lt;ref name="merkel"&gt;Merkel, Howard (July 2001). "Journals of the Plague Years: Documenting the History of the AIDS Epidemic in the United States", ''American Journal of Public Health'', '''91''' (7), p. 1025.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the content expanded into law and science, reviews were published not only in literary sources but legal and medical journals as well.

===Literary===
Literary reviews of the work were generally positive, with reviewers commenting on the "hypnotic" and "thriller-like" qualities of the book. Shilts' investigative and journalistic endeavors were praised, and reviewers seemed genuinely moved by the personal stories of the major players.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Judith Eannarino noted, "Shilts has the ability to draw the reader hypnotically into the personal lives of his characters. That, and his monumental investigative effort, would have made this a best-selling novel—if the contents weren't so horribly true."(Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.) A reviewer with the feminist magazine ''Hera'' agreed, saying, "''And the Band Played On'' reads like a mystery thriller. The fact that it is non-fiction adds to the intensity but also increases the rage the reader is left with."(Johnston, Peg. "And The Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic; A Review of the book by Randy Shilts." ''Hera''. March 31, 1989. '''9''' (2), p. 3.) Elena Brunet in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "An important, masterful piece of investigative reporting".(Brunet, Elena. "And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times'': October 2, 1988. p. 14.) Anthony Clare in ''[[The Times]]'' stated in a review, "''And the Band Played On'' is a formidable chronicle of wasted time, petty intrigue, bigoted posturing, blind faith and suffering", before warning the United Kingdom their response to AIDS was drawing too close a parallel to the United States'.(Clare, Anthony. "Chronicle of many deaths foretold: Review of 'And The Band Played On' by Randy Shilts", ''The Times'', February 28, 1988.) Joan Breckenridge in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the book high praise for "an excellent piece of both investigative and political journalism", and for the style of writing, although cautioning that at more than 600 pages casual readers might be overwhelmed.(Breckenridge, Joan. "The awful epidemic that was allowed to happen: And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic." ''The Globe and Mail (Canada)'', December 5, 1987.) Nan Goldberg in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' characterized it as a, "groundbreaking book on the history of the AIDS epidemic...every element of a thriller." (Goldeberg, Nan. "''Science Big Shot: Passion, Politics, and the Struggle for an AIDS Vaccine'' (book review)." ''The Boston Globe'', January 6, 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''And the Band Played On'' won the [[Stonewall Book Award]] for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. {{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |title=The Stonewall Book Award website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407193541/http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |archivedate=2007-04-07 }} Retrieved on December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It earned the 10th spot on "100 Lesbian and Gay Books That Changed Our Lives", compiled by the ''Lambda Book Report''.&lt;ref&gt;Monteagudo, Jesse. "100 lesbian and gay books that changed our lives." '' Lambda Book Report''; January 2000. Vol. 8, Iss. 6; p. 12, 2 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[New York City Public Library]] topped its list of "21 New Classics for the 21st Century" with ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael. "NY Librarians Pick 21 New Classics." ''Library Journal'', 10/01/99, Vol. 124 Issue 16, p18, 2p&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after it was published however, Shilts remained "fundamentally disappointed" when a radical response to the AIDS crisis did not materialize, despite the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 book review, Jack Geiger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the detail in Shilts' work was too confusing, being told "in five simultaneous but disjointed chronologies, making them all less coherent", and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users, their partners and their children as to gay men. Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying.&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt; Woodrow Myers from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far too many of us stop: We don't ask why the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the entitlements like [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the [[multiple sclerosis]] patients are not."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Woodrow. "AIDS: A Reporter's Journey Into the Maelstrom AND THE BAND PLAYED ON by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times''. Los Angeles, California: December 6, 1987. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gay Community News'' in [[Boston]] also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Kyper, John. "Stories from the epidemic: Two important books about the impact of AIDS." ''Gay Community News''. Boston: September 21, 1991. Vol. 19, Iss. 9; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Rouilard, editor of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1992 criticized Shilts for being out of touch with the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gay Journalists Hold First Conference Media: Delegates assess progress being made against newsroom hostility and the battles that remain." ''Los Angeles Times'': June 28, 1992. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and law===
Shilts' book has been used as a standard by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including [[breast cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, Susan. "Slash, Burn and Poison (book review).'' The New York Times'', April 13, 1997, Sunday, Section 7; Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic fatigue syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Chronic Fatigue Cover-Up?" ''Newsweek'', April 22, 1996, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Orange]],&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Charles. "Waiting for an Army to Die: The Tragedy of Agent Orange by Fred A. Wilcox." ''Los Angeles Times'': December 17, 1989. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and continued response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Biemiller, Lawrence. "Book World; A Clinical Look at Life With AIDS." ''The Washington Post'': April 2, 1993. p. D.02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randal, Judith. "Reality Check; Fighting AIDS in the Trenches." ''The Washington Post'': February 9, 1993. p. Z.19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the ''American Journal of Public Health'', notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing "A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers".&lt;ref name="merkel"/&gt; Jon Katz in ''Rolling Stone'' refutes this by stating "[Shilts] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing so, he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal".&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt;

Although Sandra Panem in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' praised Shilts' efforts and the attention the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight to the issue of [[homophobia]] hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.&lt;ref name="panem"&gt;Panem, Sandra (February 26, 1988). "Review: A Drama and Questions", ''Science'' '''239''' (4843), pp. 1039–1040.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Parmet, a professor at [[Northeastern University Law School]], highlights the greatest strengths of ''And the Band Played On'' to be "the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS" and how it "eloquently portrays the human side of the crisis" and believes the blame others criticized to be justified; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness, suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Parmet, Wendy (1986). "AIDS and the Law/And the Band Played on (Book)", ''[[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]]'', '''12''' (3/4), p. 503–510.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'', Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts' narrative method into question, and ask why, for a syndrome that affects people beyond race, class, and sexual orientation, that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality. The writers, however, were mostly impressed with the book, calling it an "informative, often brilliant, overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic".&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Peter and Stein, Terry (May 1989). "On the Social Meanings of AIDS", Contemporary Sociology '''18''' (3), p. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts is often quoted as claiming that Ronald Reagan neglected to mention AIDS publicly until 1987. However, Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1985 |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm |title=The President's News Conference: September 17, 1985, Federal Support for AIDS Research |publisher=www.reagan.utexas.edu/ |accessdate=2009-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221094807/http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaëtan Dugas as "Patient Zero"===
The book includes extensive discussion of [[Gaëtan Dugas]], a Canadian flight attendant who died in 1984.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Dugas was labeled [[Index case|Patient Zero]] of AIDS, because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the United States, and after he was told of his ability to infect others, defiantly continued to have unprotected sex. Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas, or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior. Some reviewers interpreted Shilts' naming Dugas "Patient Zero" to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America; the ''[[National Review]]'' called Dugas the "Columbus of AIDS" and in their review of ''And the Band Played On'' states, "[Dugas] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans. Traveling on his airline-employee privileges, he spread it here from coast to coast."&lt;ref&gt;"The Columbus of AIDS", ''The National Review'' (November 6, 1987), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts never stated this in the book, instead writing, "Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable&amp;nbsp;... there's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other."&lt;ref&gt;p. 439, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' titled its review of ''And the Band Played On'' "The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero", erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Henry III, William A. (October 19, 1987). "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965791,00.html The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero]", ''Time''. Retrieved on May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a press release by St. Martin's Press made the connection between Dugas and the introduction of AIDS to the Western World in its title, but not its text.&lt;ref name="crimp"&gt;Crimp, Douglas (Winter, 1987). "How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic." ''AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism'' '''43''' pp. 237–271&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was released, Dugas' story became a controversial subject in the Canadian media. Shilts claimed that "the Canadian press went crazy over the story" and that "Canadians... saw it as an offense to their nationhood."&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by [[William Darrow]], but it was called into question by [[University of California San Francisco]] epidemiologist Andrew Moss. Moss wrote in a letter to the editor of ''The New York Review of Books'', "There is very little evidence that Gaetan was 'patient zero' for the US or for California," while also stating that Shilts did not overstress Dugas' lack of personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Moss AR |year=1988 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4227 |title= 'AIDS without end' |journal= New York Review of Books |volume=35 |issue=19 |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Panem in ''Science'' uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his "glib" treatment of the science involved in the epidemic.&lt;ref name="panem"/&gt; Author [[Douglas Crimp]] suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as "murderously irresponsible" is in actuality "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that [Shilts], like them, is horrified by such creatures."&lt;ref name="crimp"/&gt; Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.&lt;ref name=patzer&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/story/169885-aids/ The Cell That Started a Pandemic], ''Radiolab.org'', with guests and research from: [[Nathan Wolf]] author of ''[[The Viral Storm]]''; [[Carl Zimmer]], author of ''[[A Planet of Viruses]]''; [[Michael Worobey]], [[MicrobeWorld.org]]'s "Meet the Scientist Podcast"; [[David Quammen]], author of ''[[Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic|Spillover]]''; [[Beatrice H. Hahn]] of [[Penn Center for AIDS Research]].&lt;/ref&gt; Even the labelling of Dugas as "Patient Zero" was due to an misunderstanding of the study of sexual contacts amongst a group of men indicating how the disease was transmitted – he was identified in the study as ‘Patient [letter] O’, for "Out of California" – but people reading and discussing the research began referring to and thinking about a "Patient Zero" as the origin of the disease.&lt;ref name="lrb"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crewe |first1=Tom |title=Here was a plague |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n18/tom-crewe/here-was-a-plague |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=London Review of Books |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study of early AIDS cases demonstrated that Dugas could not have been "Patient Zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature19827.epdf?ttreferrer_access_token=z0xXoLXHonkirkD_hU1jk9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mz5UkminhxQD8O3RqOtslw0uWnC8Yne3mUv32VmwjGPypGuqJT0TZeiLtsZb49IGRJf6V-wefqs5PWP2Zmz2neUNsKL8cH6Lgl4duhbwVFyGFyS_SpnROTz0ii2YbTD4zpYNY1EMUO0FYZn3LyRxi7Fe0SDLem4hpc01XbTdxF3DGYFAjTFX9jLdruf-bmalV8a5l6t-H_6eyTj_nm19jRIZfwaNR5Mx_RBGKhkHJUzg_Q5pw84M70ucJLf_WneW0=&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com|title=1970s and ‘Patient 0’ HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America|first1=Michael|last1=Worobey|first2=Thomas D.|last2=Watts|first3=Richard A.|last3=McKay|first4=Marc A.|last4=Suchard|first5=Timothy|last5=Granade|first6=Dirk E.|last6=Teuwen|first7=Beryl A.|last7=Koblin|first8=Walid|last8=Heneine|first9=Philippe|last9=Lemey|first10=Harold W.|last10=Jaffe|date=26 October 2016|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=539|issue=7627|pages=98–101|accessdate=23 July 2018|doi=10.1038/nature19827|pmc=5257289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After publication==
While Shilts was writing the book he was tested for HIV but insisted his doctor not tell him the results until the book was finished so it would not affect his journalistic integrity and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Bettijane (February 17, 1993). "Shilts Confirms He Is HIV-Positive", ''Los Angeles Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; On the day he sent the final manuscript to the publisher, he learned he was HIV-positive. He also revealed that he received abuse from gays for the articles he wrote for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' supporting the bathhouse closures, as well as for ''And the Band Played On'', saying it was common for him to be spat upon in the Castro District.&lt;ref&gt;Kirka, Danica. "Randy Shilts Fighting Against the Rules Restricting Gays in the Military;" ''Los Angeles Times'': July 25, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was openly booed when he attended the premiere of ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''—based on his book ''The Mayor of Castro Street''—at the [[Castro Theatre]]. Footage he had shot as a television reporter was included in the film, but during the construction of the documentary he was so controversial that the film's editors removed him from footage showing him with Milk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of ''And the Band Played On'', however, he was "worshipped" by many in the gay community for writing the book, but also seen as someone who pandered to publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, Jeffrey. "At Home With: Randy Shilts; Writing Against Time, Valiantly;" ''New York Times'' April 22, 1993. p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts declared while promoting the book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western world could be eradicated, and by 1994, "AIDS could be as manageable as [[diabetes]]". However, in reference to Africa, Shilts noted, "At this point it's inconceivable that there will be an AIDS-free world in Central Africa, as we're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;"West 'AIDS-free within 30&amp;nbsp;years.'" ''Sunday Mail'' (South Africa), September 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, "the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gender of Editors Affects Coverage of Stories on Sex Media: Women tend to favor more candor in reports on rape, AIDS and the private lives of politicians. Series: THE PRESS AND SEX: Assessing media's coverage when private matters become public. Second in a two-part series." ''Los Angeles Times'': August 19, 1991. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts died from complications of AIDS in 1994, age 42.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Upon his death he was eulogized by [[Cleve Jones]], who said "Randy's contribution was so crucial. He broke through society's denial and was absolutely critical to communicating the reality of AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Jennifer. "Randy Shilts, Chronicler of AIDS Epidemic, Dies at 42 Journalism: Author of 'And the Band Played On' is credited with awakening nation to the health crisis."'' Los Angeles Times'' February 18, 1994. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Kramer said of him, "He single-handedly probably did more to educate the world about AIDS than any single person."&lt;ref&gt;"Randy Shilts, journalist, 42, of AIDS."

==Film==
{{main article|And the Band Played On (film)}}

''And the Band Played On'' was used as the basis for a 1993 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] [[television film]] of the same name. It was produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]], and starred [[Matthew Modine]] as epidemiologist [[Don Francis]] and [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow]] at the Centers for Disease Control. [[Alan Alda]] portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for [[Screen Actors Guild|union-scale]] pay. The film was released the same year as ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', and the play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes]]'' premiered, which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it.&lt;ref&gt;Brelsauer, Jan "1993&amp;nbsp;year in Review AIDS The Year the Plague Went Mainstream." Los Angeles Times; December 26, 1993. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, Matt. "'Band': Noble, but slightly out of sync." ''USA TODAY'', September 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''And the Band Played On'', along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.&lt;ref&gt;Natale, Richard.

'''Andrea Arnold''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 5 April 1961) is an [[English people|English]] filmmaker and former actress. She won an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Academy Award]] for her short film ''[[Wasp (film)|Wasp]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has since made the leap to [[feature film]]s and [[television]], including ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]'' (2006), ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]'' (2009), and ''[[American Honey (film)|American Honey]]'' (2016), all of which have won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="gritten1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barraclough"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/global/andrea-arnold-cannes-jury-prize-winner-american-honey-1201790358/|title=Andrea Arnold’s Cannes Jury Prize Winner ‘American Honey’ Sells Out|last=Barraclough|first=Leo|date=2016-06-07|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold has also directed four episodes of the [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]-winning series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'',&lt;ref name="gritten1" /&gt; as well as all seven episodes of the second season of the Emmy Award-winning series ''[[Big Little Lies (TV series)|Big Little Lies]]''.

==Early life==
Arnold was born in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]], the eldest of four children. She was born when her mother was only 16 years old and her father was 17, and they separated when she was very young. Raised in a housing project, she spent her youth days constantly exploring the “chalk pits, fields, woods and motorways” of Dartford.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/andrea-arnolds-immersive-cinema|title=Andrea Arnold’s Immersive Cinema|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had to bring up all four children alone, which is reminiscent of Arnold's own directorial debut short, ''Wasp''. When people are asked if the story is in any way biographical, Arnold replies "I grew up in a working class family, so I guess you could say I write from what I know."&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Film: Andrea Arnold Interview|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-andrea-arnold-interview-1-1355790|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=Scotsmans|date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young girl, she was writing dark stories about human experience. In an interview, Arnold speaks about how when she was 10 years old, she wrote her first play that expressed her "horror" of the slave trade, and a few years later while studying for a dance GCSE, she made a performance piece; "I took quotes from the Diary of Anne Frank and read them aloud as I moved around the room. All the other kids would just bung on some pop music and dance. I remember the examiners sitting there looking at me, perplexed."&lt;ref name="secher1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Secher|first=Benjamin|title=Dark depths of Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8870091/Dark-depths-of-Andrea-Arnolds-Wuthering-Heights.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold left high school when she was 16, when she was drawn to becoming an actress.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt; When Arnold was 18 years old she began working as a host and actress for a children's TV show called ''No. 73''. She worked in TV for the next 10 years, while continually writing on the side. Arnold realised she could turn her stories into films, so she studied at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles where she gained experience in the film industry. In explaining why she moved from London to study film in the U.S., she states, “I felt my lack of education and accent always held me back in the eyes of the gatekeepers”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After finishing school and returning to Britain she had her daughter, Coral and began making short films for TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winters|first=Laura|title=Director Leaps From Shorts to Longing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/movies/01wint.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early TV work===
After leaving school in the late 1970s, Arnold got her first TV jobs as a dancer on shows that included ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/18/londonfilmfestival2006.londonfilmfestival1 "I like darkness"] ''The Guardian'' (18 October 2006). Retrieved 10 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She first came to prominence as an actress and television presenter alongside [[Sandi Toksvig]], Nick Staverson and [[Neil Buchanan]] in the 1980s children's television show ''[[No. 73]]''. This Saturday morning show on [[ITV Network|ITV]], in which she played Dawn Lodge, had a similar premise to that of ''[[The Kumars at No. 42]]'' in the way that the show was part sitcom, part chat show and based at a domestic residence. In addition to these parts, the show had the usual mix of music, competitions and cartoons that was in keeping to the formula of British Saturday morning children's TV of the 1980s. After a couple of years of experience in front of the camera, Arnold realised, "Television was great fun and I went along for the ride, but I never felt that comfortable in front of the camera".&lt;ref name="secher1"/&gt;

In 1988 No. 73 had morphed into ''[[7T3]]'', with the set being moved from the [[Maidstone]] house (in fact in [[Television South|TVS]] studios in [[Kent]]) to that of a theme park. This revamp would only last the season, but Arnold would be seen for another two years in the same timeslot as part of the ''[[Motormouth]]'' presenting team. In 1990 she presented and wrote for the environmental awareness show for teens, ''A Beetle Called Derek''. This also featured [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] and gave exposure to [[The Yes/No People]] of [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] fame.

===Directing===
After retiring from her career as a television presenter, Arnold studied directing at the [[AFI Conservatory]] in Los Angeles and trained in screenwriting at the PAL Labs in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Conservatory/alumni/alumni.aspx|title=AFI Conservatory Alumni|accessdate=31 July 2011|work=AFI Conservatory| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706075549/http://www.afi.com/Conservatory/alumni/alumni.aspx| archivedate= 6 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2011/02/afis-class-of-92.html |title=The AFI Class of '92 |accessdate=31 July 2011 |work=Chicago Sun Times |first=Uploaded |last=By |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510114119/http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2011/02/afis-class-of-92.html |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pallabs.org/portfolio/timeline/november_2003_screenwriters_lab |title=PAL Screenwriters Lab |accessdate=31 July 2011 |work=PAL Labs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094948/http://www.pallabs.org/portfolio/timeline/november_2003_screenwriters_lab/ |archivedate=28 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early short films included ''Milk'' (1998) and ''Dog'' (2001). She won the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] for [[Wasp (film)|''Wasp'']], in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Real life in the Fish Tank|first=Amy|last=Raphael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/23/andrea-arnold-fish-tank-cannes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 August 2009|accessdate=1 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was named a [[Screen International#Screen International Stars of Tomorrow|''Screen International'' Star of Tomorrow]]. Also in 2003, she directed an episode of the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Coming Up (TV series)|Coming Up]]'' titled "Bed Bugs", though she is sometimes erroneously credited as "Andrew Arnold" for the work.&lt;ref name="Jane Pugh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Pugh |first=Nicky |last=Lund |url=http://www.davidhigham.co.uk/clients/Pugh.htm |work=David Higham Agents |date=2012 |accessdate=12 July 2015 |location=London, UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712050250/http://www.davidhigham.co.uk/clients/Pugh.htm |archivedate=12 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming Up"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coming Up |url=http://4talent.channel4.com/work-programmes/4-new-writers/coming-up |work=Channel 4 |date=2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712033415/http://4talent.channel4.com/work-programmes/4-new-writers/coming-up |archivedate=12 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]'' is the first instalment of [[Advance Party (film series)|Advance Party]], a planned set of three conceptually-related films by different first-time directors. Set on a [[housing estate]] in Glasgow, the [[revenge]]-themed story centres on a [[Closed-circuit television camera|CCTV]] (security TV cameras) operator who develops an obsession with someone she observes, for reasons that become clear through the progress of the film. The picture has won the British director comparisons with established names such as [[Michael Haneke]] and [[Lars von Trier]]. ''Screen International'' critic Allan Hunter said the film was "likely to emerge as one of the discoveries of this year's [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] (2006)." It went on to win the Jury Prize at Cannes that year.&lt;ref name="cannes-2006.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4359479/year/2006.html|title=Festival de Cannes: Red Road|accessdate=13 December 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She won the 2007 [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer]] for directing ''Red Road''. In 2008, Arnold was reported to be directing an adaptation of [[Gillian Flynn]]'s novel ''[[Sharp Objects]]'' for French production company [[Pathé]], but the project never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forward, Slingshot start shooting UK school horror Tormented|url=http://www.screendaily.com/forward-slingshot-start-shooting-uk-school-horror-tormented/4040179.article|publisher=Screen Daily|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she was reported to be working on a television project with writer [[Danny Brocklehurst]] called ''Dirty'', but this project also failed to materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037913?refCatId=14|title=HBO Getting Dirty with Danny Brocklehurst|accessdate=2011-07-15|work=variety.com|first=Andrew|last=Wallenstein|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2009 film ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]'' premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|62nd Cannes Film Festival]], where she once again won the Jury Prize. The film also went on to win the [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film]] in 2010. In 2011, she completed shooting an adaptation of [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (2011 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', produced by London's [[Ecosse Films]]. The film was shown in competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in September&lt;ref name="Venice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/lineup/off-sel/venezia68/ |title=Venezia 68: International competition of feature films |accessdate=31 July 2011 |work=Venice |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003322/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/lineup/off-sel/venezia68/ |archive-date=27 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it won the [[Golden Osella]] for Best Cinematography.

She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |page=9 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was announced that she would direct two episodes of the [[Amazon Studios]] series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''.&lt;ref name="Transparent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/andrea-arnold-to-direct-episodes-of-transparent-season-2-20150707|title=Andrea Arnold To Direct Episodes Of 'Transparent' Season 2|accessdate=7 July 2015|work=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Wasp''====
Initially released in 2003, ''Wasp'' was a short (26 minutes) written and directed by Arnold. Released in 2003, it stars [[Natalie Press]] as a struggling single mother determined not to let her four young children prove an obstacle in the pursuit of igniting a relationship with an old friend ([[Danny Dyer]]). Arnold's native Dartford is the setting. The film was commissioned by the UK Film Council and the Britain's [[Channel 4]]. It won the Sundance Short Film Prize in 2005, and won Arnold an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arnold Congratulated on Oscar Win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4304943.stm|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Red Road''====
''Red Road'' was a 2006 film that is a part of a creative series proposed by the Advance Party of Filmmakers to create three films using the same characters, all directed by different new directors. It tells the story of a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] security operator who observes through her monitors a man from her past. It is named after, and partly set at, the [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in [[Barmulloch]], Glasgow, [[Scotland]] which were the tallest residential buildings in Europe at the time they were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/springher/springher17.htm Red Road Flats], Glasgow Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is shot largely in a [[Dogme 95]] style, using handheld cameras and natural light.

One rule was that if any of the directors decide to incorporate a new main character, then all of the other films must incorporate that character as well. All three directors cast together so they could all see who they believed would fit their film as well as the others. Arnold mainly used first time actors, stating that "I always want the world that I create to be its own universe. When you have really famous people, I find that it is very hard to transcend that awareness. I am always aware of who they are. When you see someone for the first time, that universe feels even more real. I like the idea of working with either unknowns or people that haven't even acted before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GreenCineStaff|title=Andrea Arnold: The Path to ''The Red Road''|url=http://www.greencine.com/central/andreaarnold?page=0%2C2|publisher=GreenCine|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Road'' cost $1 million to make&lt;ref name="gritten1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gritten|first=David|title=Andrea Arnold: 'I wish cinema could be braver'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/6093303/Andrea-Arnold-I-wish-cinema-could-be-braver.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shot digitally on a schedule of six weeks. The film was accepted into competition for the Palme d'Or in [[Cannes]] and received the Jury Prize.&lt;ref name="gritten1"/&gt;

====''Fish Tank''====
''Fish Tank'' premiered in 2009 and was accepted into competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]].&lt;ref name="gritten1"/&gt; In its initial production, distributor [[Artificial Eye]] had acquired the UK theatrical rights, while ContentFilm International handled the worldwide sales. The film was backed by the Limelight Fund, [[BBC Films]] and the [[UK Film Council]]'s New Cinema Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Wendy|title=Andrea Arnold starts UK shoot for ''Fish Tank''|url=http://www.screendaily.com/andrea-arnold-starts-uk-shoot-for-fish-tank/4040054.article|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=Screen Daily|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot entirely on location in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank Confirmed For Cannes Competition |url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=92613 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |newspaper=4RFV |date=24 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145035/http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=92613 |archivedate=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold was adamant about shooting the film in chronological order, so that the journey of the film would make sense to new coming actor Katie Jarvis. She would only give her a day's worth of script to study so that she could take it day by day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fish Tank wins the Outstanding British Film BAFTA|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyOicyr9eco|work=YOUTUBE|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film originally premiered on around 45–50 screens in Britain, making them less accessible to the general public. In regards to this, Arnold said, "I definitely feel sorry more people don't get to see my films. They aren't inaccessible, and if people got the chance to see them, I know they'd like them. I wish cinema [owners] could be braver, or had more money to help them show films like mine." The film cost around $2 million to make, which is still a relatively low budget for a feature-length film.&lt;ref name="gritten1"/&gt; Fish Tank won many awards including the best film award at the Evening Standard Film Awards.&lt;ref name="masters1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Tim|title=Andrea Arnold on 'huge responsibility' of Bronte film|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8508155.stm|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish Tank was released on 11 September 2009.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt; The film and Arnold were honoured at the 20th Annual Women in Film and TV Awards in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|title=Carey Mulligan, Andrea Arnold, Jane Goldman Among Women in Film and TV Honorees|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carey-mulligan-andrea-arnold-jane-55965|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Wuthering Heights''====
Arnold's third film was based on [[Emily Brontë]]'s 1847 novel and starred [[Kaya Scodelario]] and James Howson. This is the first film that Arnold has directed which she did not write herself, though she did co-write the screenplay. Originally, the film adaptation was set to be directed by Peter Webber, who directed ''Girl with a Pearl Earring'', but Arnold was asked to take over and gladly accepted.&lt;ref name="masters1"/&gt; The film was made in 18 months, which is half the amount of time Arnold used to make Red Road and Fish Tank.&lt;ref name="secher1"/&gt; [[Oscilloscope Laboratories]] picked up the North American distribution rights to the adaptation, which won Best Cinematography at the Venice Film Festival in 2011, being praised for its visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Toronto 2011: Oscilloscope Acquires Andrea Arnold's 'Wuthering Heights'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-2011-oscilloscope-acquires-andrea-235543|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=14 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold's fourth film, ''[[American Honey (film)|American Honey]]'', revolves around a group of young adults traveling across the country selling magazine subscriptions.

===Work with film festivals===
Arnold has been very active in working with film festivals around the world. She has been described as a "film festival regular even between films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/andrea-arnold-named-nyffs-first-filmmaker-in-residence|title=Andrea Arnold named NYFF's first Filmmaker-in-Residence |work=Hitflix|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 she was a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58948.html |title=The Jury of the 65th Festival de Cannes |accessdate=25 April 2012 |work=festival-cannes.com |publisher=Cannes Film Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524235524/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58948.html |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 she was named as a member of the jury at the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/70th-festival/70/juries-awards.html|title=Juries and Awards of the 70th Venice Film Festival|work=labiennale|accessdate=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908031428/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/70th-festival/70/juries-awards.html|archive-date=8 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Arnold was announced as the chair of the jury for [[International Critics' Week]] at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=254161|title=Andrea Arnold to chair the jury at the International Critics' Week |work=Cineuropa|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Arnold was chosen to take part in a public conversation about her career as part of the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]'s "Tribeca Talks" programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/tribeca/tribeca-news/jj-abrams-andrea-arnold-in-tribeca-talks-series/5101761.article?blocktitle=LATEST-FILM-NEWS-HEADLINES&amp;contentID=44435|title=JJ Abrams, Andrea Arnold in Tribeca Talks series |work=Screen Daily|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold was a jury member of the 2017 [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/city-of-ghosts-wins-top-prize-at-sheffield-doc/fest-2017/5119048.article?blocktitle=LATEST-FILM-NEWS-HEADLINES&amp;contentID=44435|title='City Of Ghosts' wins top prize at Sheffield Doc/Fest 2017 |work=Screen Daily|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Arnold was named the [[New York Film Festival]]'s inaugural "Filmmaker in Residence." As the first "Filmmaker in Residence," Arnold was responsible for "creating a template for the programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/andrea-arnold-talks-artist-in-residence-method-directing-and-new-project|title=Andrea Arnold Talks Residence, Method Directing and New Project |work=Film Society Lincoln Center|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is designed to "further the goals of filmmakers at an earlier stage in the creative process." Through the programme, Arnold was given the "opportunity to focus on developing or refining new work, and participate in master classes, mentorships or cultural exchange and enrichment film programmes with the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] members, the film community and the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/press/entry/fslc-names-director-writer-andrea-arnold-as-the-2013-filmmaker-in-residence|title=THE FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER names Director/Writer ANDREA ARNOLD as the 2013 FILMMAKER IN RESIDENCE during THE 51ST NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL |work=Film Society Lincoln Center|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Arnold was named to as Chair of the European Film Festival of [[Les Arcs]], which ran from December 16 to 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2017/11/06/03002-20171106ARTFIG00339-andrea-arnold-presidente-du-jury-du-festival-de-cinema-europeen-des-arcs.php Andrea Arnold, présidente du jury du Festival de cinéma européen des Arcs], le Figaro, November 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles and Themes ==
Throughout all of her films, Arnold is known for giving her actors almost total control in creating their characters.  Her directorial style was to provide support and reassurance to her actors in an effort to create their most pure reflections of themselves. Sasha Lane, star of ''American Honey,'' describes that “She constantly told me to be who I was. There wasn’t really any teaching.  More like, ‘Sasha, you’re fine.'” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In general, Arnold’s films are characterized by (but do not indulge in) the themes of deprivation and impoverishment.  For example, both ''Fish Tank''and ''Wuthering Heights'' are dramas featuring teenagers living in the poverty-stricken English edge-lands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even in ''American Honey''(despite not taking place in the UK) the young adults encounter many instances of poverty as they travel the U.S. In fact, the entire plot of the film revolves around scamming members of the upper and middle-class into buying magazines; many of whom are rude and/or easily manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;''American Honey.'' Directed by Andrea Arnold. United States: Maven Pictures, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  This perhaps reflects Arnold’s distaste of upper and middle class entitlement.

==Personal life==
Arnold lives in [[Greenwich]], [[London]], with her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elmhirst|first1=Sophie|title=Andrea Arnold’s immersive Cinema|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/andrea-arnolds-immersive-cinema|website=New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-clerical art''' is a genre of art portraying clergy, especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] clergy, in unflattering contexts.  It was especially popular in France during the second half of the 19th century, at a time that the anti-clerical message suited the prevailing political mood.  Typical paintings show [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in their bright red robes engaging in unseemly activities within their lavish private quarters.

Nineteenth and early twentieth century artists known for their anti-clerical art include [[Francesco Brunery]], [[Georges Croegaert]], [[Charles Édouard Delort]], [[Jehan Georges Vibert]], [[Jules Benoit-Levy]] and [[Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala]].  [[Masami Teraoka]] is among the contemporary painters producing anti-clerical art.

'''Arabic miniatures''' are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks. The earliest date from around 1000 AD, with a flourishing of the artform from around 1200 AD.&lt;ref name=DavidCollection&gt;{{cite web |title=Miniature Painting |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/materials/miniatures |publisher=The David Collection |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA1933"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Islamic Miniature Painting and Book Illumination |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=October 1933 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=166–171 |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3255467.pdf.bannered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic miniature artists include [[al-Jazari]], who illustrated his own ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.&lt;ref name=Jazari&gt;al-Jazari, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices: Kitáb fí ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya'', transl. &amp; anno.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">'''Barbara Honigmann''' (born 12 February 1949 in [[Berlin]]) is a German author and artist.

Barbara Honigmann is the daughter of German-Jewish emigrants, who returned to [[East Berlin]] in 1947 after a period of [[exile]] in Great Britain. Her mother, [[Litzi Friedman]], was the first wife of [[Kim Philby]] and her father, [[Georg Honigmann]], was the chief editor of the "[[Berliner Zeitung]]". From 1967 to 1972, she studied theatre at [[Humboldt University]] in East Berlin.

In the following years she worked as a [[drama]]tist and director in [[Brandenburg]] and [[Berlin]]. She has been a freelance writer since 1975. In 1984, she left the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] and currently lives with her family in [[Strasbourg]].

According to Emily Jeremiah from The Institute of Modern Languages Research, "Honigmann’s texts are also paradigmatic of post-exile writings by German-Jewish authors. In addition, they offer examples of literary reactions to the demise of the GDR by its decamped intellectuals, and represent the articulations of a new generation of women writers" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeremiah|first1=Emily|title=Barbara Honigmann|url=http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk/centre-study-contemporary-womens-writing/languages/german/barbara-honigmann|website=Modern Languages|publisher=The Institute of Modern Languages Research|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220145531/http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk/centre-study-contemporary-womens-writing/languages/german/barbara-honigmann|archive-date=2016-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">A '''bible''' (also known as a '''story bible''', '''show bible''', '''series bible''', or '''pitch bible'''){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} is a [[reference document]] used by [[screenwriter]]s for information on a television series' characters, settings, and other elements.

==Types==
Show bibles are updated with information on the characters after the information has been established on screen.&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Espenson |first1=Jane |title=How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized |url=http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php |website=JaneEspeson.com |accessdate=2013-10-26 |date=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[Frasier]]'' show bible was "scrupulously maintained", and anything established on air — "the name of [[Frasier Crane|Frasier's]] mother, [[Niles Crane|Niles']] favorite professor, [[Martin Crane|Martin's]] favorite bar...even a list of [[Maris Crane|Maris]]' [dozens of] food allergies" — was reflected in the bible.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; The updated bible then serves as a resource for writers to keep everything within the series consistent.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; 

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

==Writers Guild of America==
In the United States, writing the show bible of a produced series earns that writer the 24 units of required credit necessary to qualify for membership in the [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Become a Member |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=84 |website=Writers Guild of America West |accessdate=2013-10-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodrumkale, Osmaniye Province, Turkey.jpg|thumb|Bodrumkale in Osmaniye Province, Turkey]]

'''Bodrumkale''' is a castle ruin in [[Osmaniye Province]], [[Turkey]]. It is situated on a hill at {{coord|37|10|39|N|36|11|15|E}}. Its distance to [[Osmaniye]] is about {{convert|12|km}}. The castle is to the northeast of the ancient city of [[Castabala (city)|Castabala]]. In medieval times it controlled the road from [[Central Anatolia]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. In 1987 an archaeological assessment and accurate plan were published.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII | date=1987|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=92–95, 282, pls.291a–291c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The castle is divided into two baileys or wards and has six towers.  Most of its masonry was cut directly from the limestone outcrop and not plundered from the ancient city below.  The lower level of the south tower functioned as a cistern.

It is dated to 13th century &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmaniye.gov.tr/kastabala-antik-kenti Osmaniye governor's page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. When the castle was captured by the [[Ramadanids]] in the next century, it was already abandoned.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[http://www.ben1gezginim.com/yer_tanitimlari/osmaniye/bodrum-kalesi-kastabala-hierapolis-sehri-osmaniye.html Travellers' page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buried Alive''' is an art and lecture performance series by art-tech group [[monochrom]]. The basic concept is to offer willing participants the opportunity of being buried alive in a real coffin underground for fifteen to twenty minutes. As a framework program, monochrom offers lectures about the history of the science of determining death and the medical cultural history of [[premature burial]].
The series has created controversy&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/02/06/alarm_raised_over_burial_performance.html Toronto Star: "Alarm raised over burial performance"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/wa/ll/bild-de/unangemeldet-42925516.bild.html Bild.de: "Im TV-Duell gegen Klaas: Joko lässt sich lebendig begraben", 5 January 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; in some places it has been staged.

monochrom's founder and conceptualist [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] states that the performance series wants to start a conversation about death, culture, medical and scientific myths and mass media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/experiences/alive.htm monochrom's "Experience the Experience of Being Buried Alive"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grenzfurthner says that one of the inspirations for the performance series was the wish to deal with his claustrophobic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zebrabutter.net/der-film-glossary-of-broken-dreams-oder-im-schlachthaus-zum-goldenen-kalb.html Zebrabutter: "Der Film Glossary of Broken Dreams oder: Im Schlachthaus Zum Goldenen Kalb"; April 25, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Over the years the performance has attracted a lot of mainstream media coverage like the popular German TV show ''[[Joko gegen Klaas – Das Duell um die Welt|Joko gegen Klaas]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosieben.at/tv/joko-gegen-klaas/videos/15-joko-in-oesterreich-jokos-begraebnis-clip Pro7's Joko gegen Klaas – Das Duell um die Welt: "Joko in Österreich: Jokos Begräbnis"]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Pro7]] and the Austrian TV series ''Herr Ostrowski sucht das Glück''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernsehserien.de/herr-ostrowski-sucht-das-glueck/folgen/in-der-einsamkeit-797676 Herr Ostrowski sucht das Glück: "In der Einsamkeit"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freizeit.at/0414/michael-ostrowski-ueber-das-glueck/47.734.967 Freizeit: "Michael Ostroswki über das Glück", April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

==Experience the Experience of Being Buried Alive==

The first public burials were organized in 2005, 2006 and 2007 as part of a performance tour. People in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/downtown_news_6_20_05.jpg Downtown LA: "Goodbye Maestro, and Are You Experienced?", 20 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2005/07/05/monochrom-art-happen.html Boing Boing: "Monochrom art happenings in San Francisco, July 8-23", 5 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/georgiastraight-large.jpg The Georgia Strait: "Austrian artists play in the underworld", 14-21 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/experiences/alive/nationalpost-large.jpg National Post: "Vienna's Gift To The City Of Vancouver: An Early Grave", 14 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2007/02/06/how_to_be_buried_alive.html Toronto Star: "How to be buried alive", Erin Kobayashi, 6 Februar 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2007/02/attend_your_own/ Torontoist: "Attend your own funeral", Pandora Syperek, 6 Februar 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; had the opportunity to be buried alive in a real coffin for fifteen minutes. No cell phones, lamps or other devices were allowed inside the coffin. Participants had to sign a damage waiver.
monochrom provided a 45 minute lecture about the history of premature burial and offered a set of different funeral marches and songs about death as "Death Jockeys".

==Six Feet Under Club==
[[File:Preparations for monochrom's "Six Feet Under Club" (2010).jpg|thumb|Preparations for monochrom's "Six Feet Under Club" (2010)]]
In 2010 monochrom updated the original concept and created the "Six Feet Under Club".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php sfist.com: "Want to Be Buried Alive With Your S.O. and Make Out With Them While Others Watch Via Webcam?", 2 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602083002/http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php |date=2 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/sex-love/article/20740921/the-six-feet-under-club-offers-sex-in-a-buried-coffin#.UfjcaG0deSo Daily Loaf, CL Tampa Bay: "The Six Feet Under Club offers sex in a buried coffin", 28 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/10/07/couples-have-sex-in-coffin-buried-in-dumpster-video SF Weekly: "Couples Have Sex In Coffin Buried In Dumpster ", 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is "extremely private and intimate". The coffin "is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding 'till death do us part'." However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. monochrom's performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/6fuc/RueMorgue--January2011-Page34_SixFeetUnderClub.pdf 'Dirty Deeds Done Six Feet Deep', in Rue Morgue, January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths "Six Feet Under Club takes Sex To New Depths", in 'Carnal Nation', 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213234425/http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance was repeated at the Viennese club ''Schwelle 7'' in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/heute-sarg-3.jpg Heute: "Sex im Sarg: Alle sind schon sehr erregt", 29 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/six-feet-club-art-project-burying-kinky-couples-alive/ Huck Magazine: "The Six Feet Under Club: an art project burying kinky couples alive", 31 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

BHAC was located in the heart of [[Butetown]] (previously known as [[Tiger Bay]]), one of the UK's oldest multi-racial communities.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; The community centre started off as a place for weekly oral history classes and was the initiative of African-American academic, Glenn Jordan, who arrived in Cardiff during the 1980s and decided to stay, hoping to allow the Tiger Bay residents a chance to track the 150-year history of Cardiff Bay.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; Jordan and BHAC have aimed to create an archive of local people's memories, documents and photographs.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt; The Centre emerged in 1988 with the help of a small handful of local residents, meeting at the Butetown Community Centre where they learnt interview techniques and recording methods.&lt;ref name="without guarantees 167" /&gt; By 2000 the Centre had recorded several hundred hours of oral history, published several books and was running cultural-political and educational activities for local adults.By 2005 the centre had collected 450 hours of oral history and 3,000 photographs.&lt;ref name="politics of heritage" /&gt; BHAC's collection also includes paintings, photographs and sculptures by local artists.  It occupied a {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} building in the centre of Butetown,&lt;ref name="without guarantees 167" /&gt; which it moved into in 1996 with the help of European funding.&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt;

The Centre was featured in a 2001 report, "Creative Regeneration: Lessons from 10 Community Arts Projects", by the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]].&lt;ref name="mixed metaphor" /&gt;

Visual and performing arts have become increasingly important dimensions of BHAC's work. The centre now runs the Diversity Arts Wales (DAW) programme – an initiative, funded by the Arts Council of Wales, that supports the professional development of artists from ethnic minority backgrounds. DAW also encourages artists, whatever their background, to engage in multicultural and intercultural work.

BHAC has been funded by the Home Office, [[Welsh Assembly]], [[Arts Council for Wales]], [[Cardiff Council]] and various foundations.&lt;ref name="future secured" /&gt; However the BHAC now relies largely on volunteer staff and income from the museum shop.

== Archive== 
One of the main areas within the BHAC is the archive which is the result of over 25 years of collecting history connected to the multicultural area of Cardiff Bay. By 2005 BHAC had collected 3000 photographs and 500 hours of oral history.&lt;ref name="bhac.org"&gt;http://bhac.org/?page_id=910&lt;/ref&gt; The centre’s collection also includes paintings, videos, official documentation and sculptures by local artists. The current priority of the BHAC is to make the archive fully accessible online and to add to the collection, to expand their multimedia displays and educational materials to allow for more exhibitions.&lt;ref name="bhac.org"/&gt; 
[[File:Exhibition room.jpg|thumbnail|One of the Exhibition Rooms at the BHAC, currently being used as an Art Gallery]]

==Visual and Performing Arts==

Since 2003, Butetown History and Arts Centre have held nineteen exhibitions, which have focused on bringing awareness of Wales as a culturally and ethnically diverse nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://butetownhac.org.uk/arts/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the pieces have even been featured on BBC’s ‘Your Paintings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/locations/butetown-history-arts-centre-6400 |title=Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre |publisher=BBC Your Paintings |accessdate=7 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
Within the Butetown History and Arts Centre, there have been a number of books published over the years. All of the books held in the BHAC are based around Cardiff Bay and they all, in one way or another, focus upon the Bay's history such as; 'Butetown &amp; Cardiff Docks' compiled by Brian Lee and Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://butetownhac.org.uk/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==

In May 2016 the centre's committee announced they had no alternative but to close BHAC, because of a lack of new funding. They were looking for a storage facility to preserve their archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ruth Mosalski|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/butetown-history-arts-centre-close-11365080 |title=Butetown History and Arts Centre to close its doors - but needs help to keep archive |work=Wales Online |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is reported as closed in December 2017.

'''Castleberry Hill''' is a neighborhood in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], adjacent to and southwest of [[Downtown Atlanta]]. It is a federally recognized [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] since 1985 and became a [[List of historic buildings and districts designated by the City of Atlanta|City of Atlanta Landmark District]] in 2006. Since 2000, the area has experienced an influx of residents and new businesses. The area, which is made up predominantly of Walker, Nelson and Peters Streets is home to a growing number of small art galleries, restaurants, coffee shops, and loft residences. Less than a mile from the historically black colleges and universities that make up the [[Atlanta University Center]] Consortium and from the expansive downtown campus of [[Georgia State University]], the area also offers local shopping as well as spa services, like [http://iwifresh.com iwi Fresh]. Other notable area eateries include [http://www.nomascantina.com No Mas! Cantina], a spacious Mexican-themed restaurant, bar and fine home furnishings establishment, often used as a point of reference.  Castleberry Hill residents gather at local watering holes, such as [http://www.elliottstreet.com Elliott Street Pub] and [http://www.bottlerocketatl.com Bottle Rocket].

==History==
The area in the city limits of Atlanta known today as Castleberry Hill was originally part of the renegade [[Jonathan Norcross|Snake Nation]] community that functioned during the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/crime-city/the-most-lawless-year-in-atlantas-history/|title=The most lawless year in Atlanta's history - Atlanta Magazine|date=15 May 2014|website=Atlantamagazine.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pecannelog.com/2009/07/01/breaking-news-atlantas-seedy-past-2// |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208092708/http://pecannelog.com/2009/07/01/breaking-news-atlantas-seedy-past-2/ |archive-date=2015-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an article from Atlanta Magazine,&lt;ref name="Atlanta's Street Names 2009, p. 64"&gt;"Who the Heck Was Juan Ponce de Leon?: The Stories behind Atlanta's Street Names," Atlanta Magazine, March 2009, Vol. 48, Issue 11, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Castleberry Hill was, by the mid-nineteenth century, a red-light district filled with prostitutes, gambling, and cockfighting.  By the time the Civil War began, however, this area was in the process of industrialization.  Items such as terra cotta and other building materials were produced then in Atlanta factories.  Additionally, Castleberry Hill then contained cotton warehousing and grocers.  One of those grocers was Daniel Castleberry, for whom the area was named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleberryhill.org/history.php Castleberry Hill History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216161223/http://www.castleberryhill.org/history.php |date=2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Castleberry, however, is believed to have been an established businessman in the area as a result of his winning the land in 1821 in a Georgia land lottery.&lt;ref name="Atlanta's Street Names 2009, p. 64"/&gt; By the early 1990s, the area had fallen on hard times, serving as the backdrop for [[dystopic]] films such as [[Freejack]] and [[Kalifornia]].  Loft conversions began in the 1980s, and by 1992, there were 120 lofts with 150 residents. The [[Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996|1996 Olympics]] saw another influx of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD1430F935A15752C0A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=FOCUS; Loft-Living, Southern Style, Catching On | first=Ford | last=Risley | date=1992-01-26 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, however, Castleberry Hill began another renaissance with major motion pictures and TV series such as [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/?ref_=nv_sr_1'The Walking Dead'] being filmed in the area; the now well-known Castleberry Hill Art Stroll, which is held on the second Friday of each month, has become yet another popular event in this area.&lt;ref&gt;"Downtown's Colorful Communities," Atlanta Magazine, Oct. 2014, Vol. 54, Issue 6, p. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The "XX Chromosome Genome Project" by S. Ann Johnson is a modern example of a choreopoem. It combines poetry, song and dance to illuminate the commonalities and differences between women of various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The XX Chromosome Genome Project by S. Ann Johnson|url=http://www.twopensandlint.com/sannjohnson/|publisher=2 Pens &amp; Lint LLC|accessdate= May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this choreopoem, Johnson writes about eight women in search of self-acceptance and liberation. These colorfully dressed women, who are named after flavors of foods, represent international cultures around the world through music, spoken word, and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matema|first=ZSun-Nee|title=‘XX Chromosome Genome Project’ at Hamilton Arts Center|url=http://www.dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2013/06/29/xx-chromosome-genome-project-at-hamilton-arts-center-by-zsun-nee-matema/|publisher=DC Metro Theater Arts|accessdate= May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Influenced by women from the [[Black Arts Movement]], based on [[Black Nationalism]] that encouraged [[black separatism]], and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist arts movement]], which focused on using art of various mediums as acts against war and in favor of civil and homosexual rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm#|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate= May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange wanted to create a genre that was interdisciplinary and allowed for performers to use all senses of the body. Working closely with choreographer [[Dianne McIntyre]], Shange was able to confront her childhood experiences through movement. McIntyre helped to choreograph ''for colored girls'' with Shange, as they wanted to convey awareness and community through dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Brooks| first=Kara |title=Ntozake Shange on Why She Had to Dance| url=http://oberlinreview.org/4505/arts/4505/|accessdate= May 11, 2014|newspaper=The Oberlin Review|date= February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of movement and dance in a choreopoem was as essential to her as the poetry aspect. Shange described that "with dance (she) discovered (her) body more intimately than (she) had imagined possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Collins| first=Lisa| title=Activists Who Yearn for Art That Transforms: Parallels in the Black Arts and Feminist Art Movements in the United States| journal=| volume=31| issue=3| pages=717–752 | doi=10.1086/498991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange’s emphasis on dance was a result of her experience with [[African dance]] and movement classes as well as her exposure to [[Santeria]] through dance and music as it relates to African dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Effiong|first=Philip|title=Ntozake Shange’s Choreopoem: Reinventing a Heritage of Poetry and  Dance|url=http://www.philip-effiong.com/Shange-Choreopoem.pdf|accessdate= May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her choreopoems, Shange tends to focus on “self-awareness, self-definition, and solidarity”.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

&lt;!-- Not sure if this part is necessary: information about Shange is not necessarily applicable to an article on choreopoems. Though the movement was started by Shange, if Shange's choreopoems are discussed here, it would only be fair to discuss all the others as well, which is not very practical.
Although influenced by these movements, Shange felt as though black women were not included. In response, she uses her writing to elaborate on women of color’s experiences in her works with choreopoems while expanding the definition of black womanhood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Lisa|title=Activists Who Yearn for Art That Transforms: Parallels in the Black Arts and Feminist Art Movements in the United States|journal=|volume=31|issue=3|pages=717–752 |doi=10.1086/498991}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
--&gt;
Many choreopoems were performed with African-American cultural inspiration but were not focused on black separatism. These choreopoems were focused upon teaching the culture and history of Africans and Americans of African descent to all comers interested in learning.
Seattle's Choreopoets held this philosophy. Members of the Choreopoets included Mary Stone Hanley&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine R. Grumet, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [http://soe.unc.edu/news_events/slate/slate_winter01.pdf "School Welcomes Five New Colleagues"], Winter 2001. Retrieved July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  who founded Choreopoets along with Gilda Sheppard.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Stone Hanley, Gilda L. Sheppard, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=bSeAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Mary+Stone+Hanley+choreopoet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oou5HuwZER&amp;sig=959cYUs88EPpuY0Jo00L_634gOA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7ZPAU57IEM-7oQSymoHYBQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Stone%20Hanley%20choreopoet&amp;f=false ''Culturally Relevant Arts Education for Social Justice: A Way Out of No Way''] (London, GB 2013), p. 5.

The '''Coat of Arms of Greater Manchester''' was granted to the [[Greater Manchester County Council]] upon its formation in 1974 by the [[College of Arms]]. The county council was abolished as a consequence of the [[Local Government Act 1985]] which rendered the arms as being no longer officially in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530803.stm |title=31 March: 1986: Greater London Council abolished |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 November 2014 |year=2008 |work=On this day 1950–2005}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[blazon]] of the arms is described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | title= Tradition in action: the historical evolution of the Greater Manchester County |last=Frangopulo|first=Nicholas Joseph | year= 1977 | publisher=EP Publishing |ref=harv| isbn= 0-7158-1203-3|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Shield''': The shield bears ten turrets in gold, representing the ten districts of the County, on a red ground.
*'''Supporters''': The shield is supported on each side by a lion rampant in gold. Each lion bears on its shoulder a badge in red, the lion on the right of the shield bearing a badge with a French horn, representing music and culture, and the lion on the left of the shield bearing a badge with an open book, representing learning and academic life of the County.
*'''Crest''': The helm is surmounted by a demi-lion carrying a banner bearing ten small turrets in gold on a red ground.
*'''Motto''': ''"Ever Vigilant"''.

==Today==

[[File:County Flag of Greater Manchester.png |thumb|right|[[Flag of Greater Manchester|County Flag of Greater Manchester]]]]
Although the coat of arms is no longer in use by authorities, variant segments of the arms are still used today, such as the badge of the [[Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service]] whose arms bear a defaced version of the shield without the gold [[Battlement|crenellations]] trim, and the crest which is also used by the [[Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force]], a demi-lion carrying the banner. A version of the shield was also used as the flag which is still used to represent the county.

&lt;!--With the planned appointment of a directly elected [[Mayor of Greater Manchester]] in the future, alongside the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, it is unknown if the coat of arms or flag will be transferred and officially re-adopted as a form of authority identification.--&gt;

A '''collective work''' under the [[copyright law of France]] is a [[collective work]] that contains the works of several authors created, assembled, harmonized and published under the direction of a person or  organization who owns the commercial and moral rights of the work as a whole. 
The work as a whole is distinct from the individual contributions, which are owned by the authors.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, in a different context and layout from the printed work, to be considered to be outside the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==Definitions==

Article L113-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code defines three types of multi-author works:{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}}
* "Work of collaboration" shall mean a work in the creation of which more than one natural person has participated.
* "Composite work" shall mean a new work in which a preexisting work is incorporated without the collaboration of the author of the latter work.
* "Collective work" shall mean a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.{{efn|The definition in Spanish copyright law, much influenced by French law, says a collective work "consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work."{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}} This is perhaps clearer than the French form "in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}} }}

Article L113-5 states that "A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
Article L123-3 states that "In the case of pseudonymous, anonymous or collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

==Interpretations==

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in French law is complicated and unclear, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical
works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Courts have also ruled that collective works may include such things as the elements of a car body, a computer program, a poster and a guide of administrative formalities.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=70}}

Basic conditions for a collective work are that there must be a promoter, presenter or orchestrator, and the work must not be joint authorship.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The work's ''maître'', a natural or legal person, directs creation of the collective work, harmonizes the contributions, edits, publishes and discloses the work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The  ''maître'' decides on the theme, treatment and spirit of the work, assembles the contributions, harmonizes it and publishes the overall work. 
The contributors have not significantly cooperated in creating the overall work, but have each worked independently under the direction of the ''maître''.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}

In a 1999 dispute over the rights of the daily newspaper [[Le Progrès]] to publish articles online, the lower court refused to designate Le Progrès a collective work, but the Court of Appeal ruled that it was a collective work by virtue of assembling a newspaper in several editions, selecting and presenting the contributions at the sole discretion of the owner, Groupe Progrès.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
By working under the direction of the owner, the contributors lose their creative independence, however important their contributions are to the collective work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

==Proprietary rights==

A collective work is unusual in French law in that a juristic person may be the initial owner of a work without having to show evidence that the copyright was assigned.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=71}}
As a rule, French courts do not recognise that an employee has transferred their rights to an employer unless there is evidence of such a transfer in the form of an agreement.
A collective work is an exception.
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}

The 1885 [[Berne Convention]] stated that journalists owned their work, but this depends on whether a newspaper is seen as a collection of works or as a collective work.
In France, journalists own their work in either case.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
Article L121-8 states that whether or not a newspaper or periodical is considered to be a collective work the journalists retain the rights to exploit their contributions.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
The promoter is the sole owner of the rights in the collective work as a whole, but the contributors have author rights in their own contributions.
Case law has determined that the investor's initial right of property is limited to the first commercial release of the collective work.
The contributors can then commercialize their contributions separately as long as this does not adversely affect commercialization of the collective work as a whole.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The contributors to a newspaper thus have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

==Moral rights==

Moral rights are seen as personality rights in French law, attached to the personality of the author and inalienable.
They are retained by the author even when the patrimonial rights are sold.{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The Intellectual Property Code says the ''maître'' has the author's rights, and does not distinguish between moral and economic rights.
However, only a natural person can be an author, and moral rights cannot be alienated from the author, giving rise to uncertainty over whether the ''maître'' could claim any moral rights in the collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
However, in a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') reversed the decision of a lower court and stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The owner of the collective work may not be a natural person, so they are not an author in the strict sense, but they own the moral rights as well as the economic rights, and may therefore prohibit violations of their moral rights such as distortion of the collective work.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution, and may enforce this right against third parties or against the ''maître'' if they make unauthorized changes to the contribution. 
Despite this, the ''maître'' may modify the contributions as far as is needed to harmonize them with the collective work as a whole.
The moral right of the contributor is limited by the fusion of their contribution with those of the other co-authors.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

==Electronic reproduction==

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

As an example of digital reproduction of the full work, since 2005 the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (BnF) has been digitizing editions of daily and weekly periodicals that were published before 1943. Some of this has been through agreements with the publishers ''L’Ouest-Éclair'' and ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''. 
Where the BnF does not have such an agreement, the BnF considers the newspaper to be a collective work that entered the public domain 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Presse écrite numérisée – BnF}}
Some of these digitized journals may contain contributions for which the individual author's rights have not expired.
Thus the cover of the digitized ''[[:fr:La Baïonnette|La Baïonnette]]'' of 2 December 1915 has an illustration by the artist [[:fr:Albert Jarach|Albert Jarach]], who died in 1962 and whose rights would not expire until 2033.{{sfn|La Baïonnette – BnF}}

France was the first country to introduce an online newspaper, with the [[Minitel]] service in the 1980s.
Today the online and print versions of newspaper are typically run by different departments and have different appearance, with the online versions updated frequently and providing video boxes and  interactive features. Some newspapers are online only.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Print Media versus Electronic Media}}
A case between the French national union of journalists and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper was heard on 14 April 1999 by the Court of First Instance in Paris.
''Le Figaro'' had created a website where articles by the journalists could be consulted online.
The court ruled that although the printed newspaper was a collective work, the rights of the journalists concerning their articles had been infringed.
''Le Figaro'' only had the right to publish the articles in the printed newspaper, and the website would be considered another newspaper or magazine.{{sfn|Delcros|1999}}

On 9 December 1999 the Lyon Court of Appeal ruled similarly that the daily newspaper ''[[Le Progrès]]'' was guilty of forgery for having published its journalists' articles on the internet.
Although the newspaper was a collective work, the right of the owner to reproduction was limited to the paper edition, and the website could not be seen as an extension of that edition.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
A similar judgement was issued by the Court of Cassation  on 3 July 2013 in a case concerning the newspaper ''L'Union''.
The court said that whether or not that newspaper was a collective work, which had not been proven, the consent of a contributor was required before his contributions could be reproduced on an Internet site and reproduced in another newspaper.{{sfn|Audience publique du mercredi 3 juillet 2013}}

Newspapers have responded by signing agreements with journalist's unions that took different approaches to cover online publication of articles.
''Les Derniéres Nouvelles d'Alsace'' paid journalists for online use. 
''[[Le Monde]]'' compensated journalists for ceding their copyright. 
''[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]]'' made an agreement that treated the print and online versions as one.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}

[[File:Holland-Amerika Lijn 1898.jpg|thumbnail|right|An 1898 poster by [[Jan van Beers (artist)|Jan Van Beers]].]]
'''Commercial art''' is the art of [[creative services]], referring to [[art]] created for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes, primarily [[advertising]]. Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting sale and interest of products, services, and ideas.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/commercial_art.html|title=What is Commercial Art?|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879527515|title=Persuasion and influence in American life|last=C.|first=Woodward, Gary|others=Denton, Robert E., Jr.|isbn=9781478607892|edition= Seventh |location=Long Grove, Illinois|oclc=879527515}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complimentary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Commercial_Art_Professions_Job_Description_and_Information_About_Starting_a_Career_as_a_Commercial_Artist_or_Commercial_Designer.html|title=Commercial Artist: Job Description &amp; Career Information|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.

People can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.

==Skills of Commercial Art==
Commercial artists have the ability to organize information and knowledge of [[fine art]]s, [[Mental image|visualization]] and media in a way to reach an audience's attention. Some of these skills may include the following:&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Attention to detail
* Ability to communicate effectively
* Experience or skills in the fine arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.)
* Knowledgeable of certain computer software programs (graphics, editing, etc.) and ability to use them
* [[Marketing]] skills
* [[Advertising]] skills
* Coordination skills
* [[Animation]] skills

==Genres==
Commercial art can include many genres of art and categories of art technique, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplicable.com/new/types-of-commercial-art|title=11 Types Of Commercial Art|website=Simplicable|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Consumerism]] within Commercial Art ==
Commercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services, products, and ideas to viewers.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt; In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-warhol-andy-artworks.htm#pnt_1|title=Andy Warhol Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell]]'s soup and [[Coca-Cola]] bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through [[pop art]] that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Consumerism]] was present when [[pop art]] was popular. Pop art could contain mass cultural objects and/or [[Celebrity|celebrities]] ([[popular culture]] and [[mass media]]) to endorse markets and goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm|title=Pop Art Movement, Artists and Major Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cymatics''', from {{lang-grc|κῦμα}}, meaning "wave", is a subset of [[normal mode|modal vibrational phenomena]]. The term was coined by [[Hans Jenny (cymatics)|Hans Jenny]] (1904-1972), a Swiss follower of the philosophical school known as [[anthroposophy]]. Typically the surface of a plate, diaphragm or membrane is vibrated, and regions of maximum and minimum displacement are made visible in a thin coating of particles, paste or liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenny |first= Hans |title= Cymatics: A Study of Wave Phenomena &amp; Vibration |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Macromedia Press]] |date=July 2001 |isbn= 1-888138-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different patterns emerge in the excitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.

The apparatus employed can be simple, such as the Chinese [[standing bell|spouting bowl]], in which copper handles are rubbed and cause the copper bottom elements to vibrate. Other examples include the [[Ernst Chladni#Chladni figures|Chladni Plate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Instructional Research Lab: Chladni Plate |url= http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demoweb/demomanual/acoustics/effects_of_sound/chladni_plate.html |publisher= University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the so-called cymascope.

==History==
On July 8, 1680, [[Robert Hooke]] was able to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.&lt;ref name="ODS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130408234655/http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/chladni.html Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni], ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientists,'' Oxford Univ. Press, 1999, p. 101 (archive.org link). Accessed 24 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German musician and physicist [[Ernst Chladni]] noticed in the eighteenth century that the modes of vibration of a membrane or a plate can be observed by sprinkling the vibrating surface with a fine dust (e.g., [[lycopodium powder]], flour or fine sand). The powder moves due to the vibration and accumulates progressively in points of the surface corresponding to the sound vibration. The points form a pattern of lines, known as "nodal lines of the vibration mode". The normal modes of vibration, and the pattern of nodal lines associated with each of these, are completely determined, for a surface with homogeneous mechanical characteristics, from the geometric shape of the surface and by the way in which the surface is constrained.&lt;ref name="ODS"/&gt;

Experiments of this kind, similar to those carried out earlier by [[Galileo Galilei]]&lt;ref name="amsci"&gt;J. McLaughlin, "[http://www.americanscientist.org/my_amsci/restricted.aspx?act=pdf&amp;id=3057428159866 Good Vibrations]" in ''American Scientist'', July–August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1630 and by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1680, were later perfected by Chladni, who introduced them systematically in 1787 in his book ''Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges'' (Discoveries on the theory of sound). This provided an important contribution to the understanding of acoustic phenomena and the functioning of musical instruments. The figures thus obtained (with the aid of a violin bow that rubbed perpendicularly along the edge of smooth plates covered with fine sand) are still designated by the name of "Chladni figures".

==Work of Hans Jenny==
In 1967 [[Hans Jenny (cymatics)|Hans Jenny]], a follower of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] doctrine of [[Rudolf Steiner]], published two volumes entitled ''Kymatic'' (1967 and 1972), in which, repeating Chladni's experiments, he claimed the existence of a subtle power based on the normal, symmetrical images made by [[sound wave]]s. Jenny put sand, dust and fluids on a metal plate connected to an oscillator which could produce a broad spectrum of frequencies. The sand or other substances were organized into different structures characterized by geometric shapes typical of the frequency of the vibration emitted by the oscillator. Modern analysts, including [[Michael Shermer]], have termed anthroposophy's application in areas such as engineering, medicine, biology, and biodynamic agriculture as [[pseudoscience]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to Jenny, these structures, reminiscent of the mandala and other forms recurring in nature, would be a manifestation of an invisible force field of the vibrational energy that generated it. He was particularly impressed by an observation that imposing a vocalization in ancient Sanskrit of [[Om]] (regarded by Hindus and Buddhists as the sound of creation) the lycopodium powder formed a circle with a centre point, one of the ways in which Om had been represented. In fact, for a plate of circular shape, resting in the centre (or the border, or at least in a set of points with central symmetry), the nodal vibration modes all have central symmetry, so the observation of Jenny is entirely consistent with well known mathematical properties.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

From the physical-mathematical standpoint, the form of the nodal patterns is predetermined by the shape of the body set in vibration or, in the case of acoustic waves in a gas, the shape of the cavity in which the gas is contained. The sound wave, therefore, does not influence at all the shape of the vibrating body or the shape of the nodal patterns. The only thing that changes due to the vibration is the arrangement of the sand. The image formed by the sand, in turn, is influenced by the frequency spectrum of the vibration only because each vibration mode is characterized by a specific frequency. Therefore, the spectrum of the signal that excites the vibration determines which patterns are actually nodally displayed.

The physical phenomena involved in the formation of Chladni figures are best explained by classical physics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==In healing==

It has been speculated by some researchers that application of ultrasound cause wounds to heal faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= July 16, 2015 |url=https://www.popsci.com/sound-waves-accelerate-healing |title=Sound Waves Could Speed Up Wound Healing |website=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other than select articles on the subject of low-amplitude high-frequency sound in bone fracture healing,&lt;ref name="fractures"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18924140 | doi=10.1002/jor.20753 | volume=27 | title=Low-magnitude high-frequency vibration accelerates callus formation, mineralization, and fracture healing in rats | journal=J Orthop Res | pages=458–65 | last1 = Leung | first1 = KS | last2 = Shi | first2 = HF | last3 = Cheung | first3 = WH | last4 = Qin | first4 = L | last5 = Ng | first5 = WK | last6 = Tam | first6 = KF | last7 = Tang | first7 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no medical evidence of this phenomenon.

==Influences on art and music==
Devices for displaying nodal images have influenced visual arts and contemporary music. Artist [[Björk]] created projections of cymatics patterns by using bass frequencies on tour for her album ''Biophilia''.

Hans Jenny's book on Chladni figures influenced [[Alvin Lucier]] and helped lead to Lucier's composition ''Queen of the South''. Jenny's work was also followed up by [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] (CAVS) founder [[György Kepes]] at [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="kepes"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021104072629/http://web.mit.edu/cavs/people/kepes/kepes.html György Kepes profile at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of [[sheet metal]] in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and [[thermodynamic]] patterns were made visible by this setup.

In the mid 1980s, visual artist [[Ron Rocco]], who also developed his work at CAVS, employed mirrors mounted to tiny [[servo motor]]s, driven by the audio signal of a synthesizer and amplified by a tube amp to reflect the beam of a laser. This created light patterns which corresponded to the audio's frequency and amplitude. Using this beam to generate video feedback and computers to process the feedback signal, Rocco created his "Andro-media" series of installations. Rocco later formed a collaboration with musician David Hykes, who practiced a form of Mongolian overtone chanting with The Harmonic Choir, to generate cymatic images from a pool of liquid mercury, which functioned as a liquid mirror to modulate the beam of a Helium-Neon [[laser]] from the sound thus generated. Photographs of this work can be found in the [[Ars Electronica]] catalog of 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/In_Light_of_Sound_%28study_1%29.jpg "In Light of Sound study 1" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary German photographer and philosopher [[Alexander Lauterwasser]] has brought cymatics into the 21st century using finely crafted [[frequency modulation synthesis|crystal oscillator]]s to resonate steel plates covered with fine sand and to vibrate small samples of water in [[Petri dish]]es. His first book, ''Water Sound Images'',&lt;ref name="Lauterwasser"&gt;Lauterwasser, Alexander (2006). ''Water Sound Images.'' {{ISBN|1-888138-09-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated into English in 2006, features imagery of light reflecting off the surface of water set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure [[sine wave]]s to music by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] group ''Kymatik'' (who often record in [[ambisonics|ambisonic]] surround sound) and [[overtone singing]]. The resulting photographs of standing wave patterns are striking. Lauterwasser's book focused on creating detailed visual analogues of natural patterns ranging from the distribution of spots on a leopard to the geometric patterns found in plants and flowers, to the shapes of jellyfish and the intricate patterns found on the shell of a tortoise.

Composer [[Stuart Mitchell]] and his father T.J. Mitchell claimed that [[Rosslyn Chapel]]'s carvings supposedly contain references to cymatics patterns. In 2005 they created a work called ''The Rosslyn Motet'' realised by attempting to match various [[Chladni]] patterns to 13 geometric symbols carved onto the faces of cubes emanating from 14 arches.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Chris (May 19, 2011). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110623063324/http://www.slate.com/id/2294490/ The Rosslyn Code: Is a Scottish Da Vinci responsible for the Rosslyn melodies?]", ''Slate.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many claims in the cymatics community, the hypothesis that the carvings represent Chladni patterns is not supported by scientific or historical evidence. One of the problems is that many of the 'box' carvings are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century following damage by erosion.

The musical group, "The Glitch Mob" used cymatics to produce the music video "Becoming Harmonious (ft. Metal Mother)".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/theglitchmobmusic/videos/10153925995807733/&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Yantra]] diagrams and cymatics, artist and fashion designer [[Mandali Mendrilla]] created a sculpture dress called "Kamadhenu (Wish Tree Dress III)" the pattern of which is based 
on a Yantra diagram depicting goddess [[Kamadhenu]].
&lt;ref&gt;https://atma.hr/dizajnerica-mandali-predstavila-zagrebu-carobnu-haljinu-jeste-li-i-vi-vezali-svoju-zelju/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://mendrilla.wordpress.com/2016/07/08/kamadhenu-wish-tree-dress-iii-on-sound-in-ether-and-artistic-inspiration/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aphex Twin]] suggests learning more about cymatics (linking to this article) in reference to 'master tuning of [[A440_(pitch_standard)|440&amp;nbsp;Hz]]' in a conversation with synth-maker [[Tatsuya Takahashi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://item.warp.net/interview/aphex-twin-speaks-to-tatsuya-takahashi&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the art collective Analema Group creates participatory performances in which cymatic patterns are produced digitally in real-time by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.analemagroup.com|title=ANALEMA GROUP|website=ANALEMA GROUP|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences in engineering==
Inspired by periodic and symmetrical patterns at the air-liquid interface created by sound vibration, P. Chen and coworkers developed a method to engineer diverse structures from microscale materials using liquid-based templates.&lt;ref&gt;P. Chen, Z. Luo, S. Guven, S. Tasoglu, A. Weng, A. V. Ganesan, U. Demirci, Advanced Materials 2014, 10.1002/adma.201402079. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201402079/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured by tuning vibration frequency and acceleration.

'''''Filibus''''' is a 1915 Italian [[Silent film|silent]] [[adventure film]] directed by Mario Roncoroni and written by Giovanni Bertinetti. The film features Cristina Ruspoli as the title character, a mysterious [[sky pirate]] who makes daring heists with her technologically advanced [[airship]]. When an esteemed detective sets out on her trail, she begins an elaborate game of [[cat and mouse]] with him, slipping between various male and female identities to romance the detective's sister and stage a midnight theft of a pair of valuable diamonds.

''Filibus'' was released by Corona Film, a short-lived Turin-based studio operating on relatively low budgets and obscure casts. Though Italian reviews at the time of its release were negative, ''Filibus'' has been well received by later writers and film historians, who have highlighted the film's pioneering use of [[lesbian]] attraction, [[genderfluidity]], and [[science fiction]] motifs, as well as its creative adaptation of stylistic elements from contemporary popular fiction. The film has been screened at numerous film festivals, and prints of it survive in archives in the Netherlands and in Italy.

== Plot ==
[[File:Filibus cat poster.jpg|thumb|left|Filibus stages the diamond theft, as shown on a contemporary poster for the film]]

The elegant Baroness Troixmonde has a secret identity: a mysterious burglar known to the world only as Filibus. In the wake of a bank robbery, a large cash reward is offered to anyone who can track Filibus down, and the renowned Detective Hardy puts himself on the case. The Baroness visits the notary in charge of the cash reward, and enters her own name in the competition. Encountering Hardy in the notary's office, she hatches a plan to baffle him: she tells him that she knows he himself is Filibus. Leaving the office in her chauffeured motorcar, she catches sight of Hardy's sister, Leonora.

The Baroness rides to a deserted country road, where she uses a [[heliograph]] to signal for Filibus's [[airship]]. Her crew of silent masked assistants lower a capsule, allowing Filibus to reach the airship, change into her burglary outfit, and fly to Hardy's residence. Hardy is being visited by his friend, the antiques collector Leo Sandy, who is unrequitedly in love with Leonora. Filibus, seizing a moment when Hardy is alone, uses the capsule to reach him and put him to sleep with a [[narcotic]]. She takes a print of Hardy's hand, which she will use to make a specially formed glove.

In disguise as a young nobleman, the Count de la Brive, Filibus stages the kidnapping and rescue of Leonora, leaving a print from the special glove on Leonora's clothing. The grateful Hardy invites the nobleman to stay with them for some days, and the Count begins courting Leonora. At a party at Leo Sandy's villa, they see a glass case containing his prize acquisition, an ancient Egyptian statue of a cat with priceless diamond eyes. When Sandy turns out the lights to show off the sparkling diamonds, the Count cuts a hole in the glass and deposits a note announcing that Filibus will steal the statue that night. Hardy attempts to search the guests, but to his consternation finds the glass piece in his own pocket, with fingerprints that match none of the guests' hands. At home, he realizes to his horror that the prints on both the glass piece and Leonora's outfit match his own handprint.

Hardy, resolved to trap Filibus, has Sandy plant a tiny camera in one eye of the statue and replace the real diamonds with artificial ones. That night, Filibus flies to Sandy's villa, kidnaps him, puts Hardy under the narcotic, and reaches the statue. Realizing Hardy's ruse, she locates the real diamonds, and stages the theft so that the hidden camera photographs the unconscious Hardy's face instead of hers.

Filibus returns Hardy to his home, plants one of the real diamonds on his desk, and telephones the police to alert them of the theft and kidnapping. Hardy pleads his innocence, but when they examine the diamond and the hidden camera's picture, the police are led to believe that Hardy must indeed be Filibus. Hardy fears that this may indeed be the case, if he committed all of Filibus's heists while [[sleepwalking]]. Meanwhile, Leo Sandy, escaping Filibus's assistants and parachuting out of the dirigible, is picked up by a passing car and brought back to his villa. Learning of Hardy's arrest, Sandy rushes to his assistance and gives his evidence about his kidnapping. The relieved Hardy is allowed to go free and pursue the real Filibus, whose identity is still unknown.

Intending to trap Filibus, he tells the press to announce that he has returned to his home. Filibus decides to use the narcotic to pin another crime on him, a robbery of the International Bank. This time Hardy is prepared, and seizes Filibus when she tries to administer the narcotic. Recognizing her as the Count de la Brive, he ties her up, locks her in his office, and goes to get the police. By the time he returns with policemen, Filibus has managed to get to a window, signal for her airship, and escape into the sky. A few days later, Sandy proposes to Leonora and is accepted. Just as Hardy is congratulating them, a letter falls from the sky—a letter from Filibus, telling him that they may meet again. High in the clouds, the Baroness Troixmonde, the mysterious sky pirate Filibus, laughs over her haul from the International Bank.

== Production ==
[[File:Filibus_still.jpg|thumb|Filibus in her airship]]
In 1914, the Turin-based film distributor Umberto Corona launched his own production company, Corona Film. The company produced 26 films before disbanding in 1918, mostly low-budget [[adventure film]]s with little-known casts.&lt;ref name=CR&gt;{{citation|title=Il Cinema Ritrovato 1997|year=1997|pages=4, 6|publisher=[[Cineteca di Bologna]]|url=http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/files/festival/CinemaRitrovato/archivio/fcr1997.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Filibus'', one of the company's offerings for 1915, was directed by Mario Roncoroni, probably making his directorial debut.&lt;ref name=Lotti&gt;{{citation|first=Dennis|last=Lotti|chapter=Da Icaro a De Pinedo: Il mito del volo alle origini del cinema italiano|editor-last=Brunetta|editor-first=Gian Piero|title=Metamorfosi del mito classico nel cinema|location=Bologna|publisher=Il mulino|year=2011|pages=327–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roncoroni went on to direct ''La Nave'' (1921) in collaboration with [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], before moving to Spain, where his film career continued during the rest of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt; The cinematography was by Luigi Fiorio.&lt;ref name=YFA/&gt; In the title role was the actress Cristina Ruspoli,&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; who appeared in some thirty feature films between 1912 and 1916.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt; Other players included Giovanni Spano, Mario Mariani, and Filippo Vallino.&lt;ref name=YFA&gt;{{citation|title=XVII Festival nitratnog filma|year=2015|publisher=[[Yugoslav Film Archive]]|url=http://www.kinoteka.org.rs/wp/program-download/program-zap.pdf|page=21|language=Serbian|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay was by Giovanni Bertinetti, a writer connected to the [[Futurist]] movement among the Turin intelligentsia; in addition to film scenarios, he wrote [[science fiction]] and adventure stories for children, as well as self-help guides espousing the Futurist ideals of "courage, audacity and revolt."&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt; In writing ''Filibus'', Bertinetti may have been especially influenced by a contemporary push to bring [[feminist]] ideals to Futurism, spearheaded by the French writer [[Valentine de Saint-Point]]'s call for women to shake off oppression and torpor and to embrace the activity and independence associated with men.&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt;

==Themes==
''Filibus'' reflects the vogue in the 1910s for action-packed [[serial film]]s featuring [[supervillains]], such as [[Louis Feuillade]]'s ''[[Fantômas (1913 serial)|Fantômas]]'' (1913) and ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'' (1916).&lt;ref name=YFA/&gt; Filibus's adventures in the film also recall other early action serials such as ''[[The Exploits of Elaine]]'' (1914), as well as the [[Arsène Lupin]] novels by [[Maurice Leblanc]].&lt;ref name=Nava/&gt; (While the character of Filibus was likely inspired by the huge popularity of [[Fantômas]], she strongly resembles Lupin in her enthusiasm for burgling and baffling for the thrill of it rather than for direct reward.)&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{citation|title=Uomini meccanici e matrimoni interplanetari: La straordinarissima avventura del cinema muto italiano di fantascienza|first=Paolo|last=Bertetti|journal=Anarres|volume=2|date=Winter 2013–14|url=http://www.fantascienza.com/anarres/articoli/32/uomini-meccanici-e-matrimoni-interplanetari/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also recalls [[Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset]]'s 1913 adventure film ''Protéa'', featuring a female spy who dons multiple disguises (albeit working under a male boss and in partnership with a male spy, unlike the autonomous Filibus).&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt;

The film, while based in motifs and themes already popular in adventure serials, uses them in unusual ways; for example, the film's plot pushes the genre to the limits of its stylistic conventions, verging on a style redolent of fantasy. The screenplay also includes numerous unusual ideas, including the central image of the female sky pirate in her innovative airship&lt;ref name=Lotti/&gt; and the concept of a high-society protagonist with a [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll-and-Hyde]]-like double nature.&lt;ref name=YFA/&gt;

In particular, the character of Filibus was novel for adventure films in presenting an all-powerful female character in full control of her life and actions,&lt;ref name=Lotti/&gt;&lt;ref name=PB/&gt; able to move fluently between gendered identities as well as on and over the earth.&lt;ref name=Nava/&gt; These themes mirror a wave of [[gender identity]] exploration then occurring in Italian culture: for example, [[Francesca Bertini]] had recently played a male protagonist in ''[[Pierrot the Prodigal]]'', women's fashions at Futurist parties had begun to imitate styles for men, and a trickle of short action films with autonomous heroines had begun to appear. In real life, [[women's rights]] were highly limited in Italy, where married women were required to seek their husbands' permission to divorce, inherit property, or take out newspaper subscriptions, a situation dramatized in the popular ''diva'' films of the day.&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt;

''Filibus'' went further than its contemporaries not only in its title character's total independence and completely male-coded outfits, but also in its overarching critique of appearances. The American writer Monica Nolan notes that, with its multiple disguises, stealthy adventures, and psychological subterfuges, the film blurs the line between illusion and reality—so thoroughly, indeed, that "it's anybody's guess whether [Filibus's] flirtation [with Leonora] is opportunistic, genuine, or a combination of the two."&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt;

== Release and reception ==
[[File:Filibus question mark poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Filibus on a contemporary poster]]
''Filibus'' was reviewed by the censorship department of the [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Italian Ministry of the Interior]] on 25 March 1915, and was first screened in Rome on 14 April of that year.&lt;ref name=Lotti/&gt; Early Italian reviews of the film were unfavorable; Monsù Travet, in the journal ''Film'', criticized ''Filibus'' for borrowing the plot point of the glove from ''Fantômas'', while G. Murè in ''L'Alba Cinematografica'' mocked the film's special effects, which he found childish.&lt;ref name=Lotti/&gt; Early critics also reacted poorly to the plot as a whole, which they described as disjointed.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;

The film's conclusion suggests the possibility of a sequel, but Italy declared war on [[Austro-Hungary]] shortly after the film's release, taking a dramatic toll on the country's film industry and possibly leading to the disbanding of Corona Film in 1918.&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt; A print of ''Filibus'' survives at the [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; A print is also held at the [[National Museum of Cinema]] in Turin.&lt;ref name=Lotti/&gt;

The [[Cineteca di Bologna]] screened ''Filibus'' in 1997 as part of the [[Il Cinema Ritrovato|Cinema Ritrovato]] festival, with its program calling the film "an odd and funny forerunner of science-fiction movies."&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; When the Dortmund Cologne International Women's Film Festival screened the film in 2013, its program described Filibus as "probably one of the first lesbian characters in the history of film."&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{citation|title=Filibus|work=frauenfilmfestival.eu|publisher=Dortmund Cologne International Women's Film Festival|year=2013|url=https://www.frauenfilmfestival.eu/index.php?id=1677&amp;L=1&amp;id=1677|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film festival program for the [[Yugoslav Film Archive]], where ''Filibus'' was shown in 2015, also commented on its pioneering exploration of lesbianism in film, nominating Filibus as cinema's first lesbian "[[strong female character|bad girl]]".&lt;ref name=YFA/&gt; In 2017, an EYE Film Institute restoration of the film was shown at the [[San Francisco Silent Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; with a score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. In her program notes, Monica Nolan calls the film's protagonist "one of a kind," adding: "The special effects are endearingly low-budget, but who cares, when the action is fast-paced and just plain fun?"&lt;ref name=Nolan&gt;{{citation|first=Monica|last=Nolan|title=Filibus|work=Archive|publisher=[[San Francisco Silent Film Festival]]|year=2017|url=http://silentfilm.org/archive/filibus|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 review of the film, Claude Rieffel praised the film's "elegant and elusive woman pirate" (''élégante et insaisissable femme pirate''), saying that Filibus's ability to pass between male and female identities made the character "a champion of [[transgender]]ism before that term had been coined" (''championne avant l'heure du trans-genre'').&lt;ref name = Rieffel&gt;{{citation|title = Filibus - La critique|language = French|url = http://www.avoir-alire.com/filibus-la-critique,25837|first = Claude|last = Rieffel|date = 3 February 2014|accessdate = 7 December 2016|website = avoir-alire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performing arts writer Imogen Sara Smith, in an essay for ''[[Film Comment]]'' on the 2017 San Francisco festival, noted that the film "zips along with crisp, deliciously absurd plotting and an effervescent lightness of touch," highlighting Ruspoli's "gracefully androgynous and slyly gleeful" performance as well as the plot's feminist themes. According to Smith, "In a summer when ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' was hailed in some quarters as a milestone for women in cinema, the audience watching ''Filibus'' (1915) at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival could be forgiven for wondering sardonically if movies are finally catching up to where they were a century ago."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Imogen Sara|title=Festivals: The San Francisco Silent Film Festival|journal=[[Film Comment]]|date=10 July 2017|url=https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/festivals-san-francisco-silent-film-festival/|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiographical work ''Balão cativo'' (1973), the Brazilian writer [[Pedro Nava (writer)|Pedro Nava]] describes ''Filibus'' as a film "of major importance" (''da maior importância''), praising the [[genderfluidity]] and mythic aspects of the title character, as well as the film's innovative use of [[science fiction]] themes.&lt;ref name=Nava&gt;{{citation|last=Nava|first=Pedro|title=Balão cativo|location=Cranja Viana, Cotia|publisher=Ateliê|year=2000|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84jSgiit7IMC&amp;pg=PA182|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geguti.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the royal palace of Geguti]] 

'''Geguti''' ({{lang-ka|გეგუთი}}) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] medieval royal palace, now in ruins, at the homonymous village, 7 km south of the city of [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 

The ruins of the Geguti palace complex occupy the area of over 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; along the [[Rioni River]]. An extensive fieldwork between 1953 and 1956 allowed the specialists to stratify the principal archaeological layers and reconstruct the architectural form and decoration of the medieval edifices bulk of which dates to the 12th century, the period when the first written mention of Geguti appears in the Georgian Chronicle. The earliest structure – a plain, one-room building with a large fireplace – dates back to the 8th/9th century. A principal part of the royal complex, commissioned by King [[George III of Georgia]] (r. 1156-1184), is a four-tier brick edifice built onto a three-metre high stone plinth, with its spacious, cruciform central hall surmounted by a dome 14 m in diameter resting on squinches. The entire building is walled and fortified with massive pillars. Westerly located additional structures and a palace church are of a later period, dating to the 13th/14th century. 

The importance of the ruins of the Geguti palace is emphasized by its largely secular nature as most of the surviving monuments of medieval Georgian architecture are churches and monasteries. Records of medieval secular patronage (basically palaces with extensive decorative cycles) exist in the Georgian written sources, although only the shells of castles and the ruins of Geguti survive to testify the extent of the work produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner (ed., 1996). ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art|The Dictionary of Art]]'', p. 331. Grove, {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Geguti reconstruction.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Reconstruction sketch by V. Tsintsadze]]
The main complex of the Geguti royal palace was constructed during what is considered to be medieval Georgia's "[[golden age]]". Although the Georgian court was quite mobile, the establishment of a royal palace of this scale near the kingdom’s second capital and a major cultural center can be understood as the desire to establish a more settled, regal court, and royal bureaucracy which, indeed, reached its climax under the [[queen regnant]] [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] (r. 1184-1213).&lt;ref name="Eastmond"&gt;Antony Eastmond (1998), ''Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia'', pp. 152, 188-190. Penn State Press, {{ISBN|0-271-01628-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geguti palace frequently features in the Georgian annals as a beloved place of rest of the Georgian royalty. In the reign of Tamar, it was the place where her former husband, Prince [[Yuri Bogolyubsky]], was crowned by the rebellious nobles during an abortive coup against the queen in 1191.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"/&gt;

In 2016, a glass panel installation was erected, surrounding the ruins, to show visitors the complete original shape of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology shows historic Geguti Palace 800 years ago|url=http://agenda.ge/news/53983/eng|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Agenda.ge|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glasgow Women's Library''' is a [[public library]], registered company and charity based in the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] area of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. It provides information relevant to women's history, culture and achievements, and tries to operate on [[feminist]] principles. It supplies or encourages training and education, skill-sharing via volunteers and/or staff.

==History==
The Women's Library was established in 1991.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/about-us/our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Glasgow Women's Library |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved from the 'Women in Profile' project, whose aim was to ensure the visibility of women in the programming of Glasgow, [[European City of Culture]] year. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/glasgow-womens-library-feminism-museum-womens-history-uk-cookery-books-spare-rib-anti-suffragette|title=Glasgow Women’s Library: a treasure trove that shows how far feminism has come|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=2016-09-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 the number of paid staff had reached 22, along with 100 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/glasgow-womens-library-feminism-museum-womens-history-uk-cookery-books-spare-rib-anti-suffragette|title=Glasgow Women’s Library: a treasure trove that shows how far feminism has come|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=2016-09-19|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 the library moved to the [[Mitchell Library]] in the West End,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Women’s Library is flitting {{!}} Glasgow Women's Library|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/2010/08/10/flitting/|website=womenslibrary.org.uk|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a decision taken in 2012 to move to more suitable premises in Landressy Street in Bridgeton.  This move was completed in November 2015, after two years of renovation work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativescotland.com/explore/read/stories/features/2016/glasgow-womens-library-truly-a-national-treasure|title=Glasgow Women's Library: Truly a national treasure {{!}} Creative Scotland|website=www.creativescotland.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/09/collective-architecture-glasgow-womens-library-steel-lift-extension-renovation-scotland/|title=Collective Architecture completes Glasgow Women's Library|date=2016-04-09|work=Dezeen|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new library was officially opened on 7 November 2015 by [[Nicola Sturgeon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, and in celebration of their 21st birthday in 2012, the library launched the ''21 Revolutions'' project, commissioning a group of 21 artists and 21 writers, including [[Janice Galloway]] and [[Denise Mina]], to make work inspired by their collection.  The work was published in a book of the same name. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015 the library nominated [[The Suffragette Oak]], a tree in Kelvingrove Park, for the Woodland Trust Scottish Tree of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2015/10/suffragette-oak/|title=Suffragette Oak is Scotland's Tree of the Year|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oak tree went on to win the award and was then a nominee in the 2016 European Tree of the Year awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/2016/02/01/vote-for-the-suffragette-oak-to-be-european-tree-of-the-year-2016/|title=Vote for the Suffragette Oak to be European Tree of the Year 2016 – Glasgow Women's Library|website=womenslibrary.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Big Rachel of Glasgow.jpg|thumb|"[[Rachel Hamilton|Big Rachel]]" was a special constable in 1875]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8552">[[File:Portrait bust of Horace Brodzky by Gaudier-Brzeska, 1913 (Tate Gallery).jpg|thumb|Portrait bust of Horace Brodzky by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, 1913 (Tate Gallery)]]'''Horace Ascher Brodzky''' (30 January 1885 – 11 February 1969) was an Australian-born artist and writer most of whose work was created in London and New York. His work included paintings, drawings and [[linocut]]s, of which he was an early pioneer. An associate in his early career of many leading artists working in Britain of his period, including [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], and members of the [[Vorticism]] movement, he ended his life relatively neglected.

==Early life==
Brodzky was born in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], [[Melbourne]] in 1885 to the Australian journalist Maurice Brodzky (a [[Jew]]ish immigrant to Australia from Poland), and his wife Flora, née Leon.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"&gt;Lambirth (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he assisted his father in the production of the magazine ''Table Talk''.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;Cannon (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodzky studied initially at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery School]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; In 1904 his father was bankrupted after exposing corruption, and Horace moved with his family to San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==London==
In 1908, Brodzky went to London where he studied during 1911 at the [[City and Guilds of London Art School|City and Guilds South London Technical Art School]]. He became an acquaintance and follower of [[Walter Sickert]]. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a [[portrait bust]] of Brodzky (now in the [[Tate Gallery]], London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/search?q=Brodzky "Brodzky"], ''Tate Gallery'' website, accessed 29 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky is said to have been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the [[King's Road]], that he missed the last bus to [[Herne Hill]] where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Virginia|title=Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900-1939|date=2003|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=0141933402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet  [[John Gould Fletcher]]  and this led to his first London exhibition, "Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes" (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;  He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and [[David Bomberg]], in the [[Whitechapel Gallery]]. Brodzky became a member of [[The London Group]].&lt;ref name="lag"&gt;[http://www.londonartsgroup.com/Artist-Info.cfm?ArtistsID=355&amp;Collection=&amp;info=CV "Horace Brodzky"], London Arts Group website accessed 2 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have "excelled". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"&gt;Weindling (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works of this period are portraits of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Jacob Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==New York==
In 1915 Brodzky moved to New York, with an introduction to the art patron [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; There he worked as a poster artist and an arts journalist,&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; and in 1917 helped Quinn organize a New York exhibition of Vorticist artists. In 1919 he married Bertha Greenfield; they were to have three sons.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1920 [[Egmont Arens]] published in New York a collection of 21 of Brodzky's linoprints. Brodzky also designed [[book jacket]]s for writers including [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]],&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; and painted a portrait of O'Neill.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==Back to England==
Returning to London in 1923 he became a professional artist. His work featured in the first-ever exhibition of linocuts, organized by [[Claude Flight]] at the [[Redfern Gallery]] in  1929.&lt;ref name="Anon2"&gt;Anon 2 (n.d)&lt;/ref&gt; Initial success however withered in the 1930s, when his marriage broke up, and from then on he lived in financial straits. In 1935 [[James Laver]] published a study  ''Forty Drawings by Horace Brodzky''. Laver described Brodzky's drawing technique as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Brodzky prefers the ordinary 'dip-in' steel nib, for this enables the hand, by varying its pressure on the paper, to broaden the line at will, or rather in obedience to the obscure subconscious or half-conscious promptings which guide the hand to its task. He makes no preliminary studies, draws no pencil outline, carefully rubbed out afterwards to give a false impression of spontaneity. There are no erasures or alterations. Each drawing is made 'au premier coup'. It is made very quickly, as a unity, and when finished the artist cannot remember at what point it was started. The drawing has been thrown on the paper, as it were, with a single gesture.&lt;ref name="lag"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1946 Brodzky published his own study of the French-Romanian-Jewish artist [[Pascin|Jules Pascin]]. In London he lived for most of the rest of his life in the [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] and [[Willesden]] areas, continuing to produce paintings, drawings and linocuts. He supported himself by teaching and painting stage-decor and from 1948 to 1962 he was art-editor of the ''Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide'', (founded by his brother Adrian).&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==Final years==
In 1963, Brodzky wrote to the collector [[Ruth Borchard]], who had just purchased from him a self-portrait for the sum of 12 guineas (₤12.60):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since 1911 I have been connected with the London art world &amp; have exhibited at all important exhibitions…and have worked for modern art... For a long time I have sold none of my work &amp; have had to rely on selling items by other artists that I have collected…This letter is not an angry complaint but just the plain facts that I thought you might like to know.&lt;ref&gt;Anon 1 (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 80th anniversary exhibitions were organized for Brodzky at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] and the [[Oxford Union]] Cellars.&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt; In 1967 some of his early linocuts were reissued in London in a signed edition of 60 prints. Brodzky died in Kilburn in 1969, when his estate was valued for [[probate]] at £7977.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; Exhibitions of Brodzky's work were held in the [[Jewish Museum of Australia]] (1988) and at the Boundary Gallery, London (1989).&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt;

'''''In the Land of Pain''''' is a collection of notes by [[Alphonse Daudet]] chronicling the pain and suffering he experienced from [[tabes dorsalis]], its effects on his relationships with friends, family, and other people, and the various drugs he took and physical treatments he underwent in his fight against the disease. Daudet originally began making these notes for a projected book, but none of the material was published in his lifetime. He planned to use the title ''La Doulou'', a [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] word for pain. The collection was published in French in 1930 in a volume titled ''La Doulou (La Douleur): 1887–1895 et Le Trésor d'Arlatan: 1897'', and translated into English in 2002 by [[Julian Barnes]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s02X_Gm90ncC&amp;dq=in+the+land+of+pain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAn4UpX9AsT_oQTW2YCACA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA | title=''Introduction to'' In the Land of Pain | publisher=Knopf | author=Barnes, Julian | year=2002 | location=New York | pages=V-XV | isbn=0-375-41485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bouloumié |editor1-first=Arlette |title=Écriture et maladie: "du bon usage des maladies" |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bdlkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;dq=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=77v4UsnaA6iw7Qbni4CwBQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |location=Paris |publisher=Imago |publication-date=2003 |page=117 |isbn=2911416767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
Daudet records observations, experiences, and aphorisms related to his intense suffering over the course of many years. He describes his symptoms in graphic detail and charts their progression. This begins with isolated attacks of agonising nerve pain, and eventually becomes a daily litany of pain and use of drugs like opium and [[chloral hydrate]] to fight it. He comments on the effect of his illness on family and friends, and on his outlook on life.

He describes the different physical treatments he underwent, including being suspended in the air, diets, and a variety of injections. He also details his observations of fellow sufferers of the disease and his interactions with them. In his later years, he frequently spent time at sanitariums, becoming a celebrity among the other patients. He describes his time at these sanitariums in detail. Daudet stopped making these notes a few years before his death.

==Critical response==
Daudet originally planned to use his notes on his sufferings to make either a novel or an autobiography. After discussing the projected work with fellow writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]], Goncourt predicted the work would be superb because Daudet would be writing from intense personal experience. Although the book was never realized, translator Julian Barnes agrees with Goncourt's prediction in relation to the collection in its current form. He believes the notes format is appropriate and fitting for the subject because of its implication of passing time and its absence of disguise.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

According to critic Richard Eder, this work is worthy of lasting recognition. Daudet uses wit to probe a dark and distressing subject, providing the reader with powerful images. Daudet surprisingly responds to his pain often with humor and spirit, and even comments mockingly on his disease and its symptoms at times. Some of the most poignant moments in the book are Daudet's expressions of sympathy for his fellow sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/books/another-country.html | title=Another Country | publisher=New York Times | date=2 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Eder, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Insignificance'''''  is a 1985 British [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], produced by [[Jeremy Thomas]] and [[Alexander Stuart (The War Zone)|Alexander Stuart]], and adapted by [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]] from his play of the same name. The film is set in 1954, with most of the action taking place in a hotel room in New York City. The action revolves around the interplay of four characters who represent iconic figures of the era - [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Joseph McCarthy]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Albert Einstein]] - called The Actress, The Senator, The Ballplayer, and The Professor, respectively.

==Plot==
The film opens on a crowded New York City street where people have gathered to watch a film crew shoot a sequence which becomes recognisable as the iconic shot of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress standing on a grate while the rush of wind caused by a huge fan to imitate the subway going by below blows her skirt up around her waist. The Actress' husband, The Ballplayer, watches with obvious discomfort as she is ogled. The Actress, rather than join him afterwards, disappears in a taxi, leaving him behind. She stops at a store and picks up a variety of toys, flashlights, and balloons.

The Professor, recognisable as Albert Einstein, is in his hotel room, working on pages of mathematical calculations. He is interrupted by The Senator, who has come to alternately coax and threaten him into appearing before a committee to investigate his activities and answer the famous question, "Are you now or have you ever been...?" The Senator is recognisable as Joe McCarthy. The Professor refuses and says he will never appear. The Senator leaves, saying he'll be back to get him at 8 a.m. the following morning.

The Actress appears at the door of the Professor's hotel room, and he invites her in. They talk about fame, being chased, and the stars. She does a lively demonstration of the Theory of Relativity using the toys and flashlights and balloons. She tells The Professor he is at the top of her list of people she'd like to sleep with. They decide to go to bed, but are interrupted by the arrival of The Ballplayer, who has tracked her to the hotel. The Professor leaves them alone and goes to find another room, meeting a Cherokee elevator man with whom he speaks. The Actress and The Ballplayer talk about their marriage; The Actress tells her husband she believes she is pregnant, but he has fallen asleep.

The following morning The Senator arrives at The Professor's room to find him gone, but The Actress naked and alone in his bed. The Senator mistakes her for a call girl and threatens to use her to expose and embarrass The Professor, then punches her hard in the abdomen, causing her to collapse in pain. The Professor returns while The Senator is collecting all of the hundreds of pages of The Professor's work to take away with him. The Professor grabs the papers and throws them out of the windows, while The Actress writhes in agony on the bed. The Senator leaves, defeated in his purpose. The Ballplayer returns and talks about his fame in the baseball world, and confides in him about his marital problems while The Actress is in the bathroom, possibly suffering a miscarriage. She finally announces to him that their marriage is over, and he leaves.

The Actress becomes impatient with The Professor, sensing that he is hiding something. He is sitting on the bed with his watch, which has stopped at 8.15, in one hand, and the alarm clock in the other as the hour approaches 8.15 (the time that "[[Little Boy]]" was dropped on [[Hiroshima]]). He confesses his terrible feelings of guilt about the event, and she reassures him. Right at 8.15 a.m. as she is leaving, he has a vision of the destruction of the room, Hiroshima, and the world. The Actress's skirt swirls in flames as she burns in his vision. Then the film reverses and the world is restored to order as she smiles and leaves.&lt;ref name="La times Insignificance"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Second Look: 'Insignificance'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/entertainment/la-ca-second-look-20110626|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=8 August 2013|author=Dennis Lim|date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Insignificance'' was originally a play, written by Terry Johnson and performed at the Royal Court in 1982, with [[Judy Davis]] as The Actress. The seed for Johnson's play was his having read that an autographed photograph of Einstein was found amongst Marilyn Monroe's possessions upon her death. The idea of them meeting piqued his interest, and he wrote what became a meditation on the nature of fame.&lt;ref&gt;Sinyard, Neil; ''The Films of Nicolas Roeg''; 1991 Charles Letts &amp; Co.; pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; "It was always meant to be a play about the era, about fame...what these people stood for, the fact that this was different from what they are." He was interested in exploring the differences between who these people really were, as opposed to what qualities others assumed or imbued them with. Johnson acknowledges that there are "lots of little cheats" in the play, mostly to do with exactly where and when ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' was filmed, and the timing of Marilyn's marriage to Joe DiMaggio. Einstein was also never called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], "but," he said, "had it gone on longer, I can see that as having been a big possibility. He was there in spirit, as it were."&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"&gt;Monthly Film Bulletin; "Relatively Speaking"; August 1985; p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Roeg saw the play and felt it "might be a tool to use. An incident came up in my own life and I thought, 'Good God, nobody knows a damn thing about anyone.' That was the premise that started me thinking about the piece again." Roeg notes that ''Insignificance'' is usually talked about as a meeting between Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein, but what moved him was the pain of the problems between The Actress and The Ballplayer, who are married but seem to know nothing about each other.&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"/&gt; ''Insignificance'' would become his first film adapted from a play.

Roeg asked Johnson to work on the screenplay, which at first meant simply reducing the play to approximately 90 minutes as opposed to two hours, but then Roeg began making suggestions which would expand the screenplay and include flashbacks to the characters' histories, and flash-forwards of imagination. His suggestions inspired Johnson to focus on a deeper development of the characters, while Roeg himself began to imagine how the film could open the play spatially as well as laterally.&lt;ref&gt;Sinyard, Neil; ''The Films of Nicolas Roeg''; 1991 Charles Letts &amp; Co.; pp. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  "He opened it backwards," Johnson said.&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"/&gt;

==Production==
All of the interiors for ''Insignificance'' were shot at Lee Studios in Wembley, with exteriors shot in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089343/combined IMDB Locations Notes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mise-en-scène]] was created through the use of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s post-cubism painting "Woman and Child on the Seashore" which underscores The Actress' pain about her childlessness,&lt;ref&gt;Criterion Collection Interview with Nicolas Roeg and Terry Johnson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the fractured structure of the narrative was mirrored in the splintered image of Theresa Russell used as a nude calendar shot of The Actress. Created by photographer-collagist [[David Hockney]], the image is, according to film critic Chuck Stephens, "a pinup in a hundred pieces, a centerfold sent through a centrifuge..." and is a reflection of The Actress. With "her much-exposed and famously exploited psyche already splintered into jagged, mingled shards of kittenish innocence, movie business cunning, overwhelming erotic appeal, and abject inner terror, Monroe was post-cubism's quintessential glittering star...perfectly pieced together and seen prismatically all at once..."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Essay in Criterion Collection DVD/Blu-ray release, August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The image is also a metaphor for Roeg's non-linear filmmaking, Stephens notes that "for a cine-cubist like Roeg, two entirely disparate spatial and temporal dimensions are never more than a splice apart, and in ''Insignificance'', the past is always present, and never goes away."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Insignificance'' received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release, and currently has a 67% score at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insignificance/ Rotten Tomatoes Score&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been written about extensively in the years since it was first seen. [[Film4]]'s movie critic wrote: "Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson's stage play to the screen. Throughout, tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards (ka-boom!) draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing — but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time; each moment co-existing. As evinced by his back catalogue, it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of [[synchronicity]] – see ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' in particular. Here, 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s, a period in which another 'Actor' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States."

Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat write: "''Insignificance'' shines with some incandescent moments of acting bravado delivered by Theresa Russell, Tony Curtis, and Gary Busey. As a weird meditation on sex, power, knowledge, and fame, this is a four-star treat for those who savor exotic movie fare...Nicolas Roeg (''Don't Look Now'', ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'') draws out the inner psychological nuances of the drama and delivers the philosophical freight in Terry Johnson's screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=8918 Brussat review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The film was entered into the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]] where it was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] and won the Technical Grand Prize.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/944/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Insignificance |accessdate=28 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the film was released on the British label [[ZTT Records]]. It featured a diverse selection of professional artists and composers including movie composer [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Glenn Gregory]], [[Claudia Brücken]], [[Stanley Myers]], [[Midge Ure]] (occasional guitar), [[Roy Orbison]]. In addition, [[Gil Evans]] and his orchestra contributed with an interpretation of Mozart's ''[[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter Symphony]]'', and  "America" by Death Comet Crew was also included.

==In popular culture==
The title of the film was used by musician [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] for his album ''[[Insignificance (Jim O'Rourke album)|Insignificance]]''.

The film is also featured in [[Big Audio Dynamite]]'s music video for "E=MC2" as clips are shown throughout the video and are also referenced throughout the song.

==Home media==
''Insignificance'' was released on VHS in 1985, on Laserdisc a few years later, and on DVD in 2003. In June 2011, the [[Criterion Collection]] released a fully restored and re-mastered DVD and Blu-ray edition, containing interviews with Nicolas Roeg, Terry Johnson, long-time Roeg editor Tony Lawson, and the short film, "Making 'Insignificance'". The release also contains a booklet with excerpts from the August 1985 Roeg-Johnson interview called "Relatively Speaking" in the 1985 Monthly Film Bulletin, and an essay by film critic Chuck Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insignificance|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/27618-insignificance|publisher=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jag vill leva i Europa''' is a song written by [[Jan Hammarlund]], recorded by him on the 1982 album ''[[Järnvägsräls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001888587 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arja Saijonmaa]] recorded the song on her 1987 album ''[[Högt över havet (album)|Högt över havet]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001891207 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]&lt;/ref&gt; and her recording charted at [[Svensktoppen]] for 14 weeks between 17 May-1 November 1987, peaking at second position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/files/2023/3483.txt Svensktoppen - ''1987'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 it was also recorded by Jan Hammarlund in French, as "Je veux vivre en Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001486216 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Lindholm]] also recorded the song in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001891301 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euskefeurat]] has also recorded the song, with other lyrics, called "Jag vill städa i Europa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadebra.nu/euske/Texter/Sista%20farden/Stada%20i%20europa.html Euskefeurats officiella hemsida]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The song lyrics, dealing with the universal message of peace, describe four tourists from [[Sweden]] travelling by car across various [[state (polity)|states]] in [[Europe]].

===Version 1===
[[File:Cold war europe military map sv.png|thumb|The original 1982 version's lyrics are inspired by the [[Cold War]].]]
When the original version came out in 1982, the world was living in the shadows of the  [[Cold War]]. A threatening [[nuclear weapon]] war was the main theme.

===Version 2===
[[File:Former Yugoslavia 2006.png|thumb|In the 1990s, lyrics where changed to better fit into that era, with ethnical conflicts and streams of refugees.]]
A 1991 Jan Hammarlund version was changed, to better fit in the era, with a Europe where several [[communism|communist governments]] had been overthrown. At the time, shatterings and [[civil war]]'s between ethnical groups and religions affected Europe.. [[Refugee]] streams became a main theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6024">"'''Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical'''" is an essay by [[John Rawls]], published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, "Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical," ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 14 (Summer 1985): 223–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he describes his conception of [[justice]]. It comprises two main principles of [[liberty]] and [[:wikt:equality|equality]]; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle.

Rawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—'Justice as Fairness'—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the "least advantaged" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.

Rawls presented the theory in the famous ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', subsequently revising it in ''[[Political Liberalism]]''.

==First principle: the liberty principle==
The first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming "that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:45&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Freeman argues, Rawls believes that "personal property" – personal belongings, a home – constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:50&lt;/ref&gt; As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman 2007:51&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within "fair" conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Follesdal|first1=ed. by Andreas|last2=Pogge|first2=Thomas|last3=Mertens|first3=Thomas|title=Real world justice : grounds, principles, human rights, and social institutions|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402031410|page=86|url=http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', stating instead that "each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Rawls 2005:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second principle: the equality principle==
The Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing [[distributive justice]]. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions.

===Fair equality of opportunity===
This principle maintains that "offices and positions"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:86&lt;/ref&gt; should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the ''right'' to opportunities, but should have an ''effective'' equal chance as another of similar natural ability.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, 2008: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/#2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference principle===
The Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as [[trickle-down economics]]; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth "diffuses up".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:291–92 &amp; 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).

Rawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from [[Pareto optimal]] scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.

==Original position==
{{main|Original position}}
A key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the [[original position]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2009: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[thought experiment]] in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially,  their conception of The Good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">In [[US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[filmmaking]], the '''key grip''' supervises all [[Grip (job)|grip]] (lighting and rigging) crews and reports to the [[director of photography]].&lt;ref name=Goodell&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodell|first=Gregory|title=Independent Feature Film Production: A Complete Guide from Concept Through Distribution|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0312304625|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
Before filming begins, the key grip attends location scouts and meets the director of photography to determine what additional tools (location-specific motor vehicles, dollies, cranes, mounts, etc.) will be needed, orders and prepares required equipment, and transports equipment to the filming location.&lt;ref name=Uva /&gt; Once on set, the key grip coordinates with the electric and camera departments alongside the director of photography to control lighting and camera movement and setup.&lt;ref name=Dzyaz&gt;{{cite book|last=Dzyak|first=Brian|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0307875164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a supervisor, the key grip directs the crew of grips, many with specialized skills such as dolly grips, crane operators, or special equipment operators.&lt;ref name=Uva&gt;{{cite book|last=Uva|first=Michael G.|title=Uva's Basic Grip Book|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=0240804856|pages=5–6|author2=Uva, Michael |author3=Uva, Sabrina }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key grip is sometimes credited as the "first company grip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honthaner|first=Eve Light|title=The Complete Film Production Handbook|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=024081150X|pages=471|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==

The key grip is frequently asked to be the safety monitor of the film set. Changes in the film and television worlds have created lasting change in crew responsibilities. Any union production crews working under the "Hollywood" umbrella are required to take [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]-style certified courses in safety. The first AD (first [[assistant director]]) is responsible for the safe operation of the set. The key grip no longer has that distinction in newer Hollywood policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/filmall.txt uic.edu, LIGHTS! CAMERA! SAFETY!, A Health and Safety Manual for Motion Picture and Television Production, by Michael McCann, Ph.D., C.I.H.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
In [[Great Britain]] the "grips" are part of the camera department exclusively and are not generally responsible for regular grip duties as they are in the United States.&lt;ref name=Skills&gt;{{cite web|last=Creative Industries' Sector Skills Council|title=Grip|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/jobs/camera/article_4784_1.asp|work=Creative Skillset|publisher=Creative Industries' Sector Skills Council|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] the key grip generally owns the grip equipment, often consisting of dollies, track, cranes, camera cars, and insert trailers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The '''lion head horn''' is an undecorated silver horn that has a flaring rim and tapers down to the tip. It curves at an obtuse angle, and its lower extremity is inserted into the back of the gold lion head, and fixed with four gold rivets. The vase is not properly a [[rhyton]], since no secondary orifice is present. A hole on the upper left [[Canine tooth|canine]] of the lion is very small for effective pouring: it seems accidental. The ferocious animal is shown with open mouth, prominent canines and protruding tongue, in a grimace shared by animals and monsters of the [[Archaic Greek]] art. The wrinkled skin on both sides of the muzzle with its triangular nostrils are rendered as continuous lines and dots. Similar dots run along the upper half of the mouth contour, while the lower half shows a chased pattern of minuscule ovals. Punched circles and hatching appear in the mouth's interior. The eyes are almond-shaped, and two low, circular protuberances on the forehead are covered with hatching. The semicircular ears have three radial lines in their interior. The mane is rendered as a plastic collar of triangular section. Its front and back sides are covered with finely chiseled, stylized hair locks.

==Origin==
Among the various types of rhyta and horns, the one with an animal head termination on a long horn seems the least popular in the Near and Middle Eastern cultural domains. The horns are usually provided with an animal forepart, while the simple heads of rather large dimensions are typically combined with a straight or flaring calyx-like neck.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Manassero, who collected the evidence in all materials and reviewed the earlier literature, counts four metal exemplars of the Archaic period, of which only two are made of silver, or silver and gold, both with a lion head finial.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The type enjoys a revival in Scythia during the Classical period, often with animal heads of precious metal mounted on real horns; it continues in a pipe-like version well into the Hellenistic times.

&lt;br&gt;
The bronze lion heads are large, strongly stylized, with an almost flat muzzle; they have little in common with the VBC gold head. They probably come from Luristan and are undeniably much earlier than our exemplar. 
&lt;ref&gt;Probably 8th Century BC&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several silver exemplars entered the art market, and later some of them even museum collections, ([[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum]], [[Miho Museum]]) without any documentation, since they come from illicit digging, reportedly "from a cave cache", which became known as the "Western Cave", in Kal-e Makarekh (or Kalmakarra), western Iran.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The silver rhyta have their lion head finials made of gold and soldered onto the silver horn. All horns are undecorated with very slight tapering towards the finial. All lion heads are quite large (up to three times as big as the VBC exemplar), and show the same stylistic features, chiselled details, and rings on the point of their junction with the horn. None of them is a rhyton stricto sensu, since they are not supplied with a secondary orifice. Consequently, they are supposed to have being made in the same pre-Achaemenid western Iranian workshop, possibly in the second half of the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Although their authenticity is not questioned by Ebbinghaus 1998, or nor by Manassero 2008 (p. 44, nt. 56), who on the contrary wonders whether a piece believed a fake by Muscarella 2000(p.427) should be reconsidered. They are further confirmed as authentic by other experts (Doole 2004, p. 12), but  the absence of excavated compranda renders their dating rather a working hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is a portmanteau of '''faux''', the French word for false or fake, and 'mohawk'.

Each strand of this hair type grows in a tiny spring-like, corkscrew shape (though there are different textures and degrees of waviness, curliness, and kinkiness across the entire population).

==Career==
===Comedy===
Carr has used a [[wheelchair]] since the age of seven due to [[arthrogryposis multiplex congenita]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok.co.uk/tv/985756/saturday-kitchen-silent-witness-star-liz-carr-show-regular-clarissa-mullery-spoiler-emilia-fox "Silent Witness Star Liz Carr". OK Magazine. Olivia Wheeler. 21 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently refers to her condition in her stand-up as "meus thronus kaputus". She is frank about her life as a disabled person and the inherent comedy that brings – "I've had some tuts, which is fantastic... I look quite frail to some people, so it's like, 'She's talking about sex, she's swearing.' Every stereotype you didn't expect. People generally look terrified. 'Oh my God, is she going to be funny? Can we laugh at this?'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary O'Hara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/disability.socialcare |title=Interview: Liz Carr |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2006 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been part of a number of comedy groups, including Abnormally Funny People with [[Tanyalee Davis]], [[Steve Day]], Steve Best, Simon Minty, and [[Chris McCausland]].

In 2007 she was runner up in the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition.&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt;

===Acting===
Carr was in her thirties when she took on her first professional acting role playing [[Mother Courage]] before heading to the [[Young Vic]] with another [[Bertolt Brecht]] play, [[The Exception and the Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5kV9TqcRDr6jFhCy97LMSnj/clarissa-mullery BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she joined the long-running [[BBC]] crime thriller series ''[[Silent Witness]]'' as regular character Clarissa Mullery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p012ychn |title=Liz Carr introduces her new character, ''Silent Witness'' |publisher=[[BBC One]] |date=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/10/first_look_liz_carr_as_clariss.html |title=First look: Liz Carr as Clarissa Mullery in ''Silent Witness'' |work=The Ouch!

In May 2008 she joined with [[ADAPT]], a prominent disability rights group in the United States, to raise money for ADAPT and to protest against presidential candidate [[John McCain]]'s refusal to support the right of people with disabilities to live in their own homes.

In 2011, Carr was part of a ''[[Newsnight]]'' debate on [[assisted suicide]], following the screening on the BBC of ''[[Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die]]'', which included [[Jeremy Paxman]] and [[David Aaronovitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |id=1975600 |title=Choosing to Die: ''Newsnight'' Debate |date=1 January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She opposes [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Faulkner]]'s [[Assisted Dying Bill]], stating: "I fear we’ve so devalued certain groups of people – ill people, disabled people, older people – that I don’t think it’s in their best interests to enshrine in law the right of doctors to kill certain people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liz Carr, Not so ''Silent Witness'' |work=Standard Issue |url=http://standardissuemagazine.com/voices/liz-carr-interview/ |date=3 December 2014 |author=Hannah Dunleavy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis XVI style''', also called '''''Louis Seize''''', is a style of architecture, furniture, decoration and art which developed in France during the 19-year reign of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (1774–1793), just before the [[French Revolution]].   It saw the final phase of the [[baroque]] style as well as the birth of French [[neoclassicism]]. The style was a reaction against the elaborate ornament of the preceding [[baroque]] period. It was inspired in part by the discoveries  of ancient Roman paintings, sculpture and architecture in [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]].  Its features  included the straight column, the simplicity of the [[post-and-lintel]], the [[architrave]] of the Greek temple.  It also expressed the [[Rousseau]]-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/art/Louis-XVI-style| publisher=Encyclopedia Britanica|title=Louis XVI style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable architects of the period included [[Victor Louis]] (1731-1811) who completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780), The Odeon Theater in Paris (1779-1782) was built by [[Marie-Joseph Peyre]] (1730-1785) and [[Charles de Wailly]] (1729-1798). [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] completed the [[Chateau de Bagatelle]] in just sixty-three days to win a bet for its builder, the King's brother. Another period landmark was the belvedere of the Petit Trianon, built by Rchard Mique.  The most characteristic building of the late Louis XVI residential style is the Hôtel de Salm in Paris (Now the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur, built by [[Pierre Rousseau]] in 1751-83.

Superbly crafted desks and cabinets were created for the Palace of Versailles and other royal residences by cabinetmakers [[Jean-Henri Riesener]] and [[David Roentgen]], using inlays of fine woods, particularly [[mahogany]], decorated with gilded bronze and [[mother of pearl]].   Equally fine sets of chairs and tables were made by [[Jean-Henri Riesener]] and [[Georges Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Louis XVI style| url=http://www.marcmaison.com/architectural-antiques-resources/louis_xvi_style| publisher=Marc Maison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal tapestry works of [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]], [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] and [[Beauvais Tapestry]] continued to make large tapestries, but an increasing part of their business was the manufacture of upholstery for the new sets of chairs, sofas and other furnishings for the royal residences and nobility.  [[Wallpaper]] also became an important part of interior design, thanks to new processes developed by Reveillon.

==Origins and influences==
The Lous XVI style was a reaction to and transition the [[French Baroque]] style, which had dominated French architecture, decoration and art since the mid-17th century, and partly from a desire to establish a new ''Beau idéal'', or ideal of beauty, based on the purity and grandeur of the art of the Ancient Romans and Greeks.  In 1754 The French engraver, painter and art critic [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] denounced the curves and undulations of the predominant [[rocaille]] style: "Don't torture without reason those things which could be straight, and come back to the good sense which is the beginning of good taste."&lt;ref&gt;Droguet, Anne, ''Les styles Transition et Louis XVI'', pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XVI himself showed little enthusiasm for art or architecture.  He left the management of these to [[Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie]], the Count of Angiviller, who was made Director General of Buildings, Gardens, Arts, Academies and Royal Manufactories.&lt;ref&gt;Droguet, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Angeviller, for financial reasons,  postponed a grand enlargement of the [[Palace of Versailles]], but completed the new [[Château de Compiègne]] (1751–83), begun by Louis XV, and decorated it from 1782 to 1786.  The King's principal architectural addition to Versailles was the new library on the first floor (begun 1774).  He was much more generous to Queen Marie-Antoinette;  she redecorated the Grand Apartments of the Queen at Versailles in 1785, and carried out important works on her apartments at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] and Compiegne, as well as new apartments in the [[Tuileries Palace]].  The King also gave the Queen the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles, and in 1785 bought a new chateau for her at St. Cloud.&lt;ref&gt;Droguet, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classicism]], based Roman and Greek models had been used in French architecture since the time of [[Louis XIV]]; he rejected a plan by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] for a baroque facade of the Louvre, and chose instead a classical facade with a colonnade and pediment. The architects of Louis XIV, [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]], turned away from the gothic and renaissance style and used a baroque version of the Roman dome on the new churches at [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grace]] and [[Les Invalides]]. [[Louis XV]] and his chief architects, [[Jacques Ange Gabriel]] and [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] continued the style of architecture based upon symmetry and the straight line.  Gabriel created the ensemble of classical buildings around the [[Place de la Concorde]] while Soufflot designed the [[Panthéon]] (1758–90) on the Roman model.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential building from the late Louis XV period was the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles (1762-1764), by [[Jacques Ange Gabriel]], built for the mistress of the King, [[Madame Pompadour]]. Its cubic form, symmetric facade and Corinthian peristyle, similar to the villas of Palladio, made it model for the following Louis XVI style.

Another notable influence on the style was the architecture of the Renaissance architect [[Palladio]], which influenced the building of country houses in England, as well as the French architect [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux]] (1736-1806). Palladio's ideas were the inspiration for the [[Château de Louveciennes]], and its neoclassical music pavilion (1770–71) built by [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]] for the mistress of Louis XV, [[Madame du Barry]].  The pavilion is cubic in form, with a facade of four pilasters supporting the architrave and the pilaster of the terrace. It became the model for similar houses under Louis XVI.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazét (2006), pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Civil Architecture==
Notable monuments of Louis XVI civil architecture include the [[Hotel de la Monnaie]] in Paris (1771–76) by [[Jacques Denis Antoine]], as well as the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] in Paris by the same architect;  and the theater of Besançon (1775) and the [[Chateau de Benouville]] in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], both by Ledoux.  The latter building has geometric architecture, a flat ceiling, and a portico in the colossal order of corinthian columns.  The [[École de Chirurgie]], or School of Surgery in Paris by [[Jacques Gondoin]] (1769) adapted the forms of the neoclassical town house, with a  court of honor placed between a pavilion with a colonnade on the street and the main building. He also added a [[peristyle]] and another floor above the columns, and transformed he entrance to the courtyard into a miniature triumphal arch.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), pg. 249&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Theaters in Paris and Bordeaux were prominent examples of the new style. The architect [[Victor Louis]] (1731-1811) completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780);  its majestic stairway was a forerunner of the stairway of the Paris [[Opera Garnier]].&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, in the midst of the [[French Revolution]], he completed the [[Comedie Francaise]].  The [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odeon Theater]] in Paris (1779-1782) was built by  [[Marie-Joseph Peyre]] (1730-1785) and [[Charles de Wailly]] (1729-1798).  It featured a portico in the form of a covered gallery and columns in advance of the facade.{{sfn|Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 77}}

One of the best-known buildings of the period is the small [[Chateau de Bagatelle]], (1777) designed and built  by [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] for the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother.. The small chateau was designed and completed in just sixty three days, to win a bet with [[Marie Antoinette]] that he could build a chateau in less than three months.  Marie Antoinette had a similar small neoclassical belvedere created by architect [[Richard Mique]], who had also designed her picturesque rustic village in the gardens.  it was completed in 1789, the year of the French Revolution.  
 
Another unusual architectural project was the transformation of the [[Palais Royal]] in the heart of Paris, into a grand shopping mall. In 1781 the [[Duc de Chartres]], needing money, commissioned architect [[Victor Louis]] to create an arcade of shops, cafes and clubs on the ground floor.  In 1788 he added a covered [[cirque]] in the center, a covered promenade and space for concerts and entertainments, with a trellis roof supported by seventy-two ionic columns.{{Sfn|Droguet|2004|page=25}}

The most characteristic building of the late Louis XVI residential style is the [[Hôtel de Salm]] in Paris (Now the [[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]], built by [[Pierre Rousseau]] in 1751-83.  The facade is distinguished by its simplicity and purity, and its harmony and balance. A colonnade of corinthian columns supports the entablement of the rotunda, which is surmounted by statues.  The facade is also animated by busts of roman emperors in niches, and sculptures in relief above the windows of the semicircular central avant-corps.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=162-3}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Religious architecture==
The [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]], designed by [[Jacques Germain Soufflot]] as the Church of Sainte-Geneviève and begun in 1757 under Louis XV,  was the most prominent example of religious architecture under construction during the period.  It replaced the colossal columns modeled after those of the Church of the Jesu and St. Peter's in Rome with slender, graceful corinthian columns supporting a continuous entablement. The plan was also classical;  the long nave with a vaulted ceiling was replaced by a Greek cross, with the dome in the center.  Soufflot employed novel engineering techniques to support the dome; a system of contreforts and arches, and the use of iron bars to support the stone structure.  The building was begun in 1764 but not completed until 1790, after the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), pg. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important church completed in the Louis XVI period was Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1768-1784)  by [[Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin]].  It was one of the last churches finished before the Revolution.  The church is inspired by paleo-Christian architecture; it features  massive columns and a pediment, and an interior with vaulted ceiling that suggests a vast Roman basilica.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=60}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Functional and utopian architecture==
The architect [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux]] specialized in designing functional buildings in greatly simplified the classical style. Examples included his simplified neoclassical design for the customs barrier at La Villette in Paris (1785-1789), with its classical facade and rotunda.  He was especially known for his project for the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans]] (1775–79)  This was a model industrial site, in an elliptical shape, with the house of the factory director in the center, with a rustic neoclassical colonnade, surrounded by the workshops, storerooms and offices in concentric rings.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), pg. 250-51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Etienne-Louis Boullée]] (1728-1799) was another visionary architect of the period; his projects, never built, included a monument to [[Isaac Newton]] (1784) in the form of an immense dome, with a perforated top allowing the light to enter, giving the impression of a sky full of stars.  His project for an enlargement of the Royal Library (1785) was even more dramatic, with a gigantic arch sheltering the collection of books. While none of his projects were ever built, the images were widely published and inspired architects of the period to look outside the traditional forms.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006), pg. 250-51&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Interior decoration==
The Louis XVI style of decoration marked the triumph of neo-classicism, which had been underway in Europe since 1770.  It reflected the murals and designs found in the early archeological excavations in [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompei]], and the travels of groups of artists to Greece and Asia Minor.  The "Taste Pompeiian'' was followed by "the taste Entruscan''.    Motifs in interior decoration  included [[arabesques]] and [[grotesques]] on the Pompeiian model.  [[Bas-reliefs]] in the Greek and Roman style were popular, often in the form of rectangual friezes in bronze on furniture, or stucco, marble, molded stucco, baked earth, or simply painted in [[tromp l'oeil]]  over doors. Other popular motifs included garlands of oak leaves or olive leaves; interlaced flowers, ribbons  or vines; crowns of roses, flaming torches, horns of plenty, and particularly vases from which emerged flowers or vines.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=158-159}}

In the early part of the reign of Louis XVI, interior decoration was designed to overwhelm the viewer with its scale, majesty and opulence. Grand halls served multiple purposes, for theater entertainments, balls, or banquets.  An example of the early Louis XVI style is the dining room of the [[Chateau de Maisons]], rebuilt  between 1777-1782 by [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] for the [[Comte d'Artois]], the brother of Louis XVI.  This dining room, inspired by grand style of Louis XIV and Louis XV. It features columns of the colossal order, inches, frontons, consoles, sculpture in relief,  and a gigantic fireplace.

Later in the reign, the tendency shifed to smaller, more intimate and comfortable salons, studies, dining rooms and boudoirs, as the Cabinet Doré of Marie Antoinette at the Palace of Versailles (1783) and the boudoir of Marie Antoinette at Fontainebleau, in the Pompeiian style (1785).   The Pompeiian style featured mythical animals, such as sphinxes and griffons, horns of plenty, and vases of flowers mounted on tripods.   The style also was frequently used in [[friezes]] and [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]], in medallions and in white on blue [[Wedgewood]] porcelain.  In the laster years of the Louis XVI style, the decorative panels were divided into often geometric divisions, either circles or octagons,{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=158-159}}

==Furniture==
{{Main|Louis XVI furniture}}
Louis XVI style furniture, particularly the furniture made for the royal palaces,  is among the most finely-crafted and valuable ever produced in France.  Much of it was produced at the ''Garde-Meuble du Roi'', the royal furniture worship, directed by Francois II Foliot (1748-1808). produced at the Among the notable craftsmen of the period were [[Georges Jacob]], who made a suite of sofas and chairs for the apartments of Marie Antoinette at Versailles and for those of the Comte d'Artois, the King's brother, at the Temple.  [[Oak]], [[mahogany]] and [[walnut]] were the woods most commonly used. The chairs of the early period made for Marie Antoinette were richly decorated gilded carvings, usually with floral patterns.  The chairs and sofas were usually upholstered in satin, with more elaborate medallions embroidered in silk attached.  Later in the period, more exotic themes, often taken from popular theater productions in Paris, appeared in decoration of furniture,{  These included Chinese, Arabesque, and Etruscan figures. A variety of specialized pieces of furniture were created.  These included lightweight chairs for men sitting at gambling tables, and specialized chairs for boudoirs, dressing rooms, libraries, and antechambers.{{Sfn|Droguet|2004|pages 92-102}}

The beds, especially in the ''chambers de parade'' or ceremonial bedrooms of the royal palaces, were of extraordinary proportions, and were usually separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade. reached monumental proportions.  These beds were termed ''à la Duchesse'', and featured an ornate canopy over the bed.  The sculpted and gilded wood frame of the silk embroidered canopy over the bed of Marie Antoinette at Fontainebleau, installed in 1787,  was so heavy that two additional columns were placed under it at night avoid its collapse.{{Sfn|Droguet|2004|pages 92-102}}

==Cabinet-making and Marquetry== 
The craft of the ''Ebenist'', or cabinet-maker, was considered separate from that of other furniture-makers. About a third of the ''Ebenists'' in Paris were of foreign origin, either second-generation immigrants from Belgium and the Netherlands or first-generation from the [[Rhineland]]. The latter group included some of the most famous craftsmen, including [[Jean-Henri Riesener]], who became a master in 1768, and [[David Roentgen]].  They received special protection and patronage from Marie-Antoinette, who admired German craftsmanship.{{Sfn|Droguet|2004|paages 115-139}}

Several new varieties of the furniture were introduced, including a commode in the form of half-moon form, and the ''commode dessert'', which had a door in the front with shelves on either side.  The ''commode bonheur-du-jour'' was a dressing table for a boudoir, with a small armoire on top, with either a mirror or a curtain. The ''table a la Tronchin'' was a table with a built-in-shelf which could be raised by a mechanism for reading. some of the furniture was small and designed to be easily moved, to quickly re-earrange salons.  These included the ''table bouillotte'', a small round table with four legs and drawer.{{sfn|Renault and Laze (2006), pg. 82.}}

The tables and cabinets were usually decorated with sculpted and gilded bronze ornament, often in the forms of stylized roses, knotted ribbons, or pine cones.   The surfaces were frequently inlaid with plaques of different colored exotic woods or [[mother-of-pearl]],  forming either a checkerboard pattern, a pattern of cubes,  or more intricate designs.  The Commodes Sometimes the wood was dyed to achieve the color contrast, or pieces of wood were laid with the grain in different directions. Rissener were especially known for their richly ornamented  surfaces.{{sfn|Renault and Laze (2006), pg. 82.}}  [[David Roentgen]] was particularly famous for his desks, which featured a variety of mechanical features as well as superb woodwork.

==The Tapestry==
The royal tapestry workshop of [[Gobelins Manufactory]] continued to produce high-quality large works for royal residences and the nobility, but tastes had changed. The immense tapestries celebrating historical events were largely out of style.  Instead of creating new designs, the manufactories of Gobelins, Beauvais and Aubusson recycled old designs, such as the ''Metamorphoses'' of [[François Boucher|Boucher]].{{Sfn|Droguet|pp. 58-59}}  An increasing amount of the work was the creation of designs, especially polychrome floral patterns, for the upholstery of the royal furniture.  The other two major tapestry workshops, [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] and the [[Beauvais Manufactory]], also oriented their work primarily to furniture upholstery.

==Wallpaper and printed fabric==
Hand-painted [[wallpaper]] had been used since in the 16th century for interior decoration, followed by wood block prints. French aristocrats often used tapestries in the major rooms, but in the antechambers and lesser rooms they often used painted or printed of painted paper designs imported from China, India, and especially England. In 1765, the French government placed a heavy tax on imported wallpaper, stimulating French production.  During the reign of Louis XVI, the largest French enterprise for making wallpaper was created [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]],   In 1784 they received the title of Royal Manufactory, opened a large depot near the Tuilieries Palace, and hired a group of noted artists and illustrators, including the son of the painter [[François Boucher|Boucher]], to design wallpaper. They also soon developed a process for printing the wallpaper in long rolls. He also made the colorful paper that covered the balloon that made the first manned flight in 1783.{{sfn|Droguet|(2004)|pages=58-59}}  Their factory in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine . became one of the largest in Paris, and was an early target of demonstrations at the beginning of the [[French Revolution]].

Another popular style that developed during the period was the decoration of rooms with panoramic scenes, composed of a number of painted or printed panels put together.  These were commonly used in boudoirs and bath chambers.  The salon of the pavilion of the Countess of Provence in Montreuil, and the country "Cottage" of the Prince de Condé at Chantilly had a similar panorama installed in 1775.{{sfn|Droguet|(2004)|pages=58-59}}

Another popular form of decoration was printed fine cotton, with elaborate arabesques and floral patterns.  The most famous variety was ''[[toile de Jouy]]''.   The fabric was made with wood block prints,  was usually white and red or blue and red, was used to cover beds, for curtains, and for the covers of furniture.  Another important industry was that of the manufacture of silk products.  The best quality silk was made in [[Lyon]], and was sold to [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, and other royal clients.  [[Lampas]] silk coverings with motifs of arabesques and medallions covered the walls of the billiards room of Marie-Antoinette in 1779, and thereafter became fashionable in Paris residences.{{sfn|Droguet|(2004)|pages=58-59}}

==Painting and sculpture==
The most famous painter of the later French baroque was [[François Boucher]], who perfectly captured the spirit and style of the period. After his death in 1770, shortly before the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI, he had no real successor in the baroque style.  The end of the reign of Louis XV also brought to prominence the first artist to paint in the neoclassical style, [[Joseph Marie Vien]], who painted scenes of Rome inspired by the discoveries at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]. Vien became the last holder of the title of first painter of the King, which he held from 1789 to 1791.   Jean Peyron was another neoclassicist in the early Louis XVI reign. [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] was noted for her portraits of the royal family and nobility,  including of Marie Antoinette and her children.  The most prominent neoclassicist by far was [[Jacques-Louis David]] whose works well before the revolution expressed the Roman virtues of noble and grave simplicity. His major early works included ''Belisarius asking for alms'' (1781),''The Agony of  Andromique'' (1783), and especially [[Oath of the Horatii]] (1784), exalting the willingness of Roman soldiers to give their lives for the nation. The painting was so popular when shown at the Salon of 1785 that David was permitted to establish his studio in Louvre, a particular honor for artists. This painting became a model of the style that dominated French art during and after the Revolution.{{Sfn|Cabane|1988|pages=134-136}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Sculpture evolved from the more animated forms of the baroque to the more serene neoclassical style. The sculptors who were most prominent in the period included [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]], who created table sculptures on classical and romantic themes for many Parisian salons, as well as the famous statue of Peter the Great on horseback for St Petersburg.  Another notable portrait sculptor was [[Augustin Pajou]], who also made statues of Greek and Roman gods, illustrating virtues;  his statue of Mercury represented commerce.  The most celebrated portrait sculptor was  [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], known for his busts of leading figures of the period, including, in 1790, in the midst of the Revolution, Louis XVI himself.  [[Louis-Simon Boizot]] was prominent for making busts of the nobility, including Marie Antoinette, but also for modeling figures for the [[Sevres porcelain]] factory, which became better known than his more formal sculpture.  Examples include his ''The Toilet of Madame'', made of hard-paste porcelain, mounted on a plaque of marble and gilded bronze.

==Music==
Musical tastes at court were guided by [[Marie Antoinette]].  The Queen played the harp and sang, and had been, in Vienna, a student of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]].  Her favorite composers were Gluck and [[Grétry]], and she regularly attended concerts at the Academy of Music and the ''Concert Sprituel'', a society created to support new religious music. Gluck came to Paris in December 1776 for performances of his opera ''[[Iphigenie en Tauride]]'', and remained to compose seven operas.   However his opera, [[Echo et Narcisse]] in 1779, was a failure, and he departed Paris, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;Vila, Marie Christine, ''Paris Musique- Huit siècles d'histoire'' (2007), p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mozart]] came to Paris in 1778, where he conducted two symphonies, including the ''Parisian'' and gave music lessons to members of the nobility, as did Hayden.   The members of the new Masonic movement in Paris were particularly active in sponsoring music;  they commissioned Hayden in 1786-85 to write the ''Symphonies Parisienees''.&lt;ref&gt;Vila, Marie Christine, ''Paris Musique- Huit siècles d'histoire'' (2007), p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38982">'''Body shape''' refers to the many physical attributes of the [[human body]] that make up its appearance, including size and countenance. [[Body shape]] has come to imply not only sexual/reproductive ability, but [[Wellness (medicine)|wellness]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]]. In the [[Western culture|West]], slenderness is associated with happiness, success, youth, and social acceptability. Being [[overweight]] is associated with laziness. The media promote a weight-conscious standard for women more often than for men.&lt;ref name="Sex Roles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, and Kelly|title=The role of the mass media in promoting a thin standard of bodily attractiveness for women|journal=Sex Roles|year=1986|volume=14|issue=9–10|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rn84077187531j83/|accessdate=11 April 2012|doi=10.1007/BF00287452|pages=519–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deviance from these norms result in social consequences.&lt;ref name=SG&gt;{{cite book|last=Grogan|first=Sarah|title=Body Image Understanding body dissatisfaction in men, women, and Children|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media perpetuate this ideal in various ways, particularly glorifying and focusing on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use or image of overweight individuals.

It has been stated that the increase in [[eating disorder]]s over the past several decades has coincided with an overall decrease (pound-wise) in women's [[ideal body weight]] portrayed by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face" /&gt; A group of researchers examined the magazines [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], and [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] from 1959 to 1999.  [[Fashion model]]s became increasingly thinner during the 1980s and 1990s, making [[The Thin Ideal|the thin ideal]] even more difficult for women to achieve.  Photos depicting the models' entire bodies significantly increased in number from the 1960s to the 1990s.  From 1995 to 1999 models were dressed in far more revealing outfits than they were from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sypeck|first=Mia Foley|author2=Gray, James J. |author3= Ahrens, Anthony H.|title=No Longer Just a Pretty Face: Fashion Magazines' Depictions of Ideal Female Beauty from 1959 to 1999|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=November 2004|volume=36|issue=3|pages=342–347|pmid=15478132|doi=10.1002/eat.20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's magazine]]s have been criticized for their conflicting messages, with an emphasis on [[food]], [[cooking]], [[child rearing]], and entertaining.  75% of women's magazines contain at least one ad or article about how to alter one's appearance through [[cosmetic surgery]], [[Dieting|diet]], or [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malkin, Wornian, Chrisler|title=Women and Weight: Gendered Messages on Magazine Covers|journal=Sex Roles|year=1999|volume=40|doi=10.1023/A:1018848332464|pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of the women's magazines surveyed included tips for dieting or messages about weight loss.  Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance.  Megenta magazine released an article on "How to dress for your body type" giving tips and tricks to look the best in an outfit while striving to encourage women to feel comfortable in their skin.&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magentamagazine.co.za/health_beauty/dressing-for-your-body-type-tips-tricks-with-style-by-loren/|title=How to dress for your body type - Magenta Magazine|date=2018-02-02|work=Magenta Magazine|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"/&gt; Men's magazines provide information about hobbies, activities, and entertainment in order for men to better their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and Body Image in the Media |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research pertaining to how the media effects body image examines the change in models and magazine articles over time. Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, and Thompson paid particular attention to the difference in body shape of Playboy centerfolds over a 20-year period. They found that over the years, the body mass, bust, and hip measurements decreased; however, the height increased.  They also determined that the Playboy centerfolds were 13%-19% lower than the normal body weight for women of their age (Cusumano, Thompson 1997). Other studies found that over the years, magazines like Seventeen, YM, and Cosmopolitan all had an increase in articles pertaining to diet and exercise. Anderson and DiDomenico (1992) compared women's and men's popular magazines and found that diet and exercise articles appeared more than 10 times as much in women's magazines than men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2009/BodyImageMedia.htm|title=Effects of the Media on Body Image|last=Kovar|first=Allie|date=30 April 2009|website=Vanderbilt Psychology Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Modeling and fashion industries have come under fire in recent years for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance, giving "unhealthy stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer|date=22 May 2013|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data research done by Might Goods using 3,000 models from 20 leading model agencies, 94% of the models are underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mightygoods.com/underweight-fashion-models|title=94% of All Fashion Models are underweight|last=|first=|date=11 September 2017|website=Mighty Goods|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a recent study conducted by Jennifer Brenner and Joseph Cunningham, it was observed that the majority of female models were underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Jennifer B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Joseph G.|date=1992-10-01|title=Gender differences in eating attitudes, body concept, and self-esteem among models|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289949|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=413–437|doi=10.1007/BF00289949|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average American female fashion model begins working in the modeling business at ages 13–17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220912/average-age-for-models-to-start-in-the-business/|title=Models - average age for starting in the business {{!}} Survey 2011|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average female model in the United States weighs in ranging from 90 pounds to 120 pounds  and an average of 5'8" to 5'11" tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maceyjforonda/street-style-surveys-what-are-the-ideal-stats-for-a-fashion|title=Street Style Surveys: What Are The Ideal Stats For A Fashion Model?|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the average weight of a female is 168.5 pounds, and the average height for females is 5'4".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm|title=FastStats|date=2017-08-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AMA (American Medical Association), thin models on the catwalk as well as social media and fashion photography lead to unrealistic body expectations, which in turn could lead to eating disorders and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Viewpoints&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=TopicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=42&amp;docId=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;docType=Viewpoint+essay&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;topicId=00000000LVXR&amp;searchId=&amp;userGroupName=uiuc_oak&amp;inPS=true&amp;u=uiuc_oak&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the mass advertisement promoting thin body, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, women and young girls are being bombarded with this very idea of achieving thin body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforchange.com/battling-bodies-understanding-overcoming-negative-body-images|title=Battling Our Bodies: Understanding and Overcoming Negative Body Images|last=Hawkins|first=Nicole|date=August 2014|website=Center For Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is being control by some countries such as Israel and France in which they regulate the body mass indexes of models and let the public know whether the ad images is manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This isn't the answer to fashion's body image issues|last=Lieber|first=Chavie|date=6 September 2017|website=Racked|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoshop is, "the altering (a photographic image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/photoshop|title=Definition of PHOTOSHOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerie, the lingerie line for American Eagle, began the campaign Aerie Real in which models were no longer photoshopped. A 2016 study showed that some women showed a smaller decrease in body satisfaction when seeing the photos of women untouched in comparison to the greater decrease in body satisfaction when seeing previous photos that were retouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Convertino|first=Alexandra D|last2=Rodgers|first2=Rachel F|last3=Franko|first3=Debra L|last4=Jodoin|first4=Adriana|title=An evaluation of the Aerie Real campaign: Potential for promoting positive body image?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1359105316680022|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316680022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known magazines have been called out for photoshopping, a few examples being ''AdWeek, InStyle, Modeliste Magazine, and Fashion Magazine.'' Celebrities have recently commented on changes that were made of their photos by such magazines. In 2015, Zendaya, a current 21 year old actress, singer, and dancer, posted two pictures side by side of her magazine photoshoot calling out the changes that were made by the magazine, Modeliste Magazine. She stated that, "There are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/708613/zendaya-gets-photoshopped-singer-slams-magazine-for-promoting-unrealistic-beauty-ideals|title=Zendaya Slams Magazine for Photoshopping Her Pics|work=E!

Victoria's Secret puts on an annually televised Fashion Show in which its beautiful models walk down the runway in lingerie and latest releases for PINK, the clothing store of Victoria's Secret. In the televised showing, the models usually include how they prepared for the Fashion Show by showing clips of working out and dieting to prepare for the big day. A study published in 2013 analyzed the responses viewers were tweeting during the showing. Viewers discussed food, weight, eating disorders, and self-harm. The results of this study showed that vulnerable viewers could experience negative affect, or even engage in harmful behaviors, during or after viewing the show or others like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Suffering by comparison: Twitter users' reactions to the Victoria&amp;#x27;s Secret Fashion Show|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144513000594|journal=Body Image|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=648–652|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2013.05.001|issn=1740-1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In 28 [[primetime]] [[Situation comedy|situational comedies]] analyzed by researchers in 2002, 33% of the central female characters were below average weight.  As the thinness of a female character increased, the number of compliments she received from men did as well. Research has shown below average weight female characters are over represented, while above average weight female characters are underrepresented in situational comedies as compared to the norms of the US population. Primetime television shows that appeal to a primarily  [[female]] audience, such as [[Friends (TV series)|Friends]] or [[Ally McBeal]] are helmed by young, attractive, and thin women.  Extremely skinny or [[Emaciation|emaciated]] women are shown on [[fashion industry]] related shows, like [[House of Style]].&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henriks|first=Alexandra|title=Examining the effects of hegemonic depictions of female bodies on television: a call for theory and programmatic research|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|date=9 November 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106–123|doi=10.1080/07393180216550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male characters often negatively comment on average and above average weight females' body shapes and weights and audiences usually react by laughing.  Male characters are not immune to unfair representation.  33% of male characters were below average weight and 13% were above average weight.  By comparison, approximately 30% of men in the US are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fouts, Gregory  |author2=Vaughan, Kimberely |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Television Situation Comedies: Male Weight, Negative References, and Audience Reactions|journal=Sex Roles|date=June 2002|volume=46|issue=11/12|pages=439–442|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vux1891n61umjl2g/|accessdate=9 March 2012|doi=10.1023/A:1020469715532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 a study was conducted on ten top-rated American primetime fictional television programs.  33% of female television characters were underweight.&lt;ref name="Overweight and Obese"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on Commercial Television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|url=http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/resources/upload/docs/what/bias/portrayals-of-overweight-and-obese-individuals.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done of 10 primetime television programs on each of the 6 major [[TV network]]s ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[UPN]], [[NBC]], and [[WB Television Network|WB]]) with the largest [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen audience ratings]] during the 1999–2000 season.  Of the 1018 characters on all of the shows 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese.  These numbers represent less than half the percentage of overweight or obese males and females in the general population.  Overweight female characters were less likely to be considered attractive, display physical affection, or to connect with romantic partners.  Overweight males characters were less likely to interact with friends or romantic partners and less likely to talk about dating.  Overweight males characters were often shown eating.  These statistics are representative of the fat stigmatization present in many US television programs.&lt;ref name="Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on TV"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweights and Obese Individuals on Commercial Televisions|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of fat female television characters that do exist are consistently depicted in relation to thinner, highly [[sexualized]] female characters.  These characters are used as props, against which thinner women are compared, judged and valued.

A study in Fiji showed that the introduction of western television had a detrimental effect on young women's perceptions and eating behaviors. Three fourths of the girls in the study reported feeling fat after prolonged exposure to western television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=A.E.|title=Television, disordered eating, and young women in Fiji: negotiating body image and identity during rapid social change|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=28 4|pages=533–59|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, analysts sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for [[Anti-fat bias|anti-fat]] humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Himes and Thompson|title=Fat Stigmatization in Television Shows and Movies: A Content Analysis|journal=Obesity|year=2007|volume=15|pages=712–718|url=http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v15/n3/full/oby2007635a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-deprecation|Self-deprecating]] fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person.  Male character were three times more likely to engaged in fat commentary than female characters.  Media programs containing fat stigmatization content often are popular and have high ratings, suggesting that the general public finds it acceptable to overlook such remarks in the context of the story.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies" /&gt;

According to Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University, the average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day. Girls often take drastic measures in an attempt to become like the media images they view. Many end up with very low self-esteem and dangerous eating disorders.  Elissa Gittes, MD, a pediatrician in the division of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh says "We're seeing girls at younger ages starting to be dissatisfied with their bodies, proactively trying to change them, and feeling like they need to emulate something different than what their bodies can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/helping-girls-with-body-image#1|title=Helping Girls With Body Image|last=Heubeck|first=Elizabeth|date=|website=WebMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
In 2009 a content analysis of 150 top-selling [[video game]]s found that games rated for children depicted female characters as significantly thinner than female characters in games rated for adults. Females in video games had significantly larger heads, but smaller chest sizes, waists, and hips than the average American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martins, Williams, Harrison, and Ratan|title=A Content Analysis of Female Body Imagery in Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9682-9|volume=61|pages=824–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a study showed that after playing video games, both female and male college-aged participants had significantly lower body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher P.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard J.|date=2008-10-01|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=7–8|pages=586–601|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscular male body in mass media and video is the cause of many symptoms such as body dissatisfaction and body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlelt|first=Christopher|date=2008|title=Meta-Analyses of the Effects of Media Images on Men's Body-image Concerns|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2008.27.3.279|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume= 27|pages= 279–310|via=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, adolescent boys age 13-18 spend nine hours on average playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher|date=May 2008|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|volume= 59| issue = 7-8|pages= 586–601|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to these unattainable avatars within video games lead to higher body dissatisfaction, and in turn lead to many other social and psychology problems. Garner reported that 41% of teenage 13–19 years old boys were found to be dissatisfied with their overall body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199702/body-image-in-america-survey-results|title=Body Image in America: Survey Results|last=Garner|first=David|date=1 February 1997|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research done by Zeely Sylvia from Bridgewater State University found that: players who played game with character who had a more average body size and shape would display less  body esteem concern than players who played with unrealistic muscular body character. The research concludes that muscularity concerns play a large role in the construct of male body image, and may have a substantial influence on male body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sylvia|first=Zeely|date=2013|title=Virtual Ideals|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&amp;context=undergrad_rev|journal=The Effect of Video Game Play On Male Body Image|volume= 9|pages= 165–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-fiction media==
In 2001, British newspaper ''The Independent'' wrote about the silhouette of American TV stars like [[Calista Flockhart]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and compared it to that of the women in Pop group [[Destiny's Child]] saying, "The lollipop silhouette long-favoured by the female stars of American sitcoms, which involves disproportionately large heads wobbling atop stick-thin bodies does not say rich and it doesn't say clever. It says take me to a clinic. The New Athleticism, however, sends out a rather different set of messages: strong, confident, independent woman."&lt;ref name=SG/&gt;

[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Richard Carmona]] speaks of obesity as the "terror within" and says "unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf [[9/11|9–11]] or any other terrorist attempt." The news media has been criticized for its alarmist and overly dramatized reporting on the issue of weight and obesity.  By using key words such as "war" or "epidemic" in their reporting, the news media attracts greater attention to the issue.  News reports likely reinforce the stigma of fat bodies, linking them to disease and likening fatness to a health behavior instead of an inalterable trait.&lt;ref name="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1/pdf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saguy and Almeling|title=Fat in the Fire? Science, the News Media, and the ''Obesity Epidemic''|journal=Sociological Forum|date=26 October 2007|volume=23|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]], the founding editor of [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]], wrote harshly critical remarks about [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and his weight. Kinsley wrote "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat . . .why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character . . . Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Kinsley|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html|publisher=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's media==
A content analysis done of children's videos and books found that 72% of videos and 7.5% of books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness.  In 60% of videos, a character's love for another depends on physical appearance and attractiveness. Examples include [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]], where the prince invites maidens to the ball to select a bride and [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]], where the Beast falls in love with Belle purely based upon her physical appearance.  In 72% of videos and 10% of books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits.  In 84% of videos and 10% of books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness.  While 60% of videos portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity.  No physical attraction is shown between a slender character and an obese character, with the exception of Beauty and the Beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook-Cottone|first=Catherine|date=28 Mar 2018|title=Eating Disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10640266.2018.1451684|journal=The journal of treatment and prevention|volume= 26|pages= 105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 involved one hundred and twenty one girls age 3-6 to determine the effects of brief exposure to appearance‐related media on young girls' body image. The exposure ended up not affecting body dissatisfaction. Although nearly all the girls did like how they looked ⅓ would change one physical thing and half were worried of becoming fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Sharon|last2=Tantleff-Dunn|first2=Stacey|date=2010-06-01|title=Am I too fat to be a princess?

In 64% of children's videos and 20% of books obesity is related to negative traits.  Obese characters are often shown as evil, unfriendly, cruel, and unattractive. Ursula from [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] is an obese, unattractive octopus.  In 40% of videos and 20% of books at least one obese character is disliked by others.  Obese characters are shown thinking about food or depicted in setting related to food in 52% of videos and 20% of books.  Children's media is perpetuating the "what is beautiful is good" stereotype through its portrayals of thin and obese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herbozo, Tantleff-Dunn, Gokee-Larose, and Thompson|title=Beauty and Thinness Messages in Children's Media: A Content Analysis|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.1080/10640260490267742|pmid=16864302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Media==
Social media consists of websites like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook enable users to produce and share content. Thinspiration images that promote the idealization of thinness and pro-eating disorder websites are becoming increasingly more prevalent throughout social media. Pro-eating disorder (i.e. pro-ana and pro-bulimia) websites are forms of social media where  individuals can share advice and images that encourage their peers to engage in eating disorder behaviors. These websites have been shown to have deleterious effects because they communicate to the viewer that the thin ideal is something that is not only attainable but also necessary. Women are more likely to compare themselves online when they feel the need to improve their appearance. Women with low self-esteem are more likely to feel dissatisfied after comparing themselves to images on social and women who struggle with preexisting eating disorders may exacerbate them through social media fueled body comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perloff|first1=Richard M.|title=Social Media Effects on Young Women's Body Image Concerns: Theoretical Perspectives and an Agenda for Research|journal=Sex Roles|date=29 May 2014|volume=71|issue=11-12|pages=363–377|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0384-6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on college women in the US concluded that women who spent a significant amount of time on Facebook had increased body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckler|first1=Petya|last2=Kalyango|first2=Yusuf|last3=Paasch|first3=Ellen|title=Facebook use and negative body image among U.S. college women|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=2 March 2016|volume=57|issue=2|pages=249–267|doi=10.1080/03630242.2016.1159268|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects on viewers==
"A study of 6,928 girls ages 9 to 14 years old found that the desire to emulate the appearance of females on television, in movies, and in magazines was predictive of beginning purging behavior at least on a monthly basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Z.|last2=Sullivan|first2=E.A.|last3=Davies|first3=P.S.W.|last4=Hill|first4=R.J.|title=Media Influence on the Body Image of Children and Adolescents, Eating Disorders|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–364|doi=10.1080/10640260600952506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 92% of women feel pressure to conform to the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates.  After viewing images of women with "ideal" body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs.  Those with [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images.  Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression.&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions" /&gt;  Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements.  This finding is consistent with previous evidence that states muscularity is more important than body fat in men's body satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Muscle Dysmorphia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leit, Gray, and Pope|title=The Media's Representation of the Ideal Male Body: A Cause for Muscle Dysmorphia?|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|year=2002|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.10019/pdf|doi=10.1002/eat.10019|pages=334–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correlation between media image and body image has been proven; in one study, among European American and African American girls ages 7 – 12, greater overall television exposure predicted both a thinner ideal adult body shape and a higher level of disordered eating one year later. Adolescent girls are the most strongly affected demographic; "More and more 12-year-old girls are going on diets because they believe what you weigh determines your worth," Cutler observed. "When all you see is a body type that only two percent of the population has, it's difficult to remember what's real and what's reasonable to expect of yourself and everyone else." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image&lt;/ref&gt;

Put simply, the beauty ideal in American culture is: thin. "Large populations of 'average' girls do not demonstrate clinically diagnosable eating disorders—pathologies that the culture marks as extreme and unhealthy—but rather an entirely normative obsession with body shape and size," Cutler said. "This ongoing concern is accepted as a completely normal and even inevitable part of being a modern girl. I think we need to change that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image|title=The Media's Effect on Women's Body Image|last=Ossola|first=Alexandra|date=1 September 2010|website=Hamilton|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and teens are very vulnerable to addict of social media usage because they do not know different life, world, and functioning without it. "Teens and young adults are considered particularly at risk. They're a generation raised on the internet, social media, and digital technology so these things are integral, indispensable parts of their lives. Young people also are impressionable, eager for acceptance, and relatively inexperienced, which can cloud judgment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good, Bad, and In-between of Social Media|url=https://carrierclinic.org/resources/good-bad-in-between-of-social-media/|website=carrierclinic.org|publisher=carrierclinic.org|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statistics And Interesting Facts:'''

1.) More than 40% of consumers say that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getreferralmd.com/2013/09/healthcare-social-media-statistics/|title=24 Outstanding Statistics &amp; Figures on How Social Media has Impacted the Health Care Industry|last=Honigman|first=Brian|date=2018|website=ReferralMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.) 90% of respondents from 18 to 24 years of age said they would trust medical information shared by others on their social media networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

3.) 18 to 24 year olds are more than 2x as likely than 45 to 54 year olds to use social media for health-related discussions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

4.) 19% of smartphone owners have at least one health app on their phone. Exercise, diet, and weight apps are the most popular types.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

5.)  41% of people said social media would affect their choice of a specific doctor, hospital, or medical facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Several studies have shown that race and ethnicity can affect the way women perceive body image.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Meg|date=2001|title=Disturbances in the Social Body: Differences in Body Image and Eating Problems among African American and White Women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsjsr&amp;AN=edsjsr.3081846&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Gender and Society|volume=15 |issue=2|pages=239–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hesse-Biber, et al.|first=Sharlene|date=Nov 2017|title=Racial Identity and Body Image Among Black Female College Students Attending Predominately White Colleges.|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=55457070&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=63| issue = 9-10|pages=697–711|via=Complementary Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poran|first=Maya, A.|date=2006|title=The politics of protection: body image, social pressures, and the misrepresentation of young Black women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsggo&amp;AN=edsgcl.157839568&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=55|pages=739–755|via=General OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color often have different perceptions of body image than white women—a difference that may be linked to cultural differences such as family and community experiences and racial or ethnic pride, and other differences such as childhood influences (e.g., school environment).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ultimately, these differences may have lasting effects on the ways in which white and non-white women are affected by media depictions and cultural ideals of body image and beauty.

Lovejoy finds in her research—which compares the perceptions of body image and eating disorders in black and white women through a literature review—that the strategies (e.g., resistance to mainstream beauty ideals) that black women use to challenge mainstream depictions of female bodies and develop positive self-valuations are often strengthened through support from other black women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These same types of supportive communities were not replicated in the same way for white women in the literature. Lovejoy argues that this difference in support can influence the way black and white women are affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Namely, black women may be less susceptible to these damaging ideals than white women as a result of strong support within their communities.

However, such research does not suggest that black women are not affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Maya A. Poran finds that "[c]ontrary to popular theories that propose that Black women are protected by a 'Black Culture' that buffers them from negative effects of body representations—thereby leaving them with higher body esteem," black women in her study did experience "(1) pressures to be thin, (2) pressures from the preferences of men of diverse ethnicities, (3) competition with other Black women in the realms of beauty, and (4) a strong sense of being misrepresented by media images of thin Black women." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, while it is important to recognize the contribution of supportive communities on the positive self-valuation that some black women may experience, it is important that this not obscure the damaging impact that harmful ideals of body image and beauty may have on black women.

"Mughal Architecture" is the type of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] developed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Iranian architecture|Persian]], Turkish and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of [[Babur]] at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson [[Akbar]] built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were [[Agra Fort]], the fort-city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Buland Darwaza]]. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] commissioned the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]].

Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], who constructed the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Jama Masjid (Delhi)|Jama Masjid]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens in Lahore]]. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.

==Monuments==
===Agra Fort===
{{main article|Agra fort}}
Agra fort is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in [[Agra]], Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by [[Akbar The Great]] during 1565 to 1574. The [[architecture]] of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the [[Rajput]] planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.

=== Humayun's Tomb===
{{main article|Humayun's Tomb}}
'''Humayun's tomb''' is the [[tomb]] of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress [[Bega Begum]] (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.

===Fatehpur Sikri===
{{main article|Fatehpur Sikri}}
Akbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/excavation-at-akbars-fort-at-fatehpur-sikri-reveals-flourishing-jain-and-hindu-habitation/1/243578.html|title=Excavation at Akbars fort at Fatehpur Sikri reveals flourishing Jain and Hindu habitation|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book/story-4DfRoVJ6tVxmWzz1RztA5I.html|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.

It contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration.  The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti.  The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...

The Haramsara, the royal seraglio  in [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in [[Ain-i-Akbari]], the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the [[eunuch]]s were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful [[Rajput]] guards.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page 146, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jodha Bai's Palace====
This is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor ''haramsara'' (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the [[facade]] to create a kind of [[porch]] leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of [[Hindu]] sculptural motifs. 
The glazed tiles on the roofs from [[Multan]] have an eye catching shade of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page151, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was built in honour of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani#The misnomer of Jodhabai|Jodha Bai]], mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar.  Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.

Buland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.

====Inscription====

A [[chronogram]] is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,

{{Quote|In the reign of King of the world Akbar,
To whom is due the order in the country.
The Sheikh-ul-Islam adorned the mosque.
Which for its elegance deserves as much reverence as the Ka'ba.
The year of the completion of this magnificent edifice.
Is found in the words: duplicate of the Masjidi'l-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta (2013), page 172-176, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hill", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The Tomb of [[Sheikh Salim Chishti]] is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350&amp;nbsp;ft. by 440&amp;nbsp;ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.

==Shah Jahan==
The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in [[Lahore]] was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.
Rather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at [[Agra Fort|Agra]], [[Delhi Fort|Delhi]] and [[Lahore Fort|Lahore]]. Some examples include the [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, the tomb of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Lahore Fort]] and the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the  [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], and [[Naulakha pavilion]], which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in [[Thatta]] called [[Shahjahan Mosque]]. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now [[Delhi]]. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-[[Diwan-i-Aam]] and [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.

===Taj Mahal===
{{main article|Taj Mahal}}

The Taj Mahal, a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the "[[teardrop on the cheek of time]]" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The building's longest [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[symmetry]] runs through the entire complex except for the [[sarcophagus]] of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror [[mosque]] in red sandstone, to complement the [[Mecca]]-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used "[[pietra dura]]", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.

===Wazir Khan Masjid===
{{main|Wazir Khan Mosque}}
[[File:Wazir_Khan_Mosque_by_Moiz.jpg|thumb|[[Wazir Khan Mosque]], A [[Mughal era]] mosque in [[Lahore]]]]

==Aurangzeb and later Mughal architecture==
{{further information|Bibi Ka Maqbara}}
In [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with [[stucco]] ornament. [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Lucknow]] have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).

===Badshahi Masjid===
{{main|Badshahi Mosque}}
The [[Badshahi Mosque|Badshahi Masjid]] in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an [[Idgah (place)|''idgah'']]. The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The [[minarets]] are {{convert|196|ft|m}} tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=whc.unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1277/ |title=Badshahi Mosque, Lahore &amp;ndash; UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional monuments===
Additional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant [[Zinat al-Masjid]] in [[Daryaganj]] was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter [[Zinat-al-Nissa]]. Aurangzeb's sister [[Roshan-Ara]] who died in 1671. The tomb of [[Roshanara Begum]] and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]]  was a mausoleum built by Prince [[Azam Shah]], son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]]. The [[Alamgiri Gate]], built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

Another construction of the Mughal era is [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also known as "Fort Aurangabad"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.

==Mughal gardens==
{{main article|Mughal garden}}
[[File:Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness) terrace view from Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure) terrace.jpg|thumb|The [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]] are among the most famous Mughal gardens.]]
Mughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the [[Char Bagh]] gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as [[Pinjore]] Garden in [[Haryana]].

==Mughal bridges==
[[Shahi Bridge, Jaunpur]] was constructed during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]].

It was founded in [[Madrid]] in 1915 and functioned there until bought out by [[Neufville Typefoundry|Fundición Tipográfica Neufville]] of [[Barcelona]] in 1971.  It employed prestigious designers like [[Carlos Winkow]] and [[Enric Crous-Vidal]] and was noted for its bold and striking art deco faces.

The '''National Design Awards''', founded in 2000, are funded and awarded by [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]]. There are seven official design categories, and three additional awards.  Supplemental awards can be given at the discretion of the jury or institution.

The seven official design categories are:

*Architecture Design
*Communications Design
*Fashion Design (created in 2003)
*Interior Design (created in 2005)
*Interaction Design (created for 2009)
*Landscape Design 
*Product Design

The three additional awards categories are:

*Lifetime Achievement
*Design Patron (created in 2001)
*Design Mind (created in 2005)

The supplemental categories include: 
*People's Design Award (created in 2006)
*Special Commendation (Awarded in 2008)
*Special Jury Commendation (created in 2005, but omitted in 2008)
*American Original (Awarded in 2000 and 2002 only)

----
'''Selection Criteria'''

The selection criteria for all of the awards are '''excellence''', '''innovation''', and '''enhancement''' of the quality of life.  Individual candidates must be citizens or long-term residents of the United States and have been practicing design for at least 7 years.  Corporations and institutions must have their headquarters in the United States.  Honorees are selected for a body of realized work, not for any one specific project.

Candidates are proposed by an official Nominating Committee and are invited to submit materials for a jury's review.  Submissions consist of resumes, portfolios, publications by and about the candidates, and professional-quality audio-visual samples.

----
'''Jury'''

The jurors are chosen by the museum based on their prominence and expertise in the design world.  Once selected, jurors are briefed on the Museum mission and criteria for the Awards.  Decisions are asked to be based on the core criteria: excellence, innovation, and contribution to the quality of life.  '''Museum staff does not enter into the selection process.'''

The jury meets over a two-day period to thoroughly review every submission.  The submissions are assessed in terms of the work's relationship to and impact on contemporary life.  Special emphasis is placed on the extent to which the nominee's designs and achievements have benefit the general public.

----
'''Purpose'''

The annual Awards program celebrates design in various disciplines as a vital humanistic tool in shaping the world, and seeks to increase national awareness of design by educating the public and promoting excellence, innovation, and lasting achievement.

The National Design Awards is one of the few programs of its kind structured to continue to benefit the nation long after the Awards ceremony and gala.  A suite of educational programs is offered every year in conjunction with the Awards by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum's Education Department.  These programs include: lectures, round-tables, workshops, and fairs based on the vision and work of the Awards' winners.

----
'''People's Design Award'''

In 2006, the first ever People's Design Award was created in order to give the general public a chance to nominate and vote for their favorite design.

Individuals can nominate and vote for their favorite designers via the official website.

Ndops are royal memorial portraits caverd by the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] people of [[Central Africa]]. They are not naturalistic portrayals but are intended as representations of the king's spirit and as an encapsulation  of the principal of kingship]]
'''Ndop''' were figurative sculptures representing different kings  (''nyim'') of the [[Kuba kingdom]].

==Image of individual kings==
Although the sculptural genre appears naturalistic, ''ndop'' are not actual one-to-one representations of particular subjects, but rather a culmination of visual notations that represented the ideal characteristics of the deceased king. The reign of individual rulers are identified by a small emblem, called an ''ibol'', at the base of the sculpture. Each ''ibol'' is rendered with a great degree of customization and personalization in an otherwise formal and naturalistic standardization.&lt;ref name="Adams 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Monni|title=18th-Century Kuba King Figures|journal=African Arts|date=May 1988|volume=21|issue=3|pages=32–38+88|doi=10.2307/3336440}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measuring about 48-55 centimeters in height, ''ndop'' were carved in hardwood and anointed with palm oil to protect them from insects, which is unique in African art and underscores their survival in Western collections today. Ndop sculptures depict subjects sitting [[cross-legged]], a posture that is equally unique in African sculpture.

==Description==
''Ndop'' frequently portray the ruler carrying a weapon in his left hand, an ''ikul'' or peace knife, made in the style reserved for the Bushoong, the dominant sub-group of the Kuba. The wooden portraits were kept in the king's quarters with other sculptures referred to as 'royal charms', upon which the king's magical powers rested. When the king was absent from the capital, the ndop were rubbed with oil. Scholars agree that the tradition of the king's "portrait statue" was begun in the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Cornet 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Art Royal Kuba|year=1982|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenwald 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenwald|first=J.|title=Kuba King Figures|journal=African Arts|year=1974|volume=7|issue=3|pages=26–319, 2|doi=10.2307/3334859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and methods of construction==
To create the distinct round contours of this sculpture, the sculptor primarily worked with an [[adze]], which has a wooden handle to which a metal blade is attached at an acute angle. Knives and a burnisher were also used. Kuba carvers demonstrated fine hand and eye coordination to bring out details with the combination of these tools. In addition to the naturalistic shape of the facial features and body parts, the sculptor reproduces realistic detail on the body, including the collarbones and outline of the lips.&lt;ref name="Adams 1988" /&gt;

The durable hardwood and the palm oil anointments underscore the longevity of these works, the earliest examples of which, such as the ndop in the [[Brooklyn Museum]]’s collection, are among the oldest surviving wood works from the continent. Three wooden Ndop figures from the Kuba kingdom currently reside in the [[British Museum]]. Collected by the Hungarian explorer [[Emil Torday]], one of them is estimated to date back to the eighteenth century, making it one of the oldest wooden sculptures extant from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Kuba+king+figure+bushongo British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Two similar figures are in the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africamuseum.be/collections/browsecollections/humansciences/display_object?objectid=29414 RMCA Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africamuseum.be/collections/browsecollections/humansciences/display_object?objectid=29481 RMCA Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of ''ndop''==
After the rites of [[investiture]] were completed, it is said that the ''nyim'' commissioned a sculptor to sculpt his likeness in the form of the ''ndop''. Only one ndop could be made for a king, and if he was not present it could not be sculpted. If the figure decayed over time, it was permissible to sculpt an exact replica.

As a site of the king's life force after death, it was believed that the ''ndop'' supposedly housed the ''nyim's'' double, the counterpart of his soul. It was believed that if anything happened to the king, it would be reflected in the ''ndop''. For example, if a king were to be wounded in battle, a similar wound would appear on the ''ndop'' sculpture.&lt;ref name="Vansina 1972" /&gt; The statue was kept in the women's quarters, and when a woman of the harem was about to give birth, it was placed near her to insure a safe delivery. In the absence of the king it served as a surrogate, which women of the court would anoint and stroke. After his death, the ndop was removed to a storage room and taken out to be exhibited only on certain occasions.&lt;ref name="Vansina 1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vansina|first=J.|title=African Art and Leadership|year=1972|publisher=Madison|location=Madison|authorlink=Ndop: Royal Statues among the Kuba|editor=D.

'''Opus tessellatum''' is the Latin name for the normal technique of Greek and Roman [[mosaic]], made from [[tesserae]] that are larger than about 4 mm.  It is distinguished from the finer ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' which used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimetres or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. ''Opus tessellatum'' was used for larger areas and laid down at the final site. The two techniques were often combined, with small panels of ''opus vermiculatum''  called ''emblemata'' at the centre of a larger design in ''opus tessellatum''.  The tiny ''tesserae'' of ''opus vermiculatum'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116-119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style of ''opus tessellatum'' using only black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121-123}}

Opus tessellatum is usually used for backgrounds consisting of horizontally or vertically arranged lines  — but not both in a grid, which would be "[[opus regulatum]]".

'''Roy Henry Vickers''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|OBC}} (born June 1946 in [[Laxgalts'ap|Laxgalts'ap (now known as Greenville)]], [[British Columbia]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[First Nations]] artist.  He owns and operates a gallery in [[Tofino, British Columbia]].

Vickers was born on the [[Nass River]] but raised in [[Kitkatla, British Columbia|Kitkatla]], [[Hazelton, British Columbia]], and [[Victoria (British Columbia)|Victoria]], B.C.  His father was a fisherman who was matrilineally [[Tsimshian]], also with [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Heiltsuk]] ancestry.  His mother was a schoolteacher whose parents had emigrated from [[England]] and who was in the 1940s adopted into the [[Laxsgiik|Eagle clan]] at Kitkatla, B.C. (making Roy also Eagle).  His grandfather was a Kitkatla canoe-carver.  The paintings and works that he has created reflect this mixed heritage as his work has many elements of the traditional art of the First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest, but remains quite distinctive.

Vickers became interested in Northwest Coast art partly under the influence of the anthropologist [[Wilson Duff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=admin |url=http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/2002/12/referendum-ballots-go-out-to-bc-electorate/ |title=Referendum Ballots Go Out to BC Electorate |publisher=Firstnationsdrum.com |date=2002-12-28 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been the official gift of the Province of British Columbia to visiting foreign leaders several times.  In 1987 the original of his painting ''A Meeting of Chiefs'' was the official gift to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and in 1993 artist's proofs of his print ''The Homecoming'' were the Province's gift to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].

Vickers has been the artistic advisor to several events in British Columbia.  In 1994 he was the artistic advisor to the architects and designers of the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]].  For the Games Vickers also created more than 20 [[totem poles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megaphonemagazine.com/_peace_recovery_clarity%3c/ref ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, from 1987 to 1995, Vickers was the artistic advisor for the [[Vancouver International Airport]]'s new terminal. Some of his work is prominently displayed there for travellers to admire.

Once a substance abuser, in 1992 he created VisionQuest, a [[non-profit]] organization designed to help individuals with addictive personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacGregor|first1=Roy|title=The story of the Fraser River: A 'symbol of life' that can also be violent and deadly|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-story-of-the-fraser-river-a-symbol-of-life-that-can-also-be-violent-and-deadly/article31403733/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 July 2017|location=Hope, B.C.|language=en-ca|date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24314">In [[sociology]], '''taste''' is an individual's personal and cultural patterns of choice and preference. Taste is drawing distinctions between things such as [[Fashion|style]]s, [[Etiquette|manners]], [[Final good|consumer goods]], and works of [[art]] and relating to these. Social inquiry of taste is about the human ability to judge what is beautiful, good, and proper.

Social and cultural phenomena concerning taste are closely associated to social relations and dynamics between people. The concept of social taste is therefore rarely separated from its accompanying sociological concepts. An understanding of taste as something that is expressed in actions between people helps to perceive many social phenomena that would otherwise be inconceivable.

Aesthetic preferences and attendance to various cultural events are associated with education and social origin. Different socioeconomic groups are likely to have different tastes. Social class is one of the prominent factors structuring taste.

== Aesthetics ==

The concept of [[aesthetics]] has been the interest of philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who understood aesthetics as something pure and searched the essence of beauty, or, ''the ontology of aesthetics''. But it was not before the beginning of the [[cultural sociology]] of early 19th century that the question was problematized in its social context, which took the differences and changes in historical view as an important process of aesthetical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Outwaite &amp; Bottonmore 1996, p 662&lt;/ref&gt; Although Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' (1790) did formulate a [[Aesthetic relativism|non-relativistic]] idea of aesthetical [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], where both personal pleasure and pure beauty coexisted, it was concepts such as [[Social class|class]] taste that began the attempt to find essentially [[Sociology|sociological]] answers to the problem of taste and aesthetics. Metaphysical or spiritual interpretations of common aesthetical values have shifted towards locating social groups that form the contemporary [[art]]istic taste or [[fashion]].

[[File:Immanuel Kant.jpg|right|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also followed the fashion of his contemporaries.]]
In his aesthetic philosophy, Kant denies any standard of a good taste, which would be the taste of the majority or any social group. For Kant, beauty is not a property of any object, but an aesthetic judgement based on a subjective feeling. He claims that a genuine good taste does exist, though it could not be [[empirical]]ly identified. Good taste cannot be found in any standards or generalizations, and the [[Validity (logic)|valid]]ity of a judgement is not the general view of  the majority or some specific social group. Taste is both personal and beyond reasoning, and therefore disputing over matters of taste never reaches any universality. Kant stresses that our preferences, even on generally liked things, do not justify our judgements.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 11, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Every judgement of taste, according to Kant, presumes the existence of a ''[[sensus communis]]'', a consensus of taste. This non-existent consensus is an idea that both enables judgements of taste and is constituted by a somewhat conceptual common spiritual humanity. A judgement does not take for granted that everyone agrees with it, but it proposes the community to share the experience. If the statement would not be addressed to this community, it is not a genuine subjective judgement. Kant's idea of good taste excludes fashion, which can be understood only in its empirical form, and has no connection with the harmony of ideal consensus. There is a proposition of a universal communal voice in judgements of taste, which calls for a shared feeling among the others.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] argued against Kantian view of pure aesthetics, stating that the legitimate taste of the society is the taste of the ruling class. This position also rejects the idea of genuine good taste, as the legitimate taste is merely a class taste. This idea was also proposed by [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], who noted that the upper classes abandon fashions as they are adopted by lower ones.

Fashion in a Kantian sense is an aesthetic phenomenon and source of pleasure. For Kant, the function of fashion was merely a means of social distinction, and he excluded fashion from pure aesthetics because of its content's arbitrary nature. Simmel, following Kantian thought, recognises the usefulness of fashionable objects in its social context. For him, the function lies in the whole fashion pattern, and cannot be attributed to any single object. Fashion, for Simmel, is a tool of individuation, social distinction, and even class distinction, which are neither [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] or aesthetical criteria. Still, both Kant and Simmel agreed that staying out of fashion would be pointless.&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumption ==
[[File:Taste high life.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Taste in High Life'', original painting 1742, [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving 1746]]

Taste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] are closely linked together; taste as a preference of certain types of clothing, food and other [[Commodity|commodities]] directly affects the consumer choices at the market. The causal link between taste and consumption is however more complicated than a direct chain of events in which taste creates demand that, in turn, creates supply. There are many scientific approaches to taste, specifically within the fields of [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

=== Mechanics ===

Definition of consumption in its classical economical context can be summed up in the saying "[[Say's law|supply creates its own demand]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, pp. 154-157&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, consumption is created by and equates itself to production of market goods. This definition, however, is not adequate to accommodate any theory that tries to describe the link between taste and consumption.

A more complex economic model for taste and consumption was proposed by economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He challenged the simple conception of man as plain consumer of his utmost necessities, and suggested that the study of the formation of tastes and consumption patterns was essential for economics. Veblen did not disregard the importance of the demand for an economic system, but rather insisted on rejection of the principle of [[Utilitarism|utility-maximization]].&lt;ref name='Veblen'&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, p 462&lt;/ref&gt; The classical economics conception of supply and demand must be therefore extended to accommodate a type of social interaction that is not immanent in the economics paradigm.

Veblen understood man as a creature with a strong [[instinct]] to [[Imitation|emulate]] others to survive. As social status is in many cases at least partially based on or represented by one's property, men tend to try and match their acquisitions with those who are higher in a [[Social class|social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name='Veblen'/&gt; In terms of taste and modern consumption this means that taste forms in a process of emulation: people emulate each other, which creates certain habits and preferences, which in turn contributes to consumption of certain preferred goods.

Veblen's [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|main argument]] concerned what he called ''leisure class'', and it explicates the mechanism between taste, acquisition and consumption. He took his thesis of taste as an economic factor and merged it with the neoclassical hypothesis of nonsatiety, which states that no man can ever be satisfied with his fortune. Hence, those who can afford luxuries are bound to be in a better social situation than others, because acquisition of luxuries by definition grants a good social status. This creates a demand for certain leisure goods, that are not necessities, but that, because of the current taste of the most well off, become wanted commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund &amp; Hébert 1990, p 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In different periods of time, consumption and its societal functions have varied. In [[Tudor period|14th century England]] consumption had significant political element.&lt;ref name='McCracken'&gt;McCracken 1990&lt;/ref&gt; By creating an expensive luxurious aristocratic taste [[Kingdom of England|the Monarchy]] could legitimize itself in high status, and, according to the mechanism of taste and consumption, by mimicking the taste of the Royal the nobility competed for high social position. The aristocratic scheme of consumption came to an end, when [[industrialization]] made the rotation of commodities faster and prices lower, and the luxuries of the previous times became less and less indicator of social status. As production and consumption of commodities became a scale bigger, people could afford to choose from different commodities. This provided for [[fashion]] to be created in market.&lt;ref name='McCracken'/&gt;

The era of [[mass consumption]] marks yet another new kind of consumption and taste pattern. Beginning from the 18th century, this period can be characterized by increase in consumption and birth of fashion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bragg|25 October 2007 |loc=Taste}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cannot be accurately explained only by social status. More than establishing their class, people acquired goods just to consume [[Hedonism|hedonistically]].&lt;ref&gt;Gronow 1997, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This means, that the consumer is never satisfied, but constantly seeks out novelties and tries to satisfy insatiable urge to consume.

In above taste has been seen as something that presupposes consumption, as something that exists before consumer choices. In other words, taste is seen as an attribute or property of a consumer or a social group. Alternative view critical to the attributative taste suggests that taste doesn't exist in itself as an attribute or a property, but instead is an activity in itself.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hennion 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] conception of taste derives its critical momentum from the fact that individual tastes can not be observed in themselves, but rather that only physical acts can. Building on Hennion, Arsel and Bean &lt;ref&gt;Arsel &amp; Bean 2013&lt;/ref&gt; suggest a practice-theory approach to understanding taste.

=== Critical perspectives ===

Consumption, especially mass consumerism has been criticized from various philosophical, cultural and political directions. Consumption has been described as [[Anti-consumerism|overly conspicuous]] or [[Environmentalism|environmentally untenable]], and also a sign of bad taste.

Many critics have voiced their opinion against the growing influence of [[mass culture]], fearing the decline in global divergence of culture. For example, [[McDonald's]] has been seen as a monument to the cultural imperialism of [[Western world|the West]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[McDonaldization]] is a term used to describe the practice among fast food companies of extending their franchise worldwide, causing smaller ethnic enterprises and food cultures to disappear.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It is claimed that the convenience of getting the same hamburger can reduce consumers interest in traditional culinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western culture of consumerism has been criticized{{according to whom|date=July 2012}} for its uniformity. The critics argue, that while the culture industry promises consumers new experiences and adventures, people in fact are fed the same pattern of swift but temporary fulfillment. Here taste, it is suggested, is used as a means of repression; as something that is given from above, or from the industry of the mass culture, to people who are devoid of contentual and extensive ideologies and of will.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno &amp; Horkheimer 1982, pp. 120–167.&lt;/ref&gt; This critique insists that the popular Western culture does not fill people with aesthetic and cultural satisfaction.

== Social classes ==

Arguably, the question of taste is in many ways related to the underlying [[Social class|social divisions]] of community. There is likely to be variation between groups of different socioeconomic status in preferences for cultural practices and goods, to the extent that it is often possible to identify particular types of class taste.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984"&gt;Bourdieu 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within many theories concerning taste, class dynamics is understood as one of the principal mechanisms structuring taste and the ideas of [[sophistication]] and [[vulgarity]].

=== Imitation and distinction ===

Sociologists suggest that people disclose much about their positions in [[Social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] by how their everyday choices reveal their tastes. That is preference for certain consumer goods, appearances, manners etc. may signal status because it is perceived as part of the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of high-status groups. But, it is further argued, not just that patterns of taste are determined by class structure. because people may also strategically employ distinctions of taste as resources in maintaining and redefining their [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 153, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

When taste is explained on account of its functions for status competition, interpretations are often built on the model of [[Imitation|social emulation]]. It is assumed, firstly, that people desire to distinguish themselves from those with lower status in the [[social hierarchy]] and, secondly, that people will imitate those in higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The German sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918) examined the phenomenon of [[fashion]] - as manifested in rapidly changing patterns of taste. According to Simmel, fashion is a vehicle for strengthening the unity of the social classes and for making them distinct. Members of the [[upper class]]es tend to signal their superiority, and they act as the initiators of new trends. But upper-class taste is soon imitated by the [[middle class]]es. As goods, appearances, manners etc. conceived as high-class status markers become popular enough, they lose their function to differentiate. So the upper classes have to originate yet more stylistic innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular taste of the upper classes has been further analyzed by an economist [[Thorsten Veblen]] (1857–1929). He argues that distancing oneself from hardships of productive [[Manual labour|labour]] has always been the conclusive sign of high social status. Hence, upper-class taste is not defined by things regarded as necessary or useful but by those that are the opposite. To demonstrate non-productivity, members of the so-called [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|leisure class]] waste conspicuously both [[Conspicuous leisure|time]] and [[Conspicuous consumption|goods]]. The lower social stratum try their best to imitate the non-productive lifestyle of the upper classes, even though they do not really have means for catching up.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most widely referenced theories of class-based tastes was coined by the French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002), who asserted that tastes of social classes are structured on basis of assessments concerning possibilities and constraints of [[social action]]. Some choices are not equally possible for everyone. The constraints are not simply because members of different classes have varying amounts of economic resources at their disposal. Bourdieu argued that there are also significant non-economic resources and their distribution effects [[social stratification]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]]. One such resource is [[cultural capital]], which is acquired mainly through education and social origin. It consists of accumulated knowledge and competence for making cultural distinctions. To possess cultural capital is a potential advantage for social action, providing access to education credentials, occupations and social affiliation.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

By assessing relationships between consumption patterns and the distribution of economic and cultural capital, Bourdieu identified distinct class tastes within French society of the 1960s. Upper-class taste is characterized by refined and subtle distinctions, and it places intrinsic value on aesthetic experience. This particular kind of taste was appreciated as the [[Legitimation|legitimate]] basis for "good taste" in French society, acknowledged by the other classes as well. Consequently, members of the middle classes appeared to practice "cultural goodwill" in emulating the high-class manners and lifestyles. The taste of the middle classes is not defined as much by authentic appreciation for aesthetics as by a desire to compete in social status. In contrast, the popular taste of the working classes is defined by an imperative for "choosing the necessary". Not much importance is placed on aesthetics. This may be because of actual material deprivation excluding anything but the necessary but, also, because of a [[Habit (psychology)|habit]], formed by collective class experiences.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 159–163&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of class-based theories ===

Theories of taste which build on the ideas of status competition and social emulation have been criticized from various standpoints. Firstly, it has been suggested that it is not reasonable to trace all social action back to status competition. That is while marking and claiming status are strong incentives, people also have other motivations as well. Secondly, it has been argued that it not plausible to assume that tastes and lifestyles are always [[Trickle-down effect|diffusing downwards]] from the upper classes. and that in some situations the diffusion of tastes may move in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;Slater 1997, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the association between social class and taste is no longer quite as strong as it used to be. For instance, theorists of the [[Frankfurt School]] have claimed that the diffusion of [[Popular culture|mass cultural products]] has obscured class differences in capitalist societies. That is that products consumed passively by members of different social classes are virtually all the same, with only superficial differences regarding to brand and genre. Other criticism has concentrated on the declassifying effects of [[Postmodernity|postmodern culture]]; that consumer tastes are now less influenced by traditional social structures, and they engage in play with free-floating signifiers to perpetually redefine themselves with whatever they find pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Holt 1998, p. 21"&gt;Holt 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt 1998, p. 21"/&gt;

== Bad taste ==

"Bad taste" (also poor taste or vulgarity) is generally a title given to any object or idea that does not fall within a person's idea of the normal social standards of the time or area. Varying from society to society and from time to time, bad taste is generally thought of as a negative thing, but also changes with each individual.&lt;ref&gt;
Theodore A. Gracyk, "Having Bad Taste", ''The British Journal of Aesthetics, Volume 30'', Issue 2, 1 April 1990, Pages 117–131, https://doi.org/10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.2.117
Published: 01 April 1990. [https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/30/2/117/227988?redirectedFrom=PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary view is that "a good deal of dramatic verse written during the [[Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods is in poor taste because it is bombast" or high-sounding language with little meaning.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, "Vulgarity''. Dictionary of Literary Terms&lt; and Literary Theory'' (1977),Penguin, 1998, p.976.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Center for Art in Wood''' is an American educational [[wood art]] institution located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was officially established as a nonprofit in 1986 by brothers Albert and Alan LeCoff, following a series of international symposium from 1976-1986 presented by the LeCoff's with woodturner Palmer Sharpless.  The organization operated as the Wood Turning Center until 2011, when the nonprofit moved to its current location in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City District of Philadelphia]] and changed its name to The Center for Art in Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/10/garden/philadelphia-design.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Four Square Blocks: Philadelphia|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Center presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art work in the medium of wood, a permanent collection of over 1,000 pieces and a host of educational programs and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmagazine.com/big-philadelphia/38|work=Big Magazine|title=The Center for Art in Wood|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center also houses a research library, artists files, and a museum store.  A series of publications documents the Center's work and highlights premier artists working in the field of [[wood turning]] and art in wood.

The '''Theatre Royal''' is a restored [[Regency architecture|Regency]] [[theatre]] in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. The building is one of eight [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade I listed]] theatres in the United Kingdom, and is the only working theatre operated under the auspices of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is considered to be one of the most perfect examples of Regency theatres in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, J. (1970). ''The Shell Guide to England''. London: Michael Joseph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre presents a diverse programme of drama, music and stand up. It regularly produces its own work which tours nationally, most recently Torben Bett's Invincible in the summer of 2016. In early 2017 the Theatre Royal will produce an adaptation of Jane Austen's ''Northanger Abbey'', which will tour nationally. 

The Theatre Royal is currently a member of the pioneering Black Theatre Live partnership, a consortium of eight UK theatres committed to effecting change nationally for [[wikt:BAME|BAME]] touring through a three-year programme of national touring, structural support and audience development.

== History ==

The Theatre Royal was opened by its proprietor and architect [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] on 11 October 1819, and was one of the most elegant, sophisticated and up-to-date playhouses of its age. The fact that it has survived, without significant alteration, into our time is a miracle and it is now one of only three buildings to give the experience of theatre-going in pre-Victorian Britain.

Wilkins was an architect of national repute, responsible for, amongst other buildings, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in [[London]] and [[Downing College, Cambridge]]. As the proprietor of the [[Norwich]] circuit, he employed a small company of players to undertake an annual tour of six theatres: [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], [[Ipswich]], [[Theatre Royal, Barnwell, Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Colchester]] and [[King's Lynn]]. Each was open for just one or two short seasons during the year. The Bury theatre opened for the Great Fair in early October to mid-November and was only available for special events at other times of the year. At that time, it would certainly have enjoyed large audiences particularly as the local community would not have been able to travel far for entertainment, until the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.

[[File:Charley - Brandon.jpg|thumb|right|[[W. S. Penley]] as the first [[Charley's Aunt]], Donna Lucia d'Alvadorez, performed at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, in 1892.]] The Norwich comedians were disbanded in 1843 and at Bury there followed more than half a century of economic difficulty and theatrical gloom. This was alleviated briefly in 1892 when the world premiere of ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' was staged at the theatre. The theatre closed in 1903 but it reopened in 1906 when alterations to the building were made by the architect [[Bertie Crewe]].

[[Greene King]], the local [[brewery]], purchased the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]], which it still owns, in 1920. However, in 1925, in the face of overwhelming competition from two new [[Movie theater|cinema]]s, the theatre closed once more. Greene King had struggled to keep the theatre in operation but was now content to use the building as a barrel store. So it remained until the 1960s when a group of local people led by [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Stanley Vincent]] raised over [[pound sterling|£]]37,000 to restore and re-open the Theatre Royal in 1965. The building was vested in the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1975 on a 999-year lease. The Theatre Royal is now managed as an independent working theatre by the Bury St Edmunds Theatre Management Limited.

===2000s restoration===
In September 2005 the Theatre was closed to begin a £5.3million restoration project to restore the building to its original 1819 configuration and decorative scheme. Following an extensive research period, architects Levitt Bernstein, in collaboration with theatre staff and the National Trust, drew up plans to restore the historic building to as close to its original design as possible.

Previous restorations to the building had removed the original Georgian entrances to the pit as well as its distinctive Georgian forestage. The boxes had also been removed from the dress circle and the seating layout changed throughout the building.

The project restored these aspects to recreate a theatre which could provide further insight into the architecture, stage techniques and repertoire of the 18th and 19th centuries, of which little is known in comparison to theatre of other epochs. In addition to the restoration of the building the theatre's artistic team researched and re-discovered many of the lost texts, of the Georgian repertoire.  

Under the banner of "Restoring the Repertoire" the Theatre Royal produced some of plays of the Georgian period in the restored Theatre. On 11 September 2007 the theatre re-opened with a production of the 1829 nautical melodrama, ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', written by [[Douglas Jerrold]].  

In addition to the restoration of the main building a new modern foyer was constructed to the side of the Theatre to provide a restaurant, additional bar and more toilets for the building.

'''''Three of the Players''''' is a [[1953 in art|1953]] painting by Australian artist [[John Brack]]. The painting depicts three [[Australian rules football]]ers from the [[Collingwood Football Club]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Warwick|title=Retrogram pic special: Footy stars as works of art|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/retrogram-pic-special-footy-stars-as-works-of-art/story-fni5f22o-1226878126454|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Herald Sun|publisher=News Limited|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players are thought by some to be [[Lou Richards]], [[Jack Regan]] and [[Phonse Kyne]].

'''''Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice''''', also known as '''''Two Watermills and an Open Sluice''''', '''''Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice''''' is a 1653 painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is in the collection of the [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}}

The painting shows two working undershot water mills, with the major one being half-timbered with a cob-facade construction, tie beams, and vertical plank gable. This is characteristic of the water mills in the [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]] area in Germany, to where Ruisdael had travelled in the early 1650s.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}} This painting is one of six known variations on this theme and the only one that is dated.&lt;ref name="Getty"/&gt;

Although other Western artists had depicted water mills before, Ruisdael was the first to make it the focal subject in a painting.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=54}} [[Meindert Hobbema]], Ruisdael's pupil, started working on the water mills subject in the 1660s. Today Hobbema is more strongly associated with water mills than his teacher.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=130}}

The painting is known by various names. The painting is called ''Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice'' in [[Seymour Slive]]'s 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael, catalogue number 119.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=130}}  In his 2011 book on Ruisdael's mills and water mills Slive calls it ''Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice''.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}} The Getty Museum calls it ''Two Watermills and an Open Sluice''  on their website, object number 82.PA.18.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Watermills and an Open Sluice|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/699/jacob-van-ruisdael-two-watermills-and-an-open-sluice-dutch-1653/|publisher=[[Getty Museum]]|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zeami.png|thumb|A wooden statue of Zeami]]
{{Nihongo|'''Zeami Motokiyo'''|世阿弥 元清}} (c. 1363&amp;nbsp;– c. 1443), also called {{Nihongo|'''Kanze Motokiyo'''|観世 元清}}, was a Japanese [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]], actor, and playwright. His father, [[Kan'ami]], introduced him to [[Noh]] theater performance at a young age, and found that he was a skilled actor. Kan'ami was also skilled in acting and formed a family theater ensemble. As it grew in popularity, Zeami had the opportunity to perform in front of the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Shōgun]], [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]]. The Shōgun was impressed by the young actor and began to compose a friendship with him. Zeami was introduced to Yoshimitsu's court and was provided with an education in classical literature and philosophy while continuing to act. In 1374, Zeami received patronage and made acting his career. After the death of his father in 1385, he led the family troupe, a role in which he found greater success.

Zeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing, and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions. He incorporated numerous themes of [[Zen]] Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen. The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown, but is likely to be between 30 and 50. He wrote many treatises about Noh, discussing the philosophy of performance. These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature, but did not see popular circulation until the 20th-century.

After the death of Yoshimitsu, his successor [[Ashikaga Yoshimochi]] was less favorable to Zeami's drama. Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. [[Ashikaga Yoshinori]] became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429. Yoshinori held Zeami's nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami's refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. After Yoshinori's death in 1441, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443.

==Early life==
Zeami was born in 1363&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; in [[Nagoya]]&lt;ref name=h96p15/&gt; and was known as Kiyomota as a child.&lt;ref name=h96p14&gt;Hare 1996, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the daughter of a priest and a Fief Lord.&lt;ref name=h96p15&gt;Hare 1996, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; His father Kanami led a theater troupe&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; which primarily performed in the [[Kyoto]] region,&lt;ref name=h96p12&gt;Hare 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming popular in the late 1360s and early 1370s. As they became better-known, Kanami's troupe began to perform in Daijogi.&lt;ref name=h96p16/&gt; Zeami acted in the troupe and was considered attractive and highly skilled.&lt;ref name=h96p18&gt;Hare 1996, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebina no Naami, an adviser of the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, booked the troupe to perform for the Shōgun, who was then 17 years old.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; The shōgun was very powerful politically and was a patron of the arts.&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; He was impressed by the troupe, and patronized Kanami. The troupe began to focus on the entertainment value of performance, rather than its religious significance. It had been a form of entertainment associated with the country, but with Yoshimitsu's support it became associated with the upper class.&lt;ref name=h96p13&gt;Hare 1996, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Shōgun was highly attracted to Zeami, which proved controversial among aristocrats because of Zeami's lower-class background.&lt;ref name=h96p16&gt;Hare 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshimitsu regularly invited Kanami and Zeami to the court, and Zeami accompanied him to events.&lt;ref name=w43&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his connection with the Shōgun, Zeami was provided with a classical education by court statesman and poet Nijo Yoshimoto.&lt;ref name=h96p17&gt;Hare 1996, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Nijo was renowned for his skill as a [[Renga]] and taught Zeami about Literature, Poetry, and Philosophy. This type of education was very unusual for an actor: due to their lower-class backgrounds, actors received little education.&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt;

==Career==
Zeami received patronage in 1374, which was then an uncommon honor for an actor.&lt;ref name=h96p17/&gt; Patronage allowed him to become a vocational artist&lt;ref name=h96p11&gt;Hare 1996, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and he began to lead the troupe after his father's death in 1385. The troupe became successful during his tenure as a leader.&lt;ref name=h96p21&gt;Hare 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; While leading the troupe, he wrote the first Japanese treatises on pragmatic aesthetics.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt;

Zeami adhered to a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] writing process: he began with a topic, determined the structure, and finished by writing the lyrics. The number of plays that he wrote is uncertain, but numbers at least 30. His intellectual interests were eclectic&lt;ref name=h96p11/&gt; and he was a proficient writer of Renga.&lt;ref name=h96p19&gt;Hare 1996, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' was the source of several of his best known plays.&lt;ref name=w153&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; He integrated Japanese and Chinese ancient poetry into his drama.&lt;ref name=w18&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary dramatists Doami and Zoami had a significant influence on him,&lt;ref name=h96p30/&gt; earning recognition in his treatises. He spoke particularly well of Zoami,&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; but his shift toward Yugen and away from Monomane may have been because of Doami's influence.&lt;ref name=h96p31&gt;Hare 1996, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He mixed popular dance, drama, and music with classical poetics and thus broadened and popularized the classical tradition.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; In his earlier work, he used Zen illustrations, creating new Zen words and using established Zen words out of context. Many of the themes he used are present in other schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; Japan was dominated by a focus on Zen culture then, and he was registered at a Zen temple&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; and was a friend of a well-known Zen priest.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; In 1422, he became a lay monk.&lt;ref name=w45&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important performances of Zeami's career occurred in 1394. At that time, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu visited the [[Kasuga-taisha|Kasuga shrine]] in [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] and Zeami performed during the visit.&lt;ref name=h96p22&gt;Hare 1996, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significant political event, so Zeami was likely a well known artist then. He gave two significant performances for the Shōgun in 1399,&lt;ref name=h96p23&gt;Hare 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; one of which could have been attended by [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]].&lt;ref name=h96p25&gt;Hare 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeami found Yoshimitsu to be a difficult patron,&lt;ref name=h96p25/&gt; and was rivaled by Inuo, a [[Sarugaku]] actor, for the favor of the Shōgun.&lt;ref name=h96p26/&gt; Though Yoshimitsu died in 1408,&lt;ref name=h96p26&gt;Hare 1996, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and new Shōgun, Yoshimochi, was indifferent to Zeami&lt;ref name=rxix&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; and preferred the [[dengaku]] work of Zoami,&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; Zeami's career remained strong&lt;ref name=h96p28/&gt; due to his connections with the urban commercial class. Due to his status as a well respected public figure, he had access to a number of patrons.&lt;ref name=h96p28&gt;Hare 1996, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually reached the stature of a celebrity&lt;ref name=rxviii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a significant amount between 1418 and 1428.&lt;ref name=h96p28/&gt;

==Plays==
Authorship of noh plays is a complex issue and often a matter of debate. Many plays have been attributed to Zeami, and he was known to be involved in revising and transmitting many others. But some plays are decisively known to have been written by him. The following are universally attributed to Zeami:&lt;ref name=Tyler92&gt;Tyler 1992, plays introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

* Akoya no Matsu, currently not in the noh repertoire
* [[Atsumori (play)|Atsumori]]
* Hanjo
* [[Izutsu]], probably written in the late 1420s or early 1430s
* Kinuta, probably written in the early 1430s
* [[Matsukaze]], using a section by [[Kan'ami]]
* Saigyo Zakura
* [[Sekidera Komachi]]
* Tadanori
* [[Takasago (play)|Takasago]]
* [[Yamanba (Noh play)|Yamamba]]
* Yashima

==Treatises==
Zeami produced 21 critical writings over a period of roughly four decades.&lt;ref name=q1/&gt; His treatises discuss the principles of Noh. He sought to inform his colleagues of the most important aspects of theater, discussing character acting, music, and physical movement.&lt;ref name=rxvii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; They also discussed broader themes, such as how life should be lived.&lt;ref name=w15&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The treatises were intended for a small circle of his colleagues, since the troupes were hereditary and such information was traditionally passed down between generations. He desired to facilitate this process&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; to ensure continued patronage for the troupe.&lt;ref name=rxx/&gt;

===Fūshikaden===
Zeami wrote several treatises on drama, the first of which was the {{Nihongo||風姿花伝|Fūshikaden|"The Transmission of the Flower Through (a Mastery of) the Forms", more loosely "Style and the Flower"}}, known colloquially as {{Nihongo||花伝書|Kadensho|"The Book of Transmission of the Flower"}}. It is the first known treatise on drama in Japan;&lt;ref name=h96p23/&gt; though similar treatises were written by Japanese Buddhist sects and poets, this is the Noh treatise. [[J. Thomas Rimer]] suggests that Zeami's education in Renga poetry provided him with the idea.&lt;ref name=rxx&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; It notably includes a thorough analysis of [[jo-ha-kyū]], which Zeami viewed as a universal concept. His first treatise includes much of his father's views of Noh.&lt;ref name=h96p23/&gt;

===Kakyo===
The treatise ''Kakyo'' was written later and describes Zeami's personal views. Though ''Fushikaden'' discusses flowers at length, ''Kakyo'' deals with spiritual beauty and contains discourses on the voice of the actor and the actors' minds.&lt;ref name=h96p30&gt;Hare 1996, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A possible interest in Zen has been credited with this shift by some scholars.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; The change in his age between his first and last works also appears to have significantly affected his perspective.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; He spent a significant amount of time writing ''Kakyo'' and gave the completed work to his son Motomasa,&lt;ref name=h96p29&gt;Hare 1996, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Zeami's son Motoyoshi had previously transcribed Zeami's treatise ''Reflections on Art''.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt;

==Decline==
After Ashikaga Yoshinori became the Shōgun, he demonstrated a deeper disdain for Zeami than his predecessors had,&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; though the origins of his feelings are unknown. Speculation has centered on Zeami's association with Masashige&lt;ref name=h96p32&gt;Hare 1996, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory that Zeami was a restorationist.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; In 1967, the Kanze-Fukudu genealogy was found and gave credence to the idea that politics contributed to Yoshinori's treatment of Zeami. The genealogy showed that a brother of Zeami's mother was a supporter of the southern court against the Ashikaga Shogunate.&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; Yoshinori is sometimes seen as eccentric, and it has been speculated that he punished Zeami because he did not enjoy his performances. (Yoshinori preferred colorful plays&lt;ref name=h96p33&gt;Hare 1996, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; that involved actor portraying demons; these types of plays were seldom found in Zeami's repertoire.)&lt;ref name=h96p35&gt;Hare 1996, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshinori, who enjoyed Monomane, preferred Onnami,&lt;ref name=h96p33/&gt; as his performances included demons.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami had been close with his Onnami and they had performed together.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami had been unsure whether any of his sons would be able to lead the troupe after his death, so he paid special attention to Onnami's development.&lt;ref name=w46&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Motomasa, however, began to lead the troupe in 1429.&lt;ref name=w46/&gt; That year, though Motomasa and Onnami each performed for Yoshinori during a 10-day festival&lt;ref name=h96p345&gt;Hare 1996, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshinori forbade Zeami to appear at the [[Sentō Imperial Palace]],&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; possibly due to his refusal to provide Onnami with his complete writings.&lt;ref name=w46/&gt; The next year, the music directorship of the Kiyotaki shrine was transferred from Motomasa to Onnami.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; That year Zeami's son Motoyoshi retired from acting to serve as a Buddhist priest.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; That same year Motomasa died; it has been speculated that he was murdered.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; Though he had lost political favor, Zeami continued to write prolifically.&lt;ref name=h96p36/&gt;

Onnami inherited the leadership of Zeami's Kanze school.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; The appointment was made by the Shogunate, although the troupes were traditionally hereditary.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; Zeami initially opposed Onnami's leadership of the troupe, but he eventually acquiesced.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami believed that his line had died with Motomasa, but Onnami felt that he continued the line.&lt;ref name=h96p36/&gt; Zeami gave his completed works to [[Konparu Zenchiku]], rather than to Onnami.&lt;ref name=h96p36&gt;Hare 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sado Island==
In 1434, Zeami was exiled to Sado Island.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; He completed his last recorded work two years later, providing a detailed first-person account of his exile.&lt;ref name=h96p37&gt;Hare 1996, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the account he conveys a stoic attitude toward his misfortunes.&lt;ref name=w47&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the end of his life, but it was traditionally believed that he was pardoned and return to the mainland before his death.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; Zeami died in 1443 and was buried in Yamato. His wife died a short time later.&lt;ref name=h96p38&gt;Hare 1996, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Zeami is known as the foremost writer of Noh and the artist who brought it to its classical epitome.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; Scholars attribute roughly 50 plays to him, many of which have been translated into European languages. The contemporary versions of his plays are sometimes simplified. Some of his plays are no longer extant, and roughly 16 exist only in the form of rare manuscripts.&lt;ref name=rxxvii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few extant biographical documents of Zeami, the lack of solid information about his life has led to a significant amount of speculation.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; Some common themes in the speculation are that Zeami could have been a spy, a Ji sect priest, or a Zen master.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt;

Zeami's treatises were not widely available after his death, only the upper-class warriors were able to gain access to them. In 1908, several of the treatises were discovered at a used-book store in Japan. They gained wider circulation after this discovery but a complete set was not published until 1940.&lt;ref name=w49&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Zeami's plays have been continually performed in Japan since they were first written.&lt;ref name=q1&gt;Quinn 2005, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Émilie Desjeux''' (born 9 October 1861 in [[Joigny]]; died 23 April 1957 in [[Paris]])  was a [[France|French]] painter.

== Life ==
Emilie Desjeux was born in France, in the city of  Joigny on 9 October 1861. When Emilie was little, she moved with her family to Paris, where she started to draw in earnest. Then Emilie Desjeux was admitted to the "[[Académie Julian]]", where she became a student of  [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]],&lt;ref name="gallica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6557465p/f7.image.r=Desjeux.langEN |title=Explication des ouvrages de peinture et dessins, sculpture, architecture et gravure des artistes vivans... &amp;#124; Salon des artistes français de 1888. BNF |publisher=gallica.bnf.fr|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who greatly appreciated her artistic abilities and named Emilie his best student.

After graduation from "Académie Julian", Desjeux was able to feature her paintings at the «Society of the French artists»'s exhibitions and salons. In 1900 she had participated in the"[[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]" of Paris. She was decorated with the rank of Officier d'Academie. At the turn of the century Emilie Desjeux took part in the organization «Society of women-artists» and opened in [[Paris]] a painting school annex studio for girls in the Rue du Bac, and later moved to Rue Visconti.&lt;ref&gt;L'art: revue mensuelle illustrée... - Volume 61 - Page 38
 1902 ... l'aquarelle comme nous venons de le voir; le pastel par MM"'" Henry Adam, Fanny Fleury, Vignal-Vingal, Frédérique Vallot-Bisson, Mesdemoiselles Carpentier, Émilie Desjeux; la miniature par Mm" Debillemont-Chardon et Camille lsbert, ..&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilie Desjeux traveled across Europe, visiting [[England]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]] — and recorded her visits in various albums with sketches and her traveling records. Desjeux was an adherent of realist (or academic) painting. Other directions in the arts failed to influence her.

In 1906 Emilie Desjeux received a commission from the city council of [[Auxerre]]: to depict an historical event, the oration of [[Émile Combes]] on the division between church and state. For that time, it was unprecedented that this task was assigned to a woman. In 1908 the picture «Speech of Émile Combes» (125 x 256&amp;nbsp;cm), was unveiled in the city museum of Auxerre. It now decorates the city of Auxerre's administration boardroom.

At present works of Emilie Desjeux are stored at the city of Auxerre's museum depot, are exhibited at the Musée-Abbaye Saint-Germain&lt;ref name="musees-bourgogne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musees-bourgogne.org/les_musees/musee_bourgogne_resultat.php?id=27&amp;theme=archeologie%20Auxerre,%20Mus%C3%A9e-Abbaye%20Saint-Germain |title=Mus&amp;eacute;es de Bourgogne &amp;#124; Auxerre, Musée-Abbaye Saint-Germain|publisher=musees-bourgogne.org|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found in private collections.

The life of Emilie Desjeux came to an end on 23 April 1957. She rests at the cemetery of [[Bussy-en-Othe]], Burgundy.
