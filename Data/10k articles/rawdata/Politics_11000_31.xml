[[File:Bülent Ecevit-Davos 2000.jpg|thumb|200px|Bülent Ecevit]]
The '''56th government of Turkey''' (11 January 1999 – 28 May 1999) was a minority government led by [[Bülent Ecevit]] of [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party (DSP)]].
 
==Background ==
The [[Turkish general election, 1995|election results of 1995]] necessitated a series of coalition governments, all of which were unstable. Finally, Bülent Ecevit, the leader of DSP, was asked to form a minority government to serve as a caretaker government until new elections. Although DSP was the fourth party measured by seats, the others promised to support his government without formally participating in it.

{{Business administration}}
An '''advisory board''' is a body that provides non-binding strategic advice to the [[management]] of a [[corporation]], organization, or foundation. The informal nature of an advisory board gives greater flexibility in structure and management compared to the board of directors. Unlike the [[board of directors]], the advisory board does not have authority to vote on corporate matters or bear legal [[fiduciary]] responsibilities. Many new or small businesses choose to have advisory boards in order to benefit from the knowledge of others, without the expense or formality of the board of directors.

==Function==
The function of an advisory board is to offer assistance to enterprises with anything from marketing to managing human resources to influencing the direction of regulators. Advisory boards are composed of accomplished experts offering innovative advice and dynamic perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Stautberg S, Green N. Innovation from the Outside-In: How A Design Advisory Board Drives Innovation at P&amp;G [Internet]. 1st ed. 2014 [cited 22 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.partner-com.com/files/Design_Advisory_Board_022607.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting quarterly or biannually, boards can provide strategic direction, guide quality improvement, and assess program effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Marino, D. Rasor-Greenhalgh, S &amp; Hudak, S. (2010). Navigating practice and academic change in  collaborative partnership with a community advisory board. Journal of Allied Health, 39(3), 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs, especially from startup companies or small business may not want to dilute their control of their business by establishing a board of directors with formal responsibilities and authorities. Thus, an advisory board may be a more suitable solution to entrepreneurs who want access to high-quality advice and network in the industry. Advisory board, as an external group, could also provide non-biased information and advice to entrepreneurs.

Advisory boards can be implemented in various different areas, including science, medicine, technology, [[Editorial board|editorial policy]], citizen participation, and other topics.

===Roles and responsibilities of advisory board members===
*developing an understanding of the business, market and industry trends
*provide “wise counsel” on issues raised by owners/directors or management
*provide unbiased insights and ideas from a third point-of-view (not involved in the operation of the business)
*encourage and support the exploration of new business ideas
*act as a resource for executives
*provide social networking platform for directors and the company
*encourage the development of a governance framework that  enable sustainable growth of the company
*monitor business performance
*impose challenges to directors and management that could improve the business

Available from: http://www.companydirectors.com.au/~/media/Resources/Director%20Resource%20Centre/Directorship%20in%20your%20organistation/00660_SME_FY_The_Benefits_of_an_Advisory%20Board_web.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for creating an advisory board==
The main reason to create an advisory board is to seek expertise outside of the company. Advisory board members should provide the company with knowledge, understanding and strategic thinking of the industry or management of the company.

Companies should seek advisory board members whose qualities complement the existing board of directors and not mask gaps in knowledge or skill in the main board. An advisory board strengthens the existing board, but does not interfere with authorities of the existing board. The former editor of The Economist, also an advisory board member, once said, “They (advisory boards) are there to give focus to or sometimes challenge research and intelligence work being done in the company, thus avoiding [[groupthink]] and giving direction on big picture issues.”.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomley V, Bingham K, Thorning-Lund S, Slattery R. The Role of Advisory Boards - Who, what, why and how? [Internet]. 1st ed. Odgers Berndtson; 2014 [cited 25 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.odgersberndtson.co.uk/fileadmin/uploads/united-kingdom/Documents/K_I/The_Role_of_Advisory_Boards_-_Who__What__Why_and_How..pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating and operating an advisory board==
There are two key questions to be asked when creating and operating an advisory board. The first question is who is trying to achieve what from an advisory board. The second question is how the business of the board should be conducted. The following issues need to be addressed.

===Mandate===
The type of advisory board members should be determined by the nature of what is sought and expected from them by the enterprise. Advisory board members should have distinctive knowledge on different aspects of business such as marketing, product development, sales techniques that are of use to the directors.

A lack of definition in “what is sought from the advisory board” or “what sort of advice is to be sought of” would lead to a disorganized board, which eventually could lead to an advisory board that provide less value per dollar or hour invested than a well-mandated one. Eventually, it could result in a waste of resources and time for the enterprise and the advisory board members.

===Focus===
The advisory board must determine what the focus of the committee is, whether it is a broad focus or a narrow one on a specific product feature. Individuals in an advisory board should share a common goal or similar interests.

===Size===
Size of an advisory board influences the efficiency of delivering ongoing information and effectiveness of organizing board meetings. A large advisory board may result in managerial issues. Therefore, it is recommended that an advisory board begin with the advisory board leader, and grow from a fairly small size to its ultimate number. [[Group dynamics]] suggests the maximum size for an advisory board is eight members, which takes into account of the need for enterprise people and other facilitators at meetings. Some advisory board’s mandate may require more significant representation of a specific and large number of constituencies.

===Meeting organization and frequency===
The functioning of an advisory board is affected significantly by how effectively the group’s activities are organized and directed. A fixed meeting should be held regularly (monthly, annually or other) and advisory board members must be well informed of the purpose and background information of the meeting in order for them to provide valuable advice.

A corollary should be provided to advisory board members, in which it should be of an appropriate length, organized, comprehensible and informative. While it should be concise, it should provide enough details to provide advisory board members a suitable foundation for them to advise on the business. Confidentiality of the information discussed in the meeting shall be considered.

A skilled facilitator, administrator or corporate secretary is required to organize schedules of advisory board meetings and meeting materials. The facilitator or chair of the board should be committed and aware of time management for the meeting. An agenda could improve the organization and time management for the meeting.

===Term of membership===
Advisory board members could be appointed to specific terms i.e. one, two or three years so that it ensures them to actively commit to the company and prevent them to get too comfortable with their positions. Term of membership is also important when it comes to expansion of the board; term of membership ensures that the size of the advisory board remains efficient and manageable.

===Compensation===
Advisory board members serve an enterprise for a range of reasons, from personal loyalty to direct compensation.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits of an advisory board===
The benefits of having an advisory board over board of directors may include the following:
*'''Distance control'''
[[Multinational corporation|Multinational companies]] have local companies running their business in a particular foreign jurisdiction for lower costs e.g. tax, price of raw materials, and organizational benefits. However, giving authority to an outside group of directors in the local company may increase risks and instability of the multinational corporation. Since an advisory board can operate in a different location, with different cultural and business norms, in a different language, multinational companies may choose to have an advisory board instead of a localized board of directors in order to avoid loss of control.

*'''Preparation for board of directors'''
Companies may choose to have an advisory board before they have a board of directors. The development of an effective board of directors requires a group of individuals with good chemistry and has the combination of appropriate skills to propel the business. Having an advisory board allows companies to assess the commitments and capabilities of each individual and observe the chemistry between them before appointing them to a board of directors.

*'''Higher efficiency'''
A large board of directors may grow to an unmanageable size where organizational complexity and communication breakdown may occur, leading to ineffective and inefficient function of the board. A smaller advisory board, without the complexity of authority involved in board of directors, may work more effectively compared to a board of directors that grows in size as the corporation grows.

*'''Formal advice'''
The complexity and speed of enterprises often make it difficult to seek advice on any particular topic. Enterprises may also find building trust in any person or group to provide on-going and meaningful guidance difficult. An advisory board can then provide the degree of consistency, longevity and background knowledge as advisory board members provide reliable advice on particular issues. Advisory board members receive compensation for committing to their positions. This gives incentives to advisory board members to provide quality advice and ensure that a request for assistance is taken formally.

*'''Less pressure on executives'''
Executives can express partially defined or tentative view to an advisory board since advisory board’s sole purpose is to provide advice. This allows them to “test-drive options” before they face the board of directors which demands definitive and assertive business decisions. The board of directors assesses the CEO and establishes his or her compensation. While an advisory board may induce change in the company for the benefits of the company, a board of directors inducing change in the company could suggest a lack of confidence in the senior management team. This imposes great pressure on senior executives and could become a barrier for senior executives to express their issues and seek advice from the board. Thus, an advisory board could be a ‘safe harbor’ for senior executives to seek advice and test business options.

*'''Directoral Input'''
Directors and Assistant Directors are still required to bring any changes to policy or financial matters to the board for direction. No directors or assistant directors are to make any changes without board approval.

*'''Focused input'''
An enterprise may need advice on a particular aspect of its business (such as marketing, product direction, customer service or contact network expansion). While board of directors need to take into account of all aspects and go through a series of administrative proceedings e.g. formal approvals, ratification, an advisory board can focus directly on a particular issue and give advice.

===Drawbacks of an advisory board===
The drawbacks of having an advisory board instead of a board of directors may include the following:
*'''Less compensation'''
An advisory board deals with a more narrow range of issues and meet less often than board of directors. There is less commitment for advisory board members compared to directors in the board. This is reflected in the lower compensation advisory board members receive as compared to those in the board of directors. Nevertheless, the compensation for advisory board members depends on various factors, including return of investments, time, organization and cost.

*'''Fiduciary duty/ liability issues'''
Board of directors is exposed to a variety of legislated liabilities, fiduciary and other duties. Responsibilities include unpaid wages, unpaid taxes, environmental damage, etc. By subjecting directors to such liabilities and fiduciary, directors are forced to make decisions and establish policies in a way that minimizes risks. Whereas, an advisory board is not subjected to fiduciary duties or liabilities and therefore could influence the enterprise by providing risky advice.

'''Alexander Sinton Secondary School''', also known as '''Alexander Sinton High School''', is an [[English-medium education|English-medium school]] in [[Athlone, Cape Town|Athlone]], a suburb of [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The school is located in the [[Cape Flats]], an area designated as non-[[white South African|white]] under the [[Group Areas Act]] during [[apartheid]]. The school was involved in the anti-apartheid student uprisings of the 1970s and 1980s. Staff and students at the school made headlines when they barricaded the police into their school in September 1985.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The following month, three youths were killed near the school by police officers who opened fire on protesters in the [[#Trojan Horse Incident|Trojan Horse Incident]].&lt;ref name=warrenbrown/&gt; It was the first school to be visited by [[Nelson Mandela]] after his release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Sinton High School|url=http://sinton.co.za/|accessdate=20 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003085939/http://sinton.co.za/|archive-date=3 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the school has 1,100 pupils, half boys and half girls.

==1976 uprising==
During the [[Soweto uprising|youth uprising of 1976]] protesting the imposition of the [[Afrikaans]] language as a mandatory medium of instruction in schools, the students at the school and [[Belgravia High School]] nearby in [[Athlone, Cape Town|Athlone]] boycotted classes on 16 August during a period that saw marches, random acts of arson and battles between students and the police.&lt;ref name=youth&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/western-cape-youth-uprising-timeline-1976 Western Cape Student Uprising], SA History online, retrieved 19 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Nabil ("Basil") Swart, a teacher at the school, was arrested after helping a student who had been shot during the protests. Swart was released on bail after being detained for a weekend.&lt;ref name=swart/&gt;

==1985 protests==
[[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|Internal resistance to apartheid]] intensified, and a [[Apartheid#State of emergency|state of emergency]] was declared in parts of the country in 1985. The [[Committee of 81]], a student organisation representing [[coloured]] schools in the [[Western Cape]] which organised student boycotts and protests, held some meetings at the school in 1985.&lt;ref name=swart/&gt; The school effectively stopped teaching from February and was officially closed on 6&amp;nbsp;September when the government ordered more than 400 schools to close as a result of [[civil unrest]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=swart/&gt; Some teachers resigned their positions and others were confused as to their role.

==Other controversies==
In 2012, the then principal Fazil Parker was involved in a dispute with the [[Department of Basic Education]] after he was given late notice that his teachers needed to mark national exams. The teachers considered the request unreasonable and did not comply with it, resulting in Parker being summoned to a disciplinary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/teachers-can-t-cope-with-extra-workload-1.1430599#.U_CvXfldWpA Teachers can’t cope with 'extra workload'], Ilse Fredericks, Nov 2012, IOL online, retrieved 17 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">'''Ananias of Adiabene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ˈ|n|aɪ|ə|s}}; c. 15 BCE &amp;ndash; c. 30 CE) was a [[Jew]]ish [[merchant]] and mendicant [[proselytizer]], probably of [[Hellenistic]] origin, who, in the opening years of the [[common era]], was prominent at the court of [[Abinergaos I]] (Abennerig), king of [[Characene]]. He was instrumental in the [[conversion to Judaism]] of numerous native and foreign inhabitants of [[Charax Spasinu]]. This city, the capital of Characene, was situated at the confluence of the two arms of the [[Tigris]] and was at the time a [[Trade route|great mercantile center]].

Among Ananias' most prominent converts were several women of high position at the court, particularly the princess [[Symacho]], the king's daughter. This princess married [[Izates bar Monobaz]], a young prince who had been sent to Abennerig's court by his parents, [[Monobaz I]] and [[Helena of Adiabene|Helena]], the rulers of [[Adiabene]]. Through his wife, Izates' attention was directed to Ananias, with whom he formed an acquaintance that eventually ripened into a strong attachment. Around the year 18 CE, Ananias won the prince over to the Jewish faith. Moreover, Izates was named as successor to the throne by Monobaz, who, in so doing, passed over his elder sons. Upon his accession (about 22), Izates, in order to show his genuine attachment to the new religion, declared his determination to undergo the rite of [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]]. Helena opposed this, fearing that the adoption of foreign ceremonies might arouse against the young king the indignation of his pagan subjects. Ananias, who had come to Adiabene with Izates, supported Helena's contention, arguing that such a step on the part of the king would endanger the life of his Jewish instructor, and, further, that circumcision was not vital to the fulfilment of the Jewish religion and the worship of God.

Izates seemed convinced by the latter argument, until there came to his court another Jew, Eleazar, who, in contradistinction to Ananias' Hellenic leniency, was a rigorous [[halakha|legalist]] from [[Galilee]]. He persuaded Izates to undergo the rite.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabba xlvi. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ananias and Helena were strongly agitated when Izates disclosed his action, but the trouble they predicted did not immediately ensue. Whether Ananias made further converts in Izates' country is not stated.

In his book, "James the Brother of Jesus," [[Robert Eisenman]] contends that this person is the same as the Biblical [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]] from the book of [[Acts]].

== Origin ==
Antipodean Resistance (AR) first formed on the Iron March website, which was a forum for neo-Nazis. Members of the website formed groups such as [[Atomwaffen Division]] and Antipodean Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Poulter, James|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/437pkd/the-obscure-neo-nazi-forum-linked-to-a-wave-of-terror|title=The Obscure Neo-Nazi Forum Linked to a Wave of Terror|date=13 March 2018|newspaper=[[Vice Media|Vice]]|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jewsdownunder.com/2018/04/18/antipodean-resistance-australias-new-nazis/|title=Antipodean Resistance: Australia’s new Nazis.|last=Nathan|first=Julie|date=18 April 2018|website=jewsdownunder.com|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The membership of the group is reported to be very small. The group is only open to young [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] [[white people]], who are "able to take a hit" for their beliefs. Members assume a [[pseudonym]] in an attempt to remain anonymous. Media outlets have reported that Antipodean Resistance have organised secret radicalisation camps in remote forests.&lt;ref name="sunshinecoastdaily"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/neo-nazi-radicalisation-camp-held-on-sunshine-coas/3220247/|first = Rachel|last = Lang|title = Neo-Nazi radicalisation camp held on Sunshine Coast|newspaper = [[Sunshine Coast Daily]]|date = 5 September 2017|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2018, Antipodean Resistance formed a women's branch, Antipodean Resistance Women's Alliance (ARWA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Activities==
The group has attracted attention for their Nazi-inspired vandalism in major cities in Australia. It has targeted schools in Melbourne with significant ethnic minority populations, placing posters carrying the message "Keep Australia White" along with racial slurs such as "[[Indigenous Australians|abo]]", "[[nigger]]", and "[[chink]]", which were described as "vile and disgusting" by Victorian education minister [[James Merlino]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news|first = Melissa|last = Davey|url = https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/16/white-supremacist-posters-targeting-students-placed-at-melbourne-high-schools|title = White supremacist posters targeting students placed at Melbourne high schools|newspaper = [[Guardian Australia|The Guardian]]|date = 16 August 2017|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group attracted international attention with a campaign of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] posters at universities threatening Chinese students with deportation.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/australia/anti-chinese-posters-melbourne-universities.html|first1 = Isabella|last1 = Kwai|first2 = Xiuzhong|last2 = Xu|title = Anti-Chinese Posters at Melbourne Universities Are Tied to White Supremacists|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 25 July 2017|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]] the group targeted churches, universities and public places with homophobic propaganda linking same-sex marriage and paedophilia.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/white-supremacists-take-credit-for-homophobic-posters-in-melbourne/news-story/84a293f389104228b966491ca43dec06|title = White supremacists take credit for homophobic posters in Melbourne|newspaper = [[The Australian]]|date = 29 August 2017|first = Rebecca|last = Urban|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the group was suspended by [[Twitter]] on 18 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5191173/Twitter-rolls-stricter-rules-abusive-content.html |title=Twitter cracks down on swastikas and 'hateful imagery' and it starts enforcing new rules on abusive content - shuttering accounts run by white nationalist magazines and more |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, it was reported that the group's posters had been seen around [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AllenAtSydney/photos/a.1830441640618463/1906766399652653/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Allen之雪梨手記|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banners have been dropped from bridges over highways by Antipodean Resistance calling for "white revolution".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During April 2018 it was reported that the group's posters had been seen around [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;Sibthrope, Claire (21 April 2018) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-21/canberrans-disheartened-to-find-nazi-posters-in-city-centre/9683768 "Canberrans 'disheartened' to find Neo-Nazi propaganda in city"] ''[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC News (Australia)]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 it was reported in [[Melbourne]] that the group's posters were found on [[Chapel Street, Melbourne|Chapel Street]] mocking Pride Month and calling gay people "a walking disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jones, Jesse|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/victoria-news/nazi-group-plasters-melbourne-street-homophobic-posters/169870|title=Nazi group plasters Melbourne street with 'Happy AIDS Month' posters|newspaper=[[Star Observer]]|access-date=26 June 2018|date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith Douglas (28 June 2018) [https://www.sbs.com.au/news/vic-police-investigate-source-of-far-right-hate-speech-posters "Vic police investigate source of far-right hate speech posters"] ''[[SBS News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorism concerns==
Several counter-terrorism experts have suggested authorities should focus more on far-right extremists such as Antipodean Resistance. [[Anne Aly]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] MP has suggested that the group may turn to terrorism, stating "For a terrorist attack to succeed, it really only takes one person." Dr Aly called for the group to be banned stating "I would like to see some of these groups proscribed ... as terrorist and violent organisations."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-05/neo-nazi-group-antipodean-resistance/8852682|title = Antipodean Resistance Neo-Nazi group trying to sway Australia's same-sex marriage postal vote|work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date = 5 September 2017|first = Danny|last = Tran|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]], the Australian national security organisation, is monitoring the group whom they suggest are "willing to use violence to further their own interests."&lt;ref name="northernstar"&gt;{{cite news|first = Jack|last = Houghton|url = https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/asio-tracking-neo-nazi-group-willing-use-violence/3221072|title = ASIO tracking Neo-Nazi group 'willing to use violence'|work = [[The Northern Star]]|date = 7 September 2017|accessdate = 15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original firm of Appleby was founded by [[Reginald Appleby]] (1865-1948) in Bermuda in 1898.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/business/appleby-the-offshore-law-firm-with-a-record-of-compliance-failures-1.3280860 Appleby, the offshore law firm with a record of compliance failures.] Will Fitzgibbon, ''The Irish Times'', 5 November 2017. Retrieved 8 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Appleby had passed his final law exams in [[England]] in 1887&lt;ref&gt;"The Incorporated Law Society", ''The Times'', 19 November 1887, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been in partnership with [[Reginald Gray (lawyer)|Reginald Gray]] (later Sir) attorney-general of Bermuda, from 1893 to 1897 in Bermuda as Gray &amp; Appleby.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Canada'', Vol. 25. International Press, 1936. p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 Appleby and [[Dudley Spurling]] (later Sir) merged their practices to establish Appleby &amp; Spurling.&lt;ref&gt;''Martindale-Hubbell International Law Directory: Vol. 2: North America, South America, Central America, &amp; the Caribbean''. Martindale-Hubbell, New Providence, 2003. {{ISBN|9781561605897}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} In 1949, that firm merged with William Kempe to become Appleby Spurling Kemp (or Kempe). Dudley Spurling was the senior partner of the merged firm until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U169343 "SPURLING, Hon. Sir (Arthur) Dudley"]. ''Who Was Who'', online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014 . Retrieved 9 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 they merged with [[Cayman Islands]]' law firm Hunter &amp; Hunter and with [[Jersey]] based firm, Bailhache Labesse in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/publication-pdf/site-pdfs/appleby-timeline---april-2016-(2).pdf|format=PDF|title=Our History|website=www.applebyglobal.com|5=|year=2016|accessdate=8 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6uorxKLUQ?url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/publication-pdf/site-pdfs/appleby-timeline---april-2016-(2).pdf|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby announced on 15 June 2008 that it was to merge with [[Isle of Man]] based Dickinson Cruickshank &amp; Co., enabling it to become the largest offshore law firm in the world with 73 partners and 200 lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applebyglobal.com/template/devNewstemplatedetail.asp?ItemID=341&amp;Lang=EN] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, they opened an office in Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/events/events-details/appleby-guernsey-office-opening-reception.aspx|title=Appleby - Appleby Guernsey Office Opening Reception|date=19 March 2012|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319054506/https://www.applebyglobal.com/events/events-details/appleby-guernsey-office-opening-reception.aspx|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, they announced that they would be opening an office in Shanghai. In 2014, Appleby worked with the company [[Apple Inc.]] in a function similar to a general contractor to provide offshore offices on the island of [[Jersey]] in co-operation with the law firm [[Baker McKenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|last=Drucker|first=Jesse|date=6 November 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=6 November 2017|last2=Bowers|first2=Simon|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2016, Appleby operated in partnership with the corporate services provider [[Estera]] until Estera split to become independent.&lt;ref name="ICIJ-20171105" /&gt;

An '''appraiser''' (from Latin ''appretiare'', "to value"), is one who determines the fair market [[Value (economics)|value]] of [[property]], [[real property|real]] or [[personal property|personal]]. In [[England]] the business of an appraiser is usually combined with that of an [[auctioneer]], while the word itself has a similar meaning to that of "valuer."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appraiser|volume=2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In the [[United States]], the most common usage relates to real estate and personal property appraisals, while the term is often used to describe a person specially [[wikt:appointment|appointed]] by a [[judicial]] or quasi-judicial [[authority]] to put a valuation on property, ''e.g.'' on the items of an [[inventory]] of the Tangible Property of an Estate (IRS law) of a deceased person or on land taken for public purposes by the right of [[eminent domain]]. Appraisers of imported goods and boards of general appraisers have extensive functions in administering the customs laws of the United States. Merchant appraisers are sometimes appointed temporarily under the revenue laws to value where there is no resident appraiser without holding the office of appraiser (U.S. Rev. Stats. § 2609).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist)''' was the second '''[[Lang Labor]]''' breakaway party, associated with [[New South Wales]] [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]. It operated from 1940 to 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Grayndler, Edward| title=Treachery to Labor | publication-date=1940|publisher=The Worker Trustees|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/38635403|accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disappearance of the previous Lang Labor group, the [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)]], Lang formed a new party, which contested the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138987903 |title=TUMUT A.L.P. |newspaper=[[The Tumut and Adelong Times|The Tumut and Adelong Times (NSW : 1864 - 1867; 1899 - 1950)]] |location=NSW |date=7 May 1940 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931]], however, he was in a minority in New South Wales, many of his old supporters such as [[Eddie Ward]] remained loyal to [[Australian Labor Party]] leader [[John Curtin]], and Lang candidates polled poorly.

In February 1941, prior to the [[New South Wales state election, 1941|May 1941 state election]], the Non-Communist Labor Party wound up and its members, with the exception of Lang himself, were officially re-admitted to the Australian Labor Party.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web

The party's membership included five federal MPs ([[Jack Beasley]], [[Joe Gander]], [[Dan Mulcahy]], [[Sol Rosevear]] and [[Tom Sheehan (politician)|Tom Sheehan]]) and two senators ([[Stan Amour]] and [[John Armstrong (Australian politician)|John Armstrong]]). Nine state [[Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s and six [[Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council|MLC]]s also joined the group.

The '''Australian Labor Party split of 1916''' occurred following severe disagreement within the [[Australian Labor Party]] over the issue of proposed [[World War I conscription in Australia]]. Labor [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Billy Hughes]] had, by 1916, become an enthusiastic supporter of conscription as a means to boost Australia's contribution to the war effort. On 30 August 1916, he announced plans for a referendum on the issue (the [[Australian plebiscite, 1916]]), and introduced enabling legislation into parliament on 14 September, which passed only with the support of the opposition. Six of Hughes' ministers resigned in protest at the move, and the New South Wales state branch of the Labor Party expelled Hughes. The referendum saw an intense campaign in which Labor figures vehemently advocated on each side of the argument, although the "no" campaign narrowly won on 14 November. In the wake of the referendum defeat, the caucus moved to expel Hughes on 14 November; instead, he and 23 supporters resigned and formed the [[National Labor Party]]. [[Frank Tudor]] was elected leader of the [[rump party]]. Hughes was recommissioned as Prime Minister, heading a minority government supported by the opposition [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]]; the two parties then merged as the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] and won the [[Australian federal election, 1917|1917 federal election]]. The Nationalist Party served as the main conservative party of Australia until 1931, and the split resulted in many early Labor figures ending their careers on the political right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/william_hughes | title=William Hughes | publisher=National Museum of Australia | work=Prime Ministers of Australia | accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The split had different impacts in different states. In [[Queensland]] there was no significant split at all, with the [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|state Labor Party]] having experienced the loss of many early members a decade earlier when [[William Kidston]] led [[Kidstonites|a breakaway group]] out in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Wanka |first=K.J. |editor1-last=Murphy |editor1-first=Denis Joseph |editor2-last=Joyce |editor2-first=Roger Bilbrough |editor3-last=Hughes |editor3-first=Colin A. |encyclopedia=Prelude to Power: The Rise of the Labour Party in Queensland 1885-1915 |title=William Kidston - The Dilemma of the Powerful Leader |date=1970 |publisher=Jacaranda Press |isbn=9780701603120 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] [[T.

{{Objectivist movement}}
The '''Ayn Rand Institute: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism''', commonly known as the '''Ayn Rand Institute''' ('''ARI'''), is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit [[think tank]] in [[Irvine, California]] that promotes [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], the philosophy developed by [[Ayn Rand]]. Its stated goal is to "spearhead a cultural renaissance that will reverse the anti-reason, anti-individualism, anti-freedom, anti-capitalist trends in today's culture".&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ari|title=Overview|publisher=Ayn Rand Institute|date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was established in 1985, three years after Rand's death, by [[Ed Snider]] and [[Leonard Peikoff]], Rand's legal heir.

ARI has several educational and outreach programs, which include providing intellectuals for public appearances, supporting Objectivist campus clubs, supplying Rand's writings to schools and professors, assisting [[Ayn Rand Institute#International efforts|overseas Objectivist institutions]], organizing [[Ayn Rand Institute#Objectivist Conferences|annual conferences]] and running the [[Objectivist Academic Center]].&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;

== History ==
During her lifetime, Rand helped establish The Foundation for the New Intellectual to promote Objectivist ideas. The Foundation was dissolved some fifteen years after her death, having been made redundant by ARI. Although Rand objected to Objectivism becoming an organized movement, she supported like-minded individuals working toward a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ayn |last=Rand |title=A Statement of Policy (Part I) |journal=[[The Objectivist]] |date=June 1968 |volume=7 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff, her legal heir, was convinced to start the organization after businessman Ed Snider organized a meeting of possible financial supporters in New York in the fall of 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand Explained: From Tyranny to Tea Party |first=Ronald E. |last=Merrill |location=Chicago |publisher=Open Court |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-8126-9798-8 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff also agreed to be the first chairman of the organization's board of directors.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=[[The Objectivist Forum]] |date=December 1984 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a group of Objectivists, including [[George Reisman]], organized the Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics and Politics. The Jefferson School held a two-week-long conference at the [[University of California, San Diego]] later that year, a conference which continued to occur every two years and is the predecessor of ARI's current annual Objectivist Conference.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"/&gt;

ARI began operations on February 1, 1985, three years after Rand's death, in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. The first board of directors included Snider and psychologist Edith Packer. Snider was also one of the founding donors for the organization along with educational entrepreneur Carl Barney.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt; Its first executive director was Michael Berliner, who was previously the chairman of the Department of Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education at [[California State University, Northridge]]. ARI also established a board of governors, which initially included [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Robert Hessen]], [[Edwin Locke]], Arthur Mode, George Reisman, Jay Snider, and Mary Ann Sures, with [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=[[The Objectivist Forum]] |date=February 1985 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Northrup Buechner and George Walsh joined the board of advisors shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report from the Ayn Rand Institute |journal=[[The Objectivist Forum]] |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |date=October 1985 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI's first two projects were aimed at students. One was developing a network of college clubs to study Objectivism. The other was a college scholarship contest for high-school students based on writing an essay about Rand's novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; Later, additional essay contests were added based on ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', ''[[We the Living]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.&lt;ref name="contests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aynrandeducation.com/essay-contests/ |title=Essay Contests |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726101146/http://aynrandeducation.com/essay-contests/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, ARI began publishing ''Impact'', a newsletter for contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=[[The Objectivist Forum]] |date=December 1987 |volume=8 |issue=6 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a philosophical dispute resulted in ARI ending its association with philosopher [[David Kelley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism |last=Kelley |first=David |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2000 |isbn=0-7658-0863-3 |edition=paperback |oclc=44727861 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the board of advisors agreed with Kelley and also left, including George Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Statement |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=November 17, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=3 |first=George |last=Walsh |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley subsequently founded his own competing institute now known as [[The Atlas Society]], which remains critical of ARI's stance on loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/ayn_rand_institute_vs_atlas_society |title=TAS vs. ARI: A Question of Objectivity and Independence |first=William R. |last=Thomas |publisher=The Atlas Society |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ARI launched the Objectivist Graduate Center, which offered both distance-learning and in-person courses.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbWgESQV9Eo&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, Berliner retired as executive director, replaced by [[Yaron Brook]], then an assistant professor of finance at [[Santa Clara University]]. [[Onkar Ghate]] began working for ARI later that year and ARI launched the Objectivist Academic Center.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"/&gt;

In 2002, ARI moved from Marina del Rey to larger offices in Irvine, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayn Rand Institute to Move to Orange County |first=Vivian |last=Letran |date=June 7, 2002 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/07/local/me-rand7 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ARI launched the Anthem Fellowship for the Study of Objectivism, a fellowship that financially supports universities who have Objectivist professors.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"/&gt;

[[Charity Navigator]], which rates charitable and educational organizations to inform potential donors, gives ARI three out of four stars. According to the latest data from Charity Navigator, ARI spends 85.1% of its expenses on programs, 9.5% on fundraising and 5.3% on administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8345 |title=Charity Navigator Rating&amp;nbsp;– The Ayn Rand Institute |publisher=Charity Navigator |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|September 2016}}, ARI's board of directors consists of Brook; Berliner (co-chair); Arline Mann (co-chair), retired attorney, formerly of [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.]]; Carl Barney, CEO of several private colleges; [[Harry Binswanger]], long-time associate of Rand; Peter LePort, a surgeon in private practice; [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/smithta |title=Professor&amp;nbsp;– PhD, Johns Hopkins |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John A.

Peikoff retains a cooperative and influential relationship with ARI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Yaron |last=Brook |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=26109 |title=The Ayn Rand Institute: A Statement from ARI about the Resignation of John McCaskey from Our Board of Directors |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he remarked that he approved of the work ARI has done&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Leonard Peikoff |year=2004 |title=Leonard Peikoff: In His Own Words |medium=DVD |publisher=Northern River Productions |isbn=0-9734653-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 2010 that the executive director "has done a splendid job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peikoff.com/peikoff-vs-an-ari-board-member/ |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |title=Peikoff vs. an ARI Board Member |date=November 5, 2010 |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162420/http://www.peikoff.com/peikoff-vs-an-ari-board-member/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff was a featured speaker at the 2007 and 2010 Objectivist Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistconferences.com |title=Objectivist Conferences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, he demanded a change to ARI's board of directors, resulting in the resignation of John McCaskey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnmccaskey.com/joomla/index.php/resignation |title=My resignation from the Board of Directors of the Ayn Rand Institute and of the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship |first=John P. |last=McCaskey |date=September 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central goal for ARI throughout the 2010s has been to spread Objectivism globally. ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel in 2012, the Ayn Rand Institute Europe in 2015 and the Ayn Rand Center Japan in 2017. Each of these organizations are separate legal entities from the United States-based ARI, but they are all affiliated with ARI.

In January 2017, ARI announced Jim Brown as its CEO, succeeding [[Yaron Brook]] as its operational executive.&lt;ref name="Jim Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/tn-wknd-et-0219-ayn-rand-institute-20170218-story.html |title=Jim Brown, new Ayn Rand Institute CEO: 'Culture and society out there can look pretty irrational. Just look at the last election' |author=Holleran, Scott |website=LATimes.com |accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Tal Tsfany, co-founder of the Ayn Rand Center Israel, took over as the president and CEO of ARI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2018/03/tal-tsfany-next-president-and-ceo-of-the-ayn-rand-institute/ |title=Tal Tsfany: Next President and CEO of the Ayn Rand Institute |author=Biddle, Craig |website=TheObjectiveStandard.com |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
ARI runs a variety of programs, many of which are aimed at students. It sends free books to schools, sponsors student essay contests and campus clubs and offers financial assistance to students applying to graduate school.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contests"/&gt; It also has an online bookstore, offers internships for current and recently graduated college students and provides speakers for public lectures and media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_index |title=Student Clubs |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
ARI organizes a week-long Objectivist Conference (OCON) each summer in a different city throughout the United States. OCON primarily consists of lectures, social events, and professional mentoring. Speakers have included ARI-affiliated Objectivists as well as like-minded intellectuals such as [[Flemming Rose]] and [[Dave Rubin]].

ARI also hosts a three-day Ayn Rand Student Conference (AynRandCon) each fall, which is aimed at college and graduate school students.

=== Objectivist Academic Center ===
The Objectivist Academic Center (OAC) is an educational program that conducts online classes on Objectivism and related fields. Entry to the program requires admission after application, which requires college transcripts and admission essays. OAC does not offer college credits and is rather intended as a supplement to a college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/students/objectivist-academic-center |title=Objectivist Academic Center |website=AynRand.org |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International efforts ==
In recent years, ARI has made a concerted effort to promote Objectivism globally. Institutions affiliated with ARI in countries outside the United States are separate legal entities.

In October 2012, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel (ARCI) to promote Objectivism in [[Israel]] and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Transportation-app-Moovit-wins-Ayn-Rand-inspired-start-up-prize-454343 |title=Ayn Rand-inspired start-up award debuts in Israel, but carries controversy |author=Elis, Niv |website=JPost.com |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current director is Boaz Arad. In 2016, ARCI launched the Atlas Award for the Best Israeli Start-up, presented annually at the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech-Talk-Israels-Fortune-500-companies-496935 |title=Tech Talk: Israel's Fortune 500 companies |author=Shapira, Ariel |website=JPost.com |access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges for the award include Yaron Brook and [[Shlomo Kalish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-spirit-of-ayn-rand-israeli-entrepreneurship-to-get-a-boost/ |title=In spirit of Ayn Rand, Israeli entrepreneurship to get a boost |website=TimesofIsrael.com |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moovit]] was the first recipient of the award in 2016 and Zebra Medical Vision won the award in 2017.&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt;

In April 2015, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Institute Europe to promote Objectivism in Europe.&lt;ref name="ARI Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/philosophy/the-ayn-rand-institute-europe |title=The Ayn Rand Institute Europe |website=AdamSmith.org |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of ARI Europe is Lars Seir Christensen, CEO and co-founder of [[Saxo Bank]].&lt;ref name="ARI Europe"/&gt; In February 2017, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://aynrandjapan.org/english.html | title=About ARCJ | last= | first= | date= | website=Ayn Rand Center Japan | accessdate=July 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ARI has also helped establish Objectivist clubs at schools throughout the world, including in [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Bulgaria]], [[India]] and [[China]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

ARI has also helped guide the independent Spain-based Objetivismo Internacional, which seeks to spread Objectivism in the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://objetivismo.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=Objetivismo.org |accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas promoted ==
ARI promotes Objectivism, the philosophy developed by Ayn Rand. ARI sponsors writers and speakers who apply Objectivism to contemporary issues, including religion, politics and art.&lt;ref name="Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ayn Rand Center: Op-Eds |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=commentary_type_op_eds |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Objectivism advocates [[atheism]], ARI promotes the [[separation of church and state]] and its writers argue that the [[Christian right|religious right]] poses a threat to individual rights.{{cn|date=October 2017}} They have argued against displaying religious symbols such as the [[Ten Commandments]] in government facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=10889 |title=The Ten Commandments vs. America |first=Harry |last=Binswanger |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |date=October 25, 2004 |accessdate=August 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001052536/http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=10889 |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against [[faith-based initiatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=7475 |title=Faith-Based Initiatives Are an Assault on Secular Government |first=Alex |last=Epstein |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |date=February 4, 2003 |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARI intellectuals argue that religion is incompatible with American ideals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5360 |title=Religion vs. America |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |date=November 11, 2002 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009}} Reprint of a speech delivered by Peikoff at the Ford Hall Forum in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and opposes the teaching of "[[intelligent design]]" in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?news_iv_ctrl=-1&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=11555 |title="Intelligent Design" Is about Religion versus Reason |first=Keith |last=Lockitch |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |date=December 11, 2005 |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI is strongly supportive of [[free speech]] and opposes all forms of censorship, including laws that ban [[obscenity]] and [[hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/free-speech-conservative-value/ |title=Free Speech Can't Become a "Conservative" Value |author=Driver, Eve |website=HarvardPolitics.com |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/313161-carlie-hebdo-two-years-later-will-america-continue-to-protect |title=Charlie Hebdo two years later: Will America continue to protect free speech? |author=Simpson, Steve |website=TheHill.com |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons controversy]], ARI started a Free Speech Campaign in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/impact_201002.pdf |title=Highlights from the first 25 years |publisher=The Ayn Rand Institute |journal=Impact |date=February 2010 |volume=16 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025257/http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/impact_201002.pdf |archivedate=November 12, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Simpson, director of legal studies at ARI, has argued that [[campaign finance]] is a free speech issue and that laws that limit it are a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Accordingly, Simpson and ARI strongly supports ''[[Citizens United v. FEC|Citizens United]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/campaign/294665-overturning-citizens-united-would-be-a-disaster-for-free-speech |title=Overturning Citizens United would be a disaster for free speech |author=Simpson, Steve |website=TheHill.com |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576329642637361406 |title=Stephen Colbert's Free Speech Problem |author=Simpson, Steve and Sherman, Paul |website=WSJ.com |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI has taken many controversial positions with respect to the [[Muslim world]]. They hold that the motivation for Islamic terrorism comes from their religiosity, not poverty or a reaction to Western policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13279&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1064 |title=The Terrorists' Motivation: Islam |first=Alex |last=Epstein |date=July 26, 2005 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have urged that the United States use overwhelming, retaliatory force to "end states who sponsor terrorism", using whatever means are necessary to end the threat.&lt;ref name="endstates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?news_iv_ctrl=-1&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5207 |title=End States Who Sponsor Terrorism |date=October 2, 2001 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "End States Who Sponsor Terrorism", which was published as a full page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Peikoff wrote: "The choice today is mass death in the United States or mass death in the terrorist nations. Our Commander-In-Chief must decide whether it is his duty to save Americans or the governments who conspire to kill them". Although some at ARI initially supported the invasion of Iraq, it has criticized how the Iraq War was handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13587&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021 |title=What We Owe Our Soldiers |first=Alex |last=Epstein |date=May 28, 2006 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2, 2001, ARI has held that [[Iran]] should be the primary target in the war against "Islamic totalitarianism".&lt;ref name="endstates"/&gt;

ARI is generally supportive of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5171 |title=We Are Either With Israel, Or We Are With the Terrorists |first=Robert |last=Tracinski |date=April 1, 2002 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001052328/http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5171| archivedate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Zionism]], [[Yaron Brook]] writes: "Zionism fused a valid concern&amp;nbsp;– self-preservation amid a storm of hostility&amp;nbsp;– with a toxic premise&amp;nbsp;– ethnically based collectivism and religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184168546756&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |title=You don't fight a tactic |work=Jerusalem Post Online Edition |first=Orit |last=Arfa |date=July 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI is highly critical of [[environmentalism]] and [[animal rights]], arguing that they are destructive to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5200 |title=Man vs. Nature |first=Peter |last=Schwartz |date=April 23, 1999 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_animal_rights |title=Animal 'Rights' and the New Man Haters |first=Edwin |last=Locke |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARI is also highly critical of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[affirmative action]] programs as well as [[multiculturalism]], arguing that they are based on [[racism|racist]] premises that ignore the commonality of a shared humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=7126 |title=Multiculturalism: The New Racism |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_topic_racism_and_diversity |title=Racism and Diversity |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI supports women's [[Abortion-rights movements|right to choose abortion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2406 |title=Supreme Court Should Protect Right to Abortion in Current Partial-Birth Case |first=Glenn |last=Woiceshyn |date=April 24, 2000 |publisher=Capitalism Magazine |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; voluntary [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=10953 |title=A Culture of Living Death |first=Alex |last=Epstein |date=April 1, 2005 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARI denounces [[neoconservatism]] in general. For example, C. Bradley Thompson wrote an article entitled "The Decline and Fall of American Conservatism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2006-fall/decline-fall-american-conservatism.asp |title=The Decline and Fall of American Conservatism |first=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">The '''Chukyo Metropolis proposal'''s (中京都構想 and [[:ja:岐阜愛知新首都構想]]) are proposed transformations of the [[Aichi prefecture]] into a metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/politics/update/1206/TKY201012060358.html 愛知知事選、大村議員が出馬表明　河村市長と連携掲げる] 朝日新聞 - 2010/12/06&lt;/ref&gt;  Aichi's prefectural governor, Mr. Omura, formed [[:ja:中京維新の会]] ''Chukyo Isshin no Kai'' or [[Chukyo Metropolitan Area]] Renewal Association in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASH5L36FHH5LOIPE004.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter plan is an alternate that also incorporates [[Gifu prefecture]] in the Metropolis.

[[File:Government squashing.png|thumb|left|250px|The above figure explains the generic process of Metropolis creation in Japan, a model which has extensive basis in East Asian administrative history.]]
The metropolis would require [[Nagoya]] city to be dissolved and reorganized into wards under metropolitan authority.  The concept has parallels with [[History of Tokyo#Dissolution of Tokyo City|Tokyo]]'s past and [[Osaka Metropolis plan|Osaka's proposed reorganization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">'''Civic application''' is [[application software]] aiming at users' activation to participate in [[public good]] development through this application. In [[Civil society|civil societies]], civic applications are created to enhance [[public good]], [[civic engagement]], and generally [[social capital]].

Civic applications can for example aim at:
* development of engaged citizenship,
* strengthening of local communities,
* growth of democracy,
* supporting entrepreneurship,
* protection of nature and a common living space, etc.

Civic applications are to some extent often [[Social network service|social networking services]], but what distinguishes them is the civic goal, the mission funding its existence.

Interaction between the user and the application is what differentiates civic applications from any IT service (website, portal) speaking about any citizen's topics, where interaction is not necessary and if exists often takes form of commenting under articles.

Civic application can be accessed from a server via an Internet browser (online) or using mobile devices, such as mobile phones or tablets (mobile), less often from user's local drive (offline).

Non-Governmental Organisations and public national institutions are noticing the value of the civic apps and invite people working in Information Technology domain to participate in their development (e.g. in Greater Portland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=civicapps.org for Greater Portland|url=http://civicapps.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open City - Civic apps built with open data|url=http://opencityapps.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris: A selection of civic apps that aid Chicagoans|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-07/business/ct-biz-0707-confidential-civic-apps-sidebar-20130707_1_food-poisoning-health-department-local-government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston, Boulder, Washington D.C, Seattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Cities Get Free Civic Apps Through Code for America|url=http://mashable.com/2010/05/04/code-for-america/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other American cities as part of the Code For America initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code for America Apps and APIs|url=http://codeforamerica.org/apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Very often they are created as part of "hackatons", IT development  competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Apps Competition Handbook|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024484.do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civic applications are part of a greater concept of '''[[Civic technology|civic technologies]]''', which encompass variety of civic applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds of developers use open data to create civic apps|url=http://www.socrata.com/civic-apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with any software tools and platforms, enabling its development or hosting, and the software supporting local and national governments in performing their public functions.

The '''Community Alliance For the Ethical Treatment of Youth''' ('''CAFETY''') is an advocacy group for people enrolled in [[residential treatment]] programs for at-risk teenagers. The group's mission includes advocating for access to [[advocates]], [[due process]], alternatives to [[aversion therapy|aversive behavioral interventions]], and alternatives to [[physical restraint|restraints]] and [[seclusion]] for young people in treatment programs. They have also called for the routine reporting of abuse in residential treatment programs, as well as [[United States Government|federal government]] oversight and [[regulation]] of residential treatment programs.

==History==
CAFETY was founded in 2006 by Charles King and Kathryn Whitehead, with the goal: ''"to create a forum for youth advocacy and support designed to develop and shape youth-guided policies and practices with a specific emphasis on the ethical treatment of youth with behavioral, emotional, and mental health problems in institutional settings"''.&lt;ref name=NCCP1&gt;"Challenges and Opportunities in Children’s Mental Health, A View from Families and Youth"; Sarah Dababnah and Janice L. Cooper; July 2006; Page 26 [http://nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_673.pdf Publication]&lt;/ref&gt; By July of that year, CAFETY had 118 members and 8 core group members from across the United States, including at least one medical professional.&lt;ref name=NCCP1 /&gt;

==Campaigns==
CAFETYs' 'Care, NOT Coercion' Campaign seeks to end institutionalized child abuse and human rights violations in institutional settings. The organization additionally advocates for the regulation of, and the efficacy in treatment in such settings. In pursuit of that objective, CAFETY has chiefly focused its efforts on actively mobilizing its members in public education efforts and supporting and providing testimony in support of legislation aimed at the regulation of [[residential treatment|residential treatment facilities]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=NCCP1 /&gt;

==Public activism and outreach==
From late 2007 through 2008, a broad coalition of [[grass roots]] efforts, prominent [[medical]] and [[psychological]] organizations that included members of CAFETY, provided testimony and support that led to the creation of the ''Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008'' by the [[United States Congress]] [[Committee on Education and Labor]].&lt;ref name=SCARPTA&gt;[http://edlabor.house.gov/issues/residentialprograms.shtml "Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229095326/http://edlabor.house.gov/issues/residentialprograms.shtml |date=December 29, 2008 }} Official bill language from the [[U.S. Congress]].

On February 19, 2009, CAFETY co-sponsored a press briefing on Capitol Hill in an effort to raise awareness of youth maltreatment in residential care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astart.fmhi.usf.edu/AStartDocs/overview-abuse-presentation-021909.pdf "Dr. Friedman - Abuse of Youth in Residential Treatment"] Retrieved July 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafety.org/events/archives-conferences-and-events/725-astartcafety-capitol-hill-briefing-dc-february-19-2009  ASTART/CAFETY Capitol Hill Briefing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425011247/http://www.cafety.org/events/archives-conferences-and-events/725-astartcafety-capitol-hill-briefing-dc-february-19-2009 |date=2010-04-25 }} Retrieved July 06, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2009, the CAFETY sent an unsolicited mass-mailing to 4,000 residents of Delaware County, using a mailing list compiled by "going through the white pages of Delaware County phone books" alerting the residents of abuse allegations at a local Therapeutic Boarding School called The [[Family Foundation School]]. The two page mailing included a page of excerpts from alumni testimony alleging abuse.
The allegations in the letter were dismissed by Jeff Brain, the [[Family Foundation School]]'s vice president for external relations and acting director of admissions by telling a newspaper that "all the allegations are categorically untrue or grossly exaggerated...and determined to be unfounded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breakey |first=Patricia |url=http://www.thedailystar.com/local/local_story_295040039.html |title=The Daily Star, Oneonta, NY - Otsego, Delaware, Chenango and Schoharie County News, Sports and Opinion - Letter alleges abuse at Hancock school |publisher=Thedailystar.com |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911195106/http://www.thedailystar.com/local/local_story_295040039.html |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAFETY and its members also held a teens' rights rally held in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. At the rally, Chris Noroski, vice president of CAFETY, stated that while he was at The Family Foundation School in Hancock, NY, he was mentally and physically abused, stating
"For seven months of the time, I carried buckets of rocks back and forth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910229884/1002?Title=Rally-for-teens-rights-held-at-downtown-plaza |title=Teen rights rally, Bo Diddley Community Plaza, downtown Gainesville|publisher=Gainesville.com |date=October 22, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-23|last=Ford|first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2011 CAFETY was quoted in an article for Time.com called "Increasingly, Internet Activism Helps Shutter Abusive 'Troubled Teen' Boot Camps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/04/05/increasingly-internet-activism-helps-shutter-abusive-troubled-teen-boot-camps/#ixzz1KZAOBn41 |title=Increasingly, Internet Activism Helps Shutter Abusive 'Troubled Teen' Boot Camps|publisher=Time.com |date=April 5, 2011|accessdate=2011-04-25|last=Szalavitz|first=Maia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAFETY, along with the [[American Psychological Association]], Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Therapy, and the [[American Bar Association]] was a major supporter of the bill H.R 911, "Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act," which was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2009 and passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but was not acted upon in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and did not become law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-911  H.R. 911: Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2009] Retrieved May 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3526">In the '''resolution 1481/2006''' of the [[Council of Europe]] [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] (PACE) issued on January 25, 2006 during its winter session, the Council of Europe "strongly condemns crimes of [[totalitarian]] [[communist regime]]s".

It condemned "the massive human rights violations committed by totalitarian communist regimes and expressed sympathy, understanding and recognition for the victims of these crimes". It also said these violations "included individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror.".

The full draft recommendation by rapporteur [[Göran Lindblad]] was issued with great majority by the Political Affairs committee. However, it did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority of the votes cast in the Parliamentary Assembly. The group of communist parties plus [[United Russia]] strongly opposed the resolution. The resolution was supported by the most conservatives including [[EPP/CD]], [[European Democrats|ED]], liberal groups and some social democrats, especially from countries like Hungary, the Czech Republic or the Baltic countries. 

==Final voting results==

153 members were present and voted (out of 317)

99 members voted in favor of the Resolution 1481

42 members voted against the Resolution 1481

12 members abstained from voting.

The '''''Defence of Canada Regulations''''' were a set of [[State of emergency|emergency measures]] implemented under the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' on 3 September 1939, a week before Canada's entry into [[World War II]]. 

The extreme security measures permitted by the  [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] included the waiving of [[habeas corpus]] and the right to trial, internment, bans on certain political and cultural groups, restrictions of free speech including the banning of certain publications, and the confiscation of property.

Section 21 of the Regulations allowed the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] to detain without charge anyone who might act "in any manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the state."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=%22defence+of+canada+regulations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4nolO32onQ&amp;sig=vHTi5PaF54bCRJjjbZL9uSE7juQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7xdaSumAEpC6NZL47EI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 ''Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regulations were used to intern opponents of [[World War II]], particularly fascists (like [[Adrien Arcand]]) and Communists (including [[Jacob Penner]], [[Bruce Magnuson]] and [[Tom McEwen (politician)|Tom McEwen]]) as well as opponents of [[conscription]] such as Quebec nationalist and Montreal mayor [[Camillien Houde]]. It was under the regulations that [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese Canadians were interned and their property confiscated]] for the duration of the war. German Canadians were required to register with the state and some German and Italian Canadians were detained. The Regulations were also used to ban the [[Communist Party of Canada]] in 1940 as well as several of its allied organizations such as the [[Young Communist League of Canada|Young Communist League]], the [[League for Peace and Democracy]], the [[Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association]], the [[Finnish Organization of Canada]], the [[Russian Workers and Farmers Clubs]], the [[Polish Peoples Association]] and the [[Croatian Cultural Association]], the [[Hungarian Workers Clubs]] and the [[Canadian Ukrainian Youth Federation]].  Various fascist groups were also banned such as the [[Canadian National Socialist Unity Party]] and the [[Canadian Union of Fascists]]. Non-communist labour leaders like [[Charles Millard]] were also interned.

A number of prominent Communist Party members were detained until 1942 when the [[Soviet Union]] joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Fascist leaders such as [[Adrien Arcand]] and [[John Ross Taylor]] were detained for the duration of the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29929">'''Developmental state''', or '''hard state''', is a term used by [[international political economy]] scholars to refer to the phenomenon of state-led macroeconomic planning in [[East Asia]] in the late twentieth century. In this model of [[capitalism]] (sometimes referred to as ''state development capitalism''), the state has more independent, or autonomous, political power, as well as more control over the economy. A developmental state is characterized by having strong state intervention, as well as extensive regulation and planning.  The term has subsequently been used to describe countries outside East Asia which satisfy the criteria of a developmental state. [[Botswana]], for example, has warranted the label since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Leftwich, Adrian, "The Developmental State", Working Paper No. 6, University of York,1994&lt;/ref&gt; The developmental state is sometimes contrasted with a predatory state or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Peter. 1995. Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to seriously conceptualize the developmental state was [[Chalmers Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Leftwich, Adrian 1995, pages 400 - 427"&gt;Leftwich, Adrian, "Bringing politics back in: Towards a model of the developmental state", ''Journal of Development Studies'', Volume 31, Issue 3 February 1995, pages 400-427&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson defined the developmental state as a state that is focused on economic development and takes necessary policy measures to accomplish that objective. He argued that Japan's economic development had much to do with far-sighted intervention by bureaucrats, particularly those in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). He wrote in his book ''MITI and the Japanese Miracle'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In states that were late to industrialize, the state itself led the industrialization drive, that is, it took on developmental functions.  These two differing orientations toward private economic activities, the regulatory orientation and the developmental orientation, produced two different kinds of business-government relationships.  The United States is a good example of a state in which the regulatory orientation predominates, whereas Japan is a good example of a state in which the developmental orientation predominates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
A regulatory state governs the economy mainly through regulatory agencies that are empowered to enforce a variety of standards of behavior to protect the public against market failures of various sorts, including monopolistic pricing, predation, and other abuses of market power, and by providing collective goods (such as national defense or public education) that otherwise would be undersupplied by the market.  
In contrast, a developmental state intervenes more directly in the economy through a variety of means to promote the growth of new industries and to reduce the dislocations caused by shifts in investment and profits from old to new industries. In other words, developmental states can pursue [[Industrial policy|industrial policies]], while regulatory states generally can not.

Governments in developmental states invest and mobilize the majority of capital into the most promising industrial sector that will have maximum [[spillover effect]] for the society. Cooperation between state and major industries is crucial for maintaining stable macroeconomy. According to [[Alice Amsden]]'s ''Getting the Price Wrong'', the intervention of state in the market system such as grant of subsidy to improve competitiveness of firm, control of exchange rate, wage level and manipulation of inflation to lowered production cost for industries caused economic growth, that is mostly found in '''late industrializers''' countries but foreign to early developed countries.&lt;ref name="Amsden"/&gt;

As in the case of [[Japan]], there is little government ownership of industry, but the private sector is rigidly guided and restricted by bureaucratic government elites. These bureaucratic government elites are not elected officials and are thus less subject to influence by either the corporate-class or working-class through the political process. The argument from this perspective is that a government ministry can have the freedom to plan the economy and look to long-term national interests without having their economic policies disrupted by either corporate-class or working-class short-term or narrow interests.

==Examples in East and Southeast Asia==
Some of the best prospects for [[economic growth]] in the last few decades have been found in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Leftwich, Adrian 1995, pages 400 - 427"/&gt; [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], and [[Indonesia]]  are developing at high to moderate levels. Thailand, for example, has grown at double-digit rates most years since the early 1980s. China has been the world leader in [[economic growth]] since 2001. It is estimated that it took [[England]] around 60 years to double its economy when the [[Industrial Revolution]] began. It took the [[United States]] around 50 years to double its economy during the American economic take-off in the late nineteenth century. Several East and Southeast Asian countries today have been doubling their economies every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D., and Sheryl WuDunn. 2000. ''Thunder From the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia.'' New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that in most of these Asian countries, it is not just that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are becoming less poor. For example, [[poverty]] has dropped dramatically in Thailand. Research in the 1960s showed that 60 percent of the people in Thailand lived below a poverty level estimated with cost of basic necessities. By 2004, however, similar estimates showed that poverty there was around 13 to 15 percent. Thailand has been shown by some [[World Bank]] figures to have had the best record for reducing poverty per increase in [[GNP]] of any nation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nabi, Ijaz, and Jayasankur Shivakumer. 2001. ''Back from the Brink: Thailand's Response to the 1997 Economic Crisis.'' Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Report. 1999. Human Development Report of Thailand 1999. Bangkok: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=worldbank2000&gt;World Bank. 2000. ''World Development Report 2000/2001.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewed through the lens of [[dependency theory]], developmentalism is about countries such as [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and increasingly [[Vietnam]], where the governments are able and willing to protect their people from the negative consequences of foreign corporate exploitation. They tend to have a strong government, also called a "developmental state" or "hard state" and have leaders who can confront [[multinational corporations|multinationals]] and demand that they operate to protect their people's interests. These "development states" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they may follow domestically mandated standards for pay and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes, and by extension leave some profits within the country.

Specifically, what is meant by a developmental state, is a government with sufficient organization and power to achieve its development goals.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Ha-Joon. 1999. "The Economic Theory of the Developmental State." Pp. 182-199 in Meredith Woo-Cumings (ed.), ''The Developmental State.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cumings, Bruce. 1999. "Webs with No Spiders, Spiders with No Webs: The Genealogy of the Developmental State." Pp. 61-92 in Meredith Woo-Cummings (ed.), ''The Developmental State.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson1982&gt;Johnson, Chalmers. 1982. ''MITI and the Japanese Miracle.'' Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pempel, T.J. 1999. "The Developmental Regime in a Changing World Economy." Pp. 137-181 in Meredith Woo-Cummings (ed.), ''The Developmental State.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornall University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There must be a state with the ability to prove consistent economic guidance and rational and efficient organization, and the power to back up its long-range economic policies. All of this is important because the state must be able to resist external demands from outside [[multinational corporations]] to do things for their short-term gain, overcome internal resistance from strong groups trying to protect short-term narrow interests, and control infighting within the nation pertaining to who will most benefit from development projects.

===Thailand===
In the late 1990s a study was conducted in which the researchers interviewed people from 24 large factories in [[Thailand]] owned by [[Japan]]ese and American corporations. They found that most of the employees in these corporations made more than the average in Thailand, and substantially more than the $4.40 a day [[minimum wage]] in the country at the time. The researchers’ analysis of over 1,000 detailed questionnaires indicated that the employees rate their income and benefits significantly above average compared to Thai-owned factories.   They found the working conditions in all 24 companies far from conditions reported about [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Frank-Jurgen. 2000. ''The Asian Economic Crisis.'' New York: Quorum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One answer to the discrepancies found between multinational corporations in [[Thailand]] and the conditions described for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] workers is that companies such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], or Nike subcontract work to small local factories. These subcontractors remain more invisible, making it more easy to [[bribery|bribe]] local officials to maintain poor working conditions. When multinational corporations set up business in countries like [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], or [[Thailand]], their visibility makes much less likely employees will have [[wages]] and [[working conditions|conditions]] below the standards of living of the country.&lt;ref name="kerbo2006b"&gt;Kerbo, Harold. 2006. World Poverty in the 21st Century. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand is said to fall between the U.S. model where government has little involvement in economic policy, and Japan which has governed with a very heavy hand for more than 100 years.&lt;ref name=muscat1994&gt;Muscat, Robert J. 1994. ''The Fifth Tiger: A Study of Thai Development.'' Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulick, Elliot, and Dick Wilson. 1996. ''Time for Thailand: Profile of a New Success.'' Bangkok: White Lotus Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One focus of Thai development policies was on [[import substitution]]. Here, a development state must be able to tell [[multinational corporations]] that goods will be imported, if at all, with [[tariffs]] as high as 80 to 150 percent to prevent these goods from competing with goods made in (at least at first) less efficient infant factories in the poorer country. Only a development state can have the influence to enforce such a policy on rich multinational corporations (and their governments), and only a development state can have the influence to enforce such a policy against the demands of their own rich citizens who want the imported goods and want them then at a cheaper price, not waiting for infant industries to produce suitable products. Thailand began placing tariffs of 150 percent on important [[automobiles]], but at the same time telling the foreign auto industries that if they came to Thailand to create joint ventures with a Thai company to build cars—and thus hire Thai employees, pay Thai taxes, and keep some profits within Thailand—the auto company would get many forms of government assistance.&lt;ref name="muscat1994"/&gt;

Thailand continued to protect its economy during the 1980s and 1990s despite the flood of foreign investment the nation had attracted. Thai [[bureaucrats]] started rules such as those demanding a sufficient percentage of domestic content in goods [[manufactured]] by foreign companies in Thailand and the 51 percent rule.&lt;ref name="muscat1994"/&gt; Under the 51 percent rule, a multinational corporation starting operations in Thailand must form a joint venture with a Thai company. The result is that a Thai company with 51 percent control is better able to keep [[Employment|jobs]] and [[profit (economics)|profits]] in the country. Countries such as Thailand have been able to keep foreign investors from leaving because the government has maintained more [[infrastructure]] investment to provide good [[transportation]] and a rather educated [[labor force]], enhancing [[productivity]].

===Singapore===
Singapore is a relatively young city-state and it obtains a title of developed country. Despite the fact that it has a lack of natural resources and an intense competition geographical environment, it has been growing its nation in the form of developmental state. In 1965, Singapore successfully became independent from Malaysian Federation, and later it changed its Fordism production oriented city state to a developmental city state in less than half a century (Kwon, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Huck-ju Kwon (2005) Transforming the Developmental Welfare State in East Asia (Palgrage Macmillan) Chapter 4 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

It was claimed by the People's Action Party (PAP), the governing party since 1965 that adopting the developmental state strategy is for Singapore's best interest due to its unique feature of social, political, geographical and economical condition. At first, PAP’s economic strategy was to provide cheap and disciplined labor and it provides a stable political system; Singapore has only one labor union that is directed by the PAP government. As a result, many multinational corporations (MNCs) invested in Singapore and soon Singapore came to be a solid manufacturing base (Sung, 2006).&lt;ref name="Johnny Sung 2006"&gt;Johnny Sung (2006) Explaining the Economic Success of Singapore: The Developmental Worker as the Missing Link (Edward Elgar Publishing Inc.) Chapter 3, 5 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the PAP soon realized that if Singapore was to move forward to industrialization then it needed to improve its national education. In the 1960s, Singapore's education was fragmented basically by race, language and habitat lines (Wilson, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Harold Edmund. Social Engineering in Singapore. Singapore: Univ. Pr., 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a series of education projects were launched in the hope of helping Singapore to obtain industrialization. For example, in 1970, the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) was launched to provide technical education for workers who dropped out of secondary school. (Sung, 2006)&lt;ref name="Johnny Sung 2006"/&gt; Singapore's training programs has a different function from other neoliberal cities; these programs match workers’ skills to the market of economic development.  The economy is planned by the government; it arranges the market demand of labor on one hand and provides the supply of labor on the other hand.

The Singapore government has noticed the country's weakness and its special geographical location. It is because that the population of Singapore was much less than other surrounding countries, so soon its manufacturing status would be replaced by other Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, China, etc. Also, other Asian countries could provide relatively cheaper and greater labor force and more raw materials of production could be exploited. Therefore, Singapore was vulnerable of facing such surrounding threats. However, the Singapore government has adopted a special view of new international division of labor; it has placed itself as a global city in the Southeast Asian region. According to Saskia Sassen's "global cities", they are cities where headquarters which are committed in participating of globalization networks and they are the result of strong integration of urbanization and globalization (Hack, Margolin and Delaye, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Hack and Jean-Louis Margolin (2010) ''Singapore from Temasek to the 21st Century: Reinventing the Global City'' (National University of Singapore) Chapter 1 and 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
South Korea has undergone rapid economic development since the end of the [[Korean War]](1950~1953). Like other "late industrializers" (Amsden, 1989) such as Taiwan, [[Economy of South Korea]] was led by the bureaucratic governmental state that controlled and manipulated the market system.&lt;ref name="Amsden"&gt;Amsden, Alice H. "Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization", Oxford University Press, June 1992, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean government implemented various economic measures in order to pursue export oriented growth. Korea at the early 60s was lacking capital and technological basis, so the only competitive advantage the country had was the low wage.&lt;ref name="Amsden"/&gt; Therefore, Korea first penetrated the global market with cheap labor in the light industry sector such as wigs and cotton spinning in 50s~60s. Korean industrial policy moved towards the heavy and chemical industries in the 70s and 80s, mobilizing the state’s financial resources for the rapid growth of industries such as steel and shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Development Institute (2005), The Korean Economy:History of Economic Development [Powerpoint slides].&lt;/ref&gt;

During those developmental periods, the government granted various forms of subsidies to the industries. Long-term loans and credits were given for higher competence in global market, thereby increasing export. Foreign exchange rates were often manipulated to stimulate export or import the raw materials at lower cost. Due to such subsidies on exports and manipulation by the government, the relative prices in Korean industry diverged from the free market equilibriums. Such interventions by the state are termed as "deliberately getting relative prices wrong"(Amsden, 1989), which means that the prices are intentionally deviated from the ‘right’ prices, the market equilibrium. Big business groups in chosen industries were supported and invested by the government, thereby forming intimate economic and political ties. Such groups grew to account for a large portion of GNP and became the [[Chaebol]]s.&lt;ref name="Amsden"/&gt;

South Korea's GDP per capita grew from $876 in 1950 to $22,151 in 2010. Industrial production in South Korea was 9% in 1953 but reached 38% in 2013. Korea first adopted an ISI but followed a Developmental state growth strategy. Korea after their independence in 1945 lead to end of economic ties with Japan which they were heavily relied upon. During the Korean war, the country was devastated both physically and mentally. After the Korean war, South Korea focused on exporting primary products such as crops, minerals while imported manufactured goods from US. In the beginning of ISI ear, Korean industries were successful in textile and light consumer good industries (Charles, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Frank|year=1975|title=Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development: South Korea: Economic Growth in South Korea since World War II|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c4063.pdf|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea eventually focused on an export oriented industries through direct government involvement. South Korean state has more autonomy over the regulation of economy, the state created conditions favorable for rapid economic growth, for example, the state provided long-term loans for industries with higher competence in global market which eventually increased the exporting sector (Chibber, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chibber|first=Vivek|year=2014|title=The Developmental State in Retrospect and Prospect: Lessons from India and South Korea|url=|journal=Ed. Williams, Michelle. New York: Routledge,|volume=|pages=30-54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Under Park Chung Hee's leadership, South Korea in 1960's created Economic Planning Board (EPB) which unified previously divided industries and created a centralized decision making state.

Korea has been called one of "Asia's four little dragons" or [[Four Asian Tigers]] with its prominent economic growth (The other three being Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;Ezra F. Vogel(1992), The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia, Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; Korea’s GDP per capita in 1980 was $1,778.5, which was only a fraction of Japan’s per capita ($9,307.8). In 2014, Korea’s GDP was $25,977.0, having shown dramatic growth in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, GDP per capita (current US$)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local developmental state==
While the developmental state is associated with East Asia, it has been argued that after 30 years of many negative experiences with the [[Washington Consensus]], similar structures began to appear in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ortíz and Kate Maclean 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5666&amp;title=latin-america-medellin-colombia-microfinance-post-washington-consensus-microcredit-microenterprise-local-development A post-Washington consensus approach to local economic development in Latin America? An example from Medellín, Colombia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918135821/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5666&amp;title=latin-america-medellin-colombia-microfinance-post-washington-consensus-microcredit-microenterprise-local-development |date=September 18, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Latin American" approach is different, however, as it often takes place at a city/municipal level, rather than at a state level and places a great emphasis on tackling social exclusion. One pioneer in this experience has been [[Medellin]], whose experience with a [[Medellin#Local development state|local development state]] has been highly praised by researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Medellin's city administration used its ownership of city's main energy provider Empresas Publicas de Medellín (EPM) and diverted 30% of EPM's profits to fund municipal spending. The spending went partly on a variety of infrastructure projects, such as the city's metro, bus network and a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system connecting the poorer barrio communities to the city centre.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; However, the city also developed a program of cash grants called 'the Medellín Solidaria' programme that are very similar to [[Brazil]]'s highly successful [[Bolsa Familia]] that provide support for poor families. Additionally, the city developed the Cultura E programme that established a network of 14 publicly funded business support centres known as CEDEZO, Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The CEDEZOs are found in the poorest areas of Medellin and support the poor in developing business by providing free-of-charge business support services and technical advice.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Also, as part of Cultura E, there is Banco de las Opportunidades that provides microloans (up to $2,500 at a cheap interest rates 0.91% monthly).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This has helped create more equal opportunities for all and overcome the barriers to entry to business for poor entrepreneurs with good ideas, but lacking capital, skills and connections.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; It has also helped develop the local economy with new micro-enterprises.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; However, several mayoral candidates for the October 2011 elections have argued the Banco de las Opportunidades's [[interest rates]] are too high, loan maturity is too short and it should have [[grace period]]s.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; They therefore suggest a new [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SME) development bank to complement the Banco de las Opportunidades.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Difficulties===
There are difficulties with the local development state model. Despite claims at the end of the 1980s by some, such as Hernando de Soto (1989) that micro-enterprises would lead economic growth, this has not come to pass.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; For instance, in Medellín the [[informal sector]] has seen a huge growth in micro-enterprises, but the impact on poverty and development has been minimal.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Almost none of these microenterprises have evolved into informal small or medium businesses, as the demand does not exist to absorb increased production.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In other words, a successful ice-cream producer producing 30 ice-creams per day at home may sell all their product and make a livelihood out of it, but transforming it into a business, incurring the costs of mechanisation in order to produce perhaps 300, may not be worthwhile if there is no demand for so many ice-creams.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Failure rates are very high and the debt incurred by owners becomes unmanageable.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Recognising which micro-enterprises have a high potential is extremely difficult and the costs involved in providing business support and advise are very high.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; There is a great difficulty in identifying demand, especially on a global level and demand patterns are constantly changing.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The limited ability of city administrations to gather enough resources to support businesses and make sound investments can be problematic.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

==Public recognition==
Despite all the evidence of the importance of a development state, some international [[aid agencies]] have just recently publicly recognized the fact. The [[United Nations Development Program]], for example, published a report in April 2000 which focused on [[good governance]] in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that “Without [[good governance]], reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.”&lt;ref name="undp2000"&gt;United Nations Development Report. 2000. ''Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.'' New York: United Nations Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dror-Israel movement logo En.jpg|thumb|Dror-Israel logo]]
'''Dror-Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|דרור-ישראל}}) is a pioneering{{peacock term|date=July 2016}} educational movement whose mission is to effect meaningful, long-term educational and social change in [[Israeli society]] in order to promote [[solidarity]], social activism, democracy and equality. Dror-Israel aim to form the grassroots nucleus of an exemplary society in [[Israel]] based on the vision of the prophets of Israel and the founders of [[Zionism]].

Dror Israel emphasizes participation from every sector of Israeli society, including [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian]] and Russian immigrants, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]], [[Israeli Druze|Druze]] and [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouins]], and middle class and working class communities. In the past decade, Dror Israel has established 16 educators' kibbutzim in the social and geographic periphery of Israel. There are currently 1,200 young adults living in these kibbutzim, aged 20–40, who work daily in the organization's educational, cultural and social activities with over 100,000 children, teens and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drorisrael.org.il/english/ |title=About us |work=Dror Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sukot at Kibboz Mehanhim Beer Sheva.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Sukot]] at Dror-Israel's Kibboz Mehanhim [[Beer Sheva]]]]

==History==
Dror Israel was founded in 2006 by graduates of [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]] (Working and Studying Youth) youth movement. HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed was founded in 1924 by youth working to defend their rights. HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed founded more than one hundred [[kibbutzim]] between 1930 and 1980. In the 1990s, along with the decline of the kibbutz movement, HaNoar HaOved VeHalomed began re-examining the ideal life path of its members,
which had encouraged settling kibbutzim in [[Gar'in]]im (core groups) after finishing their mandatory period of army service. In place of this path, a model started to be put forward in which graduates of the movement formed small urban communes working in society, particularly in education. As part of this process of change, Dror Israel was founded to give a name to this new movement, and today includes HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed as its daughter [[youth movement]]. As of 2014, there are about 1,200 members of Dror Israel, graduates of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed living in small communes in cities or kibbutzim and working in Israeli society – mostly in education and the youth movement. Dror-Israel is named after the historical "[[Dror]]" Zionist youth movement.

==Educators' kibbutzim==
[[File:משכן ברנר וחבריו.JPG|thumb|The Dror-Israel center in [[Tel-Aviv]]]]
Dror Israel's 16 educators' kibbutzim throughout Israel are made up of 1,200 active young people who live together in communities and commit to bettering Israeli society, working in various social, educational and community projects. The educators' kibbutzim strive for a new way of life that enables the members to actualize the [[Jewish values]] of Zionism, equality and social responsibility in the reality of Israel's geographic and socio-economic periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drorisrael.org.il/english/?page_id=11 |title=The Members |work=Dror Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30–100 educators live in each kibbutz in accordance with local needs and the preferences of group members
* Each educators' kibbutz is responsible for a wide variety of activities specific to the needs of the local community
* The educators' kibbutzim are located throughout Israel – urban and rural areas, the center and the periphery
* Some 100 young members of Dror Israel join the educator's kibbutzim each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drorisrael.org.il/english/?page_id=15 |title=The Lifestyle |work=Dror Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives and activities==
Dror Israel believes that Jewish values are the foundation of a [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Zionism|Zionist]], democratic and egalitarian worldview. These values manifest themselves in all of the movement's programs for youth and adults, as well as in the members' own culture and lifestyle.

===Work with youth at-risk behavior===

Dror Israel educates and assists children and youth in disadvantaged communities throughout Israel, most of whom live in Israel's social periphery and are exposed to poverty, inequality, drug use, neglect, violence, and discrimination. Dror Israel strives to provide them with a better future through innovative pedagogical programs that teach them life skills, professional training and educational tools in our various schools and programs:
* Dror educational centers – a network of seven high schools and two boarding schools
* Seven after-school centers for at-risk youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods
* Professional consultation and assistance for working youth on employment issues
* Pre-military academy (Mehina) for at-risk youth, focusing on leadership and entrepreneurial skills

===Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed===
[[Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed]] (The General Federation of Students and Young Workers in Israel) movement centers throughout Israel run a broad variety of educational activities, including seminars, continuing education, and camps and excursions, alongside local daily activities – all emphasizing involvement in Israeli society. The members value community activity and leave their home branches to become leaders at branches and centers in disadvantaged communities. Youth movement alumni have gone on to become social, political, military and cultural leaders in Israel, including former prime minister, [[Yitzhak Rabin]], and former president and prime minister, [[Shimon Peres]].
After their [[Israel Defense Forces#Service|army service]], many youth movement graduates choose to join Dror Israel educators' kibbutzim.

===Jewish–Arab co-existence===
[[File:Arabic sector of the Isarely Working and Studying Youth Movement 2008.jpg|thumb|Youth guides from the Arabic sector of [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]]]]
Dror Israel operates unique educational initiatives for encounters between Jews and Arabs – with dozens of educators and thousands of children and youth participating each year.
Dror Israel co-existence activities throughout Israel:
* [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]] youth movement – informal educational activities for thousands of young people and educators in Arab villages and towns
* Leadership and empowerment workshops – encounters for Jewish and Arab youth, leadership groups, women's groups and seminars in Arab schools
* Language as a cultural bridge – English lessons by volunteers from abroad, Hebrew lessons for Arab communities, and Arabic lessons for Jewish communities
* Educators' gatherings – for [[Jewish]] and [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] educators and unique pedagogical workshops on current events, racism and co-existence
* [[Sherut Leumi]] (National service) – young Arab-Israelis aged 18–19 dedicate one or two years of service to their communities in various projects

'''Edmund Tremayne''' (c. 1525–1582) was an English conspirator and official He was dedicated to Protestant causes, in opposition to the policy of [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]]. 

Tremayne was an assistant to [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Edward Courtenay]], the first [[earl of Devon]]. Devon was suspected of involvement in [[Wyatt's rebellion]] against Mary, and Tremayne was taken to the [[Tower of London]] in 1554. There he was tortured on the rack for evidence but kept silent.  After ten or eleven months in prison, he was released on a £40 fine, and he left [[England]] for [[Italy]] with Courtenay.

He wanted to join Sir [[Henry Sutton Dudley]]'s conspiracy against Mary, and he joined the camp of English rebels at [[Rouen]] before the conspiracy was exploded in April 1557. He then attached himself to [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford]], who was another figure plotting against Mary.

When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] assumed the throne, she rewarded Tremayne. He was elected a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]], and he was raised to a commissioner of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. From 1561-1574, he was the chief recipient of royal taxes for the district. He was also interested in the conversion of [[Ireland]]. [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] had asked him to study the question, and he wrote ''Causes why Ireland is not Reformed.'' In 1571, he was a clerk of the [[Privy Council]]. He did not marry until 1576, when he married Eulalia.

Tremayne was friends with Sir [[Francis Drake]], who was his cousin.

'''Europeanism''' is a political neologism, coined in c. 2002 by the "Center for Dialogue and Universalism" at [[Warsaw University]], coined for ideological support for the process of [[European integration]] as pursued by the   [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogue and Universalism'' 12 (2002), 151f.
"I could not find 'Europeanism' in the ten or more English dictionaries I pored through. However, it does appear in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], in an entry on philosophy during the Spanish Renaissance. In Spain, this was expressed initially in the widespread diffusion of the doctrines of Erasmus of Rotterdam [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the term has been used more widely in the sense of historical ideologies of [[Pan-Europeanism]], e.g. in the context of 1930s [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fascism and Europeanism" in Alexander Tchoubarian, ''The European Idea in History in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: A View From Moscow'', Routledge (2014), 134&amp;ndash;139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habermas and Derrida (2005)==
The philosophers [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] wrote an article for the newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' in which they claimed the birth of a 'European public sphere'. 
They argued that new values and habits had given contemporary Europe 'its own face', and saw an opportunity for the construction of a 'core Europe' (excluding Britain and Eastern Europe) that might be a counterweight to the United States.

Attempting to explain what Europe represented, the two philosophers listed six facets of what they described as a common European 'political mentality':

* [[Secularisation]].
* Trust in the [[Government|state]] and scepticism about the achievements of markets.
* Realistic expectations about technological progress.
* [[Welfarism]].
* A low threshold of tolerance for the use of force.
* [[Multilateralism]] within the framework of a reformed [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, ‘February 15, or What Binds Europe Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe’, in ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 31 May 2003. Reproduced in [[Daniel Levy (sociologist)|Daniel Levy]], [[Max Pensky]] and [[John Torpey]] (eds), ''Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe'' (London: Verso, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==McCormick (2010)==
A personal study{{huh|date=May 2018}} by political scientist [[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]]&lt;ref&gt;John McCormick, ''Europeanism'' (Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; expands on these ideas, and identifies the following as core attributes of Europeanism:

*A rethinking of the meaning of [[citizenship]] and [[patriotism]]. In regard to the latter, pride in country is being replaced with pride in ideas, otherwise known as [[constitutional patriotism]]. Identification with nations or states is being increasingly joined with identification with Europe.
* [[Cosmopolitanism]], or an association with universal ideas, and a belief that all Europeans, and possibly even all humans, belong to a single moral community that transcends state boundaries or national identities. The local and the global cannot be separated or divorced.
* [[Communitarianism]], which - in contrast to the liberal emphasis on individual rights - supports a balance between individual and community interests, emphasizing the responsibilities of government to all those who live under its jurisdiction. Europeanism argues that society may sometimes be a better judge of what is good for individuals rather than vice versa.
* The [[collective society]]. Europeanism emphasizes the view that societal divisions will occur in spite of attempts to ensure equal opportunity, and accepts the role of the state as an economic manager and as a guarantor of societal welfare.
* [[Welfarism]], or a reference to Europeanist ideas that while individual endeavor is to be welcomed, applauded and rewarded, the community has a responsibility for working to ensure that the playing field is as level as possible, and that opportunity and wealth are equitably distributed. Europeanism emphasizes [[equality of outcome|equality of results]] over equality of opportunity. 
* [[Sustainable development]], or the belief that development should be sustainable, meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations.
* Redefining the [[family]]. The place of the European family is changing, with fewer Europeans opting to marry, their ages at marriage rising, their divorce rates growing, their fertility rates declining, more children are being born outside marriage, and single-parent households becoming more usual.
* Working to live. [[Post-material]] Europeans are working fewer hours, are doing more with those hours, and have developed family-friendly laws and policies.
* Criminal rights. In matters of [[criminal justice]], Europeanism means a greater emphasis on individual rights, and a preference for resolving disputes through negotiation rather than confrontation through the law. 
* [[Multiculturalism]], in which Europe has a long and often overlooked tradition arising from the diversity of European societies, and a Europeanist habit of integrating core values and features from new groups with which its dominant cultures have come into contact. This has been challenged of late by the increased racial and religious diversity of Europe.
* [[Secularism]] is probably the one quality most clearly associated with Europe: while religion continues to grow in most of the rest of the world, in virtually every European country, its role is declining, and it plays an increasingly marginal role in politics and public life, while heavily influencing Europeanist attitudes towards science and towards public policies in which religious belief plays a role.
* Opposition to [[capital punishment]]. This is prohibited in all [[European Union]] and [[Council of Europe]] member states, and European governments have worked to achieve a global moratorium as a first step towards its worldwide abolition.
* [[Perpetual peace]]. Where once Europe was a region of near constant war, conflict and political violence, it is today a region of generalised peace, and one which has made much progress along the path to achieving the [[Kantian]] condition of perpetual peace. Inter-state war in the region is alleged to be unthinkable and impossible, even during the worse economic or financial troubles.
* [[Multilateralism]]. Europeanism has eschewed national self-interest in favour of cooperation and consensus, of the promotion of values rather than interests, of reliance on international rules and agreements, and of building coalitions and working through international organisations to resolve problems.

==Immigration crisis==
{{off topic|date=May 2018}}
In the context of the [[European migrant crisis]] of 2015,  the European Commission wants to distribute part of the immigrants in EU member states, but the Visegrad Four countries in Central Europe ([[The Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]]) oppose the quotas and the mass inflow of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa as such.

Some Western European politicians have called for sanctions against the eastern members, saying that they are betraying the European values of solidarity, while the easterners say that they are defending the borders, the identity and the culture of Europe. [[Viktor Orbán]], the Prime Minister of Hungary which has built a double border fence to keep out immigrants, has said this about the immigration wave: “We may lose our European values, our very identity, by degrees like the live frog allowing itself to be slowly cooked to death in a pan of water.” Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told the German paper ''[[Die Welt]]'' that countries like Hungary which violate EU values “should be excluded temporarily, or if necessary for ever, from the EU.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-zero-refugee-strategy-viktor-orban-europe-migration-crisis/ Hungary’s ‘zero refugee’ strategy politico.eu (Sept 20, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Far-left politics''' are political views located further on the left of the [[Left–right political spectrum|left-right spectrum]] than the standard [[Left-wing politics|political left]].  

The term has been used to describe ideologies such as: [[communism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[left-communism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], and [[Maoism]].&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;Left Communism in Australia, by J.A. Dawson ''Thesis 11'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Left Communism and Trotskyism, by Loren Goldner et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of left and far-left parties in Europe}}
[[File:NPA Révolution tunisienne Planoise.jpg|thumb|French posters of support to the [[Tunisian Revolution]] (and [[feminism]] below)]]
Luke March of the School of Social and Political Science at the [[University of Edinburgh]] defines the far-left in Europe as those who position themselves to the left of [[social democracy]], which they see as insufficiently left-wing. The two main sub-types are called the radical left, who desire fundamental changes to the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system yet remain accepting of liberal democracy, and the extreme left, who are more hostile to [[liberal democracy]] and denounce any compromise with capitalism. March specifies four major subgroups within contemporary European far-left politics: [[Communism|communists]], [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]], [[Left-wing populism|populist socialists]] and [[Populism#Populist socialism|social populists]].&lt;ref name="March"&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Luke|title=Contemporary Far Left Parties in Europe: From Marxism to the Mainstream?|date=2008|publisher=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|location=Berlin|isbn=9783868720006|page=3|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/ipa/05818.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the term ''extrême-gauche'' ("far-left") is a generally accepted term for political groups that position themselves to the left of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], such as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|Maoists]], [[anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]] and [[New Left]]ists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">'''Fritz Max Cahén''' (alias '''Lynkeus''') (born December 8, 1891 in Saarlouis; died August 29, 1966 in Bonn)  was active in the Weimar Republic government and later founded the anti-Nazi political alliance Volkssozialistische Bewegung (Cahén later referred to it as, in English, the German Front Against Hitlerism).&lt;ref name="Cahén Questionnaire" /&gt;  He worked as a journalist and also authored the books ''Der Weg nach Versailles'' (1963)&lt;ref name="Cahén Versailles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cahén|first=Fritz Max|title=Der Weg nach Versailles: Erinnerungen 1912-1919|year=1963|publisher=Harald Boldt Verlag|location=Boppard/Rhein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Men Against Hitler'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Cahén Hitler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cahén|first=Fritz Max|title=Men Against Hitler|year=1939|publisher=Bobb-Merrill Company|location=Indianapolis and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German Literature" /&gt;

Fritz Max Cahén was born to a Jewish father; his mother was possibly Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie Porter, “Volcano With a Paint Brush,” The Standard, April 7, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Eugen Cahén,  was a founder of the Saar Produce Exchange, and a member of the Hansabund. Fritz Max Cahén graduated from the College of Metz (Alsace-Lorraine) and Saarbruecken University Marburg/Lahn. He took postgraduate courses at the Sorbonne (Paris) and Haute Ecole des Sciences Politiques et Sociales (Paris).&lt;ref name="Cahén Questionnaire" /&gt;  In 1916 he married Eugenie Caroline Auguste Stamm, a Protestant, according to a marriage certificate in possession of the family. Fritz Max Cahén had one son that same year, artist [[Oscar Cahén]]. A reference work on Jewish émigrés also refers to a second son, Ulrich, born in 1925; if true, this child was not raised by Fritz Max and Eugenie.&lt;ref name="German Emigrants"&gt;{{cite book|last=Röder and Strauss (editors)|title=Biographisches Handbuch der deutschsprachigen Emigration nach 1933-1945.|year=1980|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110970287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the first World War, Cahén moved in German avant-garde art circles, contributing translations of [[Apollinaire]] to the Expressionist periodical ''[[Der Sturm]]''.&lt;ref name="Bohn Apoll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Willard|title=Apollinaire and the International Avant-Garde|year=1997|publisher=State University of New York|isbn=0791431959|pages=103–106, 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raabe Expressionism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raabe|first=Paul (editor)|title=The Era of German Expressionism|year=1974|publisher=MacMillan of Canada|isbn=0879510102|pages=103–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a young critic, he saw a connection between politics and art, suggesting in 1914 that the First World War would be fought over the future of [[German Expressionism]], rather than Belgium's neutrality or the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] of June 1914.&lt;ref name="Cahén Kunst"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cahén|first=Fritz Max|title=Die neue Kunst und der Krieg|newspaper=Vossische Zeitung|date=30 December 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a civil servant in the German Legation in Copenhagen 1916 - 1918, Cahén became "personal advisor" to [[Count Brockdorff-Rantzau]], High Commissioner at the Versailles Peace Conference. Cahén wrote articles for many newspapers and magazines, sometimes under the name Lynkeus, including ''Die Schaubuehne'' (Berlin), ''Deutsche Politik'' (Berlin), ''Politiken'' (Copenhagen), ''L'Europe Nouvelle'' (Paris), ''Die Bruecke'' (Prague), ''Berliner Tageblatt, Frankfurter Zeitung'', ''Commentator'' (USA), ''Koelnische Zeitung, Skaanska Aftonbladet'' (Sweden), ''Deutsche Kunst und Decoration'' (Darmstadt).&lt;ref name="Cahén Questionnaire"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cahén|first=Fritz Max|title=Bobbs Merrill Questionnaire|year=1939|publisher=Bobbs Merrill Company|location=Lilly Library Bobbs Merrill papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German Literature"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kosch, Lang, and Feilchenfeldt (editors)|title=Deutsches Literatur-Lexikon : das 20.

In 1933, Cahén took refuge in Prague, where he co-wrote the script for ''Kiss in the Snow'' (directed by [[Rudolph Cartier|Rudolf Katscher]]), the German-language [[Multiple-language version|version]] of the 1934 film ''Polibek Ve Snehu'' (directed by Vaclav Binovec).&lt;ref name="Exile Cinema"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horak|first=Jan-Christopher|author2=Jennifer Bishop|title=German Exile Cinema, 1933-1950|journal=Film History|year=1996|volume=8|issue=4|pages=373–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Prague Cahén also intensified his political activities, and on February 5, 1936 he founded the Volkssozialistische Bewegung with Hans Jaeger and Arthur Arzt.&lt;ref name="Cahén political group"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langkau-Alex|first=Ursula|title=Der Parteivorstand der SPD im Exile.

In 1937, Cahén traveled to the United States in order to raise awareness of Nazi activities and to write ''Men Against Hitler'', which outlined the resistance activities he had participated in. Cahén asserted that half of German citizens did not actually support the Nazi regime and that their disaffection represented an opportunity to overthrow Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Joseph Hilton|title=Underground in Germany (Review)|journal=Saturday Review of Literature|date=July 22, 1939|volume=20|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had the support of Wythe Williams, editor of the ''Greenwich Times''; Williams acted as a literary agent, and translator, and wrote the book's introduction as well.&lt;ref name="Wythe Williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staley |first=Eugene (editor)|title=World Economy in Transition: Men Against Hitler (review)|journal=Banker's Magazine|date=August 1939|volume=139|issue=2|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cahén also joined the New York-based group the German-American Council for the Liberation of Germany From Nazism, later renamed Association of Free Germans.&lt;ref name=spying /&gt;

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Fritz Max Cahén was stuck in the United States and he lived there until 1954, when he returned to Germany and resumed his [https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0000/adr/adrag/kap1_3/para2_3.html civil service work] and writing. Meanwhile, his wife and son [[Oscar Cahén]] had become Canadian citizens; his wife joined him in Germany in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="German Emigrants" /&gt;  Fritz Max Cahén died in Bonn, August 29, 1966.

The '''Galician Workers Union''' ('''SOG''', ''Sindicato Obreiro Galego'' in [[Galician language]]), was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and [[Anticapitalism|anticapitalist]] [[Labour union|union]] in [[Galiza]].

Its official publication was ''O Eixo'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionmonchoreboiras.gal/arquivo-publicacions.html All the numbers of Eixo, in Galician language.]&lt;/ref&gt; editing at the same time other [[Comarcas of Spain|comarcal]] and sectorial publications. The SOG was founded in May 1975 when the Frente Obreiro (''Workers Front'') of the [[Galician People's Union]] decided to become an [[Labour union|union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://radiofusion.eu/manager.php?p=FichaNova&amp;ID=1599&lt;/ref&gt; The SOG was part of the [[Galician National Popular Assembly]] (AN-PG). The SOG defended "combative" unionism and rejected any kind o collaboration with the [[Employers' organization|''Patronal'']].

In April 1976 the organization held its first General Assembly. However, it disappeared just a year later, in March 1977 to found, with other unions, the [[Intersindical Nacional Galega]] (ING).

'''''Gemeinschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈmaɪnʃaft}}) and '''''Gesellschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|}}), generally translated as "[[community]] and [[society]]", are categories which were used by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in order to categorize social ties into two dichotomous sociological types which define each other. [[Max Weber]], who is generally recognized as being a founding figure in sociology, also wrote extensively about the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft''. Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy==
The ''Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft'' [[dichotomy]] was proposed by Tönnies as a purely conceptual tool rather than as an [[ideal type]] in the way it was used by [[Max Weber]] to accentuate the key elements of a historic/social change. According to the dichotomy, social ties can be categorized, on one hand, as belonging to personal [[social interaction]]s, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]"), or on the other hand as belonging to indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag.  An English translation of the 8th edition 1935 by Charles P. Loomis appeared in 1940 as ''Fundamental Concepts of Sociology (Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft)'', New York: American Book Co.;  in 1955 as ''Community and Association (Gemeinschaft und gesellschaft''[sic]'')'', London:  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul;  and in 1957 as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State U.P.  Loomis includes as an Introduction, representing Tönnies' "most recent thinking", his 1931 article "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft" in ''Handwörterbuch der Soziologie'' (Stuttgart, Enke V.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tönnies was a [[Thomas Hobbes]] scholar{{mdash}}he edited the standard modern editions of Hobbes's ''The Elements of Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=The Elements of Law Natural and Politic|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=Behemoth or the Long Parliament|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his study of Hobbes that encouraged Tönnies to devote himself wholly to the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. And it has been argued that he derived both categories from Hobbes's concepts of "concord" and "union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hont|first1=Istvan|editor1-last=Kapossy|editor1-first=Béla|editor2-last=Sonenscher|editor2-first=Michael|title=Politics in Commercial Society: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith|date=2015|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition, published in 1912, of the work in which Tönnies further promoted the concepts turned out to be an unexpected but lasting success&lt;ref&gt;Published with a more abstract subtitle ''Basic Terms of Pure Sociology'' (In German: "Grundbegriffe der reinen Soziologie").&lt;/ref&gt; after the first edition was published in 1887 with the subtitle "Treatise on Communism and Socialism as Empirical Patterns of Culture".&lt;ref&gt;In German: ''Abhandlung des Communismus und des Socialismus als empirischer Culturformen''&lt;/ref&gt; Seven more German editions followed, the last in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;  The 1935 edition was reprinted in 2005 by Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became part of the general stock of ideas with which pre-1933 German intellectuals were quite familiar. The book sparked a revival of [[Corporatism|corporatist]] thinking, including the rise of [[neo-medievalism]], the rise of support for [[guild socialism]], and caused major changes in the field of sociology.&lt;ref name="Peter F. Klarén 1986. Pp. 221"&gt;Peter F. Klarén, Thomas J. Bossert. ''Promise of development: theories of change in Latin America''. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 1986. P. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' were also used by Max Weber in ''Economy and Society'', which was first published in 1921.  Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weber 1968:4, and 40-43)&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is rooted in a "subjective feeling" that may be "affectual or traditional". ''Gesellschaft''-based relationships, according to Weber, are rooted in "rational agreement by mutual consent", the best example of which is a commercial contract.  To emphasize the fluidity and amorphousness of the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'', Weber modified the terms in German to ''Vergemeinschaftung'', and ''Vergesellschaftung'', which are the [[gerund]] forms of the German words.&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion see Waters and Waters 2015:3-6, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Weber's distinction between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' is highlighted in the essay "Classes, Stände, Parties",&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:37-58 in Weber's ''Rationalism and Modern Society'', Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters eds. New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basis for Weber's [[three-component theory of stratification]].

Having propounded his conception of the ''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy, Tönnies was drawn into a sharp polemic with [[Émile Durkheim]]. In a review of Tönnies' book in 1889, Durkheim interpreted ''Gemeinschaft'' as an organic community, and ''Gesellschaft'' as a mechanical one, reproaching Tönnies for considering the second type of social organisation artificial, and not seeing the transition from the one type to the other. Tönnies did not agree with such an interpretation of his views, and in turn, when reviewing Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1896), wrote that Durkheim's whole sociology was a modification and variant of Spencer's, which was also unjust.{{clarify |date=December 2017 |reason= How was Tönnies wrong? }}

==Globalization==

[[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that, as [[globalization]] turns the entire planet into an increasingly remote kind of ''Gesellschaft'', so too collective [[identity politics]] seeks for a fictitious remaking of the qualities of ''Gemeinschaft'' by artificially reforging group bonds and identities.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism'' (2007) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] highlights the ambivalent envy felt by those constructed by ''Gesellschaft'' for remaining enclaves of ''Gemeinschaft'', even as they inevitably corrode their existence.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside sociology ==
In [[business]] usage, ''Gesellschaft'' is the German term for "[[company]]", as in ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]'' or ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (''GmbH'').  "Gemeinschaft" is used to identify groups which have or are claimed to have an element of affective loyalty. One important usage is in the German name for the [[European Economic Community]], ''Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft''.

The German phrase for "mutual insurance company" includes both words, "mutual" and "company." In the 1980's, the Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company, headquartered in the German-American city of Frankenmuth, Michigan, released various promotional items such as matchbooks, featuring, in a traditional German Fraktur font, a translation of their company's name, "Frankenmuth Gemeinschafts Versicherinungs Gesellschaft."

The '''Godless Americans March on Washington''' ('''GAMOW''') occurred on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]] on November 2, 2002 with the participation of many [[atheists]], [[freethinkers]], [[agnostics]], and [[humanists]]. The public cable network [[C-SPAN]] documented the event on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Godless Americans Rally|year = 2002| url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/173662-1|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event timeline==

The event started at 11:00 A.M. near the Washington Monument, led by the American Atheist's banner promoting the separation of church and state. About halfway down the Mall the people were confronted by counter-protesters. However, the people continued to proceed to the other end of the Mall in front of the Capitol. At 11:30 A.M., the rally started and featured over 20 speakers and musical entertainment. The rally lasted for about 4 hours.&lt;ref name="worgar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Orgar |first=Wayne |title=Godless Americans March on Washington |year=2002 |url=http://www.concentric.net/~Worgar/godless.htm |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316220641/http://www.concentric.net/~Worgar/godless.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==

The event was marked by many slogans and banners on shirts, badges, etc., including "What Our Schools Need is a Moment of Science!", "Atheism is Myth-Understood!", "Secular Humanists for a Secular America", "Citizen–Atheist–Patriot".&lt;ref name="worgar" /&gt;  The official T-shirt for the march showed a picture of the Capitol and the American Flag with the statement "Free, Proud and on the Move–GODLESS AMERICANS".&lt;ref name="worgar" /&gt;

==Speeches==

Many speakers delivered speeches at the March. A few noted speakers were [[Frank Zindler]], editor of the ''[[American Atheist Magazine]]'', [[Margaret Downey]] of the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia and [[Ed Buckner]], executive director of the [[Council for Secular Humanism]], etc.( see [[Godless_Americans_March_on_Washington#Event_speakers|Event Speakers]]  The speeches delivered were basically on [[theism]], [[atheism]] and related themes. Ed Buckner reportedly attacked the way theists perceive [[atheist]]s as lacking morality.&lt;ref name="worgar" /&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

Over two thousand [[atheists]], [[freethinkers]], [[agnostics]], and [[humanists]] gathered in a mile-long parade down [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|The Mall]] to rally for several causes, including [[civil rights]], [[church-state separation]], and a greater voice in the national political process.

[[Ellen Johnson]], former president of [[American Atheists]] and director of the Godless Americans March On Washington Task Force announced at the event the formation of the [[Godless Americans Political Action Committee]] (GAMPAC), later renamed [[Enlighten the Vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Johnson| first = Ellen| title = Enlighten the Vote: About Us|year = 2004| url = http://enlightenthevote.com/about/| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and results==
Atheist groups by and large considered the march a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourdonnay |first=Katherine |title=Godless Americans March a Success |year=2003 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/shb/bourdonnay_18_4.html |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015215750/http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/shb/bourdonnay_18_4.html |archivedate=15 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = SSA Participates in Godless Americans March on Washington|year = 2002| url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/298|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams| first = Clark| title = The Godless Americans March on Washington—a Lesson in Godless Cooperation|year = 2002| url = http://www.infidels.org/kiosk/article248.html|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some within the atheist community did criticize the event for a number of reasons, including the exclusion of [[theists]] from being able to endorse the event, how [[atheism]] was defined for the purposes of the march, and the apparent attempt by organizers to use the march as a way of "creating an identity for nonbelievers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cline| first = Austin| title = Godless Americans March on Washington: What's Wrong With It?|year = 2002| url = http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa102202a.htm|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization calling itself the [[Religious Freedom Coalition]] ran newspaper ads the day before the event characterizing the views of atheists and Satanists to be identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Religious Freedom Coalition| title = Week Ending November 1, 2002: RELIGIOUS FREEDOM COALITION RESPONDS TO "GODLESS MARCH"| year = 2002| url = http://www.rfcnet.org/news/default.asp?action=detail&amp;article=60| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the event, the same organization called the event a success, but described it as "ill timed" and an indication of a dangerous brand of new atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Religious Freedom Coalition| title = Week Ending November 8, 2002: "GODLESS MARCH ON WASHINGTON"|year = 2002 | url = http://www.rfcnet.org/news/default.asp?action=detail&amp;article=63| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the march, leaders of three atheist organizations—[[Atheist Alliance International]], the [[Institute for Humanist Studies]], and the [[Internet Infidels]]—met and set in motion the founding of the [[Secular Coalition for America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History: Secular Coalition of America| url = http://secular.org/history|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international relations theory]], the '''Great Debates''' refer to a series of disagreements between international relations scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Booth, Michael Cox, Timothy Dunne,The eighty years' crisis: international relations 1919-1999, Issue 1, p1: "The story of international relations is conveniently told in a series of 'great debates'.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ashworth describes how the discipline of international relations has been heavily influenced by historical narratives and that "no single idea has been more influential" than the notion that there was a debate between utopian and realist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;LM Ashworth, Did the Realist-Idealist Great Debate Really Happen? a Revisionist History of International Relations,International Relations, Vol. 16, No. 1, p31 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Great Debate ==
{{Further|Liberalism in international relations theory|
|Idealism in international relations|Realism in international relations}}
The "First Great Debate" also known as the "Realist-Idealist Great Debate"&lt;ref&gt;LM Ashworth, Did the Realist-Idealist Great Debate Really Happen? a Revisionist History of International Relations,International Relations, Vol. 16, No. 1, 33-51 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; was a dispute between idealists and realists which took place in the 1930s and 1940s&lt;ref&gt;Ken Booth, Michael Cox, Timothy Dunne,The eighty years' crisis: international relations 1919-1999, Issue 1, p1&lt;/ref&gt; and which was fundamentally about how to deal with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Devetak, Anthony Burke, Jim George (2007) ''An Introduction to International Relations: Australian Perspectives'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 90
&lt;/ref&gt; Realist scholars emphasized the anarchical nature of international politics and the need for state survival. Idealists emphasized the possibility of international institutions such as the League of Nations. However, some have argued that defining the debate between realism and idealism in terms of a great debate is a misleading caricature and so described the "great debate" as a myth.&lt;ref&gt;Vigneswaran, Darsha, International relations’ first great debate : context and tradition.{{ISBN|0 7315 3133 7}}, p5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wilson (1998). The myth of the ‘First Great Debate’. Review of International Studies, 24 , pp 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Great Debate==
The "Second Great Debate" was a dispute between "scientific IR" scholars who sought to refine scientific methods of inquiry in international relations theory and those who insisted on a more historicist/interpretative approach to international relations theory. The debate is termed "realists versus behaviourists" or "traditionalism versus scientism".&lt;ref&gt;Guzzini, Stefano (1998) Realism in international relations and international political economy: the continuing story of a death foretold, New York: Routledge, P. 32&lt;/ref&gt; This debate would be resolved when [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealists]] such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] (1959, 1979) adopt a Behaviouralist, and hence positivist scientific approach to their studies.

==Inter-paradigm debate (Third Great Debate)==
{{Main|Inter-paradigm debate in international relations theory}}
Sometimes the inter-paradigm debate is considered to be a great debate and is therefore referred to as the "Third Great Debate". The inter-paradigm debate was a debate between liberalism, realism and radical international relations theories.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Ole,The rise and fall of the Inter-paradigm debate, International theory: positivism and beyond, Steve Smith, Ken Booth, Marysia Zalewski, p151&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has also been described as being between realism, institutionalism and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/9/4/3/p179436_index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082353/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/9/4/3/p179436_index.html |archivedate=January 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth Great Debate&lt;!--Wikilinked from [[Template:Positivism]].--&gt;==
{{Further|Post-positivism in international relations theory}}
The "Fourth Great Debate" was a debate between [[Positivism (international relations)|positivist]] theories and [[Post-positivism (international relations)|post-positivist]] theories of international relations. Confusingly, it is often described in literature as "The Third Great Debate" by those who reject the description of the inter-paradigm debate as a Great Debate.&lt;ref&gt;Y Lapid, The third debate: On the prospects of international theory in a post-positivist era, International Studies Quarterly (1989) 33, 235–254&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is concerned with the underlying [[epistemology]] of international relations scholarship and is also described as a debate between "[[Rationalism in international relations theory|rationalists]]" and "[[reflectivism|reflectivists]]".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve (2007) "Introduction" in  T. Dunne. M. Kuki, and S. Smith (eds.) International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was started by [[Robert Keohane]] in an [[International Studies Association]] debate in 1988 and can be considered an epistemological debate, about how we can know 'things' rather than an ontological one,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S, (2007) 'Introduction'  in Dunne, T., Kuki, M. and Smith, S. (eds.) ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''. Oxford: OUP. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say a debate about what we can claim to know. As Balzacq and Baele summarize, this debate is "a discussion which, in the 1980s and 1990s, followed a composite claim for a more diverse, less epistemologically and ontologically naïve, and more critical IR".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444336597_yr2015_chunk_g978144433659719_ss1-33|title=The Third Debate and Postpositivism : The International Studies Encyclopedia : Blackwell Reference Online|website=www.blackwellreference.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fifth Great Debate?==
Brown remarking on the possibility of a "Fifth Great Debate" has suggested that the debate could concern [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] but goes on to say 'let us hope not, because the first four great debates were singularly pointless affairs, and the fifth, when it arrives, is unlikely to be any different.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C. (2007) Situating Critical Realism, Millennium - Journal of International Studies, 35/2: 409-16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Smith (academic)|Steve Smith]] argues that 'it is difficult to find any notion of a "fifth great debate" in the literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated726"&gt;Smith, S. (2008) ''The Oxford Handbook of International Relations'', C. Reus-Smit, D. Snidal (eds.),Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 726&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Steve Smith has argued that the differing positions have largely ignored each other meaning that it makes little sense to talk of 'debates' between rival theoretical frameworks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated726"/&gt; [[Emmanuel Navon]] has argued that the three debates are a sham since there is nothing new about debating human nature and human knowledge, while the 'third debate' artificially imports the deconstructionist French fad into the study of International Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20097763?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Emmanuel Navon, "The Third Debate Revisited" Review of International Studies 27/4 (2001), pp. 611-625]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hida Viloria''' (born May 29, 1968) is a [[Latinx|Latina]] American writer,&lt;ref&gt;http://hidaviloria.com/wp-content/uploads/Bibliography-Hida-Viloria.pdf Hida Viloria Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''Born Both: An Intersex Life'' ([[Hachette Books]]), and [[intersex]] and [[non-binary]] rights activist of Colombian and Venezuelan descent. Viloria is Founding Director of the [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]].

==Early life and education==

Viloria was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York, to recently immigrated Colombian and Venezuelan parents. Her father, a physician, and mother, an ex-school teacher, chose to register and raise her as female without subjecting her to medically unnecessary cosmetic genital surgeries, also known as [[intersex genital mutilation]] (IGM), that were routinely recommended at the time for intersex children with genital variance like hers.&lt;ref&gt;Viloria, Hida (September 27, 2011). Dispelling The Myths: My Experience Growing Up Intersex and Au Naturel. http://www.bodieslikeours.org/index.php/our-lives/22-hida-new-story ''Bodies Like Ours.'' Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viloria attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut from 1986-1988, and graduated with high honors and high distinction from the University of California at Berkeley in 1998, with an Interdisciplinary Studies B.A. in Gender and Sexuality.

== Career ==

Viloria is the author of the acclaimed, [http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/hida-viloria/born-both/9780316347846/ ''Born Both: An Intersex Life''] ([[Hatchette Book Group]], March, 2017), and has been published extensively on intersectional intersex issues such Intersex Genital Mutilation (IGM), its harms, heteronormative imperatives and similarities to FGM, discrimination against intersex women in sports, racism, sexuality, legal gender recognition, and gender identity, in venues such as ''[[The Daily Beast]], [[Huffington Post]], [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]], [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms]]., [[The New York Times]], [[The American Journal of Bioethics]], the Global Herald, [[CNN.com]],'' and others, and in her blog &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Intersex and Out''.

Viloria is also a recognized human rights activist who has educated extensively about intersex and non-binary gender issues as a frequent speaker (Stanford, Princeton, Vassar, NYU), consultant ([[United Nations]] [[OHCHR]], [[United Nations Free &amp; Equal|United Nations Free &amp; Equal Campaign]], [[Lambda Legal]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Williams Institute]], [[IOC]]...), television and radio guest (''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], [[HuffPost Live]], [[20/20]], [[Aljazeera]], [[BBC Radio]], [[KPFA]]'') and in film (''[[Gendernauts]], One in 2000, [[Intersexion]]''), and she continues to advocate for equality and human rights for intersex and non-binary people as Founding Director of the [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]].

=== Opposing nonconsensual medically-unnecessary surgeries ===

In 1996, Viloria participated in the first international intersex retreat. She reports that, eager to meet people like herself, instead she "met people who'd been traumatized and physically damaged by cosmetic genital surgeries and hormone treatments they'd been subjected to in infancy and childhood, and it moved me to become an intersex activist."&lt;ref name="intersexion"&gt;[http://www.intersexionfilm.com Intersexion], Ponsonby Productions Limited, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viloria2010" /&gt; 
Viloria has been advocating publicly against the use of medically unnecessary cosmetic surgeries and hormone therapy on intersex infants and minors, aka Intersex Genital Mutilation,  since 1997,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isna.org/node/14/ "Caught in the Middle," Inside Edition, September 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; reaching audiences of over one hundred million, via appearances in various documentaries about intersex people, including the first,''Hermaphrodites Speak!'',.&lt;ref&gt;''Hermaphrodites Speak!''(1997) [[Intersex Society of North America]],  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwSOngdR7kM. Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
and most notably on ABC's [[20/20]],&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123917&amp;page=1 Controversy Over Operating to Change Ambiguous Genitalia, ABC 20/20, April 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8LyyNvY6e4 Growing Up Intersex, The Oprah Winfrey Show, September 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in Spanish on the Emmy nominated Spanish language show ''[[Caso Cerrado]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidaviloria.com/cosmetic-genital-surgeries-on-babies-is-wrong-case-closed/ Cosmetic Genital Surgery/Sex Re-assignment of Intersex Babies is wrong: Case Closed], Hida Viloria, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and at the UN Headquarters in New York City for Human Rights Day 2013.

In 2004, Viloria testified before the [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]] in 2004, on the need to ban medically unnecessary cosmetic genital surgeries on intersex infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Sunil (November 25, 2005). [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]] on Intersex (pdf). ''Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria''. http://www.glhv.org.au/report/san-francisco-human-rights-commission-intersex-pdf. Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2017 Viloria published numerous essays speaking out against nonconsensual medically-unnecessary surgeries, also known as [[Intersex Genital Mutilation]], in publications including CNN.com, The Advocate, The Huffingtion Post, and the Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics. Her memoir ''Born Both: An Intersex Life'', published March 14, 2017 by Hachette Books, examines and critiques Intersex Genital Mutilation extensively.

=== Opposing "disorders of sex development" ===

In 2006, the international medical establishment replaced the terms "hermaphrodite" and "intersex" with the term "[[disorders of sex development]]". Viloria is among a handful of American intersex activists{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} who opposed the use of the term "Disorders of Sex Development" since its introduction. In 2007, she publicly critiqued the label and the homophobic and transphobic reasoning behind the replacement of 'intersex' with DSD.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} S/he also argued that being raised to define oneself as disordered is psychologically harmful to intersex youth:

{{quotation|While some doctors and parents are, according to supporters of the term like Chase (co-author of the DSD Guidelines and founder and director of ISNA), more comfortable referring to us as having "disorders" than associating with a label supported by homosexuals and transsexuals, I do not believe adopting a pathologizing label to distance ourselves from these groups is a solution, to say the least....  I know that it would have harmed my self-esteem to be raised under a term which named my difference a 'disorder.' Even complete ignorance about what to call myself was preferable as I was able to form positive beliefs about my unique qualities.|Hida Viloria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viloria|first1=Hida|title=Hida Viloria Tells Us What She Really Thinks|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/hida-viloria-tells-us-what-she-really-thinks/Content?oid=2164589|website=sfweekly.com|publisher=SF Weekly|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Addressing discrimination against intersex women in sports ===

In 2009, in response to the treatment of black South African track star [[Caster Semenya]], who was rumored to be intersex, Hida lobbied as an independent intersex activist for equal rights for intersex female athletes on television&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inside Edition]]''. "Hermaphrodite Runner" (September 16, 2009). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HwLfvKPAZY Retrieved 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in print on CNN.com.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/18/hida.viloria.intersex.athlete/ My LIfe as Mighty Hermaphrodite, CNN.com, September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, then as Human Rights Spokesperson of the [[Organisation Intersex International]] (OII), s/he authored a petition to the International Olympic Committee demanding that intersex women athletes to be allowed to compete as is, and be de-pathologized,.&lt;ref&gt;OII's Petition to the IOC: Depathologization &amp; Fair Policies for Intersex Athletes (February 25, 2010). http://www.intersexequality.com/oiis-petition-to-the-international-olympic-committee-ioc/&lt;/ref&gt; The action resulted in Viloria being invited to participate in the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s October 2010 meeting of experts on intersex women in sports, in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, where she lobbied against adopting regulations which require intersex female athletes to undergo medically unnecessary medical procedures in order to compete as women, and against athletes being referred to as individuals with "disorders of sex development".&lt;ref name="viloria2010"&gt;Viloria, Hida (April 11, 2010). Gender Rules in Sport – Leveling The Playing Field, Or Reversed Doping? (April 11, 2010). ''The Global Herald''. {{cite web|url=http://theglobalherald.com/opinion-gender-rules-in-sport-leveling-the-playing-field-or-reversed-doping/14837/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514122301/http://theglobalherald.com/opinion-gender-rules-in-sport-leveling-the-playing-field-or-reversed-doping/14837/ |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Viloria's advocacy, the IOC and IAAF discontinued its use of "disorders of sex development" to describe the athletes in question, and replaced it with "women with hyperandrogenism".&lt;ref name="viloria2010" /&gt;

Viloria has argued since 2009 that Olympic sex testing is applied in a way that targets 'butch,' or masculine-looking, women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1159745/index.htm Well, Is She Or Isn't She?], SI, September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/30/science/la-sci-sn-sex-testing-in-the-olympics-a-fools-errand-20120730 Is sex testing in the Olympics a fool's errand?] Jon Bardin in Los Angeles Times, July 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Viloria co-authored an article in the [[American Journal of Bioethics]], with intersex Spanish hurdler [[Maria José Martínez-Patiño]], the athlete responsible for overturning the IOC's long-standing mandatory chromosome testing policies, which critiqued the IOC's proposed regulations for women with high levels of naturally occurring testosterone (aka hyperandrogenism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15265161.2012.680543 | volume=12 | title=Reexamining Rationales of "Fairness": An Athlete and Insider's Perspective on the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes | year=2012 | journal=The American Journal of Bioethics | pages=17–19 | last1 = Patricia Viloria | first1 = Hida}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the release of the [[I.O.C.]]'s final regulations for intersex women with [[hyperandrogenism]] in 2012, s/he collaborated on an opinion piece with scholar [[Georgiann Davis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://msmagazine.com/blog/2012/07/30/olympics-new-hormone-regulations-judged-by-how-you-look/ Olympics’ New Hormone Regulations: Judged By How You Look], Hida Viloria and [[Georgiann Davis]] in [[Ms. Magazine]], July 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and also told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the issues for intersex athletes remain unresolved: "Many athletes have medical differences that give them a competitive edge but are not asked to have medical interventions to 'remove' the advantage.... The real issue is not fairness, but that certain athletes are not accepted as real women because of their appearance."&lt;ref&gt;Viloria, Hida. Letters to the Editor. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 23, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Human Rights Day]], 2013, Viloria became the first openly intersex person to speak at the U.N., by invitation, at the event "Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia", along with fellow "out" pioneers, tennis legend [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[NBA]] player [[Jason Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webtv.un.org/watch/sport-comes-out-against-homophobia/2920436290001/#full-text Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia], UN Live [[United Nations]] TV, December 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46706&amp;Cr=homophobia&amp;Cr1=#.UqosUpFw1cc At UN human rights event, Navratilova and Collins decry homophobic violence], [[United Nations]] UN News Centre, December 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Viloria advocated against the IOC and IAAF's regulations for women with hyperandrogenism on a panel on the [[Aljazeera]] television show [[The Stream]].&lt;ref&gt;http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201409031709-0024124/ No Games for Women with Too Much Testosterone, Aljazeera, The Stream, September 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  She also wrote about the interphobia and common misunderstandings around naturally occurring testosterone which drive sporting regulations for intersex women, in [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/09/18/op-ed-stop-freaking-out-about-female-intersex-athletes Stop Freaking Out About Intersex Athletes], The Advocate, September 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth registrations ===

With the advent of a new German law assigning visibly intersex infants to an 'indeterminate' gender, Viloria has argued that this approach to birth registrations fails to provide adequate human rights for intersex people, and fails to address the most critical need: for an end to normalizing surgical and hormonal interventions on infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany’s-third-gender-law-fails-equality Germany’s Third Gender Law Fails on Equality], The Advocate, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobalherald.com/germanys-third-gender-law-intersex-people-need/31095/ Germany’s Third Gender Law: Not What Intersex People Most Need], The Global Herald, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01kb0c3 World Have Your Say]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2017, Viloria became the second American recipient of an intersex birth certificate, issued by the city of New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intersexequality.com/nyc-issues-second-intersex-birth-certificate/ NYC Issues Second Intersex Birth Certificate! Intersex Campaign for Equality, June 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and global affiliations and activism ===

In spring 2010, Viloria joined the [[Organisation Intersex International]], or OII, the first international intersex organization, was appointed Human Rights Spokesperson, and began lobbying against discriminatory regulations for intersex women athletes. In Spring 2011, Viloria was voted Chairperson of OII, upon founder Curtis Hinkle's retirement. Viloria stepped down in November 2017, when Intersex Campaign for Equality left OII.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|title = New Mission and Independent Status for IC4E as Viloria resigns from post as OII Chair | url = http://www.intersexequality.com/new-mission-and-independent-status-for-ic4e-as-viloria-resigns-from-post-as-oii-chair/ |date = November 8, 2017 | author = Intersex Campaign for Equality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2011, Hida founded the Intersex Campaign for Equality, to work for equality and human rights for intersex Americans. Her first action, in December, 2011, was contacting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to request inclusion of intersex people in human rights protocols and protections. In early 2012 she received a response from the U.S. Department of State in early 2012 affirming the importance of including the intersex community in human rights work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersexequality.com/oii-receives-reply-department-state-oii-chairperson-hida-vilorias-letter-intersex-inclusion-lgbti-lgbtonly-global-human-rights-efforts/ OII Thanks UN’s Navi Pillay], February 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Viloria spearheaded the first unified, global call for human rights by and for intersex people, in a letter signed by thirty leading intersex advocacy organizations, to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intersexequality.com/open-letter-to-the-un-the-1st-global-call-for-human-rights-by-and-for-intersex-people/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Viloria served as one of three intersex co-organizers of the Third [[International Intersex Forum]] in November 2013, in [[Malta]], which led to the creation of the [[Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)|Malta declaration]], the most widely agreed upon statement of human rights' demands by the international intersex advocacy community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/3rd_intersex_forum_2013 3rd International Intersex Forum in Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226222209/http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/3rd_intersex_forum_2013 |date=2013-12-26 }}, ILGA-Europe, 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Viloria became a board member of Genital Autonomy America (GA America), an advocacy organization working with groups worldwide who are seeking to end non-therapeutic genital cutting of all female, male, and intersex infants and children.

=== Media ===

Hida spoke about being [[non-binary]], also known as [[genderqueer]], in the groundbreaking, award-winning 1999 documentary ''[[Gendernauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersexequality.com/e-d-hida-viloria-in-the-groundbreaking-gendernauts/ E.D. Hida Viloria in the Groundbreaking GENDERNAUTS] April 23, 2013, Retrieved December 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], Viloria likened society's lack of understanding of non-binary people, and the pressure non-binary people experience to identify as men or women,  to what people of mixed African-American and caucasian race sometimes experience, saying, "Society pressures you to choose sides, just like they pressure [[mixed race]] people to decide, you know... 'Are you really black? Are you really white?'" She went on to say "I have both [sides].".&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8LyyNvY6e4 Oprah], "Growing Up Intersex," Oprah, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, she was featured in the web-based project ''Gender Talents'', by artist Carlos Motta, in which she discusses the many harms produced by, and erroneous presumptions about, Intersex Genital Mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;http://gendertalents.info/portrait/hida-viloria-organization-intersex-international-oii-los-angeles/&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the UN's Free &amp; Equal Campaign for Equality produced a video of Hida&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgFlf_jQZhc What Does It Mean To Be Intersex? United Nations Free &amp; Equal, September 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the release of their groundbreaking resource the Intersex Fact Sheet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Discrimination/LGBT/FactSheets/UNFE_FactSheet_Intersex_EN.pdf/ Intersex Fact Sheet, United Nations Free &amp; Equal, September 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 Hida was one of the "Intersex Voices" featured in the Free and Equal Campaign for Equality's Intersex Awareness Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ Intersex Awareness Mini-Campaign,  United Nations Free &amp; Equal, October 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, she has also advocated against Intersex Genital Mutilation via essays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-positive-intersex-positive_us_58e6d8d7e4b0acd784ca56cd/ Remember: Sex Positive = Intersex Positive, Huffington Post, April 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/09/27/op-ed-why-we-must-protect-intersex-babies/ Why We Must Protect Intersex Babies, The Advocate, September 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; and in her memoir ''Born Both: An Intersex LIfe''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/hida-viloria/born-both/9780316347846/ Born Both: An Intersex LIfe, Hachette Books, March 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Book reception ===

In January 2017, Kirkus reviewed the memoir saying: "Intelligent and courageous, [Born Both] chronicles one intersex person's path to wholeness, but it also affirms the right of all intersex and non-binary people to receive dignity and respect".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/hida-viloria/born-both/ Kirkus Review, Born Both, January 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, ''The New York Times'' reviewed ''Born Both'', saying: "Viloria does us the even greater service (it's more of a gift, really) of showing us what it means to live not just as both a man and a woman but also as a third gender that eventually emerges as the right one."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/books/review/memoir-human-body.html/ New in Memoir: The Intersex Body, the Dead Body, the Body in Grief, Meghan Daum, The New York Times, May 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latvian Russian Union''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Krievu savienība}}, {{lang-ru|Русский союз Латвии}}) (LKS) is an ethnic minority,  [[left-wing]] [[list of political parties in Latvia|political party]] in [[Latvia]], supported mainly by ethnic [[Russians]] and other [[Demographics of Latvia#Historical shifts|Russian-speaking minorities]]. The co-chairpersons of the Latvian Russian Union are [[Tatjana Ždanoka]], [[Jurijs Petropavlovskis]] and [[Miroslavs Mitrofanovs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/na-sezde-rsl-zvuchala-kritika-v-adres-soglasiya.d?id=45725362 На съезде РСЛ звучала критика в адрес "Согласия"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402165436/http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/na-sezde-rsl-zvuchala-kritika-v-adres-soglasiya.d?id=45725362 |date=2015-04-02 }} {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party emphasizes issues important to the [[Russians in Latvia|Russian minority in Latvia]]. It requests the granting of [[Latvian nationality law|Latvian citizenship]] to all of Latvia's remaining [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] and supports Russian and [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] as [[Official language|co-official languages]] in municipalities where at least 20% of the population are native speakers of such a language. It supports stronger ties with [[Russia]] and was the only major political organization to oppose Latvia's membership in [[NATO]]. The Latvian Russian Union is very [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], as is its voter base. Economic issues are less emphasized but the party's economic positions tend to be left-wing.

==History==
The party originated as the [[electoral alliance]] '''For Human Rights in a United Latvia''' (ForHRUL) ({{lang-lv|Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā}}, '''PCTVL'''; {{lang-ru|За права человека в единой Латвии}}, '''ЗаПЧЕЛ''') that was established in May 1998 by three political parties: the [[National Harmony Party]], [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] and the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]] (despite the name a hardline communist organization), all of which were mainly supported by [[Russophone]] voters. The alliance won 16 out of 100 seats in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary election]] and 25 seats in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]], as well as 13 out of 60 seats on [[Riga City Council]] in the [[Latvian municipal elections, 2001|2001 municipal elections]]. After the municipal elections, ForHRUL became part of Riga's city government and National Harmony Party member [[Sergejs Dolgopolovs]] became the vice-mayor of Riga.

During this period, ForHRUL's most prominent leaders were [[Jānis Jurkāns]], [[Alfrēds Rubiks]] and [[Tatjana Ždanoka]]. Jurkāns was a leader of the [[Popular Front of Latvia]] and founder of the National Harmony Party; Rubiks and Ždanoka were prominent as leaders of the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Interfront]] movement, the [[Communist Party of Latvia|Latvian branch]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the federalist movement in Latvia in the early 1990s. They are fairly popular in the Russian community but very unpopular among ethnic [[Latvians]]. ForHRUL therefore remained in opposition, because other parties would have faced a backlash from ethnic Latvian voters if they entered into a coalition with Rubiks or Ždanoka.

ForHRUL partially broke up in 2003. The National Harmony Party was the first to leave the alliance and the Socialist Party followed half a year later. The remnant of ForHRUL consisted of [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] and '''[[Free Choice in Peoples' Europe]]''' ({{lang-lv|Brīvā izvēle tautu Eiropā}}, BITE). The latter was composed of dissident Socialist Party and National Harmony Party members, like [[Jakovs Pliners]], who opposed the decision to quit the alliance. This reduced grouping had only 6 members of the [[Saeima]] (out of 25 that the alliance had before the breakup). ForHRUL was the main force supporting [[Russian School Defense Staff]] activities from 2003-2005.

At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Latvia)|first Latvian election to the European Parliament]] in 2004, ForHRUL gained one seat, held by Tatjana Ždanoka, who sat with [[the Greens–European Free Alliance]] group in the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/whos_mep.data?ipid=0&amp;ilg=EN&amp;iucd=28619&amp;ipolgrp=Verts/ALE&amp;ictry=.&amp;itempl=&amp;ireturn=&amp;imode={{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/whos_mep.data?ipid=0&amp;ilg=EN&amp;iucd=28619&amp;ipolgrp=Verts/ALE&amp;ictry=.&amp;itempl=&amp;ireturn=&amp;imode={{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposed the idea of a Europe-wide party of ethnic Russians. ForHRUL supported a federal Europe, with a "common economic and political space from [[Lisbon]] to [[Vladivostok]]".

In 2007 ForHRUL was transformed into a single party that retained the name and identity of the old electoral alliance. In recent years the party's support has declined as ethnic Russian voters have switched allegiance to the [[Social Democratic Party "Harmony"|Harmony]] party, successor to the National Harmony Party. At the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]], the party lost its representation in the Latvian Parliament.

In 2011, the party launched an unsuccessful [[Amendments to the Citizenship Law (popular initiative, Latvia)|popular initiative]] on amending the [[Latvian nationality law|law governing Latvian nationality]]. The Central Electoral Commission considered the proposed amendment to be incompatible with the [[Constitution of Latvia]] and the process of collecting signatures for a [[referendum]] on the proposals was suspended. This decision was eventually upheld by the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] and the [[Supreme Court of Latvia]]. It also supported the [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|2012 initiative]] to make Russian a co-official language in Latvia.

In January 2014 ForHRUL changed its name to the '''Latvian Russian Union'''. At the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Latvia)|2014 European Parliament election]], it retained its single seat in the European Parliament. The party supported the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] by Russia in 2014 and has taken a pro-Russian stance in the subsequent [[War in Donbass]]. In August 2014 the party signed a cooperation agreement with the Crimean branch of [[Russian Unity]] to "strengthen the unity of [[Russian World|Russian world]]". Russian Unity was instrumental in making the annexation of Crimea possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/35355/#.VA97mRbgJHU|title=Pro Russia party signs major deal with Crimea group|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825054616/http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/35355/#.VA97mRbgJHU|archivedate=2014-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRUUP304114&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/30/7024081/ Court banned the party of Aksenov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910044740/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/30/7024081/ |date=2014-09-10 }}, [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (2 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web |author=Stay informed today and every day |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/03/russia-and-ukraine |title=Russia and Ukraine: Edging closer to war |publisher=The Economist |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302182845/http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/03/russia-and-ukraine |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GmhCITAR&gt;[http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/727839 Putin signs order appointing Aksyonov interim head of Crimea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002545/http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/727839 |date=2014-05-02 }}, [[ITAR-TASS]] (15 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''M.P.M. Builders, LLC v. Dwyer''''', 442 Mass. 87, 809 [[N.E.2d]] 1053 (2004), was a [[legal case|case]] decided by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] that first adopted the [[Restatement of the law|Restatement Third of Servitudes]] for the relocation of [[easements]] in that state.&lt;ref&gt;''M.P.M. Builders, LLC v. Dwyer'' 442 Mass. 87, 809 N.E.2d 1053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual background==
Dwyer owned a dominant estate that had an easement across a parcel owned by M.P.M. Builders that connected to a public road at several points.  M.P.M. wanted to develop the lots, but the easement ran through the planned development.  M.P.M. proposed to relocate the easement and create new connections to the public road.  Dwyer declined, and M.P.M. sought a declaratory judgment that they were allowed to unilaterally relocate the easement.

==Decision==
The lower [[Massachusetts Land Court|Land Court]] ruled against M.P.M.  The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the Land Court correctly applied existing law, but that the standard for unilateral relocation of an easement by the owner of a servient estate in the Restatement Third of Servitudes was better suited to modern times.  The Restatement allowed for unilateral relocation of the easement if it did not lessen the utility of the easement, increase the burdens on the owner of the easement, or frustrate the purpose of the easement.  The court noted that this may often call for a hearing to determine what would constitute a reasonable relocation.&lt;ref&gt;Casner, A.J. et al.  ''Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition.''

'''Noah Webster Jr.''' (October 16, 1758 – May 28, 1843) was an American [[lexicographer]], textbook pioneer, [[English-language spelling reform]]er, political writer, editor, and prolific author. He has been called the "Father of American Scholarship and Education". His blue-backed speller books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read. Webster's name has become synonymous with "dictionary" in the United States, especially the modern [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary that was  first published in 1828 as ''[[Webster's Dictionary|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]''.

Born in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]], Webster graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1778. He passed the bar examination after studying law under [[Oliver Ellsworth]] and others, but was unable to find work as a lawyer. He found some financial success by opening a private school and writing a series of educational books, including the "Blue-Backed Speller." A strong supporter of the [[American Revolution]] and the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]], Webster hoped his educational works would provide an intellectual foundation for American nationalism; however, by 1820 he became a critic of the society he helped create.

In 1793, [[Alexander Hamilton]] recruited Webster to move to [[New York City]] and become an editor for a [[Federalist Party]] newspaper. He became a prolific author, publishing newspaper articles, political essays, and textbooks. He returned to Connecticut in 1798 and served in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]]. Webster founded the Connecticut Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1791 but later became somewhat disillusioned with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement.

In 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, ''A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language''. The following year, he started working on an expanded and comprehensive dictionary, finally publishing it in 1828. He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in the United States. He was also influential in establishing the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], the first major statutory revision of [[Copyright law of the United States|U.S. copyright law]]. While working on a second volume of his dictionary, Webster died in 1843, and the rights to the dictionary were acquired by [[George Merriam|George and Charles Merriam]].

==Biography==
Webster was born in the Western Division of [[Hartford]] (which became [[West Hartford, Connecticut]]) to an established family. His father Noah Sr. (1722–1813) was a descendant of Connecticut Governor [[John Webster (governor)|John Webster]]; his mother Mercy (Steele) Webster (1727–1794) was a descendant of Governor [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] of [[Plymouth Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Noah had two brothers, Abraham (1751–1831) and Charles (b. 1762), and two sisters, Mercy (1749–1820) and Jerusha (1756–1831).&lt;/ref&gt; His father was primarily a farmer, though he was also deacon of the local [[Congregational church]], captain of the town's militia, and a founder of a local book society (a precursor to the public library).&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Joshua, ''The Forgotten Founding Father'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After American independence, he was appointed a justice of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster's father never attended college, but he was intellectually curious and prized education. Webster's mother spent long hours teaching her children spelling, mathematics, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; At age six, Webster began attending a dilapidated one-room primary school built by West Hartford's Ecclesiastical Society. Years later, he described the teachers as the "dregs of humanity" and complained that the instruction was mainly in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Webster's experiences there motivated him to improve the educational experience of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age fourteen, his church pastor began tutoring him in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] to prepare him for entering [[Yale College]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Webster enrolled at Yale just before his 16th birthday, studying during his senior year with [[Ezra Stiles]], Yale's president. His four years at Yale overlapped the [[American Revolutionary War]] and, because of food shortages and threatened British invasions, many of his classes had to be held in other towns. Webster served in the Connecticut Militia. His father had [[mortgage]]d the farm to send Webster to Yale, but he was now on his own and had nothing more to do with his family.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rollins, ''The Long Journey of Noah Webster'' (1980) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster lacked career plans after graduating from Yale in 1778, later writing that a [[liberal arts education]] "disqualifies a man for business".&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught school briefly in Glastonbury, but the working conditions were harsh and the pay low. He quit to study law.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While studying law under future [[U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice]] [[Oliver Ellsworth]], Webster also taught full-time in Hartford—which was grueling, and ultimately impossible to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; He quit his legal studies for a year and lapsed into a [[clinical depression|depression]]; he then found another practicing attorney to tutor him, and completed his studies and passed the bar examination in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Revolutionary War was still going on, he could not find work as a lawyer. He received a master's degree from Yale by giving an oral dissertation to the Yale graduating class. Later that year, he opened a small private school in western Connecticut that was a success.  Nevertheless, he soon closed it and left town, probably because of a failed romance.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 59-64&lt;/ref&gt; Turning to literary work as a way to overcome his losses and channel his ambitions,&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; he began writing a series of well-received articles for a prominent New England newspaper justifying and praising the American Revolution and arguing that the separation from Britain was permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; He then founded a private school catering to wealthy parents in [[Goshen, New York]] and, by 1785, he had written his speller, a grammar book and a reader for elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from continuing sales of the popular blue-backed speller enabled Webster to spend many years working on his famous dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 71–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster was by nature a revolutionary, seeking American independence from the cultural thralldom to Britain. To replace it, he sought to create a utopian America, cleansed of luxury and ostentation and the champion of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins (1980) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; By 1781, Webster had an expansive view of the new nation. American nationalism was superior to Europe because American values were superior, he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 170&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|America sees the absurdities—she sees the kingdoms of Europe, disturbed by wrangling sectaries, or their commerce, population and improvements of every kind cramped and retarded, because the human mind like the body is fettered 'and bound fast by the chords of policy and superstition': She laughs at their folly and shuns their errors: She founds her empire upon the idea of universal toleration: She admits all religions into her bosom; She secures the sacred rights of every individual; and (astonishing absurdity to Europeans!) she sees a thousand discordant opinions live in the strictest harmony ... it will finally raise her to a pitch of greatness and lustre, before which the glory of ancient Greece and Rome shall dwindle to a point, and the splendor of modern Empires fade into obscurity.}}

Webster dedicated his ''Speller'' and ''Dictionary'' to providing an intellectual foundation for American nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.noahwebsterhouse.org/discover/noah-webster-biography.htm|title=Noah Webster Biography {{!}} Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society {{!}} West Hartford, Connecticut (CT)|website=www.noahwebsterhouse.org|access-date=2017-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105000628/http://noahwebsterhouse.org/discover/noah-webster-biography.htm#|archive-date=November 5, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1787 to 1789, Webster was an outspoken supporter of the new Constitution. In October 1787, he wrote a pamphlet entitled "An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution Proposed by the Late Convention Held at Philadelphia," published under the pen name "A Citizen of America."&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Joshua, ''The Forgotten Founding Father'', pp. 147–49&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was influential, particularly outside New York State.

In terms of political theory, he de-emphasized virtue (a core value of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]) and emphasized widespread ownership of property (a key element of Federalism). He was one of the few Americans who paid much attention to French theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. It was not Rousseau's politics but his ideas on pedagogy in ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) that influenced Webster in adjusting his ''Speller'' to the stages of a child's development.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, (1980) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federalist editor==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Noah Webster's prospectus for his English language dictionary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''To the Friends of Literature in the United States'', Webster's [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for his first dictionary of the English language, 1807–1808]]
Webster married well and had joined the elite in Hartford but did not have much money. In 1793, [[Alexander Hamilton]] lent him $1,500 to move to New York City to edit the leading [[Federalist Party]] newspaper. In December, he founded New York's first daily newspaper ''American Minerva'' (later known as the ''[[Commercial Advertiser]]''), which he edited for four years, writing the equivalent of 20 volumes of articles and editorials. He also published the semi-weekly publication ''The Herald, A Gazette for the country'' (later known as ''The New York Spectator'').

As a Federalist spokesman, he defended the administrations of [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]], especially their policy of neutrality between Britain and France, and he especially criticized the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and its [[Reign of Terror]].  When French ambassador [[Edmond-Charles Genêt|Citizen Genêt]] set up a network of pro-Jacobin "[[Democratic-Republican Societies]]" that entered American politics and attacked President Washington, he condemned them. He later defended [[Jay's Treaty]] between the United States and Britain.  As a result, he was repeatedly denounced by the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] as "a pusillanimous, half-begotten, self-dubbed patriot," "an incurable lunatic," and "a deceitful newsmonger ... Pedagogue and Quack."  &lt;ref&gt;Ellis 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1799.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, he was one of the most prolific authors in the new nation, publishing textbooks, political essays, a report on infectious diseases, and newspaper articles for his Federalist party. He wrote so much that a modern bibliography of his published works required 655 pages. He moved back to New Haven in 1798; he was elected as a Federalist to the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]] in 1800 and 1802–1807.

==Copyright==
The [[Copyright Act of 1831]] was the first major statutory revision of [[U.S. copyright law]], a result of intensive lobbying by Noah Webster and his agents in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cgi-bin/kleioc/0010/exec/ausgabe/%22us_1831%22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001230838/http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cgi-bin/kleioc/0010/exec/ausgabe/%22us_1831%22 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 1, 2008 |title=Copyright Act (1831), Primary Sources on Copyright (1450–1900), eds L. Bently &amp; M. Kretschmer |publisher=Copyrighthistory.org |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster also played a critical role lobbying individual states throughout the country during the 1780s to pass the first American copyright laws, which were expected to have distinct nationalistic implications for the infant nation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Pelanda, "Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783–1787" 58 ''[[Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A.]]'' 431, 437–42 (2011) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941506 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue-backed speller==
[[File:Noah Webster statue by Korczak Ziółkowski.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A 1932 statue of Webster by [[Korczak Ziółkowski]] stands in front of the public library of [[West Hartford, Connecticut]].]]
As a teacher, he had come to dislike American elementary schools. They could be overcrowded, with up to seventy children of all ages crammed into [[one-room schoolhouse]]s. They had poor, underpaid staff, no desks, and unsatisfactory textbooks that came from England. Webster thought that Americans should learn from American books, so he began writing the three volume compendium ''A Grammatical Institute of the English Language''. The work consisted of a speller (published in 1783), a grammar (published in 1784), and a reader (published in 1785). His goal was to provide a uniquely American approach to training children. His most important improvement, he claimed, was to rescue "our native tongue" from "the clamour&lt;ref&gt;Citing this article, "at first he kept the ''u'' in words like ''colour'' or ''favour''" so this quotation should have a 'U' in clamour&lt;/ref&gt; of pedantry" that surrounded English grammar and pronunciation. He complained that the English language had been corrupted by the British aristocracy, which set its own standard for proper spelling and pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Pelanda, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941506 Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783–1787] 58 Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. 431, 431–454 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Webster rejected the notion that the study of Greek and Latin must precede the study of English grammar. The appropriate standard for the American language, argued Webster, was "the same republican principles as American civil and ecclesiastical constitutions." This meant that the people-at-large must control the language; popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language.

The ''Speller'' was arranged so that it could be easily taught to students, and it progressed by age. From his own experiences as a teacher, Webster thought that the ''Speller'' should be simple and gave an orderly presentation of words and the rules of spelling and pronunciation. He believed that students learned most readily when he broke a complex problem into its component parts and had each pupil master one part before moving to the next. Ellis argues that Webster anticipated some of the insights currently associated with [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]. Webster said that children pass through distinctive learning phases in which they master increasingly complex or abstract tasks. Therefore, teachers must not try to teach a three-year-old how to read; they could not do it until age five. He organized his speller accordingly, beginning with the alphabet and moving systematically through the different sounds of vowels and consonants, then syllables, then simple words, then more complex words, then sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speller was originally titled ''The First Part of the Grammatical Institute of the English Language''. Over the course of 385 editions in his lifetime, the title was changed in 1786 to ''The American Spelling Book'', and again in 1829 to ''The Elementary Spelling Book''. Most people called it the "Blue-Backed Speller" because of its blue cover and, for the next one hundred years, Webster's book taught children how to read, spell, and pronounce words. It was the most popular American book of its time; by 1837, it had sold 15 million copies, and some 60 million by 1890—reaching the majority of young students in the nation's first century. Its royalty of a half-cent per copy was enough to sustain Webster in his other endeavors. It also helped create the popular contests known as [[spelling bee]]s.
[[File:Handwritten drafts of dictionary entries Noah Webster.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Handwriting|Handwritten]] drafts of dictionary entries by Webster]]
As time went on, Webster changed the spellings in the book to more phonetic ones. Most of them already existed as alternative spellings.&lt;ref name=algeo599&gt;Algeo, John. "The Effects of the Revolution on Language," in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; He chose spellings such as ''defense'', ''color'', and ''traveler'', and changed the ''re'' to ''er'' in words such as ''center''. He also changed ''tongue'' to the older spelling ''tung'', but this did not catch on.&lt;ref&gt;Scudder 1881, pp. 245–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part three of his ''Grammatical Institute'' (1785) was a reader designed to uplift the mind and "diffuse the principles of virtue and patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harry Redcay |last=Warfel |title=Noah Webster, schoolmaster to America |year=1966 |page=86 |location=New York |publisher=Octagon |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the choice of pieces," he explained, "I have not been inattentive to the political interests of America. Several of those masterly addresses of Congress, written at the commencement of the late Revolution, contain such noble, just, and independent sentiments of liberty and patriotism, that I cannot help wishing to transfuse them into the breasts of the rising generation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Students received the usual quota of Plutarch, Shakespeare, Swift, and Addison, as well as such Americans as [[Joel Barlow]]'s ''[[The Columbiad|Vision of Columbus]]'', [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]]'s ''Conquest of Canaan'', and [[John Trumbull (poet)|John Trumbull]]'s poem ''[[M'Fingal]].'' He included excerpts from [[Tom Paine]]'s ''The Crisis'' and an essay by [[Thomas Day]] calling for the abolition of slavery in accord with the Declaration of Independence.

Webster's ''Speller'' was entirely secular by design.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''After the Revolution: Profiles of Early American Culture'' (1979) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  It ended with two pages of important dates in American history, beginning with Columbus's discovery of America in 1492 and ending with the [[Siege of Yorktown|battle of Yorktown]] in 1781. There was no mention of God, the Bible, or sacred events. "Let sacred things be appropriated for sacred purposes," wrote Webster. As Ellis explains, "Webster began to construct a secular catechism to the nation-state. Here was the first appearance of 'civics' in American schoolbooks. In this sense, Webster's speller becoming what was to be the secular successor to ''The New England Primer'' with its explicitly biblical injunctions."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Webster became intensely religious and added religious themes. However, after 1840, Webster's books lost market share to the ''McGuffey Eclectic Readers'' of [[William Holmes McGuffey]], which sold over 120 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John H. III |last=Westerhoff |title=McGuffey and His Readers: Piety, Morality, and Education in Nineteenth-Century America |year=1978 |location=Nashville |publisher=Abingdon |isbn=0-687-23850-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent P. Bynack (1984) examines Webster in relation to his commitment to the idea of a unified American national culture that would stave off the decline of republican virtues and solidarity. Webster acquired his perspective on language from such theorists as [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Johann David Michaelis|Michaelis]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. There he found the belief that a nation's linguistic forms and the thoughts correlated with them shaped individuals' behavior. Thus, the etymological clarification and reform of American English promised to improve citizens' manners and thereby preserve republican purity and social stability. This presupposition animated Webster's ''Speller'' and ''Grammar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vincent P. |last=Bynack |title=Noah Webster and the Idea of a National Culture: the Pathologies of Epistemology |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1984 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=99–114 |doi= 10.2307/2709333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictionary==

===Publication===
[[File:Noah Webster 1958 issue.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Noah Webster honoured on US Postage stamp, issue of 1958]]
In 1806, Webster published his first [[dictionary]], [[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|''A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language'']]. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-six years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-eight languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), Gothic, German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, Welsh, Russian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]]. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used different languages. They also spelled, pronounced, and used English words differently.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Ellen Holmes. "[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/25489 The Standardization of American English,]" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org], accessed March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in January 1825 in a boarding house in [[Cambridge]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jill |last=Lepore |title=The Story of America: Essays on Origins |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-691-15399-5 |pages=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster preferred spellings that matched pronunciation better. In ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2008), John Algeo notes: "It is often assumed that characteristically [[American and British English spelling differences|American spellings]] were invented by Noah Webster. He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in America, but he did not originate them. Rather […] he chose already existing options such as ''center, color'' and ''check'' on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology."&lt;ref name="algeo599"/&gt; He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828, registering the copyright on April 14.&lt;ref name="Wright2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Russell O.|title=Chronology of education in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBGcAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 13, 2012|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2502-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it now has an honored place in the history of American English, Webster's first dictionary only sold 2,500 copies. He was forced to mortgage his home to develop a second edition, and his life from then on was plagued with debt.

In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. On May 28, 1843, a few days after he had completed revising an appendix to the second edition, and with much of his efforts with the dictionary still unrecognized, Noah Webster died. The rights to his dictionary were acquired by George and Charles Merriam in 1843 from Webster's estate and all contemporary [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries trace their lineage to that of Webster, although many others have adopted his name, attempting to share in the prestige.

===Impact===
Lepore (2008) demonstrates Webster's paradoxical ideas about language and politics and shows why Webster's endeavors were at first so poorly received. Culturally conservative Federalists denounced the work as radical—too inclusive in its lexicon and even bordering on vulgar. Meanwhile, Webster's old foes the Republicans attacked the man, labeling him mad for such an undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jill |last=Lepore |chapter=Introduction |editor-first=Arthur |editor-last=Schulman |title=Websterisms: A Collection of Words and Definitions Set Forth by the Founding Father of American English |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2008 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have long seen Webster's 1844 dictionary to be an important resource for reading poet [[Emily Dickinson]]'s life and work; she once commented that the "Lexicon" was her "only companion" for years. One biographer said, "The dictionary was no mere reference book to her; she read it as a priest his breviary—over and over, page by page, with utter absorption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jed |last=Deppman |title='I Could Not Have Defined the Change': Rereading Dickinson's Definition Poetry |journal=Emily Dickinson Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=49–80 |doi=10.1353/edj.2002.0005 }} Martha Dickinson Bianchi, ''The life and letters of Emily Dickinson'' (1924) p. 80 for quote&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Austin has explored the intersection of lexicographical and poetic practices in American literature, and attempts to map out a "lexical poetics" using Webster's definitions as his base. Poets mined his dictionaries, often drawing upon the lexicography in order to express word play. Austin explicates key definitions from both the ''Compendious'' (1806) and ''American'' (1828) dictionaries, and finds a range of themes such as the politics of "American" versus "British"  English and issues of national identity and independent culture. Austin argues that Webster's dictionaries helped redefine Americanism in an era of highly flexible cultural identity. Webster himself saw the dictionaries as a nationalizing device to separate America from Britain, calling his project a "federal language", with competing forces towards regularity on the one hand and innovation on the other. Austin suggests that the contradictions of Webster's lexicography were part of a larger play between liberty and order within American intellectual discourse, with some pulled toward Europe and the past, and others pulled toward America and the new future.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan W. Austin, "Lost in the Maze of Words: Reading and Re-reading Noah Webster's Dictionaries", ''Dissertation Abstracts International'', 2005, Vol. 65 Issue 12, p. 4561&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 [[Blackie and Son]] in Glasgow published the first general dictionary of English that relied heavily upon pictorial illustrations integrated with the text. Its ''The Imperial Dictionary, English, Technological, and Scientific, Adapted to the Present State of Literature, Science, and Art; On the Basis of Webster's English Dictionary'' used Webster's for most of their text, adding some additional technical words that went with illustrations of machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Hancher |title=Gazing at the Imperial Dictionary |journal=Book History |volume=1 |year=1998 |pages=156–181 |doi=10.1353/bh.1998.0006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
[[File:Noah Webster letter to Eliza Webster on abolitionism 1837.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Letter from Webster to daughter Eliza, 1837, warning of perils of the abolitionist movement]]

Webster in early life was something of a freethinker, but in 1808 he became a convert to Calvinistic orthodoxy, and thereafter became a devout [[Congregationalist]] who preached the need to Christianize the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Webster grew increasingly authoritarian and elitist, fighting against the prevailing grain of [[Jacksonian Democracy]]. Webster viewed language as a tool to control unruly thoughts. His ''American Dictionary'' emphasized the virtues of social control over human passions and individualism, submission to authority, and fear of God; they were necessary for the maintenance of the American social order. As he grew older, Webster's attitudes changed from those of an optimistic revolutionary in the 1780s to those of a pessimistic critic of man and society by the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1828 ''American Dictionary'' contained the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. Webster considered education "useless without the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Babson Fuhrer|title=A Crisis of Community: The Trials and Transformation of a New England Town, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMIBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294|year=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster released his own edition of the Bible in 1833, called the [[Common Version]]. He used the [[King James Version]] (KJV) as a base and consulted the Hebrew and Greek along with various other versions and commentaries. Webster molded the KJV to correct grammar, replaced words that were no longer used, and did away with words and phrases that could be seen as offensive.

In 1834, he published ''Value of the Bible and Excellence of the Christian Religion'',  an [[apologetics|apologetic]] book in defense of the Bible and Christianity itself.

==Opposition to slavery==
Webster helped found the Connecticut Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1791,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSGv0uGKkYC&amp;pg=PA1801&amp;lpg=PA1801&amp;dq=%22noah+webster%22+abolitionist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-2z0AiAa_v&amp;sig=PhQlFC25GRnmWsaHIWbnljRqHYE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NPz6S7b2DJKKNe_srIQI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Noah Webster and the First American Dictionary, Luisanna Fodde Melis, Rosen Publishing Group, New York, 2005 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the 1830s rejected the new tone among [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] that emphasized Americans who tolerated slavery were themselves sinners. In 1837, Webster warned his daughter Eliza about her fervent support of the abolitionist cause. Webster wrote, "slavery is a great sin and a general calamity—but it is not ''our'' sin, though it may prove to be a terrible calamity to us in the north. But we cannot legally interfere with the South on this subject."&lt;ref name="americanaejournal.hu"&gt;Florea, Silvia. ''Americana'' Vol. VI, No 2, Fall 2010 "Lessons from the Heart and Hearth of Colonial Philadelphia: Reflections on Education, As Reflected in Colonial Era Correspondence to Wives." [http://americanaejournal.hu/vol6no2/florea#fn7]&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "To come north to preach and thus disturb ''our'' peace, when we can legally do nothing to effect this object, is, in my view, highly criminal and the preachers of abolitionism deserve the penitentiary."&lt;ref name="americanaejournal.hu"/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Portrait of Rebecca Greenleaf Webster by Jared Bradley Flagg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebecca Greenleaf Webster, wife of Noah Webster]]

Noah Webster married Rebecca Greenleaf (1766–1847) on October 26, 1789, New Haven, Connecticut. They had eight children:
* Emily Schotten (1790–1861), who married [[William W. Ellsworth]], named by Webster as an executor of his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=%22william+w.+ellsworth%22+noah+webster+williams&amp;source=web&amp;ots=2z4vmPgtp7&amp;sig=14qy7-AvrwqU_tznFVP0jXNTKgk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result |title=Noah Webster and the American Dictionary, David Micklethwait, McFarland, 2005 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily, their daughter, married Rev. Abner Jackson, who became president of both Hartford's [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3hPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=%22william+greenleaf+webster%22+ellsworth&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA218,M1 |title=Genealogy of the Greenleaf family |publisher=F.

* Frances Julianna (1793–1869), married [[Chauncey Allen Goodrich]]
* Harriet (1797–1844), who married [[William Chauncey Fowler]]
* Mary (1799–1819)
* William Greenleaf (1801–1869)

* Louisa Greenleaf (1808-1874)

He moved to [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] in 1812, where he helped to found [[Amherst College]]. In 1822 the family moved back to New Haven, where Webster was awarded an honorary degree from Yale the following year. He is buried in New Haven's [[Grove Street Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|1084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">In South Korea, an '''officetel''' ({{lang-ko|오피스텔}}, a [[portmanteau]] of 'office' and 'hotel'), is a multi-purpose building with residential and commercial units.
This is a type of [[studio apartment]] or [[studio flat]].

An officetel is designed to be a partially self-contained building, such that its occupants can live and work in the same building, minimizing commute time. Because of the convenience of having daily routines located in one building, a significant proportion of the officetel's inhabitants include lawyers, accountants, tax accountants, professors, and artists. Office space is usually parceled out or leased to trading companies and small- to medium-sized businesses.

Officetels are mainly found downtown or around major transportation hubs. As the scale of construction grows over time, officetels tend to offer more commercial and housing features through amenities like sports centers and shopping facilities. After the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian financial crisis of 1997]], the construction of officetels has increased rapidly due to governmental deregulations, and they are now taking a substantial portion of the housing market in the [[Seoul Metropolitan Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee SangYoung, Kim ByungUk 2002 "오피스텔 시장분석과 수익률 추정" ''감정평가연구'' 12(2), pp.91-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Officetel parcels are commonly 50 to 100 m² in size. Most officetel residential spaces are a [[studio apartment]] with bathroom, kitchen, and bed areas. Basic furnishings are usually included with an officetel lease. It is currently illegal to have an [[Ondol]] tub or balcony heating systems in an officetel.

==History==
The first officetel was built in [[Mapo-gu|Mapo]], [[Seoul]] by the [[Korea Development Corporation]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Joe. ''Lovenests: Newlyweds of the Asian Tigers''. HarperCollins, New York, 1996. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, demand increased, so construction companies and housing cooperations took part in the growing the trend of building officetels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9478">The '''Pan-Sahel Initiative''', according to a November 7, 2002, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/14987.htm news release]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism|Office of Counterterrorism]], U.S. [[Department of State]], was "a State-led effort to assist [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], and [[Mauritania]] in detecting and responding to suspicious movement of people and goods across and within their borders through training, equipment and cooperation. Its goals support two U.S. national security interests in Africa: waging the [[War on Terrorism]] and enhancing regional peace and security." It was in 2005 superseded by the larger-scope [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]], which in turn was incorporated into the [[United States Africa Command]] in 2008. 

==Pan-Sahel Initiative==
PSI drew criticism for its lack of attention of underlying regional economic problems and local political struggles, the conduct of partner governments against those suspected of being "terrorists", and for indirectly radicalizing certain groups living in or near the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0711/p11s01-coop.html] [http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_17/Review_17-38.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;-
 
"According to State Department officials, the Pan-[[Sahel]] region of Africa has become important in the global security arena. Vast expanses of unpopulated areas, instability, porous borders and corruption make [[Africa]] an inviting playground for terrorists." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eucom.mil/Directorates/ECPA/News/Release/031704.htm&amp;2]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Voice of America]]'s [[Alex Belida]] reported on November 14, 2003, that the "multimillion dollar security training and equipment program" was "at last under way" in Mali, "a year after it was announced." The program was to continue in the other three countries "over the next several months." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/11/mil-031114-2fe6bfc0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Belida said that "Army Colonel [[John Schnibben]], operations director at [[U.S. European Command]], responsible for most of sub-Saharan Africa, says the effort could have a big pay-off for the United States and its Sahel partners."
 
Belida reported that in October 2002, "AF DAS [[Robert Perry (diplomat)|Robert Perry]] and S/CT Deputy Coordinator [[Stephanie Kinney]], along with other State representatives, visited Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Mali, briefing host nations on the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) ... a program designed to protect borders, track movement of people, combat [[terrorism]], and enhance regional cooperation and stability."
 
Beginning in November 2002, "technical assessments" took place in each country to "help focus training and other capacity building resources." PSI was to "assist participating countries to counter known terrorist operations and border incursions, as well as trafficking of people, illicit materials, and other goods."
 
In addition to the "training and material support," the release states, another program would "bring military and civilian officials from the four countries together to encourage greater cooperation and information exchange within and among the governments of the region on counterterrorism and border security issues."
 
The Associated Press reported on May 6, 2004, that "The European Command has proposed expanding the Pan-Sahel Initiative to include Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, where terror threats are believed to be growing...." [AP link not working.]
			
In the May 11, 2004, ''New York Times'', Craig Smith &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/11/international/africa/11AFRI.html?th writes]&lt;/ref&gt; that the "U.S. [is] Training African Forces to Uproot Terrorists."		
			
Smith says that the Pan-Sahel Initiative "was begun with $7 million and focused on [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]] and [[Chad]]. It is being expanded to include Senegal and possibly other countries. The [[U.S. European Command]] has asked for $125 million for the region over five years."The Pan-Sahel Initiative is the newest front in the "American campaign against [[terrorism]] ... in a region that military officials fear could become the next base for [[Al Qaeda]] -- the largely ungoverned swath of territory stretching from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the Western Sahara's Atlantic coast," he writes.
 			
"Generals here ... say the vast, arid region is a new [[Afghanistan]], with well-financed bands of Islamic militants recruiting, training and arming themselves. Terrorist attacks like the one on March 11 [2004] in Madrid that killed 191 people seem to have a North African link, investigators say, and may presage others in Europe."
			
"Having learned from missteps in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]," he says, "the American officers are pursuing this battle with a new approach. Instead of planning on a heavy American military presence, they are dispatching Special Operations forces to countries like Mali and Mauritania in West Africa to train soldiers and outfit them with pickup trucks, radios and global-positioning equipment."

Drew Brown, in his May 12, 2004, Knight Ridder article &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=20670&amp;archive=true "U.S. stepping up anti-terrorism efforts in Africa,"]&lt;/ref&gt; adds that "Marine Corps Gen. [[James L. Jones|James Jones]], the commander of U.S. European Command, which covers most of Africa ... said that shortly after he took command of [[NATO]] in January 2002, a six-month analysis of U.S. force structure within European Command concluded that the United States likely would face a number of security challenges in Africa over the next 10 to 15 years and that a more robust engagement was needed.

"Late last year, soldiers from the 10th Special Forces Group began training military forces in Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger under the Pan-Sahel Initiative, a $7 million State Department program designed to help the security forces of those impoverished nations defend against terrorists.

"That effort follows the establishment of Task Force Horn of Africa, where more than 1,200 Marines and special-operations soldiers are heading up anti-terror training and operations in eastern Africa from a base in [[Djibouti]].

"No U.S. forces have been committed to combat in Africa, Jones said. Involvement has consisted primarily of training and advisory teams."

In 2009, a ''NYTimes'' article reviewed the PSI, particularly as it played out in and now underlies current policy scenarios in Mauritania.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15Africa-t.html?ref=magazine "The Saharan Conundrum"] by Nicholas Schmidle, ''The New York Times Magazine'', p.

A '''patrol''' is commonly a group of personnel, such as [[law enforcement officers]], [[military personnel]], or [[private security contractors]] that are assigned to monitor a specific [[geographic]] area.

This is also often referred to as a [[beat (police)|beat]].

== Military ==

{{seealso|Patrolling}}

In [[military tactics]], a '''patrol''' is a [[sub-subunit]] or small tactical formation, sent out from a military organization by land, sea or air for the purpose of combat, [[reconnaissance]], or a combination of both. The basic task of a patrol is to follow a known route with the purpose of investigating some feature of interest or, in the assignment of a '''fighting patrol''' (US '''combat patrol'''), to find and engage the enemy. A '''patrol''' can also mean a small [[cavalry]] or [[armoured warfare|armoured]] [[military unit|unit]], subordinate to a [[troop]] or [[platoon]], usually comprising a [[Section (military unit)|section]] or [[squad]] of mounted [[trooper (rank)|trooper]]s, or two [[armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] (often [[tank]]s).

== Law enforcement ==


[[File:Border Patrol in Montana.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent monitoring the U.S.-Canada border in [[Montana]]. Many more agents are stationed at the US Mexico border to combat illegal immigration]]

In non-military [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], '''patrol officers''' are law enforcement officers assigned to monitor specified geographic areas—that is, to move through their areas at regular intervals looking out for any signs of problems of any kind.  They are the officers most commonly encountered by the public, as their duties include responding to calls for service, making arrests, resolving disputes, taking crime reports, and conducting traffic enforcement, and other crime prevention measures. A patrol officer is often the [[first responder|first to arrive]] on the scene of any incident; what such an officer does or fails to do at the scene can greatly influence the outcome of any subsequent investigation. The patrol officer, as the person who is in the field daily, is often closest to potential crime and may have developed contacts who can provide information.

The [[Philadelphia]] Foot Patrol Experiment, a randomized control trial conducted by [[Temple University]], has shown that foot patrols reduce crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publichealthlawresearch.org/keywords/foot-patrol/news/philadelphia-foot-patrol-experiment  Public Health Law Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618144337/http://publichealthlawresearch.org/keywords/foot-patrol/news/philadelphia-foot-patrol-experiment |date=2011-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the resources to patrol 60 locations, researchers identified the highest violent crime corners in the city, using data from 2006 to 2008. Police commanders designed 120 foot patrol areas around these corners, and stratified randomization was used to assign pairs of foot patrols with similar crime rates as either a comparison or a target area. Officers generally patrolled in pairs with two pairs assigned to each foot patrol. After three months, relative to the comparison areas, violent crime decreased 23%.

Official records of police activities during the intervention period reveal the following in the target areas:

* Drug‐related incident detections increased 15%
* Pedestrian stops increased 64%
* Vehicle stops increased 7%
* Arrests increased 13%

An emerging trend within patrol is the supplement{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} of basic police patrol with that of private security agencies. The privatization of police is explored in [[James F. Pastor|James Pastor's]] book ''The Privatization of Police in America: An Analysis and Case Study''.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor, James. ''The Privatization of Police in America: An Analysis and Case Study''. McFarland &amp; Company, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law enforcement in the United States|Law enforcement]] patrols don’t always just enforce the laws during the patrols. They also try and have community relations, will investigate traffic accidents and transport criminals. They will go to schools to talk about their jobs or about drugs and safe driving. In some large cities, the police chief will go around to meet and talk with business owners, residents or anyone in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://work.chron.com/basic-police-patrol-duties-11633.html|title=Basic Police Patrol Duties|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
From [[French language|French]] ''patrouiller'' from [[Old French]] ''patouiller'' (“to paddle, paw about, patrol”) from ''patte'' (“a paw”)

== Non-law enforcement patrols ==
=== Schools ===
Some [[elementary school]]s use the term ''patrol'' to refer to students who are selected to monitor [[safety]] in the [[classroom]] or to those students who assist [[crossing guard]]s with safety of children crossing busy [[street]]s.  Another common term for this use of patrol is ''[[hall monitor]]''.

=== Scouting ===
{{main| Scout patrol}}
In [[Scouting]], a [[scout patrol|patrol]] is six to eight [[Scout (Scouting)|Scout]]s (youth members) under the leadership of one of their number who is appointed Patrol Leader and supported by a Second or Assistant Patrol Leader. This is the basic unit of a [[Scout troop]]. The ''[[Scout method#Patrol system|Patrol method]]'' is an essential characteristic of Scouting by which it differs from all other organizations, using the natural dynamics of the ''gang'' for an educational purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, John (1950) [http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/patrolleader.pdf ''The Patrol Leader's Handbook''], The Boy Scouts Association, London (pp. 4-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pax Syriana''''' ([[Latin|Lat.]], "Syrian Peace") is a [[Historiography|historiographical term]], modeled after the original phrase ''[[Pax Romana]]'', used in the study of [[international relations]] in [[Western Asia]], usually pertaining to efforts by [[Syria]] to influence its neighbors, particularly [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="syriana definition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/lebanon/national_security/lebanon_national_security_pax_syriana.html |title=Lebanon  Pax Syriana |accessdate=2007-03-01 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind Pax Syriana is that Syria, through [[diplomacy]] and [[military]] strength, could secure peace in Lebanon.

An earlier reference was published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1976, referring to Syrian efforts to impose a [[truce]] during the early years of the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Time mag"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Back to the Brink with a Demi-Coup | work = | publisher =Time Magazine | date =March 22, 1976 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911762,00.html | doi = | accessdate = May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ME journal"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =Veenhoven  | first =Willem A., ed.  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =

It may be used with emphasis on the relative calm following suppression of the Lebanese Civil War, or on suggestions of Syria's having [[irredentism|intentions for annexing]] or otherwise [[Peace|pacifying]] Lebanon.&lt;ref name="syrian peace"&gt;{{cite web | last =Ghattas | first =Kim | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The end of sectarianism in Lebanon? | work = | publisher =Bitterlemons-international.org/ | date =March 24, 2005 | url =http://www.bitterlemons-international.org/previous.php?opt=1&amp;id=77#315 | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1986, [[Syrian Army|Syrian troops]] entered [[West Beirut]] for the first time since being expelled during the [[Peace for Galilee|1982 Israeli invasion]]. Approximately 500 Syrian troops, working with the [[Lebanese Army]] and police, cleared roadblocks, closed militia offices, and collected weapons. In mid-February 1987, however, a new round of fighting broke out in West Beirut, this time between [[Lebanese Druze|Druze]] and [[Lebanese Shia Muslims|Shia]] militias, both of which were regarded as Syrian allies. The combat was described by witnesses as being of unrivaled intensity in twelve years of war, with the militiamen using formations of Soviet-made [[T-54 tank]]s that Syria had supplied to both sides. Five days of combat caused an estimated 700 casualties and set much of West Beirut aflame.&lt;ref name="TheLibrary"&gt;The Library of Congress, [https://www.loc.gov/item/87600488/ Syria : A Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria acted decisively to stop the chaos in West Beirut, and it seized the opportunity to reimpose its hegemony over the areas in Lebanon from which it had been evicted by Israel in 1982. On February 22, 1987, it dispatched 7,500 troops, configured in two brigades and a battalion, from eastern Lebanon. The Syrian troops, most of whom were veteran [[commando]]s, closed down some seventy militia offices, rounded up and arrested militia leaders, confiscated arms caches, deployed troops along the major roads and at [[Beirut International Airport]], established checkpoints, and sent squads on patrol in the streets.&lt;ref name="TheLibrary" /&gt;

The Syrian Army did not shy away from violence in its effort to restore order to the Lebanese capital. In the first two days of its police operation, Syrian troops shot some fifteen Lebanese of various militias. Then on February 24 a dozen trucks full of Syrian commandos entered the [[Basta Faouka|Basta]] neighborhood, a Shia stronghold, and attacked the Fathallah barracks, the headquarters of the [[Hezbollah]] organization. There, Syrian troops killed eighteen Hezbollah militants.&lt;ref name="TheLibrary" /&gt;

In mid-April the Syrian Army deployed troops south of Beirut. Approximately 100 Syrian commandos, fighting alongside soldiers of the Lebanese Army's Sixth Brigade, occupied key positions along the strategic coastal highway linking Beirut with southern Lebanon and took control of the bridge over the Awali River, near Sidon.&lt;ref name="TheLibrary" /&gt;

By mid-1987 the Syrian Army appeared to have settled into Beirut for a protracted stay. Lebanon's [[anomie]] was regarded by Syrian officials as an unacceptable risk to Syrian security. The government of Syria appeared prepared to occupy Beirut permanently, if necessary. The senior Syrian military commander in Lebanon, Brigadier General [[Ghazi Kanaan]], said that militia rule of Lebanon had ended and that the Syrian intervention was "open-ended," implying that Syria would occupy West Beirut indefinitely. Meanwhile, Syrian officials indicated that thousands of additional Syrian troops would probably be sent to Beirut to ensure stability. Kanaan declared that Syria would take full responsibility for the security of foreign embassies in West Beirut, and he invited foreign missions to return. Kanaan also promised that Syria would expend all possible efforts to secure the release of Western hostages held by Lebanese terrorists.&lt;ref name="TheLibrary" /&gt;

==Other usage==
The name of the 2005 film ''[[Syriana]]'' was apparently inspired by ''Pax Syriana''. According to the film's publicity materials, "Syriana" was "a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East."&lt;ref name="syriana movie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/syriana/ |title=Syriana: About the Film |accessdate=2007-03-01 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online discussion with ''The Washington Post'' in November 2005, ''Syriana'' director [[Stephen Gaghan]] said he saw Syriana as "a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs."&lt;ref name="gaghan"&gt;{{cite news   | last =  Gaghan| first =  Stephen| coauthors =  | title =Movies: 'Syriana'  | work =Online transcript  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =The Washington Post  | date =November 15, 2005  | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/11/14/DI2005111400923.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">In [[economics]], '''resource allocation''' is the assignment of available [[resource]]s to various uses. In the context of an entire economy, resources can be allocated by various means, such as [[market (economics)|markets]] or [[central planning]]. 

In [[project management]], '''resource allocation''' or [[resource management]] is the scheduling of activities and the resources required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name: * |url=http://www.pmhut.com/pmo-and-project-management-dictionary |title=PMO and Project Management Dictionary |publisher=Pmhut.com |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

In [[economics]], the area of [[public finance]] deals with three broad areas: [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] stabilization, the [[distribution of income]] and wealth, and the allocation of resources. Much of the study of the allocation of resources is devoted to finding the conditions under which particular mechanisms of resource allocation lead to [[Pareto efficient]] outcomes, in which no party's situation can be improved without hurting that of another party.

==Strategic planning==
In [[strategic planning]], resource allocation is a [[plan]] for using available [[Natural resource|resources]],  for example [[human resources]], especially in the near term, to achieve goals for the future. It is the process of allocating scarce resources among the various [[project]]s or business units.

There are a number of approaches to solving resource allocation problems e.g. resources can be allocated using a manual approach,&lt;ref&gt;CEITON technologies [http://www.ceiton.de/CMS/EN/scheduling/tasks.html#Manual_Planning "Manual planning"] ''[[Ceiton technologies]]'' Retrieved on 3 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; an algorithmic approach (see below),&lt;ref&gt;Production planning [http://www.productionplanning.com/Production-Planning/Algorithmic-Sequencing.aspx "Algorithmic sequencing"] ''Production planning'' Retrieved on 3 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;Inteng [http://www.inteng.com.au/planning.htm "Planning manual and algorithm"] ''Inteng'' Retrieved on 3 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SimulTrainResourceLeveling.jpg|thumb|Resource Leveling optimizes histogram of resources on a project.&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. What Is Project Management?http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-management-27448701&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There may be contingency mechanisms such as a priority ranking of items excluded from the plan, showing which items to fund if more resources should become available and a priority ranking of some items included in the plan, showing which items should be sacrificed if total funding must be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel90 |url=http://www.slideshare.net/kbgluciaja/resource-allocation-16175159 |title=Resource allocation |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
Resource allocation may be decided by using [[computer programs]] applied to a specific domain to automatically and dynamically distribute resources to applicants.

This is especially common in electronic devices dedicated to routing and communication. For example, channel allocation in [[wireless]] communication may be decided by a [[base transceiver station]] using an appropriate [[algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/~modiano/papers/C67.pdf |title=Wireless Channel Allocation Using An Auction Algorithm |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One class of resource whereby applicants bid for the best resource(s) according to their balance of "money", as in an [[online auction business model]] (see also [[auction theory]]). A study by Emmanuel Yarteboi Annan {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} shows that this is highly important in the resource allocation sector.

The '''Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana''' ([[English language|English]]: Universal Rural Employment Programme) was a scheme launched by the [[Government of India]] to attain the objective of providing gainful employment for the rural poor.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} From 1 April 1999, EAS became an allocation-based scheme.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Chapter 2: Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana | title=Annual Report 2001-2002 | publisher = Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India | url = http://rural.nic.in/book01-02/ch-2.pdf| format = PDF | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090224220524/http://rural.nic.in/book01-02/ch-2.pdf | archive-date = 2009-02-24|ref=Ministry of Rural Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The programme was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions.

The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana was launched on 1 September 2001 by merging the provisions of Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS) and Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY). The programme is self-targeting in nature and aims to provide employment and food to people in rural areas who lived below the [[poverty threshold|poverty line]].

== Origin ==

The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana is an actually a combination of the provisions under the Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS) and Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY).&lt;ref name="india2008"&gt;{{cite book | title=India 2008| last=Research, Reference and Training Division | year=2008| publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India| location=New Delhi| pages=709&amp;ndash;710|isbn=81-230-1488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|709}}

The [[Food For Work Programme]] was restructured and renamed as '''National Rural Employment Programme''' in October 1980 by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and it became a regular Programme from April 1981.  The Programme was launched during the [[Five-Year Plans of India|Sixth Five Year Plan]]. It aims the implementation of additional employment to under employed persons. Central-state contribution was on the basis of 50:50 ratio. In 1989 NREP was merged with [[Jawahar Rozgar Yojana]].&lt;ref name=FiveYearPlan/&gt;

Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) was launched on April 1, 1989 by merging [[National Rural Employment Programme]] and [[Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme]] by  Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. The urban version of this program was Nehru Rozgar Yojana.

This was a consolidation of the previous employment programs and it was largest National Employment Program of India at that time with a general objective of providing 90-100 Days Employment per person particularly in backward districts. People below Poverty Line were main targets. The Yojna was implemented on rural scale. Every village was to be covered through Panchayati Raj Institutions. The village got aide and support from District Rural Development Authority. Expenditures were born by central &amp; state in 80:20 ratios.

Since 1993-94 the Yojna was made more targets oriented and expanded substantially through increased budgetary allocations. It was divided into 3 streams.

First Stream: Comprising general works under JRY and also two sub schemes [[Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana|Indira Awas Yojana]] and [[Million Wells Scheme]]. This stream got 75% of the total allocation. In [https://www.newdelhiawasyojna.com/ New Delhi Awas Yojna] the allocation was increased from 6% to 10% and in Million Wells Scheme from 20% to 30% during that period.

Second Stream: This was also called intensified JRY and was implemented in selected 120 backward districts. It got 20% allocation.

Third Stream: This was left with 5% allocation for Innovative programs which included Prevention of labor migration, drought proofing watershed etc. programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gktoday.in/jawahar-rozgar-yojna_22/|title=Jawahar Rozgar Yojna - General Knowledge Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 1, 1999 this Yojna was replaced by [[Jawahar Gram samridhi Yojna]]. Later from September 25, 2001, Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojna was merged with Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana.&lt;ref name=FiveYearPlan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianyojana.com/rojgar-yojana/jawahar-rozgar-yojana-jry.htm|title=Details About Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jawahar Gram Smridhi Yojana ===

The Jawahar Gram Smridhi Yojana, named after India's first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] aimed at creating a need-based rural infrastructure.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Both these programmes have contributed a great deal towards alleviating rural poverty.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  In 2001, the Food for Work Programme was initiated to meet demands for wage employment and food grain requirements.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

The scheme was formerly known as [[Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY)]] which was launched in 1989 by merging two wage employment programmes: [[National Rural Employment Programme(NREP)]] and [[Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP)]].&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|6}} It was the single largest wage employment programme implemented through Panchayat Raj institutions.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

====Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme====
The '''Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme''' ('''RLEGP''') was launched on 15 August 1983  by Prime Minister of India [[Indira Gandhi]] during the [[Five-Year Plans of India| Sixth Five-Year Plan]]. The entire expenditure of this Programme was financed by Central Government. While most of the objectives and stipulations under this were similar to those of [[National Rural Employment Programme]] (NREP), it was to be limited only to the landless, with guaranteed employment of 100 days. Moreover, there was earmarking of funds specifically for certain activities- 25 per cent for social forestry, 10 per cent for works benefitting only the [[Scheduled Castes ]]/ [[Scheduled Tribes]] and 20 per cent for housing under [[Indira Awaas Yojana]]. In the [[Five-Year Plans of India|Seventh Plan]], Rs.2412 crores were spent and 115 crore man days were generated with an average expenditure of Rs.21.00 per man day. Only 16 per cent had been spent on social forestry but 22 per cent had been spent on housing,- with over five lakh houses created for SC/ST and freed bonded labourers. Rural roads accounted for 22 per cent while other construction, minor irrigation, soil conservation etc. Each had a small share.

In 1989 this programme was merged with Jawahar Rozgar Yojana.&lt;ref name=FiveYearPlan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol2/v2c2-1.htm |title=9th Five Year Plan (Vol 2) : Poverty Alleviation Programme|website=Planningcommission.nic.in |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment Assurance Scheme====
EAS was first implemented on 2 October 1993 in 1778 blocks located in the rough, rugged, sparsely populated areas of the country.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

=== Announcement of SGRY ===

Finally, on 15 August 2001, the then Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] announced a new wage employment programme, the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|1}} The scheme was subsequently launched on 25 September 2001.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|709}}

== Provisions ==

The scheme has special provisions for women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and parents of children withdrawn from hazardous occupations.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|709}} While preference if given to families below the poverty line, people who live above the poverty line too are eligible under this scheme.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|709}}

A budget of Rs. 10,000 crore has been allocated for the scheme, which includes provision of 50 lakh tonnes of food grains.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|709}} Again the investment is shared between the centre and the states in the 75&amp;ndash;25 ratio.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}}  Food grains are, however, provided free of cost by the Central government, but the cost of transportation should be borne by the states.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}}

Despite the fact that EAS and JGSY were unified, funds were allocated separately for EAS and JGSY for the year 2001&amp;ndash;02.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment" /&gt;{{rp|3}} This was done for the convenience of implementation and accounting.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment" /&gt;{{{rp|3}} However, from the fiscal year 2002&amp;ndash;03 onwards, unified budgets were adopted for both EAS and JGSY.&lt;ref name="ruraldevelopment" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

== Implementation ==

The programme is implemented by the District Panchayats, Intermediate Panchayats and Gram Panchayats.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}} The resources are allocated in the 20&amp;ndash;30&amp;ndash;50 ratio.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}}

The Gram Panchayats commence their work based on the approval of the Gram Sabha.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}} 50 percent of the funds for the Gram Panchayats are used for the development of infrastructure in SC/ST dominated areas.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}} 22.5 percent of the funds allocated to District and Intermediate Panchayats are also used for the development of individuals belonging to SC/ST communities.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}}

The employment of contractors or middlemen are not permitted under this scheme. However, this scheme was subsumed in NREGP which has been initiated since 2 Feb,2006.&lt;ref name="india2008"/&gt;{{rp|710}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''Samuel Bleichröder''' (15 July 1779, [[Wriezen]] – 30 December 1855) was a [[Ashkenazi Jews|German Jewish]] banker and financier. Located in [[Berlin]], Bleichröder dealt with the [[Prussian court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Salomon Wininger |first=Salomon |last=Wininger |title=Große jüdische National-Biographie |publisher=Kraus |edition=Reprint |location=Nendeln |year=1979 |isbn=3-262-01204-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] of [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landes |first=David S. |authorlink=David Landes |title=Bleichröders and Rothschilds: The Problem of Continuity in the Family Firm |doi=10.1111/j.1741-6248.1993.00085.x |journal=Family Business Review |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=85–101 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science.gov''' is a [[web portal]] and [[Academic databases and search engines|specialized search engine]]. Using [[federated search]] technology, Science.gov serves as a gateway to [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] scientific and technical information and research. Currently in its fifth generation, Science.gov provides a search of over 38 databases from 14 federal science agencies and 200 million pages of science information with just one query, and is a gateway to 1,900+ scientific websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov/about.html Science.gov About page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a report to Congress noted that in fiscal year 2007 "Science.gov experienced 6.5 million search queries across all its scientific databases and 2.6 million [[page view]]s of its website."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/reports/fy2007_egov_report.pdf FY 2007 Report to Congress on Implementation of The E-Government Act of 2002, page 11]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the site had reached 34 million page views annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science.gov: The Power of 10 U.S. government science information search &amp; retrieval web portal celebrates 10 years of service |url=http://www.science.gov/communications/10years.html|accessdate=Dec 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2007, ''[[Library Journal]]'' included Science.gov in its list of best references of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6429510.html Best References 2006, Brian E. Coutts &amp; Cheryl LaGuardia -- Library Journal, April 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Science.gov is also the United States contribution to the international portal [[WorldWideScience]].

== History ==

Science.gov 1.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov/communications/scigovpr-final.html Science.gov version 1.0  announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in December 2002, providing for the first time wide public access and a unified search of the government's stores of scientific and technical information. Science.gov is an interagency initiative of 18 U.S. government science organizations within 14 Federal agencies. These agencies form the voluntary Science.gov Alliance.

In May 2004, Version 2.0 was launched,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov/communications/library/sciencegov_v2_pressrelease.pdf Science.gov version 2.0 announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; introducing real-time relevancy ranking to government science retrieval. This technology, funded by the Department of Energy, helps users sort through the government's research and return results relevant to individual needs. An advanced search capability and other enhancements were added. U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham and Director of the Office of Science Dr. Raymond L. Orbach both remarked positively on the launch of Science.gov 2.0 on May 11, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/news/1797.htm Remarks prepared for U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on the Science.gov 2.0 Launch, May 11, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.doe.gov/News_information/speeches/speeches/04/04-05_Science2-Orbach.htm Remarks prepared for Dr. Raymond L. Orbach Director, Office of Science Science.gov 2.0 Launch Program, May 11, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

A free "Alert" service was released in February 2005, allowing users to receive e-mail alerts about current science developments in their areas of interest. Up to 25 relevant results from selected information sources can be delivered. Results are displayed in the Alert email and in a personalized Alert Archive, which stores six weeks of alerts results. In the Archive, past activity can be reviewed and Alert profiles edited.

Launched in November 2005, Version 3.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov/communications/scigovpr-3.0.html Science.gov version 3.0 announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; provided more refined search queries of federal science databases. In addition, fielded searching and Boolean capabilities were enhanced.

In February 2007, Science.gov 4.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov/communications/scigovalliancepress4.0.html Science.gov version 4.0 announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. The new version was reviewed by Gale Cengage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gale.cengage.com/reference/peter/200703/sciencegov.htm Péter Jacsó review of Science.gov version 4.0, Gale Cengage, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and Government Computer News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcn.com/articles/2007/02/16/sciencegov-40-delves-deep-into-the-web.aspx Science.gov 4.0 delves deep into the Web, Government Computer News, February 16, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Version 4.0 allowed further refinement of search queries, allowing users to search within their original results. The relevancy ranking algorithms became more sophisticated, providing ranking of the entire full text of documents on sites where searchable full text resides. Date of the document was priority-weighted for ranking purposes. A new feature allowed users to share search results via e-mail.

Science.gov 5.0 was launched in September 2008 and announced in a U.S. Department of Energy Press Release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/news/6541.htm U.S. Department of Energy Press Release: Access to Science Information Expands with Science.gov 5.0 Launch, September 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oak Ridger covered the release&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridger.com/business/x1213466488/Science-gov-5-0-launches Science.gov 5.0 launches, The Oak Ridger - September 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; as did UPI,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2008/09/16/US_expands_science_info_on_the_Web/UPI-72541221573347/ U.S. expands science info on the Web, UPI.com, September 16, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Open Access News,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/09/preview-of-sciencegov-50.html Preview of Science.gov 5.0 Open Access News, Peter Suber, Editor - September 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Computer Week,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcw.com/articles/2008/09/23/sciencegov-launches-a-new-version.aspx Science.gov launches a new version, Federal Computer Week, Doug Beizer, September 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Econtent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Item/Science.gov-5.0-Released-50814.htm Science.gov 5.0 Released, Econtent, September 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and SLA Government Information Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sla-divisions.typepad.com/government_information/2008/09/sciencegov-50.html Science.gov 5.0, SLA Government Information Division, September 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering results into topics areas and the inclusion of Wikipedia topics and EurekAlert Science items related to the search were added.

The '''Scottish Council of Jewish Communities''' (SCoJeC) is the representative body of all the [[Jewish communities of Scotland]]. It was founded in 1999 by the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]. Its primary function is to act on behalf of Scotland's Jewish Communities to all external bodies. It is also responsible for a variety of activities and publications to support Jews and Jewish Communities in Scotland, and fostering both good community relations and community cohesion.

[[George Reid (Scottish politician)|George Reid]], the former [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament]], speaking at the SCoJeC AGM in 2007, said: "SCoJeC is an example to other communities. I want to thank the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities for grasping the outstretched hand of the Parliament, and for getting involved. Ephraim and Leah [the Director and Deputy Director respectively] are weel kent figures to Ministers, to MSPs, to the senior civil servants, to the leaders of the STUC. You bring common sense and decency to everything you do. And you do engage – how you engage! In Scotland, your small community has made a remarkable contribution to our national life. Through the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities it has led to your full engagement with our new institutions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scojec.org/4cs/4cs/07xii_4c16.pdf Four Corners Magazine, December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
SCoJeC was formed in 1999, principally by the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council and the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation, after [[Devolution in Scotland|Devolution]] to give the Jewish Community of Scotland a single democratically accountable voice in dealings with the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Scottish Government|Government]], other communities, and other statutory and official bodies.  The intention, when it was established was for it to stand in the same relationship to the Scottish Government as the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] does to [[Her Majesty's Government]].

Consequently the Council is autonomous in matters devolved by the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], such as justice, health and welfare, and community relations, whilst the Board of Deputies speaks for all [[Jews of Britain|Britain's Jews]] on [[reserved matters]] such as foreign affairs and equality legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scojec.org/scojec/scojec.html About SCoJeC]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
SCoJeC is a democratic representative organisation, and the members of its Council are the elected representatives of each of the formally organised Jewish communities in Scotland –  [http://glasgowjewishrepcouncil.org/ Glasgow], [http://www.scojec.org/communities/edinburgh.html/ Edinburgh], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110903033922/http://www.aberdeenhebrew.org.uk/ Aberdeen] and [http://www.scojec.org/communities/dundee/index.html Dundee] – as well as two other informal groups, the Jewish Network of Argyll and the Highlands, and [http://northernregion.webs.com Jewish students studying in Scottish Universities and Colleges]. There are also six coopted members of Council, who have wide experience of various aspects of public life in Scotland; these have included a former judge and law professor, a senior member of a local authority social work department, a professor of social policy, a consultant physician, and the head of a civil service department.  In addition members of the community who are office-bearers of organisations to which SCoJeC is affiliated, such as the Board of Deputies and [http://www.bemis.org.uk/ BEMIS] are invited as observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scojec.org/scojec/people/people.html Who's Who in SCoJeC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council meets at least three times a year, and the Executive more frequently.  The Council also consults widely within the Community, both with relevant communal organisations and with the [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], [[Movement for Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal]] communities before it makes representations to Government or others, and only does so when there is a clear consensus.  Where opinion is diverse and deeply divided, as for example on matters relating to Middle East politics, the Council does not express an opinion unless there is an effect on the Community in Scotland.

SCoJeC is registered as a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (no. SC 029 438 ).

== Activities ==
SCoJeC's functions generally fall into four key areas:
# '''Representing''' Scotland's Jewish Community to other external organisations, and working with other communities and umbrella groups to improve community relations;
# '''Community work''', organising activities and producing publications to connect Scotland's Jews with each other and their communities, and providing support for their activities.
# '''Interfaith work''', aimed at fostering positive relations with other groups in Scotland
# Producing '''resources''' geared towards educating and enhancing understanding on Judaism and life of Jews in Scotland, both to the people they represent and to those outside the Jewish community.

=== Representative work ===
SCoJeC's representative work is as wide-ranging as the areas of Scottish Government responsibilities that have the potential to affect Jews and Jewish life in Scotland, ranging from education through health and social care, to criminal justice and family law. Its main work includes promoting the understanding of Jewish religion, culture and community, and working to provide information and assistance to local authorities, other faith and ethnic communities, and educational, health and welfare bodies across the country. Furthermore SCoJeC makes representations on behalf of the Jewish Community in Scotland to the Scottish Government, Scottish Parliamentary committees, [[MSPs]], and other bodies on issues concerning Jews in Scotland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5093">The Liberal Party's '''Senior Whip''' was a political post with the task of administering the "[[Whip (politics)|whipping in]]" system attempting to ensure that party MPs attend and vote according to the party leadership's wishes.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=278}} All Liberal whips were members of the House of Representatives with none coming from the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. The position held high esteem in the Liberal caucus and it was not uncommon for whips to move in to higher positions later on. Two ([[William MacDonald (New Zealand politician)|William MacDonald]] and [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]]) would later serve as party leader. Forbes also served as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1935.&lt;ref name="DNZB Forbes"&gt;{{DNZB|Gardner|W. J.|3f9|Forbes, George William|11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shadow President''''' is a [[Government simulation game|geopolitical simulation]] video game released in 1993 for the [[personal computer|PC]] by [[DC True]] containing elements of [[cyberpunk]] and dark science-fiction.

The game has a sequel called ''[[CyberJudas]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ShadowPresidentMajorWar.PNG||left|thumb|Failing to keep the governments of the world peaceful with each other may result in a "hot war;" with the Soviet Union invading Japan in this screenshot.]]

The game put the player in the role of the [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]] in a situation loosely based on the [[Cold War]] and the early 1990s. Using a timeline that starts during the end of the [[Ogaden War]], players can prepare [[Kuwait]] to be [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] by [[Iraq]] during [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. After dealing with the Iraqi adversaries, the player can opt to dethrone the military overlords and political cartels that are keeping the people of [[South America]] and [[Africa]] in relative poverty.&lt;ref name="abandonia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonia.com/games/579/ShadowPresident.htm|title=Shadow President Overview for PC|publisher=Abandonia|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being popular enough to be re-elected is a vital component of the game, though [[election|re-election]]s can be disabled which in turn greatly reduces the effect of [[popularity]]. Managing the [[United States federal budget|budget of the United States]], [[Aid|sending aid to foreign countries]], dealing with [[International crisis|diplomatic crises]], and even fighting [[war]]s are a largely unavoidable aspect of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeinfosociety.com/article.php?id=479|title=Articles/Game Reviews/PC/Shadow President (1993)|publisher=Free Info Society|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player starts the game with seven [[Senior Advisor|advisor]]s, which makes the game a bit less confusing. During every American election year, players are not allowed to access their virtual screen  starting at midnight on election night so that a panel of bureaucrats can analyze their progress. If their popularity and efficiency is good enough, the player is authorized to use the terminal for four more years. Not getting re-elected automatically means "[[game over]].&lt;ref name="abandonia"/&gt;"

Furthermore, if the player makes poor decisions or abuses their power, their advisors may resign, Congress will attempt to impeach them, foreign governments may overthrow them, or terrorist groups may attempt an assassination.

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
| GSpot = 7.7/10&lt;ref name="gsr1"/&gt;
}}

[[GameSpot]] currently has the game ranked at a 7.7/10 based on 13 reviews.&lt;ref name=gsr1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/shadow-president/|title=Shadow President - GameSpot.com|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck Moss]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 wrote that ''Shadow President'' was a good learning tool but that "As a simulation, it has certain real-world problems [and] certain ... anomalies", such as Iraqi forces much more powerful than in the real Persian Gulf War. As a game, the magazine stated that "you can't do cool stuff" as the simulation "forces one to be more passive than active if stability is the desired goal", contrasting the game with "more fun" simulations like ''[[SimCity]]'' and ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]''. The magazine concluded that ''Shadow President'' was "a work of art that belongs in every civics classroom", but "even invading Canada is more fun".&lt;ref name="moss199307"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=108 | title=D.C.

The '''State Labor Party''', also known as '''State Labor Party (Hughes-Evans)''', was an Australian political party which operated exclusively in the state of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) in the early 1940s. The party was initially a far-left faction of the [[Australian Labor Party]], strongly opposed to the [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)|right-wing faction of the party]] dominated by [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], the [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] between 1925 and 1927, and again between 1930 and 1932.

Lang dominated the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|NSW Branch of the Labor Party]], in the 1920s and for most of the 1930s, and his leadership had produced a great deal of instability in the NSW Labor Party, with Lang's dominant group seceding in 1931 and rejoining the (National) Labor Party in 1936. In 1940 Lang again seceded from Labor, along with several supporters, and formed a new party called the [[Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist)]], which operated in the Federal sphere from 1940 to 1941 but had only minority support in the Labor movement of NSW. Lang and his group were reconciled to Labor in late 1941. This reconciliation was to be short-lived and Lang again seceded in 1943.

This grouping, which was to become the State Labor Party (NSW), was led by [[Jack Hughes (trade unionist)|Jack Hughes]], President of the NSW Labor Council, and Walter Evans, General Secretary of the NSW Labor Party. Both of these men were undercover members of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA), and worked closely with the CPA executive leadership, which had adopted a policy of encouraging disaffected ALP members seeking membership of the CPA, to remain in the Labor Party as undercover operatives. With the outbreak of [[World War II]],  preceded by the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], the priority of the CPA was to work to ensure Australian neutrality towards the war in Europe. Hughes and Evans devoted their efforts towards this end, in their capacity as powerful executives within the ALP.

Ultimately, the position of the Hughes-Evans group came to be seen as untenable within the ALP, and their influence began to wane. In August 1940, the federal executive of the ALP moved to suspend the NSW executive, including Hughes and Evans. Several weeks later Hughes, Evans and their supporters formed a new party, the State Labor Party. This was only weeks away from the federal elections of September 1940. State Labor contested the poll for election to the House of Representatives in NSW, and achieved 6.6% of the vote in that state (2.6% nationally), but failed to see any of its candidates (including [[Greg McGirr]]) elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party contested the NSW State elections of May 1941, and secured 5.6% of the primary vote, but again failed to secure any seats. The party's final attempt to gain parliamentary representation was at the federal election of August 1943, but it polled less than 1% nationally. Five months later (January 1944), the State Labor Party voted to end its own existence and amalgamated with the CPA.

The '''Stonewall Book Award''' is a set of three literary awards that annually recognize "exceptional merit relating to the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender experience" in English-language books published in the U.S.&lt;ref name=stonewall/&gt; They are sponsored by the [[Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table]] (GLBTRT) of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) and have been part of the [[List of ALA awards|American Library Association awards program]], now termed ALA Book, Print &amp; Media Awards, since 1986 as the single Gay Book Award.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=ALAawards/&gt;

The three award categories are fiction and nonfiction in books for adults, distinguished in 1990, and books for children or young adults, from 2010. The awards are named for [[Barbara Gittings]], Israel Fishman, and (jointly) Mike Morgan and Larry Romans. In full they are the '''Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award''', the '''Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award''', and the '''Stonewall Book Awards – Mike Morgan &amp; Larry Romans Children's &amp; Young Adult Literature Award'''.&lt;ref name=stonewall/&gt;

Finalists have been designated from 1990, and termed "Honor Books" from 2001.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; Currently a panel of librarians selects five finalists in each award category and subsequently selects one winner.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The winners are announced in January and each receives a plaque and $1000 cash prize during the ALA Annual Conference in June or July.&lt;ref name=stonewall/&gt; Winners are expected to attend and to give acceptance speeches.&lt;ref name=about1/&gt;

The ALA solicits book suggestions each to be accompanied by a brief statement in favor of the book.&lt;ref name=stonewall/&gt; Those are recommendations or "applications" to the Awards Committee from the public by email, which are not accepted from publishers, agents, authors, and others with vested interests.&lt;ref name=about1/&gt;

Eligible books should be original works published in the U.S. during the preceding year, including "substantially changed new editions" and "English-language translations of foreign-language books".&lt;ref name=about1/&gt;

==History==

The Gay Book Award was inaugurated in 1971, recognizing ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'', a [[historical novel]] by [[Alma Routsong]] as Isabel Miller, which had been self-published by Routsong in 1969.&lt;!-- main source is our book article --&gt; Originally it was a "grassroots acknowledgment" of GLBT publishing and there was "only a handful" of books to consider annually. By 1995 there were more than 800.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 2002 the awards, then two, were jointly named after the site of the
1969 [[Stonewall riots]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">In [[computing]], a '''wireless intrusion prevention system''' (WIPS) is a [[computer network|network]] device that monitors the [[radio spectrum]] for the presence of unauthorized [[Wireless access point|access points]] ''(intrusion detection)'', and can automatically take countermeasures ''(intrusion prevention)''.

== [[Intention|Purpose]] ==
The primary purpose of a WIPS is to prevent unauthorized network access to [[local area network]]s and other information assets by wireless devices.  These systems are typically implemented as an overlay to an existing [[Wireless LAN]] infrastructure, although they may be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization.  Some advanced wireless infrastructure has integrated WIPS capabilities.

Large organizations with many [[employee]]s are particularly vulnerable to security breaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fitting the WLAN Security pieces together|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/144647/guide_to_wireless_lan_security.html|publisher=pcworld.com|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by [[rogue access point]]s.  If an employee (trusted entity) in a location brings in an easily available [[wireless router]], the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.

In July 2009, the [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org PCI Security Standards Council] published wireless guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= PCI DSS Wireless Guidelines|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/PCI_DSS_Wireless_Guidelines.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[PCI DSS]] recommending the use of WIPS to automate wireless scanning for large organizations.

== Intrusion detection ==

A '''wireless [[intrusion detection]] system''' (WIDS) monitors the [[radio spectrum]] for the presence of unauthorized, [[rogue access point]]s and the use of wireless attack tools. The system monitors the [[radio spectrum]] used by [[wireless LAN]]s, and immediately alerts a [[systems administrator]] whenever a rogue access point is detected. Conventionally it is achieved by comparing the [[MAC address]] of the participating wireless devices.

Rogue devices can [[Spoofing attack|spoof]] MAC address of an authorized network device as their own. New research uses [[Radio fingerprinting|fingerprinting]] approach to weed out devices with spoofed MAC addresses. The idea is to compare the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University research aims at more secure Wi-Fi |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GPLEDVT0ZRBKUQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=192501255 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220854/http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GPLEDVT0ZRBKUQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=192501255 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intrusion prevention ==

In addition to intrusion detection, a WIPS also includes features that prevent against the threat ''automatically''. For automatic 
prevention, it is required that the WIPS is able to accurately detect and automatically classify a threat.

The following types of threats can be prevented by a good WIPS:
* [[Rogue access point]]s – WIPS should understand the difference between rogue APs and external (neighbor’s) APs
* Mis-configured AP
* Client mis-association
* Unauthorized association
* [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]
* ''Ad hoc'' networks
* MAC spoofing
* Honeypot / [[evil twin (wireless networks)|evil twin attack]]
* [[Denial-of-service attack]]

== Implementation ==

WIPS configurations consist of three components:

*'''Sensors''' &amp;mdash; These devices contain antennas and radios that scan the wireless spectrum for packets and are installed throughout areas to be protected
*'''Server''' &amp;mdash; The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors
*'''Console''' &amp;mdash; The console provides the primary user interface into the system for administration and reporting

A simple intrusion detection system can be a single computer, connected to a wireless signal processing device, and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s placed throughout the facility.  For huge organizations, a Multi Network Controller provides central control of multiple WIPS servers, while for [[Small office/home office|SOHO]] or SMB customers, all the functionality of WIPS is available in single box.

In a WIPS implementation, users first define the operating wireless policies in the WIPS. The WIPS sensors then analyze the traffic in the air and send this information to WIPS server. The WIPS server correlates the information, validates it against the defined policies, and classifies if it is a threat. The administrator of the WIPS is then notified of the threat, or, if a policy has been set accordingly, the WIPS takes automatic protection measures.

WIPS is configured as either a network implementation or a hosted implementation.

=== Network implementation ===
In a network WIPS implementation, server, sensors and the console are all placed inside a private network and are not accessible from the Internet.

Sensors communicate with the server over a private network using a private port. Since the server resides on the private network, users can access the console only from within the private network.

A network implementation is suitable for organizations where all locations are within the private network.

=== Hosted implementation ===
In a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors are installed inside a private network. However, the server is hosted in secure data center and is accessible on the Internet. Users can access the WIPS console from anywhere on the Internet. A hosted WIPS implementation is as secure as a network implementation because the data flow is encrypted between sensors and server, as well as between server and console. A hosted WIPS implementation requires very little configuration because the sensors are programmed to automatically look for the server on the Internet over a secure [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] connection.

For a large organization with locations that are not a part of a private network, a hosted WIPS implementation simplifies deployment significantly because sensors connect to the Server over the Internet without requiring any special configuration. Additionally, the Console can be accessed securely from anywhere on the Internet.

Hosted WIPS implementations are available in an on-demand, subscription-based [[software as a service]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Security SaaS hits WLAN community|url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/wireless/2008/040708wireless1.html|publisher=networkworld.com|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hosted implementations may be appropriate for organizations looking to fulfill the minimum scanning requirements of [[PCI DSS]].
