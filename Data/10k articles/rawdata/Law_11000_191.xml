The '''ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution''' is a legally binding [[environmental agreement]] signed in 2002 by the member states of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] to reduce [[haze]] [[pollution]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;ASEAN Secretariat. [http://haze.asean.org/?wpfb_dl=32 ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution]. Extracted 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Agreement recognises that transboundary haze pollution which result from land and/or forest fires should be mitigated through concerted national efforts and international co-operation.

As of September 2014, all ten ASEAN countries have ratified the haze agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Indonesia Ministry of Environment.[http://www.menlh.go.id/indonesia-meratifikasi-undang-undang-tentang-pengesahan-asean-agreement-on-transboundary-haze-pollution-persetujuan-asean-tentang-pencemaran-asap-lintas-batas/]. Extracted 23 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The agreement is a reaction to an [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|environmental crisis that hit Southeast Asia in the late 1990s]]. The crisis was mainly caused by land clearing for agricultural uses via open burning on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Sumatra]]. Satellite images confirmed the presence of hot spots throughout [[Kalimantan]]/[[Borneo]], Sumatra, the [[Malay Peninsula]] and several other places, with an estimated 45,000 square kilometres of forest and land burnt.&lt;ref name="fire.uni-freiburg.de"&gt;Global Fire Monitoring Center. [http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/country/id/id_32.htm The 1997-98 Air Pollution Episode in Southeast Asia Generated by Vegetation Fires in Indonesia] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/659eNF66x?url=http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/country/id/id_32.htm |date=2 February 2012 }}. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and to a certain extent, [[Thailand]] and [[Brunei]] were particularly badly affected.

The haze is nearly an annual occurrence in some ASEAN nations. Dangerous levels of haze usually coincide with the dry season &lt;ref&gt;Jakarta Globe. [http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/riau-haze-back-again-as-dry-season-sets-in/ The 1997-98 Riau Haze Back Again as Dry Season Sets In]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; from June to September when the southwest [[monsoon]] is in progress. Southwest monsoon winds shift the haze from Sumatra, Indonesia towards the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, sometimes creating a thick haze that can last for weeks.

===Negotiation history===
The agreement was established in 2002, though has some foundation in a 1990 agreement made among ASEAN Ministers of Environment which called for efforts leading to the harmonisation of transboundary pollution prevention and abatement practices.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;ASEAN Haze Action Online. [http://haze.asean.org/?wpfb_dl=32 (p.1) Agreement Text]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty also builds on the 1995 ASEAN Cooperation Plan on Transboundary Pollution and the 1997 Regional Haze Action Plan.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This treaty is an attempt to bring the action plan into function.

==Institutional structure==
The agreement is managed by the Ministers of Environment and other representatives from the respective ASEAN countries.  Meetings are coordinated under the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Council (ASCC), one of three councils, subsidiary to the ASEAN summit and its chair.&lt;ref&gt;Asia One News. [http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/chan-chun-sing-attend-asean-socio-cultural-community-council-meeting Chan Chun Sing to attend Asean Socio-Cultural Community council meeting]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The treaty calls for haze to be mitigated through concerted national efforts and intensified regional and international co-operation in the context of sustainable development. This is to be done through monitoring and prevention activities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Protocols==
The official procedure or system of rules that informs this agreement is the ‘ASEAN Way’ set of region norms and codes of diplomatic conduct characterised by principles of non-interference, consultation, consensus, quiet diplomacy, symbolism, and organizational minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Nguitragool, Paruedee. "Negotiating the Haze Treaty: Rationality and Institutions in the Negotiations for the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002)." Asian Survey, 2011: 356-378. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
In October 2013 ASEAN leaders approved a joint haze monitoring system at a cost of $100,000 USD.&lt;ref&gt;Strait Times. [http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/asean-leaders-approve-haze-monitoring-system-20131009?itemid=771 Asean leaders approve haze monitoring system]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Singapore has offered to start working directly with Indonesian farmers to encourage sustainable practices and minimise the problem over time by "tackling the haze issue at its root". Singapore has worked with farmers in this way in Indonesia's Jambi province in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Strait Times. [http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/singapore-willing-work-indonesia-malaysia-tackle-causes-haze-20131009 Singapore willing to work with Indonesia, Malaysia to tackle causes of haze]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==
Indonesia, as the primary haze producing party to the problem,&lt;ref name="fire.uni-freiburg.de"/&gt; was the last ASEAN country to ratify the agreement in 2014, 12 years after it was first signed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia finally ratifies the ASEAN agreement on transboundary haze pollution |url=http://www.establishmentpost.com/indonesia-finally-ratifies-asean-agreement-transboundary-haze-pollution/ |website=The Establishment Post |accessdate=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002339/http://www.establishmentpost.com/indonesia-finally-ratifies-asean-agreement-transboundary-haze-pollution/ |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns remain over the ability of the Indonesian government to monitor and effect changes to the problem.

The treaty failed to prevent the annual return of the haze between 2004 and 2010, and again in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Recently Indonesia has been placed as the world’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter with 75% of its emissions stemming from deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;Time World. [http://world.time.com/2013/07/30/the-southeast-asian-haze-is-back-and-worse-may-follow/ The Southeast Asian Haze Is Back and Worse May Follow]. Extracted 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key debates in literature and policy community==
The ‘haze treaty’ is accused of being vague and lacking enforcement mechanisms or strong instruments for dispute-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nguitragool, Paruedee. "Negotiating the Haze Treaty: Rationality and Institutions in the Negotiations for the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002)." Asian Survey, 2011: 356-378. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ASEAN has clearly tried to depart from its institutional culture in attempt to achieve deeper co-operation on this issue. This is evident in that this is a legally binding treaty, something ASEAN has vehemently opposed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Nguitragool, Paruedee. "Negotiating the Haze Treaty: Rationality and Institutions in the Negotiations for the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002)." Asian Survey, 2011: 356-378. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty is ill-served by the ASEAN style of regional engagement which adamantly protects national sovereignty. The result is that states are compelled to act in their own self-interest rather than regional interests. Additionally, the close relationships between key economic actors and political elites have meant maintenance of the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Varkkey, Helena Muhamad. "The Asean Way and Haze Mitigation Efforts." Journal of International Studies, 2012: 1823-691X. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''Act of September 25, 1874 '''  elevated to constitutional status the Reform Laws. [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] enacted through a decree on September 25, 1873, a series of additions and amendments to the Mexican Constitution of 1857, concerning the Reform Laws that had decreed the separation of church and state.

Through this law the reform process that secularized two acts previously faced the church and marriage oath and consolidated as civil actions where the State was the guarantor of compliance was completed.

== Background ==
The liberal reforms were led by President [[Benito Juárez]]. These led to the conflict between conservatives and liberalesque detonated in the Reform War. Shortly after the outbreak of the French intervention in Mexico, which is a continuation of the same conflict. 
[[File:Sebastian_Lerdo_de_Tejada.jpg|thumb|Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada signed into law September 25, 1874.
]]

== Content of the law  ==
The articles that make up this law are:
1. The State and the Church are independent of each other. The Congress can not enact laws, establishing or prohibiting any religion.
2. Marriage is a civil contract. This and other acts of the civil status of persons are the exclusive competence of officials and authorities of civil order, under the terms provided by law, and will have the force and validity that they attribute to them.
3. No religious institution can acquire real property or capital taxes on them, with the sole exception established in Article 27 of the Constitution.
4. The simple promise to speak truth and to fulfill the obligations that are contracted, will replace the religious oath with its effects and penalties
5. No one can be forced to give personal works without the right retribution and without their full consent. The State can not allow any contract, covenant or agreement that has as its object the impairment, loss or irrevocable sacrifice of the freedom of man, whether due to work, education or religious vote, to be carried out. The law consequently does not recognize monastic Orders, nor can it allow its establishment, whatever the denomination or object with which they wish to be erected. Nor can it be accepted that a man agrees to his banishment or exile.

== Reactions to the Act of September 25, 1874  ==
The subject specialist Dr. Marta Eugenia Garcia Ugarte notes that the content of the law is "the establishment of marriage as a civil contract, the ban on religious institutions to acquire real estate or capital taxes on them, and replacement of religious oath for the simple promise to tell the truth and fulfill the obligations. "

When they rose to constitutional rank the Reform Laws a long process that transformed the church-state relations closed. The response of the church through the Archbishop of Mexico, [[Pelagio Antonio de Labastida y Dávalos]], followed conminado the Catholic faithful not to swear laws, and even promoted the ignorance of the 1857 Constitution.

'''''Animals, Property, and the Law''''' (1995) is a book by [[Gary Francione]], Distinguished Professor of Law and Nicholas deB. Katzenbach Scholar of Law &amp; Philosophy at [[Rutgers School of Law–Newark]]. The book was the first extensive [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] treatment of [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kunstler|Kunstler, William F.]] (1995). "Foreword" in ''Animals, Property, and the Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}}
__TOC__

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into an introduction, which describes Francione's concept of "legal welfarism," followed by three parts: (1) "The Status of Animals as Property, (2) "A General Application of the Theory: Anticruelty Statutes," and (3) "A Specific Application of the Theory: The Regulation of Animal Experimenation." The epilogue is entitled, "An Alternative to Legal Welfarism?"

In part 1, Francione argues that nonhuman animals are the personal property, or ''chattel'', of their owners, even if recognized as a special kind of property. As such, they cannot themselves possess legal rights, because they are the objects of the exercise of someone else's rights. Whenever the interests of an animal are balanced against the interests of the owner (assuming the animal is recognized as having interests), the owner's interests almost always prevail, no matter how trivial they might be. Francione compares the situation to the treatment of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, where legislation existed that ostensibly protected them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery rendered that protection largely meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues further that the United States [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] is an example of symbolic, as opposed to functional, legislation, relying on concepts described by [[John Dwyer (Australian judge)|John Dwyer]] in 1990. It is symbolic, he writes (quoting Dwyer), because it is an example of a law where "the legislature has failed to address the administrative and political constraints that will block implementation of the statute."&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 208ff; also see Sherry, Clifford J (2009). ''Animal Rights: A Reference Handbook''. ABC-CLIO, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Professor [[Priscilla Cohn]] gave the book a favorable review, writing "Francione makes us analyze our views on animals, cruelty, what sort of pain is 'necessary,' what kind of a society allows defenseless creatures to be shot, burned, prodded, beaten, etc. His explanations are always thoughtful, his analyses penetrating, his examples interesting and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gary L.

A '''blue discharge''' (also known as a "'''blue ticket'''") was a form of administrative [[military discharge]] formerly issued by the United States beginning in 1916. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable. The blue ticket became the discharge of choice for commanders seeking to remove [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexual]] service members from the ranks. They were also issued disproportionately to [[Military history of African Americans|African Americans]].

Service members holding a blue discharge were subjected to discrimination in civilian life. They were denied the benefits of the [[G.I. Bill]] by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the [[black press]], because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in [[United States Congress|Congress]], the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.

==History==
The blue discharge was created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the "unclassified" discharge.&lt;ref name = jones2&gt;{{harvp|Jones|1973|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The discharges were printed on blue paper, hence the name. They were also sometimes called "blue tickets".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One early use of the blue discharge was for service members who had enlisted to fight in [[World War I]] while underage, but this practice was abolished by law and all such discharges were upgraded to honorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Jones |first= Marvin |subjectlink= John Marvin Jones |interviewer= Jerry N. Hess |title= Oral History Interview with Judge Marvin Jones |url= http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/jonesjm1.htm |publisher= Harry S. Truman Library |date= April 3, 1970 |accessdate= January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with homosexuality==
The United States military had a long-standing policy that service members found to be homosexual or to have engaged in homosexual conduct were to be [[court-martial]]ed for sodomy, imprisoned and dishonorably discharged. However, with the mobilization of troops following the United States' entry into [[World War II]], it became impractical to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and some commanders began issuing administrative discharges instead. Several waves of reform addressing the handling of [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuals in the military]] resulted in a 1944 policy directive that called for homosexuals to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists, and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]] as "unfit for service".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|pp=142–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown exactly how many gay and lesbian service members were given blue discharges under this regulation, but in 1946 the Army estimated that it had issued between 49,000 and 68,000 blue discharges, with approximately 5,000 of them issued to homosexuals, while the Navy's estimates  of blue-discharge homosexuals was around 4,000. The period of time covered by these estimates is unclear.&lt;ref name = berube232&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrists responsible for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|pp=11–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, when they learned of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. [[William C. Menninger]], who served as the Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One press account said the purpose of administrative blue discharges, "discharges which are not dishonorable but are based on habits or traits of the individual that make his continuation in service undesirable", was the need to return soldiers to civilian life as quickly as possible: "to get the non-disabled soldier back into the nation's economic life with as little delay and red tape as possible, and to help him solve his own personal problems such as unemployment, educational opportunities or finances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1944/05/12/87446854.pdf |format= PDF |title= Army Expands Plan to Rush Discharge |date= May 12, 1944 |access-date= March 9, 2012 |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA), charged with implementing the provisions of the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans,&lt;ref name = berube230&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mettler|2005|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits.&lt;ref name = mettler66&gt;{{harvp|Mettler|2005|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 1955, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Longernecker v. Higley |vol= 229 |reporter= F.2d |opinion= 27 |pinpoint=  |court= [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|DC Cir.]] |date= December 22, 1955 |url= http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/229/229.F2d.27.12568.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120712031457/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/229/229.F2d.27.12568.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bennett Champ Clark (portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Senator [[Bennett Champ Clark]], a sponsor of the [[G.I. Bill]], supported benefits for soldiers with blue discharges.]]

Most employers required that job applicants who had served in the military present their discharge papers as part of the application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1998|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue-discharge veterans experienced difficulty in securing employment because many employers were aware that the blue discharge meant that the holder was considered undesirable. Those employers who did not know had access to a list of the Separation Program Numbers or "spin" numbers that the military used to classify discharges. At least four such spin numbers indicated a gay-related discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shilts|1993|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress had expressed concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944. In discussions about the legislation's details, the [[American Legion]] insisted on a specific provision to provide benefits to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable.&lt;ref name = bennett143&gt;{{harvp|Bennett|1999|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion believed a large number of veterans had been given blue and other less-than-honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial.&lt;ref name = bennett141&gt;{{harvp|Bennett|1999|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony before the [[United States Senate]], Rear Admiral [[Randall Jacobs]] strongly opposed this provision on the grounds that it would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record. Senator [[Bennett Champ Clark]], a sponsor of the bill, dismissed his concerns, calling them "some of the most stupid, short-sighted objections which could be raised".&lt;ref name="bennett143"/&gt; Clark went on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Army is giving blue discharges, namely discharges without honor, to those who have had no fault other than they have not shown sufficient [[aptitude]] for military service. I say that when the government drafts a man from civil life and puts him in the military service  ... and, thereafter, because the man does not show sufficient aptitude gives him a blue discharge, or a discharge without honor, that fact should not be permitted to prevent the man from receiving the benefits to which soldiers are generally entitled.&lt;ref name = bennett141 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The G.I. Bill also provided for discharge review boards to review an appeal of any discharge other than dishonorable. From 1945 until early 1947, these boards routinely upgraded  to honorable the blue discharges of homosexual service members who had not committed any known sex acts during their military service.&lt;ref name = miller238&gt;{{harvp|Miller|1995|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About one-third of all blue discharges reviewed were upgraded to honorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[Associated Press]] |title= Blue Discharge Report Filed |newspaper= [[Reno Evening Gazette]] |page= 6 |date= January 8, 1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black press crusade==
Another minority group disproportionately issued blue discharges were African Americans. Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans, or 22.23% of all blue discharges. At this time, African Americans constituted 6.5% of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McGuire|1993|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Black-interest newspaper ''[[The Pittsburgh Courier]]'' launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses, calling the discharge "a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier", and rebuked the Army for "allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions". The ''Courier'' specifically noted the discrimination faced by homosexual blue-tickets, calling them "'unfortunates' of the Nation...being preyed upon by the blue discharge" and demanded to know "why the Army chooses to penalize these 'unfortunates' who seem most in need of Army benefits and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Courier'' printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned readers against accepting a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p=241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''Courier'', other groups and institutions that decried the punitive use of the blue discharge included the American Legion, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[AFL-CIO|Congress of Industrial Organizations]],&lt;ref name = berube232 /&gt; and the [[Veterans Benevolent Association]]. In the U.S. Senate, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, Sen. [[Edwin C. Johnson]] (D-Colorado), read the ''Courier'''s editorial into the record. On October 29, 1945, noting that a blue discharge meant the veteran had not been convicted and yet had been separated from the military without being able to defend himself, he said: "There ought not to be a twilight zone between innocence and guilt. Blue discharges are certain to be a headache for Congress from now on."&lt;ref name=berube234 /&gt;

==House Report on blue discharges==
In response to reports about the disparate treatment of blue-ticket veterans, the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Committee on Military Affairs]] appointed a special committee to review the Veterans Administration's procedures. The committee, headed by Rep. [[Carl T. Durham]] (D-NC), issued its report officially called "Investigations of the National War Effort", commonly known as "Blue Discharges", on January 30, 1946.&lt;ref name=berube234&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1990|p= 234}}; The other members of the committee were: [[Robert L. F. Sikes]] (D-Florida), [[W. Arthur Winstead|Arthur Winstead]] (D-Mississippi), [[Charles Melvin Price|Melvin Price]] (D-Illinois), [[Thomas E. Martin]] (R-Iowa), [[Ivor D. Fenton]] (R-Pennsylvania), [[J. Leroy Johnson]] (R-California). {{harvp|Bérubé|1993|p= 349n17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee expressed its amazement that anyone with a blue discharge would risk further stigmatization by speaking out against the discrimination:&lt;ref name = berube234 /&gt;
{{quote|It should be borne in mind that even a moderate amount of complaint in a matter of this sort is significant. For a person to make such a complaint in his own case implies that he feels a sense of injustice so great that he is willing to risk publicizing the stigma of having been discharged from the Army under circumstances which savor of disgrace. For each complainant there are many more who feel the same sense of injustice but prefer to bury their hurt in as much oblivion as possible.}}

In examining case histories of blue-discharge veterans, the committee found that "the procedure lends itself to dismissals based on prejudice and antagonism".&lt;ref name = troy&gt;{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |title= House Body Asks Army to Abolish Blue Discharges |work= The Troy Times Record |page= 20 |date= January 30, 1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the committee found that the effects of a blue discharge "differ little from those of a dishonorable discharge...the discharged man finds it difficult to get or keep a job. The suspicion of society is aroused against him, all the worse in some ways for carrying an atmosphere of mystery."&lt;ref name = troy /&gt; The report said that "nothing could more clearly prove the anomalous and illogical and disingenuous nature of the blue discharge than this policy of the Veterans Administration".&lt;ref name = mettler66 /&gt; The committee called the system for dealing with blue-ticket veterans "a squeeze play between the war department and the veterans' administration"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[United Press International|United Press]] |title= 'Blue' System of Discharges May Be Probed |work= The Charleston Daily Mail |page= 2 |date= January 30, 1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and took the agency to task for assuming "the right to separate the sheep from the goats" and "passing moral verdicts on the history of any soldier".&lt;ref name = mettler66 /&gt;

To reform the discharge system the committee recommended:
* Automatic review for all blue discharges
* That the Army be required to demonstrate that it made multiple attempts to rehabilitate the service member before issuing a blue discharge
* The right to counsel for service members being given a blue discharge, either provided by the military or private counsel
* Copies of procedural regulations regarding the blue discharge process be provided upon request
* That any discharge that did not specify the quality of service state plainly that it is not dishonorable

The committee also recommended changing the discharge system to four classifications: honorable and dishonorable, with no change in their definitions; "under honorable conditions" to replace the blue discharge; and general, to cover separation for misconduct.&lt;ref name = troy /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Despite the Committee's report, the VA continued to discriminate against homosexual blue-tickets, renewing its 1945 directive in 1946 and again in 1949.&lt;ref name = berube230 /&gt; Blue discharges were discontinued as of July 1, 1947, and two new headings, general and undesirable, took their place.&lt;ref name=abandon&gt;{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |title= Army to Abandon 'Blue' Discharge |work= Jefferson City Daily Capital News |page= 1 |date= May 21, 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions—distinct from an "honorable discharge"—and an undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable—distinct from a "dishonorable discharge".&lt;ref name = jones2 /&gt; At the same time, the Army changed its regulations to ensure that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérubé|1990|p= 243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct still received dishonorable discharges, while those identified as homosexuals but not to have committed any homosexual acts now received undesirable discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Homosexuals in Uniform |work= Newsweek |date= June 9, 1947 |page= 54 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bjeJCGF5OiUC&amp;pg=PA164&amp; |access-date= January 4, 2009 }} via {{cite book |editor1-first= Larry P. |editor1-last= Gross |editor2-first= James D. |editor2-last= Woods |year= 1999 |title=  The Columbia Reader on Lesbians and Gay Men in Media, Society, and Politics |location= New York |publisher= Columbia University Press |isbn= 9780231104463 |pages= 163–4 |via= [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, a service member who had not committed any homosexual acts would tend to receive a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual sex tended to receive undesirable discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jones|1973|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay service members continued to receive a disproportionate percentage of the undesirable discharges issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shilts|1993|p= 163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the ''status quo'' until replaced in 1993 by the policy commonly known as "[[don't ask, don't tell]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 10 U.S. Code § 654: Repealed |via= Cornell University Law School |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html |access-date= January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the large gay populations in port cities like [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]] are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|1995|p=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty under the '''[[military of the United States|U.S. military]]''' criminal justice system.

==Reinstatement of the military death penalty==
[[File:Hasan nidal.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Nidal Hasan]] when he was still in the military.]]
The U.S. Armed Forces Court of Appeals ruled in 1983 that the military death penalty was unconstitutional, and after new standards intended to rectify the Armed Forces Court of Appeals' objections, the military death penalty was reinstated by an executive order of President [[Ronald Reagan]] the following year.&lt;ref name=dpic&gt;[http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=180&amp;scid=32 The U.S. Military Death Penalty], ''Death Penalty Information Center''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2008, President [[George W. Bush]] approved the execution of Former United States Army Private [[Ronald A. Gray]], who had been convicted in April 1988 of multiple murders and rapes. A month later, [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Pete Geren]] set an execution date of 10 December 2008 and ordered that Gray be put to death by [[lethal injection]] at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]]. The military publicly released Gray's execution date on 20 November 2008. On 26 November, however, Gray was granted a stay of execution by federal judge Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military sets date for first execution since 1961|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 20, 2008|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27828874/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, a Kansas federal judge lifted Gray's stay, moving Gray one step closer to becoming the U.S. military's first death sentence carried out since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Lifts Execution Stay for Ex-Soldier in Military Prison|publisher=[[military.com]]|date=December 28, 2016|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/12/28/judge-lifts-execution-stay-ex-soldier-military-prison.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Military currently has four inmates on death row, the most recent being [[Nidal Hasan]], who murdered 13 people and injured 32 others during the 2009 [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood mass shooting]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Capital crimes==
Currently, under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], 14 offenses are punishable by death. Under the following sections of the UCMJ, the death penalty can be imposed at any time:

* 94 – [[Mutiny]] or [[sedition]]
* 99 – Misbehavior before the enemy
* 100 – Subordinate compelling [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]
* 101 – Improper use of [[countersign (military)|countersign]]
* 102 – Forcing a safeguard&lt;!-- ? --&gt;
* 104 – Aiding the enemy
* 106a – [[Espionage]]
* 110 – Improper hazarding of vessel
* 118 – [[Murder]] 
* 120 – [[Rape]] &lt;ref&gt;Unlike the other capital offenses under the UCMJ, the text of Article 120 does not explicitly state that the death penalty is available; such language was removed in a 2007 revision. However, the revision stated that the maximum penalty remained death until the President specified otherwise.  [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006]], PL 109–163, January 6, 2006, 119 Stat 3136, §552(b). Subsequent Manuals for Courts Martial, issued under the President's authority, continue to describe the maximum penalty for rape as death. See [[Manual for Courts-Martial]] (2012) Appendix 28(f)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another four provisions of the UCMJ carry a death sentence only if the crime is committed during times of war:

* 85 – [[Desertion]]
* 90 – Assaulting or willfully disobeying a superior [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]
* 106 – Lurking as a spy or acting as a spy
* 113 – Misbehavior of a sentinel or lookout

==Legal process==
[[File:USDB2002.jpg|thumb|[[United States Disciplinary Barracks]] houses men on military death row]]
[[File:Navy consolidated brig -- Mirimar CA.jpg|thumb|All female prisoners in the DOD serve time at [[Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar]] (therefore female military service members under death sentence would await execution here).]]
Capital cases are tried in [[Courts-martial in the United States|courts-martial]] before a panel of at least 12 military members. If the defendant is an enlisted service member, he or she may opt for at least one-third of the panel to also be of [[enlisted rank]]. All members of the panel must outrank the accused. The defendant cannot plead guilty to the charges. A two-thirds majority is enough for conviction, but unanimity is required to issue a death sentence during the penalty phase of the proceeding.

All death sentences are automatically appealed, first to the [[Court of Criminal Appeals (disambiguation)|Court of Criminal Appeals]] for the military service concerned, then to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]]. The sentence must be personally confirmed by the [[President of the United States]].

Military executions would be conducted under regulations issued on 17 January 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/r190_55.pdf regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; and would ordinarily take place at the Special Housing Unit of the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]] (USDB), [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]], although alternative locations are possible (such as the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]], Indiana, where federal civilian death-row inmates are housed and executed). Of four convicted servicemen awaiting execution, three are confined at the USDB's Special Housing Unit and one at [[Camp Lejeune]], all of whom have been convicted of murder.

Until 1961--the last military execution to date--hanging was the sole and official method. Later the military introduced the electric chair, which was never used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/military/article_eb49c13c-0e5a-50f3-a8de-1ab9f6e624ae.html |title=Iraq murder charges raise specter of rarely used military death sentence |date=June 29, 2006 |first=Lolita C. |last=Baldor |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nctimes.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmilitary%2Farticle_eb49c13c-0e5a-50f3-a8de-1ab9f6e624ae.html&amp;date=2010-01-30 |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, [[lethal injection]] is the only method.&lt;ref name=dpic/&gt;

== Previous use ==

=== US Civil War===
US General William Rosecrans approved the courtmartial and hanging of two Confederate Officers Lawrence Orton Williams and Walter Peters June 9, 1863 at Franklin Tenn after these two officers had disguised themselves as Union Officers for the purposes of Spying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.executedtoday.com/2017/06/09/1863-lawrence-williams-and-walter-peters-bold-csa-spies/ executed today Williams and Peters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exit78.com/the-execution-of-williams-and-peters/ Execution of Williams and Peters]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1865 four persons convicted on involvement in the assassination of US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] were executed by hanging by the military

In 10 November 1865 [[Henry Wirz]] Commander of Camp Anderson aka Andersonville POW Camp Georgia was tried , convicted and executed by hanging by the military.

=== First World War ===
The United States Army executed 36 soldiers during the [[First World War]] by [[hanging]] between 5 November 1917 and 20 June 1919. Eleven of these hangings were performed in [[French Third Republic|France]] while the remaining 25 were carried out in the continental [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Houston Riot of 1917]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19180705&amp;id=aQdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aQoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1674,3681538&amp;hl=en The Milwaukee Sentinel July 5, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Establishment of Military Justice – Proposed Amendment of the Articles of War, Thursday September 25, 1919. United States Senate, Subcommittee on Militarz Affairs, Washington, D. C.  [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/09_25.pdf (loc.gov/)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942 - 1961===

The military executed 160 soldiers and other members of the armed forces between 1942-61 (these figures do not include German [[prisoners of war]], [[war criminals]], [[espionage|spies]] and [[saboteurs]] executed by U.S. military authorities between 1942-51). 

There have been no military executions since 1961, although the death penalty is still a possible punishment for several crimes under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. Of these executions, 157 were carried out by the [[United States Army]] - this includes members of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] prior to September 1947. After becoming independent of the U.S. Army on September 18, 1947, the [[United States Air Force]] conducted the three remaining executions, one in 1950 and two in 1954. The [[U.S. Navy]] has not executed any of its own servicemen since 1849. 

Of the total, 21 were executed for rape and murder, 85 for murder, and 53 for rape, with Army Pvt. [[Eddie Slovik]] being executed in 1945 by firing squad for [[desertion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2000|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/statab/sec05.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television''', or C-SET, was a [[regional sports network]] in the [[United States]] that was in operation from October 2004 until June 2005.  It was the primary television vehicle of the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] during that team's first season in the league.

==History==
C-SET was a joint venture between Bobcats owner [[Robert L. Johnson]], the executive who founded [[Black Entertainment Television]] and used the money to become the first majority [[African-American]] owner in NBA history, and [[Time Warner Cable]], the largest cable provider in North Carolina. It was supposed to cover both [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. An aspect that set C-SET apart from similar team-owned channels is that Time Warner Cable did not put the channel on analog cable, instead using it as an attraction to get customers for their [[digital cable]] services. [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]], the largest cable provider on the South Carolina side of the Charlotte market, simulcast C-SET's broadcasts on its local news channel, CN2.  A package of 15 Bobcats games produced by C-SET aired on [[WJZY]].

===Other programming===
In addition to the Bobcats, C-SET aired college sports programs, mostly from the [[Big South Conference]] and [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], [[outdoors]] programming (hunting and fishing), [[auto racing]], and [[action sports]].  C-SET also planned a nightly sportscast.

===Closure and aftermath===
C-SET lasted only one NBA season and folded on the day of the [[2005 NBA Draft]].  The lack of analog cable carriage, as well as the Bobcats' poor attendance, was seen as a primary reason.  Additionally, despite being owned by North Carolina's largest cable provider, few other providers picked up C-SET. Time Warner blocked [[satellite television]] providers from carrying the channel.  As a result, cable customers without a digital package, as well as western North Carolina and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.

In 2005, the Bobcats moved their local cable broadcasts to [[News 14 Carolina]] in another complex and limiting deal which cut out viewers who did not have Time Warner or Comporium as a cable provider.  In [[2006-07 NBA season|2006-07]], the team added [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] broadcasts on [[WMYT-TV|WMYT]] after one season on WJZY. In April 2008, Time Warner Cable allowed the Bobcats to exit the News 14 deal and sign a more broadcasting accessible agreement with [[SportsSouth]]/[[FSN South]] in exchange for Time Warner Cable acquiring the [[naming rights]] for the Charlotte Bobcats Arena, which is now known as [[Time Warner Cable Arena]].

The Carolinas would not have a dedicated regional sports network focused on the region until 2008, when Fox Sports South created [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] as a regional subfeed.

'''''Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc.''''', 670 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 760 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1982) is a [[US labor law]] decision of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concerning the award of attorney's fees in a discrimination lawsuit.  The facts of the case involved allegedly discriminatory practices in violation of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title_VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].  The litigants of the case settled in favor of the plaintiffs, but brought the issue of reasonable attorney's fees to the district court.

==Facts==
[[Uniroyal]] allegedly maintained "a segregated hiring and [[seniority]] system at its [[Mishawaka, Indiana]] plant where women were heavily employed in the footwear production division, while other lines predominantly employed male employees." Alta Chrapliwy and other female workers filed charges against the company in a [[class action suit]] that was eventually settled in their favor after years of litigation.

A '''clawback''' or '''clawback provision''' is a special contractual clause typically included in employment contracts by [[financial firm]]s, by which money already paid must be paid back under certain conditions. The term also is in use in [[bankruptcy]] matters where insiders may have raided assets prior to a filing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/clawback_suit_seeks_420k_from_us_transportation_secretary|title=Clawback suit seeks $420K from US transportation secretary concerning in-house counsel pay|last=|first=|date=|website=American Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medicaid#Clawback controversy|Medicaid]], when a state recovers costs of long-term care or covered medical expenses from the estates of deceased Medicaid patients. The aim of the clause is to secure an option for an employer or trustee to limit bonuses, compensation or other remuneration in case of catastrophic shifts in business, bankruptcy, and national crisis as the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], and for states to recoup the cost of administering Medicaid services.

The term '''clawbacks''' or '''claw backs''' can also be used to refer to any money or benefits that have been given out but need to be returned due to special circumstances or events, which are mentioned in a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clawback.asp|title= Clawback | website=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employees' bonuses are, in a clawback scheme, tied specifically to the performance (or lack thereof) of the [[financial product]](s) the individual(s) may have created and/or sold as part of his or her job expecting a high profit. If the product does indeed do well over a long period of time, and permanently improves the nature of the firm, the bonuses paid to the individual are allowed to be retained by the individual. However, if the product fails, and damages the nature of the firm—even years down the line from the product's inception—then the firm has the inherent right to revoke, reclaim, or otherwise repossess some or all of the bonus amount(s).&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 29, 2010|title=What Good Is Wall Street? Much of what investment bankers do is socially worthless|author=Cassidy, John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_cassidy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research shows managers who are subject to clawback provisions that are newly in place in a company often try to offset their increased risk of bonus clawback by demanding an increase in base salary that is not subject to being clawed back.&lt;ref name="deHaan et al."/&gt;

The prevalence of clawback provisions among Fortune 100 companies increased from lower than 3% prior to 2005 to 82% in 2010.&lt;ref name="CSuite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|title=Focus on Clawbacks|website=C-Suite Insight|date=2011|access-date=2012-05-16|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118164533/http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|archive-date=2013-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of clawback provisions is likely, at least in part, due to the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, which requires the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to pursue the repayment of incentive compensation from senior executives that are involved in a fraud. In practice, the Securities and Exchange commission has enforced its clawback powers in only a small number of cases.&lt;ref name= "Fried and Shilon"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1798185 |title=Excess-Pay Clawbacks|authors= Fried, Jesse &amp; Shilon, Nitzan |date=2011|journal= Journal of Corporation Law|volume= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010 mandates the SEC to require that U.S. public companies include a clawback provision in their executive compensation contracts that is triggered by any accounting restatement, regardless of fault (whereas the clawback provisions per the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] only applied to intentional fraud). As of mid 2015, this portion of the Dodd-Frank Act has yet to be implemented. &lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2015/33-9861.pdf |title=Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation|accessdate=February 10, 2018|website=SEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The usual objective of a clawback provision is to deter managers from publishing incorrect accounting information. Academic research finds that voluntarily adopted clawback provisions appear to be effective at reducing both intentional and unintentional accounting errors.&lt;ref name= "deHaan et al."&gt;{{cite news|ssrn=2049442 |title=Does Voluntary Adoption of a Clawback Provision Improve Financial Reporting Quality?|authors= deHaan, Ed &amp; Hodge, Frank &amp; Shevlin, Terry J. |date=2012|work=Contemporary Accounting Research, forthcoming}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also finds that investors have greater confidence in a firm's financial statements after clawback adoption, and that boards of directors place greater weight on accounting numbers in executive bonuses after a clawback is in place (i.e., [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay for performance]] sensitivity increases).

According to a December 2010 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine article,&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; the clawback phenomenon pursued by banks and other financial groups directly and/or indirectly responsible for the financial crisis has been used by the chief administrators of those institutions in order to make the case that they are presently taking tangible self-corrective action to both prevent another crisis (by supposedly dis-incentivizing the sorts of shady investment-product behavior displayed by their people in the recent past) and to appropriately punish any potential future activity of a similar or identical sort. However, the case is made in ''The New Yorker'' article (which cites several professional economists who agree with its perspective) that it is probably unlikely that either result will become the case, and ''The New Yorker'' article also alleges that the people making this argument may not even truly believe it, but are instead promoting it as a sort of [[public relations]] tactic until such time as the impact of the financial crisis fades and similar (perhaps near-identical) abuses of the financial system can slowly and quietly resume, with minimal or no detection by outside forces.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

==Background==
In the past, clawback phenomena have been used primarily in securing [[tax incentive]]s, [[Tax holiday|abatements]], [[tax refund|refund]]s and [[Grant (money)|grants]]. Clawbacks are distinguished from repayments or refunds as they involve a [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] in addition to a repayment.

The use of tax incentives for attracting jobs and [[capital investment]] has grown over the past twenty odd years to include performance measures from which to gauge a company's growth. Typical measures are:

#number of created jobs over 5 or 10 years
#annual payroll
#amount of capital investment over a similar time frame, and
#amount of depreciated value in a given time.

More unusual measures are retaining a headquarters at a specific site for a period of time, amount of production increase or production cost decrease per unit or the requirement to bring a given technology to a commercial market. The recipient will be required to return the monetary value of the incentive plus a penalty and/or interest to the grantor of the incentive, usually a local or state taxing authority. As the use of incentives mature over time, it is sometimes alleged {{who|date=May 2012}} that the triggering of clawbacks for non performance will likely become more ubiquitous.

Clawbacks can be understood to be the contractual elements that stand between the drive for economic development and community development and the slippery slope of [[corporate welfare]]. They are highly controversial and are utilized as community based guarantees for some expectation of performance. The site location industry normally tries to eliminate or reduce any such promises as part of their negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Business Facilities|url=http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|title=Cover|date=|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113130202/http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|archive-date=2006-11-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"&gt;{{cite web|website=Good Jobs First|url=http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|title=Reform|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823152332/http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|archive-date=2006-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iedconline.org/ |website=International Economic Development Council|title=Homem page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in mortgage brokering==
Clawbacks are also used by most banks and lenders to recover money from "unprofitable" home loans. This is usually done when the borrower pays back the loan in a short period of time, usually within 24 months of the loan advancement.

In Australia this fee is usually 0.77% of the total loan amount for loans paid back within the first 12 months after the settlement and 0.385% within 24 months. If a borrower is using a mortgage broker for their home loan, then the broker will usually charge them this amount.

{{Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The '''Constitutional Court''' ({{Lang-fr|1='''Cour Constitutionnelle'''}}) was established by the [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Constitution]] of the Third Republic on 18 February 2006. It is the highest constitutional authority in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. 

Its duty is to ensure that the principles and rules of the constitution are upheld. It considers conformity with the Constitution.

The '''Contagious Diseases Acts''', also known as the CD Acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojtczak |first=Helena |title=THE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ACTS And the campaign to repeal them |url=http://www.historyofwomen.org/cdacts.html |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were originally passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. 85),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contagious Diseases Act |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wcontagious.htm |publisher=Spartacus education |accessdate=1 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116112921/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wcontagious.htm |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with alterations and editions made in 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 35) and 1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 96). In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into [[venereal disease]] (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the [[armed forces]]. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being [[prostitute]]s in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a [[lock hospital]] until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen "subjected districts".{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=1}}

The Act of 1864 stated that women found to be infected could be interned in locked hospitals for up to three months, a period gradually extended to one year with the 1869 Act. These measures were justified by medical and military officials as the most effective method to shield men from venereal disease. Because military men were often unmarried and homosexuality was criminal, prostitution was considered a necessary evil. However, no provision was made for the examination of prostitutes' clientele, which became one of the many points of contention in a campaign to repeal the Acts.

After 1866, proposals were introduced to extend the acts to the north of England and to the civilian population. It was suggested that this extension would regulate prostitution and stop street disorders caused by it in large cities.

The subject of venereal disease, known as social disease, created significant controversy within Victorian society. The Contagious Diseases Acts themselves affected thousands of people's lives, from campaigners to prostitutes themselves. They sparked the debate over inequality between men and women. It was an early political issue that led to women organising themselves and actively campaigning for their rights.

The inconsistent treatment of genders inherent in the acts was a key part of [[Josephine Butler]]'s campaigns for their repeal. In one of her public letters, she allowed a prostitute to deliver her own account of her personal encounters with men:
{{quote|It is men, only men, from the first to the last that we have to do with! To please a man I did wrong at first, then I was flung about from man to man. Men police lay hands on us. By men we are examined, handled, doctored. In the hospital it is a man again who makes prayer and reads the Bible for us. We are had up before magistrates who are men, and we never get out of the hands of men till we die!}}

== Prostitution in Victorian England ==
The level of prostitution was high in Victorian England. The acts themselves would have affected a large proportion of the female workforce in Britain. For several reasons prostitution was predominantly a working class profession. For many working class women their journey into prostitution was one of circumstance. During the nineteenth century the public began to concern itself with particular social problems, an increasing view of the "ideal woman" was beginning to emerge and the "angel of the home" was becoming a popular [[stereotype]]. This rise of the middle class domestic morality made it increasingly harder for women to obtain work in certain professions, causing an increase in such areas as needle-trades, shop girls, [[Agricultural gang|agricultural gangs]], factory work, and domestic servants,{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=81}} all occupations with long hours and little pay. Low earnings, it is argued, meant that women had to resort to prostitution to be able to provide for themselves and their families, particularly in households where the main breadwinner was no longer around. The figures below, however, show this to be untrue. A study from the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period showed that more than 90 per cent of prostitutes in Millbank prison were the daughters of "unskilled and semiskilled workingmen", more than 50 per cent of whom had been servants, the rest having worked in dead-end jobs such as laundering, charring, and street selling.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=16}}

The nature of the occupation makes it difficult to establish the exact number of prostitutes in operation during the Victorian Period. Judicial reports of the years 1857 to 1869 show that prostitutes were more common in commercial ports and pleasure resorts and less so in hardware towns, cotton and linen manufacturing centres and woollen and worsted centres.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=22}} The Westminster Review placed the figure between 50,000 and 368,000.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}} This would make prostitution the fourth-largest female occupation. However, the police estimates of known prostitutes portray an entirely different estimate:

However, this table relates only prostitutes known to the police. The unreliability of statistics during the nineteenth century prevents one from knowing if prostitution was increasing or decreasing during this period, but it is clear that Victorians during the 1840s and 1850s thought that prostitution and venereal disease were increasing.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=80}}

Regulating prostitution was the government's attempt to control the high level of venereal disease in its armed forces. By 1864, one out of three sick cases in the army was caused by venereal disease; admissions into hospitals for gonorrhoea and syphilis reached 290.7 per 1,000 of total troop strength.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=49}}

Prostitutes found work within the armed forces, mainly due to servicemen's forced celibacy and the conditions of the barracks the men were forced to endure.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=88}} The barracks were overcrowded, and had a lack of ventilation and defective sanitation. Very few servicemen were permitted to marry, and even those who were, were not given an allowance to support their wives, which occasionally lured them to become prostitutes as well.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=89}}

== Extension and repeal ==
In 1867, the [[Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was established and was just as prominent in the publishing of pamphlets and articles as the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.

=== Opposition ===
There was much action taken towards the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1869, the [[National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was established; initially restricting women from its meetings, causing the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] to be quickly established by [[Josephine Butler]]. These repeal organisations attracted the vigorous support of moralists and feminists but also those more generally concerned with civil liberties, especially since the Acts were perceived as having violated basic human rights. Both groups actively campaigned against the acts and between 1870 and 1885, 17,365 petitions against the acts bearing 2,606,429 signatures were presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and during the same period, more than 900 meetings were held.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}}
The repealists struck a chord with the public consensus on the issues surrounding prostitution and they highlighted the issue of double standards.

It was the men and women of the National Association and the Ladies National Association who won the battle over the Contagious Diseases Acts, and, in 1886, the Acts were repealed.

== Conditions in lock hospitals ==
If a woman was declared diseased she would be confined in what were known as [[lock hospital]]s. The lock hospitals or lock wards were designed specifically to treat those infected with a venereal disease since 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=J. Ernest|date=1917|title=London Lock Hospitals|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=2963|pages=500|jstor=20308486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in lock hospitals may have been inadequate. An 1882 survey estimated that there were only 402 beds for female patients in all the voluntary lock hospitals in Great Britain, and out of this number only 232 were "funded for use".{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=58}} Female venereal patients generally had to resort to workhouse infirmaries.

Extensive archives on the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts are held at the [[Women's Library]] at the Library of the London School of Economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13812">The '''Councils of Clovesho''' or '''Clofesho''' were a series of [[synod|synods]] attended by [[Anglo-Saxon]] kings, bishops, abbots and nobles in the 8th and 9th centuries. They took place at an unknown location in the [[Kingdom of Mercia]].

== Location ==
The location of the [[place-name]] Clovesho has never been conclusively identified. Scholars believe that Clovesho must have been located in the kingdom of [[Mercia]], or close to it, and close enough to the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of the southern English [[bishop]]s to travel to. It has been described by Clifford Offer as "the most famous lost place in Anglo-Saxon England".&lt;ref&gt;By Clifford Offer, quoted by Slater &amp; Goose below&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest candidate for the location of Clovesho has long been [[Brixworth]] in [[Northamptonshire]], where the surviving Anglo-Saxon church of [[All Saints' Church, Brixworth]] is indicative of the importance of the settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. C. Davis (1962) ''Brixworth and Clofesho'', Journal of the British Archaeological Association, 25:1, 71, DOI: 10.1080/00681288.1962.11894762&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative locations have included [[Cliffe, Kent|Cliffe]] (previously called Cliffe-at-Hoo), [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]&lt;ref&gt;J.

The Councils' dates and their Acts are known. Those Councils of Clovesho for which authentic evidence exists are those of 742, 747, 794, 798, 803, 824 and 825.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== The purpose and nature of the councils ==
When Archbishop [[Theodore of Tarsus]] held the [[Council of Hertford]] in 672 or 673, he declared to the assembled bishops that he had been "appointed by the Apostolic See to be Bishop of the Church of Canterbury". A [[Canon law|canon]] was passed to the effect that in future yearly synods should be held on 1 August every year "in the place which is called Clofeshoch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bede]], H. E., IV, ch. v.&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling represents the inauguration of the first parliamentary system known to have operated in the [[British Isles]]; "there had never before been a parliament with authority enough to decide on matters concerning all the English peoples".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Meetings were held at Clovesho for more than 150 years.

The councils at Clovesho, and those generally of the Anglo-Saxon period, were mixed assemblies which included bishops, [[abbot]]s, the [[List of monarchs of Mercia|king of Mercia]] and the chief men of his kingdom. The councils had the character not only of a church synod but of the [[Witenagemot]], an assembly of the ruling class whose primary function was to advise the king. The affairs of the Church were decided by the bishops, who were in turn presided over by the [[archbishop]]. The king presided over his chiefs and gave his authority to their decisions. There is no evidence of any royal interference in the spiritual legislation or judgments of the Church. [[England]] was not yet united into one kingdom, but the decisions made at Clovesho, as far as can be judged from participants' signatures, represented the decisions of the whole English Church south of the [[Humber]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Seventy years after the Hertford council, the first Council of Clovesho of which we have an authentic record was held. The ''Canterbury Cartulary'' contained a charter stating that in 716 the privilege of [[Wihtred]] to the churches was "confirmed and ratified in a synod held in the month of July in a place called Clovesho". Some doubt has been expressed about the authenticity of this document.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== The Council of 742 ==
The first Council of Clovesho was presided over by [[Æthelbald of Mercia]] and Archbishop [[Cuthbert of Canterbury]]. According to the record of its proceedings, the council "diligently enquired into the needs of religion, the Creed as delivered by the ancient teaching of the Fathers, and carefully examined how things were ordered at the first beginning of the Church here in England, and where the honour of the monasteries according to the rules of justice was maintained".&lt;ref&gt;Given in Kemble's ''Codex Diplomaticus Ævi Saxonici'', 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The privilege of Wihtred, which assured the liberty of the Church, was solemnly confirmed. No other provisions were mentioned.

== The Council of 747 ==
The second Council of Clovesho was one of the most important such gatherings recorded in the history of the [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Anglo-Saxon Church]]. Its acts were copied by Spelman&lt;ref&gt;''Councils'', I, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; from an ancient [[Cottonian]] manuscript, which is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;They are printed in Wilkins, I, 94; in Mansi, XII, 395; and in Haddan and Stubbs, III, 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acts state that the Council was composed of "bishops and dignitaries of less degree from the various provinces of Britain" and that it was presided over by Archbishop [[Cuthbert of Canterbury|Cuthbert]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} According to a manuscript preserved by [[William of Malmesbury]], "King Ethelbald and his princes and chiefs were present".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The Acts related that "first of all, the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], as president, brought forth in their midst two letters of the [[Apostolic Lord]], [[Pope Zachary]], venerated throughout the whole world, and with great care these were plainly read, and also openly translated into our own language, according as he himself by his Apostolic authority had commanded".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The papal letters are described as containing a fervent admonition, addressed to the English people of every rank and condition, and stated that those who condemned these warnings and remained obstinate in their malice should be punished by sentence of excommunication. The council then drew up thirty-one canons, the majority of which dealt with matters of ecclesiastical discipline and liturgy.

The thirteenth and fifteenth canons are noteworthy as showing the close union of the Anglo-Saxon Church with the [[Holy See]]. The thirteenth canon stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]ll the most sacred Festivals of Our Lord made Man, in all things pertaining to the same, viz.: in the Office of Baptism, the celebration of Masses, in the method of chanting, shall be celebrated in one and the same way, namely, according to the sample which we have received in writing from the Roman Church. And also, throughout the course of the whole year, the festivals of the Saints are to be kept on one and the same day, with their proper psalmody and chant, according to the Martyrology of the same Roman Church.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fifteenth canon adds that in the seven hours of the daily and nightly Office the clergy "must not dare to sing or read anything not sanctioned by the general use, but only that which comes down by authority of Holy Scripture, and which the usage of the Roman Church allows".

Other canons required that the [[litanies]] and [[rogation]]s were to be observed by the clergy and people with great reverence "according to the rite of the Roman Church". The feasts of [[St. Gregory]] and of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]], "who was sent to the English people by our said Pope and father St. Gregory", were to be solemnly celebrated. The clergy and monks were to live so as to be always prepared to receive worthily the most holy Body and Blood of the Lord, and the laity were to be exhorted to the practice of frequent Communion. Persons who did not know [[Latin]] were to join in the [[Psalms|psalmody]] by intention, and were to be taught to say prayers for the living or for the repose of the souls of the dead in English. Neither clergy nor monks were to be allowed to live in the houses of the people, nor were they to adopt or imitate the dress which is worn by the laity.

== The Council of 794 ==
The record of the third Council of Clovesho is a charter by which [[Offa of Mercia]] made a grant of land for pious purposes. The charter stated that it has been drawn up "in the general synodal Council in the most celebrated place called Clofeshoas".

Around the time when the [[papal legate]]s presided at the [[Council of Chelsea]] in 787, Offa had obtained from [[Pope Adrian I]] that a new archbishopric should be created at [[Lichfield]] and that the [[Mercia]]n sees should be subjected to its jurisdiction and withdrawn from that of Canterbury. Consequently, at this Council of 794, [[Higbert of Lichfield]], to whom the pope had sent the [[pallium]], signed as an archbishop.

== The Council of 798 ==
A council was held at Clovesho in 798 by [[Archbishop Ethelheard]] with [[Coenwulf of Mercia]], at which the bishops and abbots and chief men of the province were present. Its proceedings are related in a document by Archbishop Ethelheard,&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Manuscript 1212, p. 312; Haddan and Stubbs, III, 512.&lt;/ref&gt; who stated that his first care was to examine diligently "in what way the Catholic Faith was held and how the Christian religion was practised amongst them". To this inquiry, "they all replied with one voice: 'Be it known to your Paternity, that even as it was formerly delivered to us by the Holy Roman and Apostolic See, by the mission of the most Blessed Pope Gregory, so do we believe, and what we believe, we in all sincerity do our best to put into practice.'"{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The Council also devoted time in dealing with questions of church property, and producing an agreement of exchange of lands between the archbishop and the Abbess [[Cynethryth]].

== The Council of 803 ==
The fifth Council of Clovesho was one of the most remarkable of the series, as its Acts contained the declaration of the restitution of the Mercian sees to the [[province of Canterbury]] by the authority of [[Pope Leo III]].

In 798, [[Coenwulf of Mercia]] addressed to the pope a long letter, representing "with great affection and humility" the disadvantages of the new archbishopric at [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]] that had been created eleven years before by [[Pope Adrian I]]. In the letter the king submitted the whole case to the pope, asking his blessing and saying: "I love you as one who is my father, and I embrace you with the whole strength of my obedience", and promising to abide in all things by his decision. "I judge it fitting to bend humbly the ear of our obedience to your holy commands, and to fulfil with all our strength whatever may seem to your Holiness that we ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;Haddan and Stubbs, III, 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Æthelhard]], Archbishop of Canterbury, travelled to Rome to plead for the restitution of the sees. In 802, Leo granted the petition of the king and the archbishop and issued to the latter a [[Papal bull]] in which he restored to him the full jurisdiction enjoyed by his predecessors. The pope communicated this judgment in a letter to Coenwulf.&lt;ref&gt;Haddan and Stubbs, III, 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was duly proclaimed in the Council of Clovesho held in the following year. Archbishop Ethelheard declared to the synod that "by the co-operation of God and of the Apostolic Lord, the Pope Leo", he and his fellow-bishops unanimously ratified the rights of the See of Canterbury, and that an archbishopric should never more be founded at Lichfield, and that the grant of the pallium made "with the consent and permission of the Apostolic Lord Pope Adrian, be considered as null, having been obtained surreptitiously and by evil suggestion".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} After [[Higbert]], the Archbishop of Lichfield, submitted to the papal judgment and retired to a monastery, the Mercian sees returned to the jurisdiction of Canterbury.

== Further synods ==
In 824 and 825 two further synods were held at Clovesho, "[[Beornwulf, King of Mercia]], presiding and the Venerable Archbishop [[Wulfred]] ruling and controlling the Synod", according to the record of the first, and "Wulfred the Archbishop presiding, and also Beornwulf, King of Mercia", according to the second. The first assembly was occupied in deciding a suit concerning an inheritance and the second in terminating a dispute between the archbishop and the Abbess Cynethryth.&lt;ref&gt;Haddan and Stubbs, III, 593, 596.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Family law}}
'''Coverture''' (sometimes spelled '''couverture''') was a legal doctrine whereby, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband, in accordance with the wife's legal status of '''feme covert'''. An unmarried woman, a '''feme sole''', had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name.  Coverture arises from the [[legal fiction]] that a husband and wife are one person.

Coverture was enshrined in the [[common law]] of [[England]] for several centuries and throughout most of the 19th century, influencing some other [[common-law]] jurisdictions. According to Arianne Chernock, coverture did not apply in [[Scotland]], but whether it applied in [[Wales]] is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|pp=18, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rise of the [[feminism|women's rights movement]] in the mid-19th century, coverture came under increasing criticism as oppressive towards women, hindering them from exercising ordinary property rights and entering professions. Coverture was first substantially modified by late 19th century [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; passed in various common-law legal jurisdictions, and was weakened and eventually eliminated by subsequent reforms. Certain aspects of coverture (mainly concerned with preventing a wife from unilaterally incurring major financial obligations for which her husband would be liable) survived as late as the 1960s in some states of the United States.

== Principle ==
Under traditional English common law, an adult unmarried woman was considered to have the legal status of ''feme sole'', while a married woman had the status of ''feme covert''. These terms are English spellings of medieval [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] phrases (the modern standard French spellings would be ''femme seule'' "single woman" and ''femme couverte'', literally "covered woman").

The principle of coverture was described in [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' in the late 18th century:
{{Quote|By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband: under whose wing, protection, and cover, she performs every thing; and is therefore called in our law-French a feme-covert; is said to be covert-baron, or under the protection and influence of her husband, her baron, or lord; and her condition during her marriage is called her coverture. Upon this principle, of a union of person in husband and wife, depend almost all the legal rights, duties, and disabilities, that either of them acquire by the marriage. I speak not at present of the rights of property, but of such as are merely personal. For this reason, a man cannot grant any thing to his wife, or enter into covenant with her: for the grant would be to suppose her separate existence; and to covenant with her, would be only to covenant with himself: and therefore it is also generally true, that all compacts made between husband and wife, when single, are voided by the intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Blackstone|1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A ''feme sole'' had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name, while a ''feme covert'' was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman's existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own. As expressed in [[Hugo Black]]'s dissent in ''[[United States v. Yazell]]'', "This rule [coverture] has worked out in reality to mean that though the husband and wife are one, the one is the husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_v._Yazell/Dissent_Black|title=United States v. Yazell|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband's wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture, she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband. In certain cases, a wife did not have individual legal liability for her misdeeds since it was legally assumed that she was acting under the orders of her husband, and generally a husband and a wife were not allowed to testify either for or against each other.

A queen of England, whether she was a [[queen consort]] or a [[queen regnant]], was generally exempted from the legal requirements of coverture, as understood by [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]].

== History ==
The system of ''feme sole'' and ''feme covert'' developed in England in the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]] as part of the [[common law]] system, which had its origins in the legal reforms of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and other medieval English kings. Medieval legal treatises, such as that famously known as [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], described the nature of coverture and its impact on married women's legal actions. Bracton states that husband and wife were a single person, being one flesh and one blood, a principle known as 'unity of person'. Husbands also wielded power over their wives, being their rulers and custodians of their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae / On the laws and customs of England, edited by George E. Woodbine; translated, with revisions and notes, by Samuel E. Thorne|last=Bracton|first=Henry de|publisher=Selden Society|year=1968|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=vol.4, p. 335}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While it was once assumed that married women had little or no access to legal recourse, as a result of coverture, historians have more recently complicated our knowledge of coverture in the middle ages through various studies of married women's legal status across different courts and jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/845257609|title=Married women and the law in premodern northwest Europe|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|others=Beattie, Cordelia,, Stevens, Matthew Frank,|isbn=9781843838333|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|oclc=845257609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, many of these studies have argued that 'there has been a tendency to overplay the extent to which coverture applied', as legal records reveal that married women could possess rights over property, could take part in business transactions, and interact with the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/845257609|title=Married women and the law in premodern northwest Europe|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|others=Beattie, Cordelia,, Stevens, Matthew Frank,|year=|isbn=9781843838333|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=10|oclc=845257609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval post-conquest Wales, it has been suggested that coverture only applied in certain situations. Married women were responsible for their own actions in criminal presentments and defamation, but their husbands represented them in litigation for abduction and in interpersonal pleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/845257609|title='Married women, crime and the courts in Wales' in Married women and the law in premodern northwest Europe|last=Johnson|first=Lizabeth|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|others=Beattie, Cordelia,, Stevens, Matthew Frank,|year=|isbn=9781843838333|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=71-90|oclc=845257609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of coverture in medieval England has also been qualified by the existence of ''femme sole'' customs that existed in some medieval English towns. This granted them independent commercial and legal rights as if they were single. This practice is outlined in Darcy's [[London]] custumal of the 1340s, allowing married women working independently of their husband to act as a single woman in all matters concerning her craft, such as renting a shop and suing and being sued for debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barron|first=Caroline|date=1989|title='The 'Golden Age' of Women in Medieval London'|url=|journal=Reading Medieval Studies|volume=15|pages=40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom is known to have been adopted in a number of other towns, including Bristol, Lincoln, York, Sandwich, Rye, Carlisle, Chester and Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIntosh|first=Marjorie K.|date=2005|title=The Benefits and Drawbacks of Femme Sole Status in England, 1300–1630|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-british-studies/article/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-femme-sole-status-in-england-13001630/2CC1AB5CD31CF902169CAB0F8749AC47|journal=Journal of British Studies|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=413|doi=10.1086/429708|issn=1545-6986|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some North American British colonies also adopted this custom in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and the Law of Property in Early America|last=Salmon|first=Marylynn|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=44-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear how many women took up this status, the extent to which it was legally enforced, or whether the legal and commercial independence it offered were advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beattie|first=Cordelia|date=2008|title=‘Living as a Single Person’: marital status, performance and the law in late medieval England|url=|journal=Women's History Review|volume=17|pages=327-340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chernock, "coverture,&amp;nbsp;... [a 1777] author&amp;nbsp;... concluded, was the product of foreign Norman invasion in the eleventh century—not, as Blackstone would have it, a time-tested 'English' legal practice. This was a reading of British history, then, that put a decidedly feminist twist on the idea of the 'Norman yoke.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|pp=91, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Normans|Norman]], the people after whom Normandy in northern France is named.}}{{Efn|[[Norman yoke]], largely about feudalism in England under William I}} Also according to Chernock, "the Saxons,&amp;nbsp;... [Calidore] boasted, had encouraged women to 'retain separate property'—&amp;nbsp;... a clear blow to coverture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Saxons]], a confederation of Germanic tribes who had conquered England centuries prior to the Normans.}}{{Efn|Andrew Macdonald}}{{Efn|Calidore was a pseudonymous author ("probably&amp;nbsp;... Andrew Macdonald") of a letter to ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', vol. 58, p.&amp;nbsp;101 (February, 1788)}} Chernock claims that "as the historical accounts of the laws regarding women had indicated, coverture was a policy not just foreign in its origins but also suited to particular and now remote historical conditions."&lt;ref name="Chernock_93" /&gt; Coverture may not have existed in "the Anglo-Saxon constitution."&lt;ref name="Chernock_93" /&gt; 

Coverture also held sway in English-speaking colonies because of the influence of the English common law there. The way in which coverture operated across the common law world has been the subject of recent studies examining the subordinating effects of marriage for women across medieval and early modern England and North America, in a variety of legal contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860349875|title=Married women and the law : coverture in England and the common law world|others=Stretton, Tim, 1963-, Kesselring, K. J. (Krista J.),|isbn=9780773542976|location=Montreal|oclc=860349875}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that in practice, most of the rules of coverture 'served not to guide every transaction but rather to provide clarity and direction in times of crisis or death.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860349875|title=Married women and the law : coverture in England and the common law world|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Stretton, Tim, 1963-, Kesselring, K.

=== Criticism ===
Early [[Feminism|feminist]] historian [[Mary Ritter Beard]] held the view that much of the severity of the doctrine of coverture was actually due to Blackstone and other late systematizers rather than due to a genuine old common-law tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beard|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March [[1776]], [[Abigail Adams]] saw an opportunity in the language of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], and wrote to her husband, [[John Adams]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;“In the new [[United States Code|Code of Laws]] which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/view?id=AFC01d244|title=Adams Papers Digital Edition - Massachusetts Historical Society|website=www.masshist.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;She was not writing generally about [[Women's rights|women’s rights]], or specifically about the [[Suffrage|right to vote]]. She was asking for relief from coverture. John responded, “I cannot but laugh.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyhistory.org/womens-history/education/curriculum/saving-washington/module-1-unofficial-politician/resources/resource-1-coverture|title=The New Republic and Early Reformers: Coverture|last=New-York Historical Society|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chernock, "late Enlightenment radicals&amp;nbsp;.... argued&amp;nbsp;... [that "coverture" and other "principles"] did not reflect the 'advancements' of a modern, civilized society. Rather, they were markers of past human errors and inconsistencies, and thus in need of further revision."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period in 18th Century Europe.}} Chernock claimed that "as the editor of Blackstone's ''Commentaries,'' [Edward] Christian used his popular thirteenth edition, published in 1800, to highlight the ways in which the practice of coverture might be modified."&lt;ref name="Chernock_93"/&gt; Chernock wrote that "Christian&amp;nbsp;.... proceeded to recommend that a husband cease to be 'absolutely master of the profits of the wife's lands during the coverture.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Chernock_93"/&gt; Chernock reported that other men sought for coverture to be modified or eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|p=93}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;93–96&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ellen Carol DuBois, "the initial target of women's rights protest was the legal doctrine of 'coverture...'...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=283}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;284–286 &amp; 293&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, according to DuBois, [[Lucy Stone]] criticized "the common law of marriage because it 'gives the "custody" of the wife's person to her husband, so that he has a right to her even against herself.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Women's rights]], rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls}} Stone kept her premarital family name after marriage as a protest "against all manifestations of coverture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuBois continued, "in the 1850s,&amp;nbsp;.... {{Nowrap|[t]he}} primarily legal goal [of "the American women's rights movement"] was the establishment of basic property rights for women once they were married, which went to the core of the deprivations of coverture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|pp=286–287}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;288.&lt;/ref&gt; Chernock continued, "for those who determined that legal reforms were the key to achieving a more enlightened relationship between the sexes, coverture was a primary object of attention."&lt;ref name="Chernock_93"&gt;{{harvp|Chernock|2010|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuBois wrote that coverture, because of property restrictions with the vote, "played a major role in" influencing the effort to secure [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's right to vote in the U.S.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=260}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;261.&lt;/ref&gt; because one view was that the right should be limited to women who owned property when coverture excluded most women (relatively few were unmarried or widowed),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another view was for the right to be available for all women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, according to Melissa J. Homestead, coverture was criticized as depriving married women authors of the financial benefits of their [[copyright]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|pp=21, 23}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;24, 30, 33, 35–37, 49, 54, 57 &amp; 58&lt;/ref&gt; including analogizing to [[slavery]]; one woman poet "explicitly analogized her legal status as a married woman author to that of an American slave."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|p=24}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;29 &amp; 59–60 &amp; 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homestead, feminists also criticized the effect of coverture on rights under [[patent]]s held by married women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Hartog counter-criticized that coverture was only a [[legal fiction]] and not descriptive of social reality&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that courts applying [[equity (legal concept)|equity jurisdiction]] had developed many exceptions to coverture,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Norma Basch, the exceptions themselves still required that the woman be dependent on someone&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all agreements between spouses to let wives control their property were enforceable in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Homestead|2010|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, coverture was criticized when [[Myra Bradwell]] was refused permission to practice as a lawyer in Illinois specifically because of coverture.&lt;ref name="DuBois_127"&gt;{{harvp|DuBois|1998|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Bradwell argued to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] that coverture violated the Constitution's [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]].&lt;ref name="DuBois_127"/&gt;{{Efn|In U.S. law, an argument to a court is not a decision by that court.}} According to Margot Canaday, "coverture's main purpose&amp;nbsp;... was the legal subordination of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Canaday|2008|p=445}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;465 &amp; 845&lt;/ref&gt; Canaday continued, "women's legal subordination through marriage&amp;nbsp;... was maintained in fact across [coverture]".&lt;ref name="Canaday_465"&gt;{{harvp|Canaday|2008|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canaday, "coverture was diminished&amp;nbsp;... in the 1970s, as part of a broader feminist revolution in law that further weakened the principle that a husband owned a wife's labor (including her person).... The regime of coverture&amp;nbsp;... was coming undone [in the mid-20th century]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Canaday|2008|p=445}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;466 &amp; 471.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court said "the institution of coverture is&amp;nbsp;... obsolete"&lt;ref name="USvYazell-351-ctop"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=382&amp;invol=341 ''U.S.'' v.

=== Abolition ===
This situation continued until the mid-to-late nineteenth century, when [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|married women's property acts]] started to be passed in many English-speaking jurisdictions, setting the stage for further reforms.

[[Image:Racial deed restriction.gif|right|thumb|Note the Acknowledgement in this Florida subdivision plat from 1926: "...on a separate and private examination taken and made by and before me, and separately and apart from her said husband did acknowledge that she made herself a party to the said Plat and Dedication..."]]
In the United States, many states passed [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Acts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts ''Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&amp;#93;)'', in ''Britannica Online Encyclopedia''].&lt;/ref&gt; to eliminate or reduce the effects of coverture. Nineteenth-century courts in the United States also enforced state [[privy examination]] laws. A privy examination was an American legal practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document. This practice was seen as a means to protect married women's property from overbearing husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html ''Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887'' (''Project MUSE'')].&lt;/ref&gt; Other states abolished the concept through court cases, for example: California in ''Follansbee v. Benzenberg'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/122/466.html|title=Follansbee v. Benzenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as 1972, two US states allowed a wife accused in criminal court to offer as a legal defense that she was obeying her husband's orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942533,00.html ''The Law: Up from Coverture'', in ''Time Magazine'', March 20, 1972].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analogous concepts outside the common law system ==
In the [[Roman-Dutch law]], the [[marital power]] was a doctrine very similar to the doctrine of coverture in the English common law. Under the marital power doctrine, a wife was legally a [[minor (law)|minor]] under the guardianship of her husband.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1946|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/introductiontoro00leeruoft#page/64/mode/2up pp. 64–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Napoleonic Code]] – which was very influential both inside and outside of Europe – married women and children were subordinated to the husband's authority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/crs1_low.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Married French women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref&gt;http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Neighboring [[Switzerland]] was one  of the last European countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, came into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html |title=Swiss grant women equal marriage rights |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 September 1985 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450 |title=Switzerland profile – Timeline |date=1 January 2016 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=Switzerland's Long Way to Women's Right to Vote |work=History of Switzerland |accessdate=1 March 2016 |editor=Markus G. Jud}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shreir|1988|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Louisiana]] became the last of the states of the U.S. to have its [[Head and Master law]] struck down. An appeal made it to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1980, and in the following year the high court's decision in ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'' effectively declared the practice of male-rule in marriage unconstitutional, generally favoring instead a co-administration model.

== Outside the legal realm ==
The doctrine of coverture carried over into British [[heraldry]], in which there were established traditional methods of displaying the [[coat of arms]] of an unmarried woman, displaying the coat of arms of a widow, or displaying the combined coat of arms of a couple jointly, but no accepted method of displaying the coat of arms of a married woman separately as an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|p=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice by which a woman relinquishes her name and adopts her husband's name (e.g., "Mrs. John Smith") is similarly a representation of coverture, although usually symbolic rather than legal in form.{{Citation needed|date = November 2017}}

In some cultures, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]], wives often [[maiden and married names|change their surnames]] to that of their husbands upon getting married. Although this procedure is today optional, for some it remains a controversial practice due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture or to other similar doctrines in civil law systems, and to the historically subordinated roles of wives; while others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450 |title=Why should women change their names on getting married? |date=1 November 2014 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to [[women's rights]], and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when [[Greece]] adopted a new [[marriage law]] which guaranteed [[gender equality]] between the spouses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html |title=Greece Approves Family Law Changes |author=[[Reuters]] |date=26 January 1983 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; women in Greece are ''required'' to keep their birth names for their whole life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/women-change-name-after-marriage-greece |title=Should women change their names after marriage?

== Cultural references ==
The phrase "the law is an ass" was popularized by Charles Dickens' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when the character Mr. Bumble is informed that "the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction". Mr. Bumble replies, "if the law supposes that&amp;nbsp;... the law is a {{Sic}} ass—a idiot. If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience—by experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shapiro|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA197 pp. 197–198] (item 20)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Republic of Dahomey]] on 5 January 1964. The main issues were changing the system of government to a [[presidential system]], scrapping term limits for the president, and having a [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]]. The referendum passed with 99.86% of voters approving the changes. Turnout was 92.1% of the 1,051,614 registered voters.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M &amp; Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p89 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debt settlement''', also known as '''debt arbitration''', '''debt negotiation''' or '''credit settlement''', is an approach to debt reduction in which the [[debtor]] and [[creditor]] agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Birmbaum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/business/yourmoney/09credit.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin |title=De bt Relief Can Cause Headaches of Its Own |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a negotiation period, all payments by the debtor are made to the debt settlement company, which typically withholds payments to the creditors, even if the debtor has paid a lump sum or made payments.  Once all the debtor's accounts are in default due to this non-payment, the debt settlement company has leverage to force the debtor to accept a reduced lump sum payment as settlement. The debtor's credit rating goes down significantly due to the default, especially if the debtor was not behind on payments before the negotiation period commenced. Even though the accounts are "settled," the default appears on the debtor's credit record for seven years. Nevertheless, some debtors prefer this method of debt reduction over bankruptcy.

Debt settlement is often confused with [[debt consolidation]] or [[debt management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khalfani-Cox|first1=Lynnette|title=Debt Management vs. Debt Settlement: Which Is Best?|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/credit-loans-debt/info-08-2011/debt-management-debt-settlement.html|website=AARP|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=11 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In debt consolidation and debt management, the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt consolidator, who takes a fee and passes the rest on to the creditors; this way, creditors continue to receive payments each month.  In debt settlement, the consumer makes monthly payments, out of which the debt settlement company takes its fees for the legal work or negotiation and payments are paid to the creditor. The debt settlement company may persuade the creditor to accept a settlement less than the amount the debtor pays, with the debt settlement company keeping the difference.

Debtors may use debt settlement instead of conventional debt management because they are not aware of debt management.

== History ==

As a concept, lenders have been practicing debt settlement for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/soconne1/documents/forgive.pdf Debt Forgiveness: Plainer Speaking, Please.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the business of debt settlement became prominent in America during the late 1980s and early 1990s when bank [[deregulation]], which loosened [[consumer lending]] practices, followed by an economic [[recession]] placed consumers in financial hardships.

With charge-offs (debts [[Write-off|written-off]] by banks) increasing, banks established debt settlement departments staffed with personnel who were authorized to negotiate with defaulted cardholders to reduce the [[Balance (accounting)|outstanding balances]] in hopes to recover funds that would otherwise be lost if the cardholder filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]]. Typical settlements ranged between 25% and 65% of the outstanding balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditcardnation.com/testimony-20070416.pdf Testimony of Dr. Robert Manning before the FTC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the unprecedented spike in [[personal debt]] loads, there has been another rather significant (even if criminally under reported) change – the 2005 passage of legislation that dramatically worsened the chances for average Americans to claim Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. As things stand, should anyone filing for bankruptcy fail to meet the Internal Revenue Service regulated ‘means test’, they would instead be shelved into the Chapter 13 debt restructuring plan. Essentially, [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13 bankruptcies]] simply tell borrowers that they must pay back some or all of their debts to all unsecured lenders. Repayments under Chapter 13 can range from 1% to 100% of the amounts owed to unsecured creditors, based on the ability of the debtor to pay. Repayment periods are 3 years (for those who earn below the median income) or 5 years (for those above), under court mandated budgets that follow IRS guidelines, and the penalties for failure are  more severe.

== Process ==

Debt settlement is the process of negotiating with creditors to reduce overall debts in exchange for a lump sum payment.  A successful settlement occurs when the creditor agrees to forgive a percentage of total account balance.  Normally, only unsecured debts not secured by real assets like homes or autos can be settled. [[Unsecured debt]]s include medical bills and [[Credit card debt]] - not student loans, auto financing or mortgages. For the debtor, this makes obvious sense, they avoid the stigma and intrusive court-mandated controls of bankruptcy while still lowering, sometimes by more than 50%, their debt balances.  Whereas, for the creditor, they regain trust that the borrower intends to pay back what he can of the loans and not file bankruptcy (in which case, the creditor risks losing all moneys owed).

Negotiating with a collection agency or junk debt buyer is somewhat similar to negotiating with a credit card company or other original creditor.  However, many collection agencies (or junk debt buyers) will agree to take less of the owed amount than the original creditor, because the junk debt buyer has purchased the debt for a fraction of the original balance.&lt;ref name="ZombieDebt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/ZombieDebtCollectorsDigUpYourOldMistakes.aspx|title=Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a part of the settlement, the consumer can request that collection is removed from the [[credit report]], which is generally not the case with the original creditor.  Even if the removal of the collection account from the consumer credit report has been successfully achieved as a condition of settlement during negotiations, the negative marks from the original credit card company will still remain, according to Maxine Sweet, a spokeswoman for credit reporting agency Experian.&lt;ref name="MakeADeal"/&gt;

Potential candidates for debt settlement will typically have an overwhelming debt that they can’t afford to pay, have poor credit or don’t care about negatively impacting their bad credit, and/or don’t qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Debt Settlement: A Complete Guide |url=https://www.supermoney.com/debt-help/debt-settlement/ |publisher=SuperMoney |accessdate=June 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the U.K. you can appoint an Arbiter or legal entity to negotiate with the creditors. Creditors often accept reduced balances in a final payment and this is called '''full and final settlement''' but with debt settlement the reduced amount can be spread over an agreed term.

In the U.K. creditors such as banks, credit card, loan companies and other creditors are already writing off huge amounts of debt. Most creditors are open to negotiations and are willing to accept reductions of 50% or more. Debt settlement allows the public to spread payments out over a set term - instead of having to pay a lump sum in one go which is the case with Full and Final Settlement.

U.K. debt settlement is not to be confused with full and final settlement where debt management companies have been known to hold on to client funds in which case the creditors get nothing until they decide to settle.  Furthermore, the debt management company usually instructs the consumer not to make any payments to creditors.  The intended effect is to scare creditors into settling the debt for less than the full amount.  Typically, however, creditors simply begin collection procedures, which can include filing suit against the consumer in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Federal Trade Commission, Facts for Consumers, "Knee Deep in Debt"|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre19.shtm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as [[consumer]]s continue to make minimum monthly payments, creditors will not negotiate a reduced balance.  However, when payments stop, balances continue to grow because of late fees and ongoing interest.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; This practice of holding client funds is regarded as unethical in the U.S. and U.K.

===United States===
U.S. debt settlement differs slightly. There are several indicators that few consumers actually have their debt eliminated by full and final settlement. A survey of U.S. debt settlement companies found that 34.4% of enrollees had 75 percent or more of their debt settled within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TASC |title=Letter from the Association of Settlement Companies (TASC) to the Federal Trade Commission, commenting on the FTC's proposed amendments to the Telemarketing Sales Rule on the marketing of debt relief services at 9-11 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/tsrdebtrelief/543670-00202.pdf |publisher=FTC |accessdate=Oct 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602151345/http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/tsrdebtrelief/543670-00202.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data released by the Colorado Attorney General showed that only 11.35 percent of consumers who had enrolled more than three years earlier had all of their debt settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Press Release |title=Attorney General Unveils First Annual Report On Debt Settlement, Credit Counseling Business Practices |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2009/10/15/attorney_general_unveils_first_annual_report_debt_settlement_credit_counseling |publisher=Colorado Attorney General |accessdate=Oct 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204190809/http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2009/10/15/attorney_general_unveils_first_annual_report_debt_settlement_credit_counseling |archivedate=2010-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And when asked to show that most of their customers are better off after debt settlement, industry leaders said that would be an "unrealistic measure." &lt;ref name="GAO Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=GAO Report|title=Debt Settlement: Fraudulent, Abusive and Deceptive Practices Pose Risk to Consumers|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10593t.pdf|publisher=GAO|accessdate=Apr 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers can arrange their own settlements by using advice found on web sites, hire a [[lawyer]] to act for them, or use debt settlement companies.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;  In a New York Times article Cyndi Geerdes, an associate professor at the University of Illinois law school, states "Done correctly, (debt settlement) can absolutely help people". However, stopping payments to creditors as part of a debt settlement plan can reduce a consumer's [[credit score]] from 65 to 125 points, with higher impacts on those who were current on their payments prior to enrolling in the program.&lt;ref name="GAO Report"/&gt; And missed payments can remain on a consumer's credit report for seven years even after a debt is settled.&lt;ref name="GAO Report"/&gt;

Some settlement companies may charge a large fee up front, which ignores a rule from the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Consumer Advocates |title=Debt Settlement Company Evasion of Amendments to TSR |url=http://www.cambridge-credit.org/pdf/ftcopenletter12132010.pdf |publisher=Cambridge-Credit.org |accessdate=Dec 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313165334/http://www.cambridge-credit.org/pdf/ftcopenletter12132010.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or they take a monthly fee from customer bank accounts for their service, possibly reducing the incentive to settle with creditors quickly. One expert advises consumers to look for companies that charge only after a settlement is made, and charge about 20 percent of the amount by which the outstanding balance is reduced.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;  Other experts say debt settlement is a flawed model altogether and should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Center for Responsible Lending |title=The Debt Settlement Industry |url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/other-consumer-loans/debt-settlement/research-analysis/the-debt-settlement-industry.html |publisher=Center for Responsible Lending |accessdate=Jan 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229181853/http://www.responsiblelending.org/other-consumer-loans/debt-settlement/research-analysis/the-debt-settlement-industry.html |archivedate=2011-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional debt settlement==

Depending on the country, different laws regulate professional debt settlement companies. In the United States, debt relief companies are required to provide information in advance of a consumer signing up for the services, including the cost and the terms. A legitimate company will use a [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]-insured trust account.  Once enough funds are built up the negotiation  process can begin with each creditor individually.  Trust accounts, also known as "special purpose accounts," are often held by a bank, and managed by a bank agent (who charges a monthly maintenance fee).  Accounts can also be held by creditors, or may be sold to collections agency for an average of $0.15 on the dollar, in which case debt can still be negotiated.

A consumer makes monthly payments to the debt settlement company, or to the bank (or bank agent) who holds the "trust" account.  A portion of each payment is taken as fees for the debt settlement company, and the rest is put into the trust account.  The consumer is told not to pay anything to the creditors.  The debt settlement company's fees are usually specified in the enrollment contract, and may range from 10% to 75% of the total amount of debt to be settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Money, "Debt settlement: A costly escape"|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/DebtSettlementACostlyEscape.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FTC regulations effective October 27, 2010 restrict debt settlement companies from collecting any fees from a debtor client for services until settlement with the creditor has been reached and at least one payment made.

===Advantages===
Settlement companies generally package their settlements into a larger bulk settlement with the creditor for 35% - 50% of the existing balances.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The debt settlement companies typically have built up a relationship during their normal business practices with the credit card companies and can come to a settlement agreement quicker and at a more favorable rate than a debtor acting on their own. With [[Global financial crisis of 2008|the current economic crisis]], more and more credit card companies may be willing to settle existing credit card debts rather than add to their already large written off bad debt.

===Disadvantages===
Debt settlement companies generally take a percentage of the savings of the forgiven debt as the fee for their services. The drop out rate of debt settlement programs is high if a monthly plan is greater than 36 months at 50% and consumers who find themselves in these sorts of debt situations tend to have trouble sticking to a structured payment program for an extended period of time. Plans 36 months or less have a completion rate of over 85%  Good settlement companies will arrange monthly update calls, establish a plan where you could miss a payment or two (life happens) or finish the plan six months earlier if you are consistent with all monthly payments. Credit card accounts typically go into collection after they are charged off, typically 180 days after the last payment on the account.  The debt settlement companies may not handle calls from the credit card companies, nor the collection agencies.Calls will slow down as the settlement company makes contact with the creditors.  Legal action can be taken against the creditor if they violate the FDCP act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf|title=Consumer Information - Federal Trade Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good settlement company works with their clients to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/how-does-debt-settlement-work/[NerdWallet] February 26, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;  Debtors can be sued by creditors seeking to recover debts and interest. This can be avoided by using companies with good standings and practices that protect consumers from these procedures.{16}

==Do-it-yourself debt settlement==

It is possible for a consumer to imitate the methods of professional debt settlement companies and many people report success in negotiating a debt settlement for themselves.&lt;ref name="MakeADeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/MakeADealWithDebtCollectors.aspx|title=Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiation of negotiations can begin by calling the customer service department of the credit card company. In general, the credit card company will only deal with a consumer when the consumer is behind on payments but capable of making a lump sum payment.  A payment plan is not an option; the credit card company will demand that the consumer make a lump sum payment of the settlement amount.

===Advantages===
By negotiating debts on their own, debtors are able to save in fees that would otherwise be paid to a debt settlement company or an attorney.  This option also gives the debtor more control over the process which may, or may not, be a motivational factor to continue successfully completing the process.

===Disadvantages===
While the do-it-yourself option offers the debtor more control and reduced fees, there are negatives generally associated with this option. Creditors have their own policies regarding debt settlement and certain creditors will not settle directly with consumers. Additionally, consumers may face less advantageous settlement rates on their own, as opposed to debt settlement companies that have relationships with creditors and can often package bulk settlements. Consumers may face difficulty getting through to decision makers or long delays in any negotiations or paperwork processing with the creditors. Furthermore, every creditor has different processes and procedures in how they determine settlement offers and terms. Not knowing those can leave a consumer in the dark. Settlement Companies have a Customer service department to assist consumers with any questions or difficulties that arise during their program. This support can be particularly valuable, especially in cases where creditors become aggressive. If an account were to escalate to legal status, a consumer settling on their own would need to seek out a third party for help. Unfamiliarity of the settlement process can be intimidating and mistakes can be made. You will need to beware of fine print and carefully review any correspondence, proposed settlement or agreement with a creditor. Settlement Agreements should be reviewed very carefully, perhaps by a third party, to make sure that all the terms are those that are agreed upon. Settling one’s debt can be an emotionally draining and difficult process.

== Creditor’s incentives ==

The creditor’s primary incentive is to recover funds that would otherwise be lost if the debtor filed for bankruptcy. The other key incentive is that the creditor can often recover more funds than through other collection methods. Collection agencies and [[Collection agency|collection attorneys]] charge commissions as high as 40% on recovered funds. Bad debt purchasers buy portfolios of delinquent debts from creditors who give up on internal collection efforts and these [[bad debt]] purchasers pay between 1 and 12 cents on the dollar, depending on the age of the debt, with the oldest debts the cheapest.&lt;ref name="ZombieDebt"/&gt; Collection calls and lawsuits sometimes push debtors into bankruptcy, in which case the creditor often recovers no funds.

== Common objections  ==

'''Damages credit''' - Credit reports will show evidence of debt settlements and the associated [[FICO]] scores will be lowered temporarily as a result.  However, if a "paid in full" letter is obtained from the creditor, the debtor's credit report should show no sign of a debt settlement.  Additionally, as debtors settle their accounts the score starts to go back up again. Some Debt Settlement companies offer Credit Repair in their programs in order to erase some of the negative remarks on credit reports.

'''Potential for lawsuits''' - Though few creditors wish to push borrowers toward bankruptcy, (and the potential of governmental protection against all debts),there’s always the possibility of a [[lawsuit]] whenever debts lay unpaid.  In the debt settlement process the debtor's accounts remain in default.  While the debts are still in default the creditor or its assignee can still file a lawsuit against a debtor.  Most creditors and debt collectors want a lump sum payment to settle for less than the full debt.  Although a debtor may make monthly payments to the debt settlement company, the amount is too small to successfully negotiate a settlement until after the debtor has made several months' worth of payments.

'''Eligibility of debts''' - In addition, the specific debts of the borrowers themselves affect the success of negotiations.  [[Tax liens]] and domestic judgments, for reasons that should be clear, remain unaffected by attempts at settlement.  Student loans, even those not federally subsidized, have been granted special powers by recent legislation to attach bank accounts without possibility of Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  Also, some individual creditors, including Discover Card, for example, tend to have an aggressive resistance against negotiations.

'''Tax consequences''' - Another common objection to debt settlement is that debtors whose debts are partially canceled outside the bankruptcy system will need to report the canceled portion of the debt as [[taxable income]]. (IRS Publication Form 982) The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers any amount of forgiven debt as taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The forgiving creditor must provide the taxpayer with a 1099-C tax form for amounts $600 or greater. This form will list the amount of forgiven debt and interest in Box 2. Taxpayers with portions of personal loans forgiven may not subtract the interest reported in Box 3 from the amount of reportable income on this form.

However, the IRS does not require taxpayers to report forgiven debt if the tax payer was [[insolvent]] at the time the creditor forgave the debt. Being insolvent means that the amount of a debtor’s debts are greater than his/her assets (how much money and property the debtor owns). However, the IRS adds that “you cannot exclude any amount of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you are insolvent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#d0e4707|title=Publication 525 (2015), Taxable and Nontaxable  Income|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a taxpayer is $10,000 in debt and owns $3,000 in assets, he/she cannot exclude more than $7,000 of forgiven debt from his/her [[income tax]]. Any forgiven debt over $7,000 that year must be reported as taxable income.

==  Criticism ==

In May 2009, the [[New York Attorney General]] issued [[subpoena]]s to fourteen "debt settlement" companies, looking for violations of New York law.&lt;ref&gt;New York Attorney General Press Release May 7, 2009 http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/may/may7a_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 19, 2009, the [[New York Attorney General]] filed suit against two "debt settlement" firms and their affiliates, alleging violations related to fraudulent business practices and false advertising.&lt;ref&gt;New York Attorney General Press Release May 19, 2009 http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/may/may19b_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2010 [[CBS]] ''[[Early Show]]'' story on the debt settlement industry cast a harsh light on major debt settlement firm [[Credit Solutions of America]]'s business practices, and provided consumer advice for debt settlement counseling.&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, Early Show, Beware Debt Settlement Companies, March 29, 2010, http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/29/earlyshow/contributors/susankoeppen/main6343617.shtml?tag=cbsnewsTwoColUpperPromoArea&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Better Business Bureau rating ===

The [[Better Business Bureau]] has adopted an automatic downgrading policy for all debt settlement companies.  In a written statement, the Council of Better Business Bureaus stated, "Debt negotiation/settlement businesses are downgraded in the BBB rating system based on BBB concerns with the debt negotiation/settlement industry. The FTC held a workshop on debt negotiation/settlement last fall, and similar concerns were expressed as to how the industry operates and the likelihood that debt negotiation/settlement benefits a significant number of consumers."

The Association of Settlement Companies (TASC), the professional association for the debt settlement industry, warned in a written statement that "under the BBB’s new rating system, it is virtually impossible for a debt settlement company to be rated anything other than a ‘D’ or ‘F’,". In a February letter TASC sent to the National Council of Better Business Bureaus, the organization alleged that “there are critical flaws in the BBB’s consumer grading system as it applies to settlement firms.” The letter expressed concern that all settlement companies will be given poor ratings, regardless of the number of consumer complaints, how those complaints have been resolved, or the business practices of the settlement firm under review. TASC says the dispute stems from the fact that the BBB does not consider debt settlement a viable option for consumers who cannot afford to pay back their debts and want professional help to negotiate lower payments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Decree Law 4161/56''' ({{lang-es|Decreto ley 4161/56}}) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[government]] [[decree]] designed to suppress [[Peronism|Peronist]] sentiment among the Argentine people. Enacted on 5 March 1956, six months after the 1955 overthrow of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Juan Perón]] in the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', the decree instituted a wide-ranging ban on any "affirmation of Peronism" under the government of [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]].

==Decree Law 4161/56==
[[File:Eva&amp;Juan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Perón]] and [[Evita Perón]], as depicted on a 1950s photograph. Decree Law 4161/56 prohibited their names from being mentioned.]]
The decree officially outlawed the "affirmation of Peronism, publicly performed, or Peronist propaganda, by any person, whether by individuals or groups of individuals, associations, unions, political parties, corporations, legal entities of public or private images, symbols, signs, significant expressions, items and artwork doctrines, intending genuine or could be taken by anyone as such owned or used by individuals or bodies representative of Peronism."

The law explicitly prohibited images of the former president and even went as far as to outlaw mentioning the names of both the former president and his wife [[Evita Perón|Evita]], a woman particularly popular with the poor Argentines of the [[working class]], as Article I of the decree banned not only the "photographs, portraits, and sculptures" of the former president but also the very names of Juan and Eva Perón, the names of Perón's officials, and other symbols and references to the [[Perón]]s, the former administration, and the [[Justicialist Party]]. Two musical works which celebrated Juan and Eva Perón {{ndash}} ''Marcha de los Muchachos Peronista'' and ''Evita Capitana'' {{ndash}} were banned explicitly.

Aramburu himself only referred to Perón as "the monster" and newspapers identified him as "the fugitive tyrant." Historian Antonius Robben describes the shouting of Perón's name as "a small act of resistance" under Aramburu.&lt;ref name = "Robben 2005, 27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robben|2005|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4522">The '''Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003''' was draft legislation written by [[United States Department of Justice]] during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], under the tenure of [[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]]. The [[Center for Public Integrity]] obtained a copy of the draft marked "confidential" on February 7, 2003 and posted it on its [[Web site]] along with commentary. It was sometimes called '''Patriot II''', after the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which was enacted in 2001. It was never introduced to the [[United States Congress]].

The draft version of the bill would have expanded the powers of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]] while simultaneously curtailing [[judicial review]] of these powers. Members of the [[United States Congress]] said that they had not seen the drafts, though the documents obtained by the CPI indicated that [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Dennis Hastert]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] had received copies.

Provisions of the draft version included:
*Removal of court-ordered prohibitions against police agencies spying on domestic groups.
*The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] would be granted powers to conduct [[Search and seizure|searches]] and surveillance based on intelligence gathered in foreign countries without first obtaining a [[Search warrant|court order]].
*Creation of a [[DNA database]] of suspected [[terrorism|terrorists]].
*Prohibition of any public disclosure of the names of alleged terrorists including those who have been arrested.
*Exemptions from [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[Legal liability|liability]] for people and businesses who voluntarily turn private information over to the government.
*Criminalization of the use of [[encryption]] to conceal incriminating communications.
*Automatic denial of [[bail]] for persons accused of terrorism-related crimes, reversing the ordinary [[common law]] [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] principle. Persons charged with terrorists acts would be required to demonstrate why they should be released on bail rather than the government being required to demonstrate why they should be held.
*Expansion of the list of crimes eligible for the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]].
*The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] would be prevented from releasing "worst-case scenario" information to the public about chemical plants.
*[[United States nationality law|United States citizens]] whom the government finds to be either members of, or [[Providing material support for terrorism|providing material support]] to, terrorist groups could have their [[Naturalization#Denaturalization|citizenship revoked]] and be [[Deportation|deported]] to foreign countries.

Some provisions of this act have been tacked onto other bills such as the Senate Spending bill and subsequently passed.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Bill of Rights Defense Committee]] have all been vocal opponents of the PATRIOT Act of 2001, the proposed (as of 2003) PATRIOT 2 Act, and other associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism that it believes violates either the letter and/or the spirit of the U.S. Bill of Rights.

On January 31, 2006 the Center for Public Integrity published a story on its website that claimed that this proposed legislation undercut the Bush administration's legal rationale of its NSA wiretapping program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6209">{{Politics of the Republic of the Congo}}
Congo’s electoral law was approved in 2001 and amended in 2007, 2012, 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/01/15/congo-une-nouvelle-commission-electorale-adoptee-par-l-assemblee-nationale_4848298_3212.html "Congo : une nouvelle commission électorale adoptée par l’Assemblée nationale"], ''Le Monde'', 15 January 2016 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It aims to provide the conditions for a democratic and transparent electoral system, from campaigning and media access through voter registration, vote counting and certification.

Presidential and parliamentary elections take place under a two-round majority system. In presidential elections, this means that if no candidate reaches 50% in the first round, there is a second round 21 days afterwards, featuring the top two candidates. In parliamentary elections, each parliamentary seat is decided by a single-seat constituency vote, with a second round taking place if no candidate reaches 50% in a constituency.

Under Congolese electoral law, all adults over the age of 18 can vote (including those who are not yet 18 but will be at the time of the election).

An election campaign in the Republic of Congo begins 15 days before the vote. It finishes two days before the vote, at midnight (as elections are always on Sundays in Congo, this means that campaigning must cease Friday at midnight).

The electoral law regulates posters, election rallies, leaflets, the press and other media appearances. During the election period, equal space is given for the election posters of all candidates. Rallies are authorised but must be declared to the authorities 24 hours before taking place. In addition, on-screen time and access is provided in state broadcast media for all candidates. Civil servants are not allowed to engage in campaigning.

On voting day – which is from 7am to 6pm on Sundays (though it can be extended if there are more voters than anticipated) – all parties are entitled to have delegates at all polling stations. Vote counting involves an initial tally of the number of votes cast to ensure a match with the number of declared voters. Once this is completed, votes per candidate are counted. The votes are transmitted electronically to the electoral commission on the day, but it is not until the paper copies are received that the vote is certified and deemed official.

The preparation of elections is under the control of the interior ministry, which is in charge of voter rolls, receiving candidacies for elections, acquiring and distributing election materials. However, the organisation of elections is under the power of the electoral commission – formerly the National Commission for the Organisation of Elections (CONEL – Commission nationale d’organisation des élections) and now the Independent National Election Commission (CNEI – Commission nationale électorale indépendante).

The national electoral commission is in charge of verifying electoral rolls, ensuring the election campaign is without incident, collecting and assembling election results, and transmitting the results to the interior minister and Constitutional Court. It is made up of civil servants, members of political parties and civil society. Local electoral commissions have a similar composition and are supervised by the national commission.

== Recent changes to the Electoral Law ==
The most recent modification of the law came on January 14, 2016, with the creation of a new electoral commission, the Independent National Election Commission (CNEI – Commission nationale électorale indépendante). This replaced the National Commission for the Organisation of Elections (CONEL – Commission nationale d’organisation des élections).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/01/15/congo-une-nouvelle-commission-electorale-adoptee-par-l-assemblee-nationale_4848298_3212.html|title=Congo : une nouvelle commission électorale adoptée par l’Assemblée nationale|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|issn=1950-6244|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNEI is made up of members of both government and opposition parties, as well as civil society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/monde/detail_congo-la-nouvelle-loi-electorale-adoptee-par-l-assemblee-nationale?id=9186174|title=Congo: la nouvelle loi électorale adoptée par l'Assemblée nationale|website=RTBF Info|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is set up to be independent and financially autonomous. Indeed, the new budget law assigns a specific budget line to the CNEI.[http://french.peopledaily.com.cn/Afrique/n3/2016/0115/c96852-9004117.html]

Ballot papers have also changed in line with demands by the opposition – moving to a single ballot paper. This limits opportunities to cheat by taking and using several ballots – as voters will now be given a single paper on which they will be asked to place one cross or tick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/congo/congo-brazzaville-la-gouvernance-lectorale-en-constante-am-lioration|title=Congo-Brazzaville : la gouvernance électorale en constante amélioration|website=ReliefWeb|language=French|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While parties were already entitled to have representatives at all polling stations, their agreement in certifying the vote count is now mandatory. These changes have been noted by the opposition, which has welcomed progress made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.web-afc.info/congo-presidentielle-la-date-du-depot-des-candidatures-fixee-du-5-au-20-fevrier/|title=Congo – Présidentielle  : la date du dépôt des candidatures fixée du 5 au 20 février|website=www.web-afc.info|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the election deposit has changed, meaning prospective candidates are required to pay a deposit of 25,000,000 CFA francs. This was reduced from initial proposals in parliament, on the grounds that more candidates should be able to run.

There will be new rules on state funding of political parties brought in after the elections.

'''Family patrimony''' is a type of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[Property|patrimony]] that is created by [[marriage]] or [[civil union]] (where recognized) which creates a bundle of entitlements and [[obligation]]s that must be shared by the spouses or partners upon [[divorce]], [[annulment]], [[dissolution of marriage]] or dissolution of [[civil union]], when there must be a [[division of property]]. It is similar to the [[common law]] concept of [[community property]].

==Fiscal Year 2015==
This table lists the tax revenue collected from each state, plus the District of Columbia and the territory of Puerto Rico by the IRS in fiscal year 2015, which ran from October 1, 2014, through September 30, 2015. The gross collections total only reflects the revenue collected from the categories listed in the table, and not the entire revenue collected by the IRS. Per capita values are based on population estimates from the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] for July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2016/state/totals/nst-est2016-01.xlsx|title=Table 1.

The '''Insubordinate movement''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Movimiento insumiso'' or ''Insumisión'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Moviment d'insubmissió'', [[Galician language|Galician]]: ''Movemento insubmiso'', [[Euskera|Basque]]: ''Matxinada'') was a mass [[Antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] movement of [[civil disobedience]] to compulsory [[military service]] in [[Spain]], the movement lasting from the early 1980s until the abolition of [[conscription]] on 31 December 2001.

==History==
The immediate predecessor of insubordination was the movement of [[conscientious objector]]s initiated in the last years of the [[Francoism|Francoist regime]], a movement seeking legal recognition of the right not to perform the, then, compulsory [[military service]] on conscience or  moral grounds. Objectors, therefore, refused the army, but were nevertheless prosecuted  and tried by it, and in many cases ended up in [[military prisons]].

In 1984 the [[Congreso de los Diputados]] passed a law on [[conscientious objection]], which recognised the rights of objectors, establishing a civilian service of 18 months, called "Prestación Social Sustitutoria" (''Substitutionary Social Service'', PSS), as an alternative to 12 months [[compulsory military service]]. The previous objectors were then amnestied and freed from military obligations. A few of them, however, considered that the longer duration of the PSS penalised objectors, amounted to forced labour, and deprived ordinary workers of jobs; they demanded complete abolition of [[military service]]. Those objectors therefore rejected the amnesty and returned to Spain apparently ready to be called up.

When the army tried to enlist them again, the so-called "Insumisos" (''insubordinates'') refused to join either the army or the PSS. By doing so they committed a crime and were tried again, but the existence of a largely unfavourable public opinion to [[compulsory military service]] made the judicial proceedings, especially when the penalty included imprisonment, a considerable political cost for the government.

Refusal to perform [[military service]] was punishable under the military penal code, and was part of the jurisdiction of the army, with a minimum penalty of a year in [[jail]]. Refusal to perform PSS was punished by the ordinary penal code, with two years, four months and one day in [[prison]].

In subsequent years the number of young people refusing to join the army or, once recognised as conscientious objectors, refused to perform PSS, exponentially increased. If repression of the "insumisos" was difficult, given the broad social support that they had, it was even more difficult when undertaken by the military courts, because the military courts were denounced by antimilitarists as "judge and jury" in the army's own cause, and because the accused were not part of the [[Spanish army|army]], but remained civilians. Also, the adjudication of civilians by military courts and sending them to prison evoked for many the [[Francoism|Franco era]].&lt;ref&gt;Mario López (2004) ''Enciclopedia de paz y conflictos.'' [[Granada]], Universidad de Granada.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[Spanish army|army]] asked the government to release it from the task of repressing the insubordination movement, which was finally agreed by the government. From then the "insumisos" were tried by ordinary courts. Despite this, in the first years the ordinary courts continued applying [[military law]]. Later the ordinary courts judged the "insumisos" by applying a reformed version of the ordinary [[penal code]] that included the crime of refusing to perform [[military service]], with an increased penalty to equate it to that applied for refusing to do PSS.&lt;ref&gt;Mario López (2006); Política sin violencia. La noviolencia como humanización de la política. Bogotá. Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios. {{ISBN|978-958-8165-28-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Insubordination was a [[grassroots]], [[nonpartisan]] and [[Decentralisation|decentralised movement]]. Despite the [[nonpartisan]] character it was supported by several [[left-wing]] parties, like the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Herri Batasuna]], [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]], [[Auzolan]], [[Popular Unity Candidates]], [[Socialist Party of Mallorca]], [[Galician Socialist Party-Galician Left]], [[Valencian Nationalist Bloc]], [[Unitarian Candidacy of Workers]], [[Communist Movement]], [[Revolutionary Communist League (Spain)|LCR]] and many others. In all the major cities there were assemblies of "insumisos", co-ordinated with each other in different antimilitarist fora. The most important groups were the [[Conscientious Objection Movement]] (MOC), close to the ideas of [[nonviolence]], and a constellation of groups generically called [[Mili KK]], more linked to the [[Far-left|extra-parliamentary left]], although the dividing lines were never totally clear. [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchist]] groups also played an important role in the [[Antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] struggle, promoting most of them total disobedience tactics (such as the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|CGT]] and [[Libertarian Youth|FIJL]] organisations). In the late 1980s and the 1990s many [[Antimilitarism|antimilitaristic]], [[magazines]] and groups appeared. On the eve of the disappearance of [[compulsory military service]] the number of "insumisos" exceeded the tens of thousands, probably more than the number of "no-insumisos".

Insubordination was mostly a purely [[Antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] movement. There were also, however, people who joined the insubordination for other reasons, especially, in more recent times, people favouring a [[professional army]]. One of the most important components of the insubordination movement were the [[Basque nationalism|Basque]], [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]], [[Galician nationalism|Galician]] or [[Canarian nationalism|Canarian]] [[Left-wing nationalism|nationalists]], not necessarily anti-militarist, although the majority were also strong [[antimilitarism|antimilitarists]] and [[Antiimperialism|antiimperialists]]; that especially applied to the [[Galician nationalism|Galicians]] and [[Canarian nationalism|Canarians]], who denounced the presence of any military force in their respective territories, and routinely protested against them. The [[Basque people|Basque]] [[Ezker abertzalea|Abertzale left]] also considered the [[Spanish army]] an occupation force in the [[Southern Basque Country]], and campaigned for full withdrawal of any [[Spanish army]] from [[Euskadi]];&lt;ref&gt;Eoin O'Broin; ''Matxinada: historia del movimiento juvenil radical vasco''. [[Tafalla]], Editorial Txalaparta, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8136-385-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who refused to serve in a "Spanish" army. Another reason for insubordination was the popular perception of the [[Spanish army]] as a [[Fascism|fascist]] and/or [[Francoism|francoist]] institution, a perception renewed by the various coup attempts in the 1980s, like the [[23F]] in 1981 or the 2J conspiracy in 1985. Some people also opposed [[military service]] on religious grounds, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] or some [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Christianism|Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Arturo García Lucio; ''Insumisión, respuesta coherente al militarismo.'' Iglesia viva: revista de pensamiento cristiano, ISSN 0210-1114, Nº. 173 (SEP-OCT), 1994, pages 499-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactics and strategy==
Regarding the strategy to follow in [[civil disobedience]], there were also different viewpoints:
* Some "insumisos" chose not to avoid prison, considering that the existence of [[prisoners of conscience]] favoured the objectives of the movement due to the high political cost to the government of having [[Conscientious objector|objectors]] in [[prison]].
* Another group, on the other hand, sought to avoid prison through an elaborate legal defence, as they felt that freedom (interim or final) was a small victory and that imprisonment could discourage young people of military age to join the movement.
* A third group (sometimes known as the "invisibles") also declared insubordination to the courts, and did not go to their own trials, and did not accept orders to report to prison. They survived by hiding, at least until they were located and arrested. Many, however, managed to remain free until the total disappearance of conscription. This strategy was advocated and practised by the [[Colectivo Antimilitarista Pro-Insumisión]] (''Pro-insubordinatio Antimilitarist Collective'', CAMPI), that rejected the right of any court to judge the legitimacy of their ideas, and on the other hand considered the PSS an arbitrary punishment that provided the state with a free and forced workforce, removing employment opportunities to qualified persons for those functions. This group was active in many cities. The majority of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]] also followed this tactic.

Those who could not be "insumisos" (for example, men who had already completed military service or women) put up initiatives of "[[self-incrimination]]": based on the legal principle that whoever incites someone to commit an offence is also guilty, they signed statements accusing themselves of promoting insubordination. [[Self-incrimination]]s were generally not accepted by the courts. Many people used [[self-incrimination]]s to establish an active link with the insubordinate movement, among them prominent intellectuals, politicians, filmmakers, singers, actors and other personalities and celebrities.

The Spanish insubordinate movement was a [[civil disobedience]] movement unparalleled in any other European country, its closest precedent in the [[Western world]] being the disobedience and insubordination to the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War in the United States]].&lt;ref name="eldiario.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.es/norte/euskadi/insumision-antimilitaristas-MOC-servicio_militar-noviolencia-desobediencia_0_204030288.html|title=Insumisión, 25 años de desobediencia|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to do something similar in other countries, such as [[Germany]] and [[France]], failed due to the lack of a social base and popular support. The success of insubordination in Spain has been attributed to an [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] sentiment supposedly rooted in the Spanish society and linked both to the resistance against conscription during the [[Carlist Wars]] and during the [[Rif War]] between 1909 and 1927, and even some have tried to establish a relationship of this movement to the wide diffusion of [[anarchism in Spain]] (a minor phenomenon elsewhere), specially in the first decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Díez; ''La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923-1938)''. Germinal: revista de estudios libertarios, ISSN 1886-3019, Nº. 1, 2006, págs. 23-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insubordination was one of the main causes of the reduction of military service from 12 to 9 months and, later, of its total abolition. The other main cause was the 1996 pact between the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] and the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] and [[Convergence and Union]] in 1996, that included the disappearance of military service in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2012/01/28/catalunya/1327788981_990417.html|title=El fantasma del Majestic sobrevuela CiU|first=Maiol|last=Roger|date=28 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insubordination in popular music==
One of the main ways of propaganda of the Insubordinate movement was music, mainly within the [[Punk subculture|punk]] scene, but also in [[pop-rock|pop and pop rock]], [[Heavy metal music|Metal]], [[Ska-punk|Ska]] and other scenes. [[Antimilitarism|Antimilitarist]] music was very popular among the youth during the campaign against [[Military Service]]. Some groups like [[Negu Gorriak]] even donated their profits to the movement. Among the most notable songs and hymns are:
* Cruzar los brazos (1986) [[Víctor Manuel]]

The '''Laffey Matrix''' is a fee schedule used by many [[United States court]]s for determining the reasonable hourly rates in the [[District of Columbia]] for [[lawyer|attorneys']] fee awards under federal fee-shifting statutes.&lt;ref&gt;See list of fee-shifting statutes at the Appendix to Opinion of Brennan, J., Dissenting in ''Marek v. Chesny'', 473 U.S. 1 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;{{wiktionary|matrix}}

==Overview==
The ''Laffey'' Matrix originated in ''Laffey v. Northwest Airlines'', 572 F. Supp. 354 (D.D.C. 1983), reversed, 746 F.2d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1984), overruled, ''Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel'', 857 F.2d 1516, 1525 (D.C. Cir. 1988) ([[en banc]]).  Counsel in the ''Laffey'' case compiled evidence from firms showing the market rates in the District of Columbia for complex federal litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Rezneck Affidavit and Evidence from ''Laffey'' case [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/Original-Laffey-Matrix.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  That evidence was analyzed and a matrix of rates for attorneys at various experience levels was created, later becoming known as the ''Laffey'' Matrix.  

Based on ''Blum v. Stenson'', 465 U.S. 886 (1984), the district court in ''Laffey'' adopted the matrix and expressly rejected the use of the size or type of the law firm in setting hourly rates.  ''Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., supra'', 572 F. Supp. at 374.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected use of the matrix in favor of the firm’s actual billing rate, thus restricting fee awards to small firms, such as the counsel in ''Laffey'', to their own reduced billing rates.  ''Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, supra'', 746 F.2d at 24-25.  Four years later, in ''Save Our Cumberland Mountains'', the D.C. Circuit sitting ''en banc'' overruled the ''Laffey'' decision (857 F.2d at 1524) stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress did not intend the private but public-spirited rate-cutting attorney to be penalized for his public spiritedness by being paid on a lower scale than either his higher priced fellow barrister from a more established firm or his salaried neighbor at a legal services clinic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, we conclude that our prior decision in ''Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.'', and the panel decision in this case, which it compelled, are both inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Blum v. Stenson'' which construed those statutes.  We therefore expressly overrule ''Laffey'' to the extent that it imposes the above discussed different method of determining reasonable attorney fees on attorneys situated as Yablonski and Galloway are here.  Henceforth, the prevailing market rate method heretofore used in awarding fees to traditional for-profit firms and public interest legal services organizations shall apply as well to those attorneys who practice privately and for profit but at reduced rates reflecting non-economic goals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original ''Laffey'' Matrix provided market rates for the period from June 1, 1981, through May 31, 1982, based on different levels of experience .  At the urging of the D.C. Circuit in its ''en banc'' decision in ''Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel, supra'', 857 F.2d at 1525, the matrix was updated through May 31, 1989, in connection with a settlement reached on remand in that case.  ''See, e.g.,'' ''Trout v. Ball'', 705 F. Supp. 705, 709, n. 10 (D.D.C. 1989)(the updated matrix developed in ''Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel'' “does provide an updated and accurate schedule of attorney fees in this District”).&lt;ref&gt;Yablonski Affidavit provides information regarding the update [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/1989-Laffey-Matrix.PDF] &lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant for a fee award must establish the prevailing market rates.  To establish the prevailing market rates in the District of Columbia, the applicant “may point to such evidence as an updated version of the ''Laffey'' Matrix or the U.S. Attorney’s Office matrix, or their own survey of prevailing market rates in the community.”  ''Covington v. District of Columbia'', 57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

Fee applicants often point to the ''Laffey'' Matrix.  Over the years, two methods of updating the ''Laffey'' Matrix have developed:  the U.S. Attorney’s Office ''Laffey'' Matrix and the Legal Service Index-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix.  These methods produce different hourly rates.  These competing methods are addressed below.

==U.S. Attorney's Office ''Laffey'' Matrix==
For many years, the [[United States Attorney's Office]] used the ''Laffey'' Matrix ("USAO Laffey Matrix") as a basis for hourly rates for attorneys' fees in litigation claims. This matrix used the original ''Laffey'' Matrix from 1982 and updated it annually using changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for the Washington-Baltimore area. The result was a routinely updated United States Attorney’s Office Matrix; a table which provided hourly rates, based on years of experience, for attorneys, paralegals and law clerks in the Washington, D.C. area.&lt;ref&gt;Charts showing updates for various time frames [http://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/civil-division]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the USAO revised its method.  Its matrix is no longer based on the ''Laffey'' Matrix. Its matrix is now based on ALM survey data from 2010-2011 updated using the Producer Price Index-Office of Lawyers (PPI-OL) index (the "USAO-ALM Matrix").&lt;ref&gt;USAO Matrix [http://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/file/796471/download]&lt;/ref&gt; The USAO-ALM Matrix is based on rates for all types of legal services, not exclusively complex federal litigation like the ''Laffey'' Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' USAO-ALM Matrix base data with United States’ confirmation of base data, and declaration explaining that the base ALM data is “actual average billing rates of attorneys in the Washington, DC area, from law offices of all sizes and types.” [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/USAO-ALM-Matrix-Base-Data-with-Related-Information.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also based on rates for the Washington metro area (which includes areas in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, DC), not just the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' USAO-ALM Matrix base data with United States’ confirmation of base data, and declaration explaining that the base ALM data is “actual average billing rates of attorneys in the Washington, DC area, from law offices of all sizes and types.” [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/USAO-ALM-Matrix-Base-Data-with-Related-Information.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The USAO-ALM Matrix is also divided into more experience levels than the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix.

Many defendants have taken the position that the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix should be used instead of the Legal Service Index (LSI) update method presumably because the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix produces lower hourly rates than the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix.  The USAO-ALM Matrix also produces hourly rates that are lower than the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix.  Some courts in the United States have used the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix when awarding attorneys' fees under a fee-shifting statute, such as the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., Heller v. District of Columbia'', 832 F.Supp.2d 32 (D.D.C. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==LSI-Updated Laffey Matrix==
Based on ''Covington'', some fee applicants have established the prevailing market rates using the ''Laffey'' Matrix updated by the Legal Services Component of the Consumer Price Index referred to as the Legal Services Index or the LSI.&lt;ref&gt;LSI-Updated "Laffey" Matrix through May 2018 [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/LSI-Laffey-Matrix.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The LSI is provided monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix is based on the 1989 update of the ''Laffey'' Matrix.  The LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix produces higher hourly rates than the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix or the USAO-ALM Matrix.  Some courts in the United States have awarded fees using the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix.  In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit affirmed such a fee award.  ''Salazar v. District of Columbia,'' 809 F.3d 58 (D.C. Cir. 2015).&lt;ref&gt;''Salazar'' Decision [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/Salazar-v-District-of-Columbia_-809-F3d-58.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The D.C. Circuit agreed with the district court that the evidence presented by plaintiffs demonstrates that the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix 'is probably a ''conservative'' estimate of the actual cost of legal services in this area’” (emphasis in original).  It concluded that “[t]he District, neither below nor on appeal, rebuts this logic with relevant arguments.”  The Court noted that the fact that other courts have applied the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix “is not compelling.”

Other courts have rejected the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix, particularly for cases in the Washington-Baltimore region, and have based fee awards the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix. ''See, e.g., Pleasants v. Ridge,'' 424 F. Supp. 2d 67, n.2 (D.D.C. 2006); ''Judicial Watch, Inc. v. BLM,'' No. 07-1570, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49069.

==Some Decisions from Non-D.C. Courts==
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed a fee award based on the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix for a Washington, D.C., law firm litigating a case in New Jersey. ''Interfaith Community Organization v. Honeywell International, Inc.,'' 426 F.3d 694 (3rd Cir. 2005)("In updating the matrix to account for inflation from 1989-2003, ICO relied on the legal services component of the nationwide Consumer Price Index ('the Legal Services Index'), a measure of inflation in the cost of legal services maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."). The Court of Appeals noted that the District Court "reviewed both indices [the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix and the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix] and decided that [the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix] represented a better measure of prevailing rates in Washington, DC. In so doing, it relied on a decision by the District Court for the District of Columbia, ''Salazar v. District of Columbia'', 123 F.Supp.2d 8 (D.D.C.2000), which compared the U.S. Attorney's Laffey Matrix with a matrix similar to that put forward by ICO in this case and concluded that the latter method was superior. ''Salazar'' is one of the few decisions approving the use of this approach, and it is, according to ICO, the only decision (prior to the District Court decision in this case) comparing the two approaches."  ''ICO v. Honeywell International, Inc., supra,'' 426 F. 3d at 709.  The Third Circuit issued a similar affirmance of a fee award based on the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix in ''ICO v. Honeywell International, Inc.,'' 726 F. 3d 744 (3d Cir. 2013).

The Fourth Circuit expressly disapproved reliance on the ''Laffey'' Matrix in ''Robinson v. Equifax Information Services, LLC,'' 560 F.3d 235 (4th Cir. 2009), requiring instead that fee awards be based on prevailing market rates established by evidence.

Some California Federal courts have accepted the same methodology, adjusting the ''Laffey'' Matrix upwards based upon the higher costs of living in Los Angeles and other California cities.  ''In Re HPL Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation'', 366 F.Supp.2d 912, 921 (N. Dist. Cal. 2005).  ''See also'' “It is the practice of the undersigned judge, however, to rely on official data to determine appropriate hourly rates, not on an attorney's self-proclaimed rates or declarations regarding hourly rates charged by law firms. One reliable official source for rates that vary by experience levels is the Laffey matrix used in the District of Columbia.” ''Garnes v. Barnhardt'', 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5938 (N. Dist. Cal. 2006).

==The Legal Services Index==
The Legal Services component of the National CPI, referred to as the Legal Services Index or LSI, measures price changes in simple [[legal service]]s used by household consumers, such as basic [[Will and testament|wills]], uncontested [[divorce]]s, power of attorneys and DWI defenses. Prices for business-related legal services and complex litigation cases are covered in the Producer Price Index. Contingency fees such as those that are commonly used in litigation settings are not taken into account since they are not relevant to these basic consumer legal services. To determine prices, the BLS contacts practicing attorneys and records prices for a defined “procedure” (such as an uncontested divorce) rather than an hourly unit of an attorney’s or paralegal’s time. Discounted fees are not incorporated into the data unless the contacted attorney routinely gives one for a specific service.  The LSI is not specific to Washington, DC; it is a national index.

==Opposing economists' opinions==
Laura Malowane of Economists Incorporated is an economist with a Ph.D. from Princeton University.  She believes that the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix is inferior to the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix for the following reasons:  1) The LSI measures prices changes in basic, personal, consumer-oriented legal services such as uncontested divorce and DUI and not complex federal litigation; 2) The LSI is a nationwide average index and not specific to the D.C. metropolitan region; 3) The LSI is primarily for flat-fee services rather than hourly rates; 4) The LSI does not take into account discounted rates, contingency fees, and other reasons actual collected rates may differ from hourly billing rates; and 5) Actual hourly billing rates of attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area are, according to published survey data, more accurately represented by rates outlined in the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix than in the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix.

Dr. Michael Kavanaugh is an economist in private practice in Volcano, Hawaii.  He is the economist credited by the D.C. Circuit in the ''Salazar'' case.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar Decision [http://www.tpmlaw.com/s/Salazar-v-District-of-Columbia_-809-F3d-58.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his opinion, the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix is a better reflection of the District of Columbia market for complex federal litigation for the following reasons:   1) it is based on more recent observations (1989 data compared to 1982 data), which is more likely to produce a better forecast of actual rates; 2) the LSI is specific to legal services whereas the CPI is based on a basket of general goods that is dominated by the cost of housing, food, etc.; 3) the LSI includes some services associated with litigation, such as, preparing briefs and attending depositions; 4)  the Washington, D.C. market for complex federal litigation is a national market where firms from across the country compete to provide such services; 5) market data shows that the LSI-Updated ''Laffey'' Matrix produces rates that are below market and the USAO ''Laffey'' Matrix rates are even lower.

==Another option==
Another method is to adjust for local costs of wages to lawyers and paralegals.  The Laffey Matrix can be adjusted for local costs using the Bureau of Labor Statistics data on wages paid to lawyers (occupation code 23-1011) and paralegals (occupation code 23-2011) for primary metropolitan statistical areas  in each state (http://www.bls.gov).  This method appears to be a re-formulation of the argument rejected in ''Blum v. Stenson, supra,'' 465 U.S. at 892, 895-896, that compensation to some attorneys should be based on costs including salary levels.

Here is what the hourly rate Matrix looks like for June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007 for D.C., 5 cities in California, Hartford, CT and New York City (NYC) after adjustments are made for local labor costs.

This will need to be adjusted when the May CPI figures are available and the Laffey Matrix is updated by the LaffeyMatrix.com administrators, based upon DOL BLS new wage data available, usually in early July of each year.

==Series&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams, Learning the Law, Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;==
The number and names of the series have changed. This is partly due to the merger of existing courts, the merger of existing divisions of individual courts, and the creation of new divisions of individual courts. [[Case citation|Citation]] of series has also changed.

===1865 to 1875===
The Law Reports were originally divided into eleven series. [[Glanville Williams]] said that "roughly speaking" there was a series for each of the [[superior court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams, Learning the Law, Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; The series were:

*House of Lords, English and Irish Appeals
*House of Lords, Scotch and Divorce Appeals
*Privy Council Appeals
*Chancery Appeal Cases
*Equity Cases
*Crown Cases Reserved
*Queens Bench Cases
*Common Pleas Cases
*Exchequer Cases

===1875 to 1880===
In 1875, the number of series was reduced to six. This was due to the creation of the High Court and a decision on the part of the publishers, to put the House of Lords, the Privy Council and the new Court of Appeal in the same volume, and to group Crown Cases Reserved and the Queen's Bench Division together. The series were:

*Appeal Cases
*Chancery Division
*Queens Bench Division
*Common Pleas Division
*Exchequer Division
*Probate Division

There was a change in the mode of citation. The abbreviation "LR" ceased to be used.

===1881 to 1890===
In 1881, the number of series was reduced to four. This is because the Common Pleas and Exchequer Divisions of the High Court were incorporated in the Queen's Bench Division of that court in 1880:

*Appeal Cases
*Chancery Division
*Queens Bench Division
*Probate Division

===1891 onwards===
There have continued to be four series during this period, but their names have changed from time to time.

*Appeal Cases
*Chancery Division
*Queens Bench Division (1891 - 1901, 1952 onwards)/Kings Bench Division (1901 - 1952) (From 1907, this series included decisions of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in place of the former [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved]].)
*Probate (Replaced in 1972 by a series called Family, due to the creation of the Family Division of the High Court)

In 1891, there was a change in the mode of citation. Volumes published from 1891 onwards are cited by the year in which they were published and numbered according to the order of publication in that year, if more than one volume has been published in that year.

The '''legal history of cannabis in the United States''' pertains to the regulation of [[cannabis]] (legal term [[Marijuana (word)|marijuana]] or marihuana) for medical, recreational, and industrial purposes in the [[United States]]. Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s. By the mid-1930s cannabis was regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]].&lt;ref name="druglibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/vlr/vlr3.htm |title=Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H. Whitebread, II: PASSAGE OF THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first national regulation was the [[Marihuana &lt;!-- This is spelled correctly--&gt;Tax Act of 1937]].&lt;ref name="Why Is Marijuana Illegal?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weednews.co/why-is-marijuana-illegal/ |title=Why Is Marijuana Illegal? |publisher=weednews.co |date= |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis was officially outlawed for any use (medical included) with the passage of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) of 1970.  Multiple efforts to [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|reschedule cannabis]] under the CSA have failed, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes.  Despite this, states and other jurisdictions have continued to implement policies that conflict with federal law, beginning with the passage of California's [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996.  By 2016 a majority of states had legalized [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical cannabis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=Marijuana wins big on election night|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/medical-marijuana-sails-to-victory-in-florida/|accessdate=February 15, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 the first states legalized [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|recreational use]].

In 1619, [[King James I]] decreed that the American colonists of Jamestown would need to step up efforts to do their fair share towards supporting England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 [[hemp]] plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deitch|first=Robert|title=Hemp – American History Revisited|year=2003|publisher=Algora Publishing|location=New York City|isbn=0-87586-206-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a brief chronology of Marijuana in America"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frontline|first=PBS|title=Busted – america's war on marijuana|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html|website=pbs.org|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis cultivation played a central role in the establishment of the United States, with cannabis appearing on the ten dollar bill as late as 1900. [[George Washington]] grew hemp at [[Mount Vernon]] as one of his three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American [[pharmacies]] in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy|William O'Shaughnessy]] a decade earlier in 1839.&lt;ref name="Dale H. Gieringer"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Forgotten Origins of Cannabis Prohibition in California|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=26|issue=2|year=1999|first=Dale H.|last=Gieringer|url=http://www.canorml.org/background/caloriginsmjproh.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early pharmaceutical and recreational use===
[[File:Drug bottle containing cannabis.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Tincture of cannabis|Cannabis fluid extract]] medicine bottle]]

Around the same time, efforts to regulate the sale of [[pharmaceuticals]] began, and laws were introduced on a state-to-state basis that created penalties for mislabeling drugs, [[adulterant|adulterating]] them with undisclosed [[narcotics]], and improper sale of those considered "[[poison]]s". Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription. Those that required labeling often required the word "poison" if the drug was not issued by a pharmacy. Other regulations were prohibitions on the sale to minors, as well as restrictions on refills. Some pharmaceutical laws specifically enumerated the drugs that came under the effect of the regulations, while others did not—leaving the matter to medical experts. Those that did generally included references to cannabis, either under the category of "cannabis and its preparations" or "hemp and its preparations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Chemist &amp; druggist|volume=28|title=Chemists and poisons|publisher=Benn Brothers|year=1886|location=London, New York City, Melbourne| pages=68,330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiPOAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1905 Bulletin from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] lists twenty-nine states with laws mentioning cannabis. Eight states are listed with "sale of poisons" laws that specifically mention cannabis: North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Vermont, Maine, Montana; and the District of Columbia. Among those states that required a prescription for sale were Wisconsin and Louisiana. Several "sale of poison" laws did not specify restricted drugs, including in Indiana, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Nebraska, Kentucky, Mississippi, and New York. Many states did not consider cannabis a "poison" but required it be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States. Bureau of Chemistry|title=Bulletin, Issues 96–99|publisher=G.P.O.|year=1905|location=Washington, DC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KdUAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York (state)|New York]], the original law did enumerate cannabis, and was passed in 1860 following a string of suicides allegedly involving the substances later categorized as poisons. The first draft of the bill 'An act to regulate the sale of poisons' prohibited the sale of cannabis—as with the other substances—without the written order of a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate.|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 15, 1860|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/16/news/senate-88150825.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final bill as passed allowed the sale without a prescription so long as the purpose to which it was issued and name and address of the buyer was recorded, and in addition, all packaging of such substances—whether sold with a prescription or not—had to have the label "poison" on them in uppercase red letters. In 1862, the section which enumerated the substances was repealed with an amendatory act, though cannabis was still required to be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Papers read before the Medico-Legal Society of New York, from its organization|publisher=McDivitt, Campbell &amp; Co.|year=1869|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kdoDAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states where poison laws excluded cannabis, there were nonetheless attempts to include it. A bill introduced in 1880 in the [[California]] state legislature was titled 'An act to regulate the sale of opium and other narcotic poisons' and would have forbidden anyone to keep, sell, furnish, or give away any "preparations or mixtures made or prepared from opium, hemp, or other narcotic drugs" without a doctor's prescription at a licensed store. That bill was withdrawn in favor of one specifically aimed at opium, though further bills including hemp-based drugs were introduced in 1885 and in 1889.&lt;ref name="Dale H. Gieringer"/&gt;

==== Background to later restrictions (late 19th century) ====
[[File:Mr-binns-tries-hasheesh.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from the ''New York Times'', March 7, 1884]]

As early as 1853, recreational cannabis was listed as a "fashionable narcotic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our Fashionable Narcotics.|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 10, 1854|location=New York City|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20710FF3B5E167493C2A8178AD85F408584F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, oriental-style hashish parlors were flourishing alongside opium dens, to the point that one could be found in every major city on the east coast. It was estimated there were around 500 such establishments in New York City alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spliffs: A Celebration of Cannabis Culture|last=Jones|first=Nick|year=2004|publisher=Black Dock Publishing|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UG-9L4RD71QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in Harper’s Magazine (1883), attributed to Harry Hubbell Kane, describes a hashish-house in New York frequented by a large clientele, including males and females of "the better classes," and further talks about parlors in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago.&lt;ref name="Dale H. Gieringer"/&gt; Hemp cigarettes were reported to be used by Mexican soldiers as early as 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE USE OF TOBACCO.; INCREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION OF NARCOTIC STIMULANTS.

== Criminalization (1900s) ==

=== Strengthening of poison laws (1906–1938) ===
The [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was then passed by the United States Congress in 1906 and required that certain special drugs, including [[cannabis]], be accurately labeled with contents. Previously, many drugs had been sold as [[patent medicines]] with secret ingredients or misleading labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musto|first=David F.|year=1999|edition=3rd|title=The American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-512509-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VrQy2d8PxYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the passage of regulations, there continued to be criticism about the availability of narcotics and around 1910 there was a wave of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove what were commonly referred to as "loopholes" in poison laws. The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons, limit their sale to pharmacies, and require doctor's prescriptions. The first instance was in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, under "An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes". The act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today, creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing. Under this act, the framework for prescription and non-prescription drugs and foods are set, along with standards as well as the enforcing agency, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). "Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published (Notices of Judgment), proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators." Marijuana remains under this law defined as a "dangerous drug".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C. Woodward |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further regulation of cannabis followed in Massachusetts (1911), New York (1914), and Maine (1914). In New York, reform legislation began under the Towns-Boylan Act, which targeted all "habit-forming drugs", restricted their sale, prohibited refills in order to prevent habituation, prohibited sale to people with a habit, and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TO MAKE IT TO GET HABIT DRUGS; Towns-Boylan Bill at Albany Would Stop the Loopholes in Present Prescription Law.|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 26, 1914|location=New York City|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B14FF3A5B13738DDDAF0A94D9405B848DF1D3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, several amendments were passed by the New York Board of Health, including adding cannabis to the list of habit-forming drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MUZZLES THE DOGS ALL THE YEAR 'ROUND; Health Board Seeks to Stop the Increase of Rabies by Sanitary Law.

A ''[[New York Times]]'' article noted on the cannabis amendment:

{{quote|The inclusion of ''Cannabis indica'' among the drugs to be sold only on prescription is common sense. Devotees of hashish are now hardly numerous here enough to count, but they are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Topics of the Times|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 30, 1914|location=New York City|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E1DB1438EF32A25753C3A9619C946596D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the West, the first state to include cannabis as a poison was California. The Poison Act was passed in 1907 and amended in 1909 and 1911, and in 1913 an amendatory act was made to make possession of "extracts, tinctures, or other narcotic preparations of hemp, or loco-weed, their preparations and compounds" a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="Dale H. Gieringer"/&gt; There is no evidence that the law was ever used or intended to restrict pharmaceutical cannabis; instead it was a legislative mistake, and in 1915 another revision placed cannabis under the same restriction as other poisons.&lt;ref name="Dale H. Gieringer"/&gt; In 1914, one of the first cannabis drug raids in the nation occurred in the Mexican-American neighborhood of [[Sonoratown]] in Los Angeles, where police raided two "dream gardens" and confiscated a wagonload of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dudley|first1=Elyssa|title=The nation's first marijuana raid likely happened in Los Angeles|url=https://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2014/09/19/39399/the-nation-s-first-marijuana-raid-likely-happened/|work=Off-Ramp|publisher=KPCC|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states followed with marijuana laws including: Wyoming (1915); Texas (1919); Iowa (1923); Nevada (1923); Oregon (1923); Washington (1923); Arkansas (1923); Nebraska (1927);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canorml.org/background/ca1913.html |title=The Origins of California's 1913 Cannabis Law |publisher=Canorml.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana (1927); and Colorado (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Robert F. |date=1938 |title=Marijuana, America’s New Drug Problem |location=Philadelphia |publisher=B.

One source of tensions in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/02/the_real_reason_marijuana_is_illegal_in_the_united_states_partner/|title=The real reason marijuana is illegal in the United States|author=Thor Benson|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drug Use and Abuse|year=2003|publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Publishing]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|isbn=978-0-15-508517-6|pages=426–428|author1=Maisto, Stephen |author2=Galizio, Mark |author3=Connors, Gerard |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] (which went into effect nationally in 1920).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cu55.html|title=The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |last1=Brecher |first1=Edward M.  |date=1972 |website=DRCNet Online Library of Drug Policy|access-date=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, the passage of the initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet the use of hashish by Near Eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEXICO BANS MARIHUANA.; To Stamp Out Drug Plant Which Crazes Its Addicts.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1925|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/12/29/archives/mexico-bans-marihuana-to-stamp-out-drug-plant-which-crazes-its.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Opium Convention (1925) ===
In 1925, the United States supported regulation of Indian hemp, also known as [[hashish]], in the [[International Opium Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm |title=W.W. WILLOUGHBY: OPIUM AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM, BALTIMORE, THE JOHNS HOPKINS PRESS, 1925 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention banned exportation of "Indian hemp", and the preparations derived therefrom, to countries that had prohibited its use and required importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required "exclusively for medical or scientific purposes". The convention did not ban trade in fibers and other similar products from European hemp, traditionally grown in the United States. According to the 1912 edition of the Swedish encyclopedia ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', the European hemp grown for its fibers lacks the THC content that characterizes Indian hemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/hasjisj.htm |title=Nordisk familjebok 1912 |publisher=Runeberg.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act (1925–1932) ===
The [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]], first tentative draft in 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, was a result of work by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]]. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the [[Harrison Act]] in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/people/anslinger/traffic/appendix1.htm |title=Anslinger H.

By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/drug_law_timeline.htm|title=Drug Law Timeline, Significant Events in the History of our Drug Laws|author=Keel, Robert|publisher= Schaffer Library of Drug Policy|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/t10a.htm |title=The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, Transcripts of Congressional Hearings |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/people/anslinger/traffic/chapter6.htm |title=ANSLINGER H.

=== Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930) ===
[[File:Killerdrug.jpg|right|thumb|[[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] public service announcement used in the late 1930s and 1940s]]

The use of cannabis and other drugs came under increasing scrutiny after the formation of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by [[Harry J. Anslinger]] as part of the government's broader push to outlaw all recreational drugs.

{{quote|When the present administration took office ten countries had ratified the Geneva Narcotic Limitation Convention. The United States was one of these ten. ... It was my privilege, as President, to proclaim, on that day, that this treaty had become effective throughout the jurisdiction of the United States. ... On Jan. 1, 1933, only nine nations had registered their ratification of the limitation treaty. On Jan. 1, 1935, only nine States had adopted the uniform State statute. As 1933 witnessed ratification of the treaty by thirty-one additional nations, so may 1935 witness the adoption of the uniform drug act by at least thirty-one more states, thereby placing interstate accord abreast of international accord, to the honor of the legislative bodies of our States and for the promotion of the welfare of our people and the peoples of other lands.|[[Franklin D.

Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. The FBN produced propaganda films promoting Anslinger's views and Anslinger often commented to the press regarding his views on marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McWilliams|first=John C.|title=The Protectors: Harry J.

=== The 1936 Geneva Trafficking Conventions ===
In 1936 the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs]] (1936 Trafficking Convention) was concluded in Geneva. The U.S., led by Anslinger, had attempted to include the criminalization of all activities in the treaty – cultivation, production, manufacture and distribution – related to the use of opium, coca (and its derivatives), and cannabis, for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. Many countries opposed this and the focus remained on illicit trafficking. Article 2 of the Convention called upon signatory countries to use their national criminal law systems to "severely" punish, "particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty", acts directly related to drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/canadasenate/vol3/chapter19_1936_geneva.htm |title=The 1936 Geneva Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. refused to sign the final version because it considered the convention too weak, especially in relation to extradition, extraterritoriality and the confiscation of trafficking profits.&lt;ref&gt;International Law Commission, 62nd session (June 18, 2010).

=== Marihuana&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS SPELLING--&gt; Tax Act (1937) ===
{{Main article|Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|Hemp}}
&lt;!-- All Inflation calculations are between 1937 and 2008 using http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ --&gt;
The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 effectively made possession or transfer of marihuana illegal throughout the [[United States]] under [[Law of the United States|federal law]], excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an [[Excise|excise tax]] on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 adjusted for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 adjusted for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 adjusted for inflation) for industrial users. Detailed sales logs were required to record marihuana sales. Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 adjusted for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/mjtaxact.htm|title=Full Text of the Marihuana Tax Act as passed in 1937|publisher=Schaffer Library of Drug Policy|accessdate=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Producer of marihuana.jpg|thumb|300px|Tax stamp for a producer of hemp]]
The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) opposed the act because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis [[Cannabis cultivation|cultivation]] and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis be added to the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm|title=Statement of Dr. William C. Woodward, Legislative Counsel, American Medical Association|publisher=Druglibrary.org|accessdate=March 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.

After the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for cultivation were issued to farmers.

The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between [[nylon]] and hemp. They argue that the reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with [[silk]] and [[rayon]] in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caimateriali.org/index.php?id=32|title=the history of nylon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Nylon: A Revolution in Textiles|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nylon-a-revolution-in-textiles|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|volume=26|issue=3|last1=Wolfe|first1=Audra J.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers/first-nylon-plant-historical-resource.pdf|title=American Chemical Society: THE FIRST NYLON PLANT. 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Hemp, bast with fibers. The stem in the middle.]]

In 1916, [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and [[Lyster Hoxie Dewey|Lyster H. Dewey]] created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votehemp.com/17855-h/17855-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material, by Lyster H. Dewey and Jason L. Merrill.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they stated that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called [[hemp hurds]], was "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood". Merrill and Dewey's findings were not repeated in a later book by Dewey&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt; and have not been confirmed by paper production experts. The consistency of long fibers is too low in hemp hurds for commercial papermaking. Numerous machines had been devised for breaking and scutching hemp fibers, but none had been found to be fully satisfactory in actual commercial work.&lt;ref name ="vaste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fiberproductioni518dewe#page/68/mode/2up|title=Fiber production in the western hemisphere|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |title=Hemp facts and hemp fiction |publisher=hempfood.com |author=Hayo M.G. van der Werf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713184209/http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |archivedate=July 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce fiber from hemp was a labor-intensive process if harvest, transport and processing are included.

There was also a misconception about the intoxicating effects of hemp because it has the same active substance, [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], which is in all cannabis strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930s, THC was not yet fully identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matters.ecnp.nl/number11/interview2.shtml "Interview with the winner of the first ECNP Lifetime Achievement Award: Raphael Mechoulam, Israel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430032241/http://matters.ecnp.nl/number11/interview2.shtml |date=April 30, 2011 }} (February 2007).

=== Mandatory sentencing (1952, 1956) ===
[[Mandatory sentencing]] and increased punishment were enacted when the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Boggs Act of 1952]] and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956. The acts made a first-time cannabis possession offense a minimum of two to ten years with a fine up to $20,000; however, in 1970 the US Congress repealed mandatory penalties for cannabis offenses.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

=== Controlled Substances Act (1970) ===
In its 1969 ''[[Leary v. United States]]'' decision the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held the Marijuana Tax Act to be unconstitutional, since it violated the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege against self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/e1960/learyvus.htm |title=Timothy Leary v. US, Supreme Court of the United States, 1969 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Controlled Substances Act]] as Title II of the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]], which repealed the Marijuana Tax Act.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. October 27, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the new law did officially prohibit the use of cannabis for any purpose (medical included), it also separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences for possessing small amounts of the drug.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

Cannabis was assigned a Schedule I classification under the CSA, deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting even medical use of the drug.  The classification has remained since the CSA was first signed into law, despite multiple efforts to reschedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The DEA: Four Decades of Impeding And Rejecting Science|url=https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA-MAPS_DEA_Science_Final.pdf|publisher=Drug Policy Alliance / Multidisciplinary Associations for Psychedelic Studies|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hudak|first1=John|last2=Wallack|first2=Grace|title=Ending the U.S. government’s war on medical marijuana research|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ending-the-US-governments-war-on-medical-marijuana-research.pdf|work=Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings|publisher=The Brookings Institution|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other drugs in the Schedule I category include [[heroin]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[peyote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRUG SCHEDULING|url=https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml|website=dea.gov|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] subsidiary the [[Bureau of Narcotics]], and the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] subsidiary the [[Bureau of Drug Abuse Control]], merged to create the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] as a [[United States Department of Justice]] subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Drug Crisis: Report on Drug Abuse in Illinois to the Illinois General Assembly|year=1971|publisher=Illinois Legislative Investigating Commission|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|author=Illinois General Assembly; Legislative Investigating Commission|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 President [[Richard Nixon]]'s "Reorganization Plan Number Two" proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce federal drug laws and [[United States Congress|Congress]] accepted the proposal, as there was concern regarding the growing availability of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deamuseum.org/dea_history_book/1970_1975.htm |title=History of the DEA: 1970 – 1975 |publisher=deamuseum.org |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044643/http://www.deamuseum.org/dea_history_book/1970_1975.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, on July 1, 1973, the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] (BNDD) and the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE) merged to create the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; On December 1, 1975, the Supreme Court ruled that it was "not cruel or unusual for Ohio to sentence someone to 20 years for having or selling cannabis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=480712 |title=Supreme Court / Marijuana / Busing / Speedy Trial NBC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=December 1, 1975 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State Office of Narcotics and Drug Abuse (1977) ===
In January 1976, California's study of the economic impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had been spending from $35 million to $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysis of marijuana policy.|year=2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=978-1-154-43725-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandatory sentencing and three-strikes (1984, 1986) ===
During the [[Reagan Administration]] the Sentencing Reform Act provisions of the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]] created the Sentencing Commission, which established mandatory sentencing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/politics/judbranc/ovrweb03.pdf|title=An Overview of the United States Sentencing Commission|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040721202601/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/politics/judbranc/ovrweb03.pdf|archivedate=July 21, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 reinstated mandatory prison sentences, including large scale cannabis distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |title=1985–1990 |publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]] |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622214536/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |archivedate=June 22, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later an amendment created a [[three-strikes law]], which created mandatory 25-years imprisonment for repeated serious crimes – including certain drug offenses – and allowed the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] to be used against "drug kingpins".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

===Solomon–Lautenberg amendment (1990)===
The [[Solomon–Lautenberg amendment]] is a federal law enacted in 1990 that urged states to suspend the [[driver's license]] of anyone who commits a drug offense.&lt;ref name="nyt suspend"&gt;{{cite news|title=States Are Pressed to Suspend Driver Licenses of Drug Users|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/16/us/states-are-pressed-to-suspend-driver-licenses-of-drug-users.html|accessdate=February 1, 2018|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=November 16, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of states passed laws in the early 1990s seeking to comply with the amendment, in order to avoid a penalty of reduced federal highway funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Aiken|first1=Joshua|title=Reinstating Common Sense: How driver's license suspensions for drug offenses unrelated to driving are falling out of favor|url=https://www.prisonpolicy.org/driving/national.html|accessdate=February 1, 2018|work=Prison Policy Initiative|date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These laws imposed mandatory driver's license suspensions of at least six months for persons committing a drug offense (including simple possession of cannabis), regardless of whether any motor vehicle was involved.&lt;ref name="clemency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reefer sanity: States abandon driver's license suspensions for drug offenses|url=http://clemencyreport.org/drivers-license-suspensions-drug-offenses-state-state-list/|website=The Clemency Report|accessdate=February 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119234957/http://clemencyreport.org/drivers-license-suspensions-drug-offenses-state-state-list/|archive-date=January 19, 2018|dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the amendment does contain a provision for states to opt out (without penalty), as of 2018 seven states still have so-called "Smoke a joint, lose your license" laws in effect.

=== House Joint Resolution 117 (1998) ===
By the fall of 1998, California voters had approved [[Proposition 215]] to legalize [[medical cannabis]], and similar measures were up for vote in several more states.  In response to these developments, House Joint Resolution 117 was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on September 15, 1998, to declare support for "the existing Federal legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs" and oppose "efforts to circumvent this process by legalizing marijuana ... for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and [FDA] approval".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary: H.J.Res.117 – 105th Congress (1997-1998)|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-joint-resolution/117|website=congress.gov|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure passed by a 310 to 93 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ninety-Three Members of Congress Stand Up For Medical Marijuana|url=http://norml.org/news/1998/09/17/ninety-three-members-of-congress-stand-up-for-medical-marijuana|accessdate=February 27, 2018|work=NORML|date=September 17, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative}}

Following the passage of Proposition 215, the [[Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]] was created to "provide seriously ill patients with a safe and reliable source of medical cannabis, information, and patient support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Student Study Guide to Accompany Drugs and Society|year=2008|publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]]|location=[[Sudbury, Massachusetts]]|isbn=978-0-7637-5932-2|author1=Hanson, Glen |author2=Venturelli, Peter |author3=Fleckenstein, Annette |page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1998, the U.S. Government sued Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative for violating federal laws created as a result of [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970. On May 14, 2001, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' that federal anti-drug laws do not permit an exception for medical cannabis and rejected the common-law [[medical necessity]] defense to crimes enacted under the Controlled Substances Act because Congress concluded cannabis has "no currently accepted medical use" when the act was passed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-151.ZS.html ''UNITED STATES v.

=== ''Gonzales v. Raich'' (2005) ===
{{Main article|Gonzales v. Raich}}
''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a decision in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled (6–3) that even where individuals or businesses in accordance with state-approved medical cannabis programs are lawfully cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical cannabis, such persons or businesses are violating federal marijuana laws. Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants the federal government jurisdiction, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, to prosecute marijuana offenses.

In ''Gonzales'' the defendants argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within California and in compliance with California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce, and as such could not be regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause.

The Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html ''GONZALES V. RAICH''] (2008). [[Cornell Law School]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat state-approved medical cannabis legislation, the Drug Enforcement Administration continued the routine targeting and arrests of medical cannabis patients and the seizure of medical cannabis and the business assets of growers and medical dispensaries.  This was finally curtailed with the passage of the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] in 2014, although prosecutions initially continued until a pair of court rulings determined the DOJ was interpreting the amendment incorrectly.

===Cole Memorandum rescinded (2018)===

Randall, who had discovered that cannabis relieved the symptoms of his [[glaucoma]], employed a [[medical necessity]] defense at trial to justify his use of the drug.&lt;ref name="PITC"&gt;{{citation|title=Patients in the Crossfire|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/crossfire.pdf|publisher=American for Safe Access|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges against Randall were dismissed, and as a result of an ensuing petition filed with the FDA, Randall became the first person to receive cannabis from the federal government in 1976.&lt;ref name="PITC" /&gt;  After his supply was cut off in 1978, he filed a lawsuit to have it restored,&lt;ref name="PITC" /&gt; setting in motion the creation of the [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Coning|first1=Lexi|title=Irvin Rosenfeld: Meet the Longest-Surviving U.S. Federal Marijuana Patient|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/irvin-rosenfeld-meet-the-longest-surviving-us-federal-marijuana-patient|accessdate=May 17, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program allowed patients with serious medical conditions to receive a regular supply of cannabis from the federal government; however, only 13 patients ended up participating due to the very complicated and drawn-out application process involved.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;

The Compassionate IND program was closed to new patients in 1992, due to a flood of new applications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] patients and concerns that the program undercut [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush administration]] efforts to discourage illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. to halt distributing 'pot' to ill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19910619&amp;id=6PkhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9KIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4370,3236411&amp;hl=en|work=The Washington Post|date=June 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-eight applications that had recently been approved were rescinded, and only the 13 patients who were already receiving cannabis were allowed to do so moving forward.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  As of 2016, most of the original 13 patients had perished, but at least two were still known to be receiving cannabis from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rabinski|first1=Gooey|title=U.S. Government Supplies Free Medical Cannabis to Select Patients|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/government-provides-medical-cannabis|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early medical cannabis laws (1978–1982)====
During the late 1970s and into the early 80s, a number of states passed legislation addressing the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  [[New Mexico]] was the first to do so in 1978, and by the end of 1982 over thirty states had followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=Steven C.|title=State-by-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=http://www.procon.org/view.background-resource.php?resourceID=001496|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of these laws sought to provide cannabis through federally-approved research programs administered by the states, using cannabis supplied by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]].  Only seven states ended up implementing the programs, however,&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt; due to the large bureaucratic and regulatory obstacles involved.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  Other states passed laws allowing doctors to prescribe cannabis, or reclassifying cannabis in a state's internal drug scheduling system.  Additionally, a few states passed legislation affirming the right of individuals to present a [[medical necessity]] defense at trial.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  These laws were all largely ineffectual though, due to the continued prohibition of medical cannabis at the federal level.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  By the mid-80s, efforts to pass new medical cannabis laws had ground to a halt, and a number of existing laws were either repealed or allowed to expire.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;

====DEA judge recommends reclassification (1988)====
In 1972, the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] petitioned the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs|BNDD]] (which later became the DEA) to remove cannabis from the list of Schedule I drugs, in order to allow it to be prescribed by physicians.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history"&gt;{{citation|last1=Grinspoon|first1=Lester|title=History of Cannabis as a Medicine|date=August 16, 2005|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/mmj/grinspoon_history_cannabis_medicine.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a decade of legal battles in which the DEA refused to consider the petition, public hearings were finally held on the matter starting in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Medical Use Introduction|url=http://norml.org/pdf_files/NORML_medical_use_introduction.pdf|work=NORML|date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1988, after two years of extensive public hearings, DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young ruled in favor of moving cannabis to a Schedule II classification, finding that "Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."&lt;ref name="CRS report"&gt;{{citation|last1=Eddy|first1=Mark|title=Medical Marijuana: Review and Analysis of Federal and State Policies|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/MedicalMarjiuanaStatePolicies040210.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young further concluded: "The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision.  It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for [the] DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record."&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  As Young's ruling was only a non-binding recommendation, however, it was rejected by DEA Administrator John Lawn in December 1989.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boire|first1=Richard Glen|last2=Feeney|first2=Kevin|title=Medical Marijuana Law|date=January 26, 2007|publisher=Ronin Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1Tw_UFU2XEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision was upheld in 1994 by a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling.&lt;ref name="Pacula"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacula|first1=Rosalie Piccardo|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws: Understanding the Laws and Their Limitations|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|date=February 2002|doi=10.2307/3343240|url=http://impacteen.uic.edu/generalarea_PDFs/medicalmarijuanapaper100301.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposition P and first cannabis dispensaries (1991)====
In 1991, 79% of [[San Francisco]] voters approved Proposition P, a non-binding ballot measure expressing support for the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;  The city [[board of supervisors]] soon followed with Resolution 141-92, which urged law enforcement not to prosecute individuals using cannabis under a doctor's care (as proven by a letter from a treating physician).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition P|url=http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/Proposition_P_Nov_1991.html|website=marijuanalibrary.org|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution allowed the open distribution of cannabis to AIDS patients and others throughout the city, most notably through the [[San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club]] which was operated by [[Dennis Peron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=The Cannabis Buyers Club: How Medical Marijuana Began in California|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/the-cannabis-buyers-club-how-medical-marijuana-began-in-california/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar clubs appeared outside San Francisco in the ensuing years as other cities passed legislation to support the medical use of cannabis.  The [[Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana]] was founded in 1993 after [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] voters approved Measure A in November 1992.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  And the [[Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]] was founded in 1995 shortly before the city council passed multiple medical cannabis resolutions.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  These were the first cannabis dispensaries in the U.S., allowed to operate openly by city officials even though in violation of both state and federal law.

====Compassionate Use Act of 1996====
In California, following the success of Proposition P and other local initiatives, medical cannabis advocates turned attention towards reform efforts at the state level.  A pair of medical cannabis bills was approved by state legislators in 1994 and 1995; however, both of these were vetoed by Governor [[Pete Wilson]].&lt;ref name="Vitiello 215"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitiello|first1=Michael|title=Proposition 215: De Facto Legalization of Pot and the Shortcomings of Direct Democracy|url=http://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&amp;context=facultyarticles|accessdate=April 30, 2017|publisher=McGeorge School of Law|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frustrated by these vetoes, medical cannabis advocates took the issue directly to the voters, collecting 775,000 signatures for qualification of a statewide ballot initiative in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Marijuana Initiative Qualifies For November Ballot|url=http://norml.org/news/1996/06/06/medical-marijuana-initiative-qualifies-for-november-ballot|accessdate=April 30, 2017|work=NORML|date=June 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 1996, California voters approved [[Proposition 215]] (Compassionate Use Act of 1996), making the state the first in the nation to legalize the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balzar|first1=John|title=Voters Approve Measure to Use Pot as Medicine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1996-11-06/news/mn-62740_1_voters-approve-measure|accessdate=February 9, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure, approved with 56% of the vote, allowed the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis by patients with a physician's recommendation, for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or "any other illness for which marijuana provides relief".&lt;ref name="Prop215 text"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 215: Text of Proposed Law|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/california-proposition-215.pdf|website=ProCon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law also allowed patient [[caregiver]]s to cultivate cannabis, and urged lawmakers to facilitate the "safe and affordable distribution of marijuana".&lt;ref name="Prop215 text" /&gt;

The passage of Proposition 215 was followed by the approval of five more medical cannabis ballot initiatives in 1998 (Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Nevada, and the District of Columbia).&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Maine followed in 1999, along with Nevada (for a second time) and Colorado in 2000.&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Also in 2000, Hawaii became the first state to legalize medical cannabis through an act of state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaii Becomes First State to Approve Medical Marijuana Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/15/us/hawaii-becomes-first-state-to-approve-medical-marijuana-bill.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=June 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====D.C. medical cannabis blocked (1998)====
[[Washington D.C.]] residents approved a [[Initiative 59|medical cannabis initiative]] in 1998, but a series of amendments introduced by Rep. [[Bob Barr]] and approved by Congress prevented its implementation for over a decade.&lt;ref name="AFSA DCMMJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress Lifts Ban on Medical Marijuana for Nation's Capitol|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_lifts_ban_on_medical_marijuana_for_nations_capitol|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial Barr amendment was enacted prior to the November 1998 election but after ballots had been printed, thereby allowing D.C. residents to vote on the initiative but preventing the results from being made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slevin|first1=Peter|last2=Murphy|first2=Caryle|title=Marijuana Vote Results Kept Secret|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dcelections/marijuana4.htm|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=November 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment was challenged in court by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] on grounds that it violated [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, and in September 1999 U.S. District Court Judge [[Richard W. Roberts]] agreed, overturning the Barr amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy Held Hostage|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/democracy-held-hostage|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=ACLU|date=December 31, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114081620/https://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/medmarijuana/10718res20001231.html|archive-date=January 14, 2006|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rep. Barr then introduced a similar amendment which became law in November 1999, setting off a long legal battle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Initiative Events|url=http://www.mpp.org/legislation/dc/bills/timeline-of-initiative-events.html|website=Marijuana Policy Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918150902/http://www.mpp.org/legislation/dc/bills/timeline-of-initiative-events.html|archive-date=September 18, 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; until finally in December 2009 the Barr amendment was removed from the annual D.C. appropriations bill, allowing the original 1998 ballot initiative to move forward.&lt;ref name="AFSA DCMMJ" /&gt;  Rep. Barr, who left Congress in 2003, helped lobby for defeat of the legislation he originally authored,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frates|first1=Chris|title=Bob Barr Flip-Flops on Pot|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2007/03/bob-barr-flip-flops-on-pot-003329|accessdate=February 19, 2017|work=Politico|date=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; having reversed his earlier opposition to the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barr|first1=Bob|title=Federal Drug War Rethought|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-barr/federal-drug-war-rethough_b_125458.html|accessdate=February 19, 2017|work=The Huffington Post|date=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Conant v. McCaffrey'' (2000)====
After [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] passed, the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] reiterated its firm opposition to the medical use of cannabis, and threatened to revoke the prescription-writing abilities of doctors who recommend or prescribe the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=David G.|last2=Warren|first2=Jennifer|title=U.S. Threatens Penalties if Doctors Prescribe Pot|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-31/news/mn-14152_1_medical-marijuana-initiative|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, threats were made by the administration to criminally prosecute physicians, and ban them from participating in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Plan Attacks Medical Marijuana Initiatives, Targets Doctors|url=http://norml.org/news/1997/01/02/clinton-plan-attacks-medical-marijuana-initiatives-targets-doctors|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=NORML|date=January 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of physicians challenged this policy as a violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, and in September 2000 prevailed in the case ''[[Conant v. McCaffrey]]'', which affirmed the right of physicians to recommend (but not prescribe) cannabis.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws"&gt;{{citation|title=State-By-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws-report/|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, cannabis must be recommended instead of prescribed in all states where its medical use has been legalized.

====Ogden memo (2009)====
In October 2009, the Ogden memo was issued by the Justice Department, advising [[United States Attorney|U.S. attorneys]] to only prosecute medical cannabis providers who violate state law or engage in other federally-illegal activity (such as money laundering or illegal use of firearms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Won't Seek to Arrest Medical Pot Users|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/19/obama-wont-seek-arrest-medical-pot-users.html|accessdate=February 13, 2009|work=Fox News|date=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memo did not have the effect that many expected, however, as raids on medical cannabis providers actually increased in frequency following its release.&lt;ref name="Sullum bummer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=Bummer -- Barack Obama turns out to be just another drug warrior|url=http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/12/bummer/singlepage|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Reason|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prompted by public outcry and requests for clarification from numerous elected officials, a new memo was issued by Deputy Attorney General [[James M. Cole]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name="ASA Cole"&gt;{{citation|title=THIRD TIME THE CHARM? -- State Laws on Medical Cannabis Distribution and Department of Justice Guidance on Enforcement|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/ASA_2013ColeMemo_WhitePaper.pdf|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2011 Cole memo insisted that the 2009 Ogden memo was being adhered to,&lt;ref name="Sullum bummer" /&gt; and that the Ogden memo's protections applied only to individual patients and not commercial operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=Obama's War on Pot|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crackdown on medical cannabis continued following the release of the 2011 memo, but was tempered somewhat by the issuance of a new [[Cole Memorandum|Cole memo in 2013]], which advised a more deferential approach towards the states (similar in nature to how the 2009 Ogden memo was widely interpreted).&lt;ref name="ASA Cole" /&gt;

==== Rohrabacher–Farr amendment (2014) ====
In response to increased raids on medical cannabis providers, Congress passed the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] in 2014, to prohibit the Justice Department from prosecuting individuals acting in accordance with state law.  The amendment passed the House by a 219–189 vote in May 2014, and was signed into law in December as part of an [[omnibus spending bill]].&lt;ref name="Hinchey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Federal Medical Marijuana Amendment Author Dies At 79|url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-medical-marijuana-amendment-author-dies-79/|accessdate=November 24, 2017|work=Marijuana Moment|date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was renewed following a 242–186 House vote in 2015, and was subsequently included in a number of short-term spending bills in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref name="Hinchey" /&gt;

After the amendment's 2014 enactment, the Justice Department initially continued to prosecute medical cannabis providers based on a new interpretation of the amendment that was being employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zilversmit|first1=Marc|title=Obama’s Iran-Contra – The president is spending money that Congress has explicitly told him he can’t spend|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/04/obama_s_medical_marijuana_prosecutions_probably_aren_t_legal.html|accessdate=September 16, 2017|work=Slate|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=How the Justice Department seems to have misled Congress on medical marijuana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/06/the-justice-department-says-it-misled-congress-on-medical-marijuana/|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. District Judge [[Charles R.

====Shafer Commission (1972)====
Following the passage of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in 1970, a commission was formed under decree of the act to study the rising use of cannabis in America, and subsequently make policy recommendations.  Formally known as the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, the [[Shafer Commission]] – led by former Pennsylvania governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]] – determined in its March 1972 report to the President and Congress that the societal harms caused by cannabis were limited, and recommended removal of criminal penalties for possession and distribution of small amounts of the drug.&lt;ref name="csdp"&gt;{{citation|title=Nixon Tapes Show Roots of Marijuana Prohibition: Misinformation, Culture Wars and Prejudice|url=http://www.csdp.org/research/shafernixon.pdf|work=Common Sense for Drug Policy|date=March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] was furious with the commission and publicly rejected its findings,&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt; supporters of reform frequently cited the report's recommendations to build support for decriminalization in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Heddleston"&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Heddleston|first1=Thomas R.|title=From the Frontlines to the Bottom Line: Medical Marijuana, the War on Drugs, and the Drug Policy Reform Movement|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1t7220hj|publisher=UC Santa Cruz Electronic Theses and Dissertations|date=June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/MedicalMarijuanaTheWarOnDrugsAndTheDrugPolicyReformMovement|archive-date=February 16, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California Marijuana Initiative (1972)====
In 1972, California became the first state to vote on a ballot measure attempting to legalize cannabis.  [[California Proposition 19 (1972)|Proposition 19]] – the California Marijuana Initiative – sought to legalize the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis, but did not allow for commercial sales.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Patrick|title=High In America: The True Story Behind NORML And The Politics Of Marijuana|date=February 27, 1981|publisher=The Viking Press|isbn=978-0670119905|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/anderson/highinamerica.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was ultimately defeated by a wide margin (33–67%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of marijuana on the ballot|url=https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_marijuana_on_the_ballot|website=Ballotpedia|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supporters were encouraged by the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=John|title=Getting NORML -- A brief history of the movement to legalize marijuana|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/getting-norml/Content?oid=2150635|accessdate=February 11, 2018|work=Detroit Metro Times|date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided momentum to other reform efforts in California in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;

====First wave of decriminalization (1973 to 1978)====
In 1973 [[Oregon]] became the first state to decriminalize cannabis, reducing the penalty for possessing up to one ounce to a $100 fine.  Five more states followed in 1975 – [[Alaska]], [[Maine]], [[Colorado]], [[California]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;  In subsequent years, decriminalization laws passed in [[Minnesota]] (1976), [[Mississippi]] (1977), [[New York (state)|New York]] (1977), [[North Carolina]] (1977), and [[Nebraska]] (1978).&lt;ref name="Dufton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dufton|first1=Emily|title=Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America|date=December 5, 2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0465096169|url=https://www.amazon.com/Grass-Roots-Rise-Marijuana-America/dp/0465096166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]] was actively involved in helping to pass these laws, lobbying in support of legislation and paying for decriminalization proponents (including members of the Shafer Commission) to travel to various states to testify.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;

Some cities also passed decriminalization laws in the 1970s, such as [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1972 and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brush|first1=Mark|title=Sorting out the confusion over local marijuana laws, Ann Arbor's experience|url=http://michiganradio.org/post/sorting-out-confusion-over-local-marijuana-laws-ann-arbors-experience|accessdate=February 24, 2018|work=Michigan Radio|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullen|first1=Sandy|title=30 Years Later Madison Voters Passed A Law In April 1977 That Permits Possession Of Small Amounts Of Marijuana In Private Places|url=http://host.madison.com/news/years-later-madison-voters-passed-a-law-in-april-that/article_fbb60aa4-99f6-59f6-870a-2021eeffd16c.html|accessdate=February 7, 2018|work=madison.com|date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, San Francisco voters approved a non-binding measure in 1978 to effectively legalize cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Martin A.|title=Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana – Medical, Recreational, and Scientific|date=August 2012|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1439102602|url=https://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Signals-Marijuana-Recreational-Scientific/dp/1439102600}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mayor [[George Moscone]] was assassinated shortly afterwards and the initiative was subsequently disregarded.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Chris|title=SF's Dianne Feinstein: 'Worst Senator on Marijuana Reform'|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/sfs-dianne-feinstein-worst-senator-on-marijuana-reform/|accessdate=February 24, 2018|work=SF Weekly|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Ravin v. State'' (1975)====
''[[Ravin v. State]]'' was a 1975 decision by the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] that held the Alaska Constitution's [[right to privacy]] protects an adult's ability to use and possess a small amount of cannabis in the home for personal use.{{sfn|Brandeis|2012|p=175}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Continuing Vitality of Ravin v.

====Second wave of decriminalization (2000s and onward)====
In 2001, [[Nevada]] became the first state in over two decades to decriminalize cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nevada Defelonizes Pot PossessionState Eliminates Jail, Criminal Record for Minor Offenders; Legalizes Medical Marijuana for Seriously Ill|url=http://norml.org/news/2001/06/07/nevada-defelonizes-pot-possessionstate-eliminates-jail-criminal-record-for-minor-offenders-legalizes-medical-marijuana-for-seriously-ill|accessdate=February 9, 2018|work=NORML|date=June 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following years, major cities across the U.S. began to either decriminalize cannabis or make enforcement of cannabis laws the lowest priority.  Among the first cities to do so were [[Seattle]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle Voters Approve Initiative Making Marijuana Enforcement City's "Lowest Priority"|url=http://norml.org/news/2003/09/18/seattle-voters-approve-initiative-making-marijuana-enforcement-city-s-lowest-priority|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=NORML|date=September 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voters Nationwide Embrace Marijuana Law Reform Proposals|url=http://norml.org/news/2004/11/03/voters-nationwide-embrace-marijuana-law-reform-proposals|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=NORML|date=November 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denver]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denver Residents Legalize Marijuana Possession|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/11/02/denver-residents-legalize-marijuana-possession.html|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=Fox News|agency=Associated Press|date=November 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco Board of Supervisors Vote Overwhelmingly to Deprioritize Adult Marijuana Offenses; Now Officially Lowest Law Enforcement Priority|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2006/11/san-francisco-board-supervisors-vote-overwhelmingly-deprioritize-adult-marijuana-offens|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=Drug Policy Alliance|date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot initiative to decriminalize cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abel|first1=David|title=Voters approve marijuana law change|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/05/voters_approve_marijuana_law_change/|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=The Boston Globe|date=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  States that decriminalized in subsequent years were [[Connecticut]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conn. passes bill to decriminalize marijuana|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conn-passes-bill-to-decriminalize-marijuana/|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhode Island]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rhode Island: Marijuana Decriminalization Measure Signed Into Law|url=http://norml.org/news/2012/06/21/rhode-island-marijuana-decriminalization-measure-signed-into-law|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=NORML|date=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vermont]] (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wing|first1=Nick|title=Vermont Marijuana Decriminalization Signed Into Law, Reduces Penalties For Possession Up To An Ounce|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/vermont-marijuana-decriminalization_n_3397266.html|accessdate=February 9, 2018|work=HuffPost|date=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryland]] (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Molly|title=Maryland Decriminalizes Marijuana Possession|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/maryland-marijuana-decriminalization_n_5107412.html|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=HuffPost|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Missouri]] (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Missouri Becomes 19th State To Decriminalize Marijuana Possession|url=https://blog.mpp.org/prohibition/missouri-becomes-19th-state-to-decriminalize-marijuana-possession/|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=Marijuana Policy Project|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delaware]] (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starkey|first1=Jonathan|title=Marijuana decriminalization bill OK'd in Delaware|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/18/marijuana-decriminalization-bill-okd-delaware/28955055/|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=USA Today|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illinois]] (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monique|first1=Garcia|title=Rauner reduces punishment for minor pot possession from jail to citation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-marijuana-decriminalzation-0730-20160729-story.html|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Hampshire]] (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=NH governor signs marijuana decriminalization bill|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/342692-nh-governor-signs-marijuana-decriminalization-bill|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=The Hill|date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] also decriminalized in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armento|first1=Paul|title=Pot Possession Decriminalized In US Virgin Islands|url=http://blog.norml.org/2014/12/22/pot-possession-decriminalized-in-us-virgin-islands/|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=NORML|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First two states legalize (2012)====
On November 6, 2012, [[Colorado]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] became the first states to legalize recreational use of cannabis when voters approved [[Colorado Amendment 64]] and [[Washington Initiative 502]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington, Colorado Allow Recreational Marijuana Use|url=https://www.newsmax.com/US/marijuana-Washington-Colorado-ballot/2012/11/07/id/463145/|accessdate=February 15, 2018|work=Newsmax|agency=Bloomberg News|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each regulated cannabis in a way similar to alcohol, allowing possession of up to an ounce for adults ages 21 and older, with [[DUID]] provisions similar to those against drunk driving.  Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allowed for personal cultivation of up to six plants.  Both allowed for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.

====Cole Memorandum (2013)====
After the first states legalized in 2012, the Justice Department issued the [[Cole Memorandum]] in August 2013, seeking to clarify how federal law would be enforced.  The memo specified eight conditions which would merit enforcement of federal law, some of which included the distribution of cannabis to minors and the diversion of cannabis across state borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rough|first1=Lisa|title=The Cole Memo: What Is It and What Does It Mean?|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-the-cole-memo|accessdate=January 21, 2018|work=Leafly|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from these situations, the memo generally allowed for the commercial distribution of cannabis in states where such activity has been legalized.  In January 2018, however, the Cole memo was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], introducing uncertainty into how federal law would be enforced.&lt;ref name="politico cole" /&gt;

====Two more states plus D.C. legalize (2014)====
In November 2014, the states of [[Alaska]] ([[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)|Measure 2]]) and [[Oregon]] ([[Oregon Ballot Measure 91 (2014)|Ballot Measure 91]]) along with [[Washington D.C.]] ([[Initiative 71]]) legalized the recreational use of cannabis.  These laws were similar in nature to those of Colorado and Washington, except the D.C. initiative did not contain an allowance for commercial sales.  A rider attached to the 2014 "Cromnibus" bill further prevented D.C. council members from enacting legislation to allow for commercial sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington DC legalizes marijuana possession and use|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31634827|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=BBC News|date=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cummings|first1=William|title=Pot now legal in D.C. despite threats from Congress|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/25/dc-marijuana-legalization/24033803/|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=USA Today|date=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indian Reservation legalization allowed (2014) ====
In December 2014, the Justice Department announced a policy to allow recognized Indian tribes to legalize the use and sale of cannabis on their lands.  The laws on reservations are allowed to be different from state and federal laws, and as with states that have legalized cannabis the federal government will not intervene as long as strict controls are maintained.  Some domestic nations such as the [[Yakama Nation]] and the [[Oglala Sioux Tribal Council]] have rejected legalization on their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.nwherald.com/2014/12/12/doj-says-indian-tribes-can-grow-and-sell-marijuana/aee5o5i/ |title = DOJ says Indian tribes can grow and sell marijuana |publisher = nwherald.com|date = December 12, 2014 |accessdate = December 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the [[Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe]] (South Dakota) voted to legalize the recreational use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="Tribe Bets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/16/tribe-bets-on-legal-pot |title=Tribe Bets on Legal Pot |publisher=US News |date=June 16, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801064052/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/16/tribe-bets-on-legal-pot |archivedate=August 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Four more states legalize (2016)====
In November 2016, four more states legalized through ballot initiative – [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Alicia|title=A greener America: Marijuana’s big statement in Election 2016|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/08/election-2016-marijuana-results-states-recreational-medical/66994/|accessdate=February 14, 2018|work=The Cannabist|date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This included the nation's most populous state (California), while Massachusetts and Maine became the first eastern states to legalize.

====First state legalizes through legislature (2018)====
In January 2018, [[Vermont]] became the first state to legalize through an act of legislature, as opposed to ballot initiative with the previous eight states.  Also differentiating Vermont's law is the fact that it does not allow for commercial sales, although a commission was set up to explore the possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zezima|first1=Katie|title=Vermont is the first state to legalize marijuana through legislature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/01/23/vermont-is-the-first-state-to-legalize-marijuana-through-legislature/|accessdate=February 14, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was signed into law by Republican governor [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phil Scott]].&lt;ref name=Wallace20180122&gt;{{citation|work=The Cannabist|publisher=''The Denver Post''|title=Vermont Gov.

Instead of attending high school for his senior year, he enrolled as a full-time student at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] International [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. While attending the University of Pittsburgh, he held a variety of jobs, including a bartender, [[disco]] dancing instructor, and a party promoter.

==Business career==
In 1982, Cuban moved to [[Dallas]], Texas, where he first found work as a bartender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Cuban|url=http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/23/success-and-motivation-part-1/|title=Success and Motivation, Part 1|work=Blog Maverick|date=April 23, 2004|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="once"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Cuban|url=http://blogmaverick.com/2005/05/30/success-and-motivation-you-only-have-to-be-right-once/|title=Success and Motivation – You only have to be right once!|work=Blog Maverick|date=May 30, 2005|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the earliest PC software retailers in Dallas. He was fired less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Cuban|url=http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/25/success-and-motivation-part-2/ |title=Success and Motivation, Part 2 |work=Blog Maverick |date=April 25, 2004 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban started his own company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as [[Carbon Copy (software)|Carbon Copy]], [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]], and [[CompuServe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varbusiness.com/sections/columns/columns.jhtml?articleId=18806438 |title=Technology News For Solution Providers And The IT Channel &amp;#124; CRN |publisher=Varbusiness.com |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the company's largest clients was [[Perot Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogmaverick.com/2004/12/14/a-little-bit-of-history-lotus-notes/|title=A little bit of history....Lotus Notes|first=Mark|last=Cuban|date=December 14, 2004|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of [[H&amp;R Block]]—for $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; He made approximately $2&amp;nbsp;million after taxes on the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/300|title=A 'must read' by Maverick owner Mark Cuban|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505070839/http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/300|archivedate=May 5, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audionet and Broadcast.com===
In 1995, Chris Jaeb and fellow Indiana University alumnus [[Todd Wagner]] started Audionet (which Cuban started to fund in 1998), combining their mutual interest in [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosier]] college basketball and [[webcasting]]. With a single server and an [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerpoweruser.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0212/62c12web/62c12web.asp&amp;guid= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20040512171124/http://www.computerpoweruser.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0212/62c12web/62c12web.asp&amp;guid= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 24, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audionet became [[Broadcast.com]] in 1998.

Cuban continues to work with Wagner in another venture, [[2929 Entertainment]], which provides [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] production and distribution of films and video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2929entertainment.com/Index.cfm?FuseAction=Page&amp;PageID=1000012 |title=Holdings |publisher=2929 Entertainment |accessdate=September 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224001649/http://www.2929entertainment.com/Index.cfm?FuseAction=Page&amp;PageID=1000012 |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, Cuban announced that he would be working with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television to produce a reality television series, ''[[The Benefactor (TV series)|The Benefactor]]''. The premise of the six-episode series involved 16 contestants trying to win $1&amp;nbsp;million by participating in various contests, with their performances being judged by Cuban. It premiered on September 13, 2004, but due to poor ratings, the series was canceled before the full season aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2004-10-14 |title=The Benefactor |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=February 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827123123/http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2004-10-14 |archivedate=August 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"People tend to approach technology the same way, whether it's in front of them, or behind them," Cuban joked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Shallit|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2005/dec/1228243.htm |title=Clean living |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date=December 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also invested in Goowy Media Inc., a San Diego internet software startup. In April 2006, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] announced that Cuban would host his own weekly radio talk show, ''Mark Cuban's Radio Maverick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sys-con.com/read/211681.htm |title=Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban to Host Talk Show Exclusively on SIRIUS Satellite Radio |publisher=Sys-con.com |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show has not materialized.

In July 2006, Cuban financed [[Sharesleuth.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paidcontent.org/mark-cuban-invests-in-new-investigative-journalism-site |title=Mark Cuban invests in new investigative journalism site |publisher=Paidcontent.org |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website created by former ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' investigative reporter Christopher Carey to uncover fraud and misinformation in publicly traded companies.
Experimenting with a new business model for making online journalism financially viable, Cuban disclosed that he would take positions in the shares of companies mentioned in Sharesleuth.com in advance of publication. Business and legal analysts questioned the appropriateness of shorting a stock prior to making public pronouncements which are likely to result in losses in that stock's value. Cuban insisted that the practice is legal in view of full disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LOREN STEFFY, Copyright 2006 Houston Chronicle |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/4109641.html |title=Cuban's made his agenda crystal clear |work=Houston Chronicle |date=August 11, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/opinion/15259590.htm |title=And it looked so good |accessdate=August 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823190801/http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/opinion/15259590.htm |archivedate=August 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moneyisgood.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/sharesleuthcom/ |title=Money is Good |publisher=Moneyisgood.wordpress.com |date=August 11, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Cuban partnered with [[Mascot Books]] to publish his first children's book, ''Let's Go, Mavs!''. In November 2011, he wrote a 30,000-word e-book, ''How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It'', which he described as "a way to get motivated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Trachtenberg |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204517204577046430928804826 |title=In E-Books, a New Player |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|location=New York City|date=November 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Cuban started Bailoutsleuth.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Bailoutsleuth.com |title=Mark Cuban's online resource for the U.S. government bailout of financial institutions |publisher=Bailoutsleuth.com |date=November 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a grassroots, online portal for oversight over the U.S. government's $700&amp;nbsp;billion "bailout" of financial institutions.

In September 2010, Cuban provided an undisclosed amount of [[venture capital]] to store-front analytics company Motionloft. According to the company's CEO Jon Mills, he cold-emailed Cuban on a whim with the business proposition and claimed Cuban quickly responded that he would like to hear more. Mills credited that sentence for launching the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who's Watching You Shop? |publisher=Crain's Chicago |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20121018/BLOGS01/121019786/whos-watching-you-shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, several investors questioned Cuban about Mills' representation of a pending acquisition of Motionloft. Cuban denied an acquisition was in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan|last=Lawler|title=Former Motionloft CEO Jon Mills Arrested By The FBI|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/jon-mills-arrested/|work=TechCrunch|publisher=[[AOL]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills was terminated as CEO of Motionloft by stockholders on December 1, 2013, and in February 2014 was arrested by the FBI and charged with wire fraud, it being alleged that Mr. Mills misrepresented to investors that Motionloft was going to be acquired by [[Cisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former CEO Of Technology Start-Up Charged In Investment Scheme |publisher=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney's Office, Northern District of California |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-ceo-technology-start-charged-investment-scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban has gone on record to state that the technology, that at least in part is meant to serve the commercial real estate industry, is "game changing" for tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David|last=Jones|title=Cushman Test Drives Pedestrian Driving Sensors |url=http://therealdeal.com/blog/2012/08/03/cushman-test-drives-pedestrian-driving-sensors/|work=The Real Deal |publisher=Real Estate Media|location=New York City|date=August 3, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Shark Tank''===
Cuban has been a "shark" investor on the [[american Broadcasting Company|ABC]] reality program ''[[Shark Tank]]'' since season two in 2011.

As of May 2015, he has invested in 85 deals across 111 ''Shark Tank'' episodes, for a total of $19.9 million invested.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkalytics.com/investor/mcuban |title=Mark Cuban $19,850,000 invested on air |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual numbers vary because the investment happens after the handshake deal on live television, after the due diligence is performed to ensure the accuracy of the information presented in the pitch room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-happens-after-closing-shark-tank-deal-2015-10 |title=Mark Cuban explains what happens after a deal is made on 'Shark Tank' |publisher=Business Insider |date=October 26, 2015 |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Hy-Conn, a manufacturer of easily removable fire hoses, after agreeing to a deal of $1.25 million for 100% of the company with Cuban, did not go through with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharktankblog.com/mark-cuban-dumped-hycon/ |title=Mark Cuban Dumped HyConn |publisher=Shark Tank Blog |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban's top three deals, all with at least $1 million invested, are [[Ten Thirty One Productions]], [[Rugged Maniac]] Obstacle Race, and [[BeatBox Beverages]].&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;

Since Cuban joined the show in 2011, [[Shark Tank#Ratings|the ratings for ''Shark Tank'' have increased]], and also during his tenure, the show has won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program|Outstanding Structured Reality Program]] (from 2014 - 2016). As of 2018, Cuban was the second richest of all Sharks to appear on the show, at 3.7 billion, after [[Richard Branson]], at 5.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tellmenothing.com/2017/03/27/shark-tank-net-worth-all-sharks/|title=Shark Tank: Net Worth Of All Sharks On The Show Till Date|last=Malankar|first=Nikhil|date=2017-03-27|website=Tell Me Nothing|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnolia Pictures===
Cuban owns film distributor [[Magnolia Pictures]]. Through Magnolia, he financed ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'', a fictional [[Adaptation (arts)|dramatization]] based on the [[Mahmudiyah killings|2006 Mahmudiyah killings]], written and directed by [[Brian De Palma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1185714-redacted/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|title=Redacted|accessdate=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Cuban, in his capacity as owner of Magnolia Pictures, removed disturbing photographs from the concluding moments of the ''Redacted'', citing copyrights/permissions issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jen|last=Carlson|url=http://gothamist.com/2007/10/11/video_of_the_da_121.php|title=De Palma defends redacted|work=[[Gothamist]]|publisher=Gothamist LLC|location=New York City|date=October 11, 2007|accessdate=December 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111080601/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/11/video_of_the_da_121.php|archivedate=January 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Cuban was reportedly interested in distributing through Magnolia an edition of the film ''[[Loose Change (film)|Loose Change]]'', which posits a [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11 conspiracy theory]], with [[Charlie Sheen]] narrating. Cuban told the ''[[New York Post]]'', "We are having discussions about distributing the existing video with Charlie's involvement as a narrator, not in making a new feature. We are also looking for productions with an opposing viewpoint. We like controversial subjects, but we are agnostic to which side the controversy comes from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pagesix.com/2007/03/22/hwoods-911-idiot-brigade/ | title=H'wood's 9/11 Idiot Brigade| work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Cuban put Magnolia Pictures and [[Landmark Theatres]] up for sale, but said, "If we don't get the price and premium we want, we are happy to continue to make money from the properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Verrier|title=Mark Cuban puts Landmark Theatres and Magnolia Pictures up for sale|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/04/cuban-puts-landmark-theatres-and-magnolia-pictures-up-for-sale-.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEC insider trading allegation===
On November 17, 2008, it was reported that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) filed a civil suit against Cuban relating to alleged [[insider trading]] in the shares of Mamma.com, now known as [[Copernic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20810.pdf |title=SEC civil suit against Cuban |format=PDF |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[stock dilution]] occurred shortly after a trade in June 2004, giving hints of inside knowledge at the time of the trade, and Cuban allegedly was saved from a loss of $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kara|last=Scannell |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122693827604333637 |title=Wall Street Journal report on insider trading accusations |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Co.]]|date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC claimed that Cuban ordered the sale of his holdings in Mamma.com after he had been confidentially approached by the company to participate in a transaction likely to dilute shares of current shareholders. Cuban disputed the charges, saying he had not agreed to keep the information secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE4AH8Y120081118 |title=Reuters report on insider trading accusations |agency=Reuters |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |first=Robert |last=MacMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, Cuban contended the facts were false and that the investigation was "a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogmaverick.com/2008/11/17/the-sec/ |title=Mark Cuban's personal weblog |publisher=Blogmaverick.com |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''DealBook'', a section of ''[[The New York Times]]'', reported through an anonymous source that Cuban believed the investigation was motivated by an SEC employee having taken offense to his interest in possibly distributing the film ''[[Loose Change (film)|Loose Change]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/a-purported-war-of-words-between-cuban-and-the-sec/ | work=The New York Times | title=A War of Words Between Cuban and the SEC | date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the U.S. District Court dismissed the charges against Cuban, and the SEC appealed. In September 2010, an appeals court said that the district court had erred and that further proceedings would be necessary to address the merits of the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Lattman|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/court-reinstates-s-e-c-case-against-mark-cuban/|title=Mark Cuban to Face SEC Insider Case Again|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal jury in Texas found in favor of Cuban on October 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Cuban Found Not Guilty Of Insider Trading|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/mark-cuban-insider-trading_n_4110257.html?1381953011&amp;icid=maing-grid7%7Caim%7Cdl2%7Csec1_lnk3%26pLid%3D392366|work=The Huffington Post | first=Emily|last=Cohn|date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine-member jury issued the verdict after deliberating 3 hours and 35 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/mark-cuban-insider-trading_n_4110257.html|title=Mark Cuban Found Not Guilty Of Insider Trading|last=Reuters|date=2013-10-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Cuban was on air at [[CNBC]] criticizing [[high-frequency trading]] (HFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Navarro|first1=Bruno J.|title=Mark Cuban rips high-frequency trading|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101539820|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those against HFT, such as Cuban, believe the technology is equivalent to automated insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn|title=Insider Selling Isn't Always A Bad Sign|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/10b5-1.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dallas Mavericks===

On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]] for $285&amp;nbsp;million from [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/columns/story?id=4793301|title=Mark Cuban's decade as Dallas Mavericks owner has been anything but boring|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.indiana.edu/magazine/issues/200411/cuban.shtml |title=Cuban, unembargoed |publisher=Alumni.indiana.edu |accessdate=June 29, 2012|first=Tracy|last=Dodds|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310113900/https://alumni.indiana.edu/magazine/issues/200411/cuban.shtml|archivedate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/sale_press_conference000120.html |title=NBA press release |publisher=National Basketball Association |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games, and a playoff record of 21–32.&lt;ref name="mavstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=dal&amp;lg=n |title=Dallas Mavericks 1980– |publisher=Databasebasketball.com |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617070745/http://databasebasketball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=dal&amp;lg=n |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=nba/teams/DIRECT095.htm |title=Dallas Mavericks - Team Directory 2006 |website=The Sports Network |accessdate=August 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112002237/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=nba%2Fteams%2FDIRECT095.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10 years following, the team won 69 percent of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49 wins and 57 losses, including their first trip to the [[NBA Finals]] in 2006, where they lost to the [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/|title=NBA.com: Finals 2006|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Heat to win the NBA Finals. Historically, NBA team owners publicly play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane—a [[Gulfstream V]]—to attend road games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ding |first=Kevin |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/sports/atoz/article_998115.php |title=All fun and games for Cuban |publisher=Ocregister.com |date=February 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211190535/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/sports/atoz/article_998115.php |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some $100&amp;nbsp;million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs11tv.com/sports/Mark.Cuban.Response.2.1767538.html |title=Mark Cuban Response |website=[[KTVT]] CBS-11 Sports |date=June 2010 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the [[2011 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7186383/judge-denies-lawsuit-mark-cuban-ross-perot-jr |title=Judge denies suit against Mark Cuban |author=Jeff Caplan |date=November 4, 2011 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals|5th Circuit Court]] affirmed that decision on appeal.

====Policy controversies====
Cuban's ownership has been the source of extensive media attention and controversy involving league policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702410.html |title=The NBA's True Maverick |work=The Washington Post |date=June 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |first=Michael |last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban has been fined by the NBA, mostly for critical statements about the league and referees, at least $1.665 million for 13 incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=2098577&amp;page=1 |title=ABCnews: Cuban Slammed with $250,000 Fine |publisher=ABC News |date=June 20, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 30, 2006 interview, Mavericks player [[Dirk Nowitzki]] said about Cuban:&lt;ref name="NowitzkiCriticism"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eddie|last=Sefko|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/070106dnspomavslede.c1dd04.html|title=Dirk to Cuban: Chill out|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=July 1, 2006|accessdate=July 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Cuban said that he matches NBA fines with charitable donations of equal amounts.&lt;ref&gt;''Cuban fined $250,000 for tirade''. The Associated Press. June 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In a nationally publicized incident in 2002, he criticized the league's manager of officials, [[Ed T. Rush]], saying that he "wouldn't be able to manage a [[Dairy Queen]]." Dairy Queen management took offense to Cuban's comments and invited him to manage a Dairy Queen restaurant for a day.

In February 2007, Cuban publicly criticized [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] [[Dwyane Wade]] and declared that he would get fined if he made any comments about what he thought really happened in the [[2006 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/021007dnspodirkwade.1586725.html|title=Nowitzki won't comment on Wade's criticism|first=Tim|last=MacMahon|publisher=Dallas News|date=February 10, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2015|archivedate=December 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201015803/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/021007dnspodirkwade.1586725.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/06/22/i-know-you-are-but-what-am-i/ |title=I know you are, but what am I… |publisher=Blogmaverick.com |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2009, the league fined Cuban $25,000 for yelling at [[Denver Nuggets]] player [[J. R. Smith]] at the end of the first half on a Mavericks-at-Nuggets game played on January 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3839196 |title=NBA fines Mavs owner Cuban $25,000 |publisher=ESPN |date=January 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?pnum=1&amp;bfromind=7408&amp;eeid=6330930&amp;_sitecat=1526&amp;dcatid=0&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ac=1&amp;ck=&amp;ch=sp&amp;rg=blsadstrgt&amp;_lid=332&amp;_lnm=tg+sp+topnews|title=Cuban fined|publisher=att.com|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban was apparently incensed that Smith had thrown an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward [[Antoine Wright (basketball player)|Antoine Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3836664 |title=Cuban may still face punishment for spat |publisher=ESPN |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban offered to match the fine with a donation to a charity of Smith's choosing. Cuban stated that if he doesn't hear from Smith, then he will donate the money to the [[NHL Players' Association]] Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident|Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Suggest removal |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/18/nuggets-report-inauguration-buzz/ |title=Nuggets report: Inauguration buzz: Nuggets |publisher=The Rocky Mountain News |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Cuban made a reference to the Denver Nuggets being "thugs" after a loss to the Nuggets in game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The statement was geared towards the Nuggets and their fans. As he passed [[Kenyon Martin]]'s mother, who was seated near Cuban as he left the arena, he pointed at her and said, "that includes your son." This controversial comment revisited media attention on Cuban yet again. Cuban issued an apology the next day referencing the poor treatment of away fans in arenas around the league. The league issued a statement stating that they would not fine him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3841384|title=Cuban posts donation plans on blog|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2010, Cuban was fined $100,000 for comments he made during a television interview about trying to sign [[LeBron James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Caplan |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5210828 |title=Cuban fined for LeBron James comments |publisher=ESPN |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his history, he was notably silent during the Mavericks' 2011 championship playoff run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Stein |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2011/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=Cubansilence-110606 |title=Cuban stifles self to great effect |publisher=ESPN |date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Cuban's history with [[David Stern]], he believed the [[NBA]] [[Commissioner]] would leave a lasting legacy "of a focus on growth and recognizing that the NBA is in the entertainment business and that it's a global product, not just a local product. Whatever platforms that took us to, he was ready to go. He wasn't protective at all. He was wide open.

On January 18, 2014, Cuban was once again fined $100,000 for confronting referees and using inappropriate language toward them. As with previous fines, Cuban confirmed that he would match the fine with a donation to charity, however, with the condition that he reaches two million followers on his [[Twitter]] account. Cuban also jokingly commented that he could not let Stern leave without a proper farewell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New York AP|title=Mavs' Cuban fined $100K for confronting officials after game|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/01/18/mavs-owner-cuban-fined/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpts|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2015, Cuban said the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] was still not a "respectable franchise" in regards to the botched deal between [[DeAndre Jordan]] and the Mavericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mark Cuban took a huge shot at the Clippers in their first meeting since DeAndre Jordan's controversial free agency fiasco|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-shot-at-clippers-deandre-jordan-free-agency-2015-10|website = Business Insider|accessdate = October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2018, Cuban was fined $600,000 by the NBA for stating that the Dallas Mavericks should "tank for the rest of the season." Commissioner [[Adam Silver]] stated that the fine was "for public statements detrimental to the NBA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mark Cuban fined $600,000 by league for tanking talk|url = http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22532215/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-owner-fined-600000-tanking-comments|website = ESPN|accessdate =

===Major League Baseball===
Cuban has repeatedly expressed interest in owning a [[Major League Baseball]] franchise and has unsuccessfully attempted to purchase at least three franchises. In 2008, he submitted an initial bid of $1.3 billion to buy the [[Chicago Cubs]] and was invited to participate in a second round of bidding along with several other potential ownership groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3503599 |title=Report: Cubs cut number of bids to at least three, including Cuban |publisher=ESPN |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban was not selected to participate in the final bidding process in January 2009. In August 2010, Cuban actively bid to buy the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] with Jeffrey L. Beck. Cuban stopped bids after 1 a.m., having placed bids totaling almost $600 million. He had outbid a competing ownership group led by ex-pitcher and Rangers executive [[Nolan Ryan]], but lost the deal before the Rangers played the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the [[2010 World Series]].

In January 2012, Cuban placed an initial bid for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], but was eliminated before the second round of bidding. Cuban felt that the value of the Dodgers' TV rights deal drove the price of the franchise too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/34631046 |title=Cuban explains losing out on Dodgers |publisher=CBSSports.com |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313025519/http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/34631046 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously said that he would not be interested in buying the franchise at $1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/mlb/feed/2011-04/dodgers-ownership/story/mark-cuban-wont-pay-1-billion-for-dodgers |title=Mark Cuban won't pay $1 billion for Dodgers - MLB - Sporting News |publisher=Aol.sportingnews.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507010626/http://aol.sportingnews.com/mlb/feed/2011-04/dodgers-ownership/story/mark-cuban-wont-pay-1-billion-for-dodgers |archivedate=May 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; telling the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in November 2011 "I don't think the Dodgers franchise is worth twice what the Rangers are worth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/02/sports/la-sp-1102-dodgers-mark-cuban-20111102|title=Cuban offered to buy Dodgers but price was too high|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Bill|last=Shaikin|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the bidding process drew near many speculated that the sale would surpass $1.5 billion, with [[Jon Heyman]] of [[CBS Sports]] reporting via Twitter that at least one bid in the $1–1.5 billion range was placed in the initial round of the bidding process. Ultimately, the Dodgers sold for $2.15 billion to [[Guggenheim Baseball Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-sp-0329-dodgers-magic-20120329,0,5012740.story |title=Magic Johnson-led group is picked as Dodgers' next owner |author1=Bill Shaikin |author2=David Wharton |lastauthoramp=yes |date=March 27, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban also previously expressed interest in becoming a minority owner of the [[New York Mets]] after owner [[Fred Wilpon]] announced in 2011 that he was planning to sell up to a 25% stake in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber |first=Matt |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110203&amp;content_id=16561128&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Mark Cuban would be open to talking about buying share of Mets if approached by the club |publisher=Major League Baseball |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban has wanted to purchase his hometown [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], but was rebuffed by then owner [[Kevin McClatchy]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2216809|title=No thanks: Pirates tell Mavs' Cuban team not for sale|date=November 7, 2005|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[WWE]]'s [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] in 2003, Cuban was involved in a [[Kayfabe|staged]] altercation with ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] and ''Raw'' wrestler [[Randy Orton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003_/articles/1069104275.php |accessdate=August 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028011420/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003_/articles/1069104275.php |archivedate=October 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 2009, Cuban acted as the [[List of WWE Raw guest hosts|guest host]] of ''Raw'', getting revenge on Orton when he was the guest referee in Orton's match against [[Kofi Kingston]], giving Kingston a fast count victory. He then announced that Orton would face Kingston at [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs]]. At the end of the show, Cuban was slammed through a table by the number one contender for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWE Championship]], [[Sheamus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/12159150/upcomingguesthosts |title=WWE website |publisher=Us.wwe.com |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2007, Cuban said that he was in talks with WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] to create a [[mixed martial arts]] company that would compete with [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref name="cubansees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=3017701|title=Cuban sees bright future for MMA|year=2007|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=[[ESPN]]/[[Sherdog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now a [[Bond (finance)|bondholder]] of [[Zuffa]], UFC's parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmapayout.com/2009/07/cuban-now-a-zuffa-bondholder/ |title=Cuban Now a Zuffa Bondholder |publisher=Mmapayout.com |date=July 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban followed up his intentions by organizing "[[HDNet Fights]]", a mixed martial arts promotion which airs exclusively on HDNet and premiered on October 13, 2007 with a card headlined by a fight between [[Erik Paulson]] and Jeff Ford as well as fights featuring veterans [[Drew Fickett]] and [[Justin Eilers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage |first=Greg |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles.asp?n_id=9477 |title=HDNet Fights |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=October 14, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Cuban loaned the newly formed [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] (UFL) $5 million. He did not own a franchise, and he was not involved in day-to-day operations of the league nor of any of its teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5131063 |title=Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban joins ownership group of UFL |publisher=ESPN |date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, he filed a federal lawsuit against the UFL for their failure to repay the loan by the October 6, 2010 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2011/01/mark_cuban_files_federal_suit.php|title=Mark Cuban Files Federal Suit to Get Back His $5 Million Loan to the United Football League|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|first=Robert|last=Wilonsky|date=January 13, 2011|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[jagoff]] [...] Is there any bigger jagoff in the world than Donald Trump?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/mark-cuban-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-226472 |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=July 30, 2016 |first=Rebecca |last=Morin |title=Endorsing Clinton, Mark Cuban calls Trump a 'jagoff' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731130731/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/mark-cuban-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-226472 |archive-date=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Daily Mail]] |title=Pittsburgh native Mark Cuban shows up at Hillary rally to call Donald Trump a 'jagoff' and boast that he was on a reality show that 'kicked The Apprentice's a**' |first=Francesca |last=Chambers |date=July 31, 2016 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3716486/Mark-Cuban-calls-Trump-jagoff-boasts-Shark-Tank-kicked-Apprentice-s-a.html |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731131049/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3716486/Mark-Cuban-calls-Trump-jagoff-boasts-Shark-Tank-kicked-Apprentice-s-a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2016 Cuban met with the then [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Trump's key advisor [[Steve Bannon]], according to reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pramuk|first1=Jacob|title=Trump critic Mark Cuban stays mum on sitdown with Steve Bannon|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/23/trump-critic-mark-cuban-reportedly-has-curious-sitdown-with-steve-bannon.html|accessdate=7 April 2017|agency=CNBC|publisher=NBC Universal|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fallen Patriot Fund===
Cuban started the Fallen Patriot Fund to help families of U.S. military personnel killed or injured during the [[Iraq War]], personally matching the first $1&amp;nbsp;million in contributions with funds from the Mark Cuban Foundation, which is run by his brother [[Brian Cuban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallenpatriotfund.org/4_16_03.html |title=Fallen Patriot Fund website |publisher=Fallenpatriotfund.org |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20101004-Mark-Cuban-s-brother-Brian-is-7863.ece |title=Brian Cuban Profile |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=October 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculation of a presidential run===
In September 2015, Cuban stated in an interview that running for president was "a fun idea to toss around", and that, if he were running in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], he "could beat both [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]]".&lt;ref&gt;Javers, Eamon (September 14, 2015) [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/14/mark-cuban-i-could-beat-trump-and-clinton.html "Mark Cuban: I could beat Trump AND Clinton"], [[MSNBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Severa, Kenny (September 14, 2015) [http://www.latinpost.com/articles/79022/20150914/2016-presidential-election-mark-cuban-beat-donald-trump-hillary-clinton.htm "2016 Presidential Election: Mark Cuban Says He Can Beat Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton"], ''Latin Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted by many media outlets as indication that Cuban was considering running, but he clarified soon afterward that he had no intention to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Michelle (September 14, 2015) [http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/mark-cuban-im-not-running-for-president/ar-AAei6Et?ocid=ansmsnmoney11 "Mark Cuban: I'm not running for president"], [[CNBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Cuban posted on [[Twitter]], "Maybe I'll run for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/mark-cuban-to-run-for-house-speaker-its-possible.html|title=Mark Cuban running for speaker? It's possible|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there was no clear front-runner to replace the outgoing [[John Boehner]]; the Speaker of the House does not have to be a member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Grier|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2015/0925/John-Boehner-exit-Anyone-can-run-for-House-speaker-even-you |title=John Boehner exit: Anyone can run for House speaker, even you |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |publisher=[[Christian Science Publishing Society]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban told ''[[Meet the Press]]'' in May 2016 that he would be open to being Clinton's running mate in the election, though he would seek to alter some of her positions in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/05/20/mark-cuban-absolutely-open-to-being-hillary-clintons-running-mate/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text |title=Mark Cuban "absolutely" open to being Hillary Clinton's running mate |publisher=NBCSports.com |date=May 29, 2016 |first=Sean |last=Highkin |accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, the self-described "fiercely independent" Cuban also said that he would consider running as Republican nominee Trump's running mate after having a meeting with Trump about understanding the issues, Trump's positions on them, and coming up with solutions. Cuban also described Trump as "that friend that you just shake your head at. He's that guy who'd get drunk and fall over all the time, or just says dumb shit all the time, but he's your friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Garofalo|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/13/mark_cuban_dunks_donald_trump_youre_a_goddamn_airhead/|title=Mark Cuban dunks Donald Trump: "You're a goddamn airhead"|work=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=Salon Media Group Inc.|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2016, Cuban appeared on a live segment on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' entitled "Gloves Off: Mark Cuban Edition" in which he mocked Trump, including referencing the Trump companies' multiple bankruptcies and the failed Trump University program, and questioning the size of Trump's actual net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christian|last=Holub|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/21/mark-cuban-stephen-colbert-insult-donald-trump|title=Mark Cuban and Stephen Colbert sling insults at Donald Trump|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2016, interview with NPR's Scott Simon, Cuban effectively positioned himself to support Clinton. He posited that the best strategy to beat Trump was to attack his insecurities, especially that of his intellect. He also added that Trump is the least qualified to be president and is not informed about policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/10/493399762/now-in-hillarys-corner-businessman-mark-cuban-offers-up-debate-tips|title=Now In Hillary's Corner, Businessman Mark Cuban Offers Up Debate Tips|work=[[NPR]]|date=September 10, 2016|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in September 2016, during a post-presidential debate interview, Cuban criticized Trump's characterization that paying the minimum required taxes 'is smart' and criticized Trump for not paying back into the system that allowed him to amass such wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlotte|last=Wilder|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/09/mark-cuban-donald-trump-not-releasing-tax-returns-mavericks-practice-facility|title=Mark Cuban rips into Donald Trump after the debate for saying not paying taxes is smart|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Media|location=Tyson's Corner, Virginia|date=September 27, 2016|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Cuban said that he would "definitely" run for President if he were single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Allan|last=Smith|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/is-mark-cuban-running-for-president-2017-10?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Mark Cuban says if he 'was single' he'd 'definitely be running' for president|work=[[Business Insider|Business Insider UK]]|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|location=San Francisco, California|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the same month, Cuban claimed that if he ran for president in 2020, it would be as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and described himself as "socially a centrist...but very fiscally conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher|last=Brennan|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mark-cuban-run-president-republican-2020-article-1.3582373|title=Mark Cuban would run for president as a Republican in 2020|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=October 23, 2017|accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was also speculated that he could challenge president [[Donald Trump]] in 2020 as a Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-advised-mark-cuban-to-consider-running-in-2020-as-a-democrat&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
In 2003, Cuban founded the Fallen Patriot Fund to help families of U.S. military personnel killed or injured during the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Cuban|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/guide-to-individual-donors/mark-cuban.html|website=Inside Philanthropy|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 Cuban made a $5 million donation to Indiana University at Bloomington for the "Mark Cuban Center for Sports Media and Technology," which will be built inside [[Assembly Hall (Bloomington)|Assembly Hall]], the school's basketball arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beer|first1=Kara|title=Mark Cuban's IU boost|url=http://www.philanthropydaily.com/mark-cubans-iu-boost/|website=Philanthropy Daily|publisher=American Philanthropic, LLC|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual assault complaint ===
In a March 6, 2018 article, ''[[Willamette Week]]'' reported an alleged April 2011 incident between Cuban and a female patron of a Portland, Oregon bar called the Barrel Room. The woman told Portland police that Cuban sexually groped her while she posed for pictures with him. She submitted seven photographs, two of which Portland Police Detective Brendan McGuire referred to as "significant." &lt;ref name="sexual_assault"&gt;{{cite web | first=Nigel | last=Jaquiss|title=In 2011, Portland Police Investigated a Sexual Assault Complaint Against Billionaire Mark Cuban.

'''Meninism''' is term used which has been used to describe various groups, including the [[men's rights movement]], and [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]]. The term is sometimes used sincerely to challenge social issues facing men, and sometimes satirically or semi-satirically as a word-play on [[feminism]]. Members of these groups are known as '''meninists'''.

==History==
The term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]] who opposed [[sexism]] and supported women's right for equality in [[society]], [[politics]] and at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MENININST: MEN SUPPORTING THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/links/men.htm|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=feminist.com|date=8 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kay|first1=Tom Zatar|title=Out if the Box|date=2003|publisher=Xlibris|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=1-4134-1757-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrick-Jones|first1=Amanda|title=Men who Believe in Feminism|date=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-96822-7|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next decade, the term was used on [[social media]] to make jokes which mocked and criticised [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zand|first1=Benjamin|title=#BBCtrending: Feminism v Meninism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25462758|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daubney|first1=Martin|title=Will 2015 be the year of meninism?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11308455/Will-2015-be-the-year-of-meninism.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[BBC]] reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on [[Twitter]], first to share jokes about [[feminism]], but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In 2015, Nolan Feeney of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that those who used meninist hashtags "generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe they’ve been victimised by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place".&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with terms like Meninism

==Meaning==
The term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues which the movement perceives as affecting men, opposition to the perceived oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to the way some perceive that men are victimised by modern-day feminism, and occasionally violence against men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feeney|first1=Nolan|title=This Is What Happens When You Show Off Your 'Meninist' T-Shirt|url=http://time.com/3673614/meninist-meninism-t-shirts-hashtag/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=TIME|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also identify as meninists.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Alison|title=Women disillusioned with feminism are turning to meninism|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/25/women-disillusioned-with-feminism-are-turning-to-meninism-5265103/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Metro|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Daubney]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as [[domestic violence against men]]; [[fathers' rights]] and [[divorce]] issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, [[suicide]] rates, and rates of homelessness.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; According to Radhika Sanghani of ''The Telegraph'', the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to "The Red Pill" forum on [[Reddit]]. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghani|first1=Radhika|title=Feminists v Meninists: The labels we could all afford to ditch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11380282/Feminists-v-Meninists-The-labels-we-could-all-afford-ditch.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abigail James writing for ''Catholic Online'' said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Abigail|title=Feminism takes a sharp hit as men fight back with Meninism|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/family/story.php?id=58102|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Catholic Online|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lin|first=Jie Liang|title=Antifeminism Online: MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)|date=2017|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1xxrxw.9|work=Digital Environments|pages=77–96|series=Ethnographic Perspectives Across Global Online and Offline Spaces|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=9783837634976|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Mintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of ''[[The Independent]]'', the campaign was  part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Victoria|title='Don't blame all men for rape' campaign backfires spectacularly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/blameonenotall-the-meninist-rape-campaign-that-spectacularly-backfired-10278297.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for ''[[The Economic Times]]'' Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and [[International Men's Day]] to sell deodorant, saying "...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhatt|first1=Shephali|title=How meninism campaigns can explain gender inequality against men better|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-26/news/56490134_1_international-men-harsh-agarwal-feminism|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Economic Times|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Rossalyn|title=People Are Wearing Anti-Feminist "Meninist" T-Shirts And The Internet Has Responded Amusingly|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/people-are-wearing-anti-feminist-meninist-t-shirts-and-the-i|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=#Meninist T-Shirts Got a Photoshop Makeover Thanks to Twitter, and It's Glorious|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/59653-meninist-t-shirts-got-a-photoshop-makeover-thanks-to-twitter-and-its-glorious|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Bustle.com]]|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Law and Justice''' in the [[Government of India]] is a cabinet ministry which deals with the management of the legal affairs, legislative activities and administration of justice in India through its three departments namely the ''Legislative Department'' and the ''Department of Legal Affairs'' and ''Department of Justice'' respectively. The Department of Legal Affairs is concerned with advising the various Ministries of the Central Government while the Legislative Department is concerned with drafting of principal legislation for the Central Government. The ministry is headed by a cabinet rank minister appointed by the [[President of India]] on the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of India]].&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt;&lt;ref name="About Us More"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ministry of Law and Justice (More information)|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/more.htm|publisher=Minsitry of Law and Justice|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Law and Justice minister of independent India was [[B. R. Ambedkar]], who served in Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s cabinet during 1947–52. [[Ravi Shankar Prasad]] is the current minister for law and justice in India.

== History ==
Ministry of law and justice is the oldest limb of the government of India dating back to 1833 when the Charter Act 1833 was enacted by the British Parliament when India was under [[British Raj|British control]]. The said Act vested for the first time legislative power in a single authority, namely the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General in Council]]. By virtue of this authority and the authority vested under him under section 22 of the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]] the Governor General in Council enacted laws for the country from 1834 to 1920. After the commencement of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] the legislative power was exercised by the Indian Legislature constituted thereunder. The Government of India Act 1919 was followed by the [[Government of India Act 1935]]. With the passing of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] India became a 'dominion' and the 'dominion legislature' made laws from 1947 to 1949 under the provisions of section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935 as adapted by the [[Interim Government of India|India (Provisional Constitution) Order 1947]]. When the [[Constitution of India]] came into force on 26 January 1950, the legislative power thereafter got vested in the [[Parliament of India|Indian parliament]].&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt;

The CBDT is a statutory authority functioning under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963.It is India's official FATF unit.The Central Board of Revenue as the Department apex body charged with the administration of taxes came into existence as a result of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. Initially the Board was in charge of both direct and indirect taxes. However, when the administration of taxes became too unwieldy for one Board to handle, the Board was split up into two, namely the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Central Board of Excise and Customs with effect from 1.1.1964. This bifurcation was brought about by constitution of the two Boards u/s 3 of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963.

The '''National Judicial Examination''' or '''State Judicial Examination''' ({{zh|c=国家司法考试}}) is a unified legal examination administered by the [[People's Republic of China]] for people who work in the legal industry. This Examination is widely acknowledged as arguably the most difficult Examination in China and perhaps in the world ("天下第一考"). Unlike Judicial Examinations of most other countries in the world, candidates sit the Examinations of 17 subjects all at the same time. Thus, it requires a very high memory power and equally high ability of making swift analysis for difficult cases (each question is actually a case).  

Since 2002, all new members of the judiciary and legal profession will need to pass it. The SJE will push education programs for lawyers and judges to adopt more unified curricula and standards. It is also expected to increase the professionalism of the judiciary, which has been regarded as lacking.

In the past, there were different kinds of legal professional exams that were administered by different institutions: some by the courts for judges only, some by the procuratorates for prosecutors only, and the Lawyers Qualifications Exam (LQE) administered by the [[Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Justice]] for those who wanted to become practicing lawyers. The exams for judges and prosecutors were internal, not open to the public. 

== Requirements ==

Under amendments to the ''Judges Law'', ''Prosecutors Law'' and the ''Lawyers Law'' in 2001, all participants of the SJE must have a university-level education, although not necessarily in law. The only exception was the 2002 SJE, where over 50% of participants only had a college-level law diploma. These people were allowed to sit the exam with special permission from the [[Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Justice]]. Another requirement is that the person must have a record of good behaviour. Those caught cheating will be issued a ban for either two years or for life.

On March 30-31, 2002, China held the first SJE. Of the 360,000 participants, about one-third were staff members of the courts, procuratorates, police departments, and other workers in the field of law and justice. Only 7% of the participants passed the exam, but this result was considered reasonable in comparison with rates in judicial exams in [[Japan]].

The number of participants decreased significantly in 2003 to 197,000 people, due to stricter education requirements. Nearly 89% of candidates received at least four years of university education, while 74% majored in law. The only exceptions are for remote counties lacking in advanced education facilities. 

In 2004, residents of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were permitted to sit for the exam for the first time. More than 400 in Hong Kong have applied.

== Structure ==

The SJE is a closed book exam mainly designed to test the legal knowledge of the tested persons and their ability to join the legal profession. Questions are divided into four categories: 
*theoretical legal science
*applied legal science
*provisions in current laws
*legal practice and ethics

Candidates are tested on their knowledge of [[legal theory]], [[economic law]], [[international law]], [[international private law]] and international economic law as well as ethics.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}
'''Non-judicial punishment''' (or '''NJP''') is any form of punishment that may be applied to individual [[military personnel]], without a need for a [[court martial]] or [[military justice|similar proceedings]].

==United States==
In the [[United States Armed Forces]], non-judicial punishment is a form of [[military justice]] authorized by Article 15 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. NJP permits commanders to administratively discipline troops without a [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]]. Punishment can range from reprimand to reduction in rank, correctional custody, confinement on bread and water/diminished rations (aboard ships only), loss of pay, extra duty, and/or restrictions. The receipt of non-judicial punishment does not constitute a criminal conviction (it is equivalent to a civil action), but is often placed in the service record of the individual. The process for non-judicial punishment is governed by Part V of the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]] and by each service branch's regulations.

Non-judicial punishment proceedings are known by different terms among the services. In the [[United States Army|Army]] and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], non-judicial punishment is referred to as '''Article 15'''; in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] it is called being "NJP'd," being sent to "Office Hours," or satirically amongst the junior ranks, "Ninja Punched." The [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] call non-judicial punishment '''captain's [[Mast (naval)|mast]]''' or '''admiral's mast''', depending on the rank of the [[commanding officer]].

===Hearing===
Prior to imposition of NJP, the commander will notify the accused of the commander's intention to impose punishment, the nature of the misconduct alleged, supporting evidence, and a statement of the accused's rights under the UCMJ. All service members, except those embarked or attached to a vessel currently away from its homeport, have a right to refuse NJP and request a court-martial. If the accused does not accept the NJP, the NJP hearing is terminated and the commander must make the decision of whether to process the service member for court-martial. If the accused accepts NJP, he or she, plus a representative if desired, will attend the hearing conducted by the commander. The accused may present evidence and witnesses to the commander. The commander must consider any information offered during the hearing, and must be personally convinced that the service member committed misconduct before imposing punishment.

===Punishments===
Maximum penalties depend on the [[Military rank|rank]] of the accused and that of the officer imposing punishment:

====For officers accused of misconduct====
'''If the officer imposing punishment holds [[Courts-martial in the United States#General Court-Martial|General Court Martial]] authority, or if the commanding officer is of the grade O-7 or greater'''
* Arrest in quarters: not more than 30 days
* Restriction to limits: not more than 60 days
* Forfeiture of pay: not more than ½ of one month's base pay for two months (base pay does not include allowances or special pay)
* Admonition or reprimand

'''By Commanding Officers of the grades O-4 to O-6'''
* Restriction to limits: not more than 30 days
* Admonition or reprimand

'''By Commanding Officers of the grades O-1 to O-3'''
* Restriction to limits: not more than 15 days
* Admonition or reprimand

'''By Officers In Charge''' (OIC)
* No NJP authority over officers

====For enlisted members accused of misconduct====
There are three types of non-judicial punishment commonly imposed.

'''Summary Article 15: commanders (O-3 and below) and commissioned OIC may impose:'''
* Restriction to specific limits (normally work, barracks, place of worship, mess hall, and medical facilities) for not more than 14 days
* Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 14 days
* Restriction with extra duties for not more than 14 days

'''Company Grade (O-3 or below) commanders may impose the above plus:'''
* Correctional Custody for not more than 7 days (only if accused is in the grades E-3 and below)
* Forfeiture of 7 days base pay
* Reduction by one grade, if original rank in promotion authority of imposing officer (USA/USAF E-4 and below.)
* Confinement on diminished rations or bread and water for not more than 3 days (USN/USMC E-3 and below only, and only when embarked on a vessel). (Per a 1995 amendment to NAVSO P-6064, Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States (2000 edition), Appendix 1, Rule 1003, punishment of confinement on bread and water or diminished rations is not authorized as a punishment by a court-martial.&lt;ref name="15102ConfinementonBreadandWater"&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/correctionprograms/corrections/Documents/15102ConfinementonBreadandWater.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Admonition or reprimand, either written or verbal

'''Field Grade (O-4 to O-6) may impose:'''
* Restriction for not more than 60 days
* Extra duties for not more than 45 days
* Restriction with extra duties for not more than 45 days
* Correctional Custody for not more than 30 days (only if accused is in the grades E-3 and below)
* Forfeiture of ½ of base pay for two months
* Reduction by one grade if (USA/USAF E-6 or E-5; USMC E-5 or below; USN E-6 or below); or reduction to E-1 (USA/USAF E-4 to E-2)
* Confinement on diminished rations or bread and water for not more than 3 days (USN/USMC E-3 and below only, and only when embarked on a vessel.) (A 1995 amendment to NAVSO P-6064, Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States (2000 edition), Appendix 1, Rule 1003, punishment of confinement on bread and water or diminished rations is not authorized as a punishment imposable by a court-martial.&lt;ref name="15102ConfinementonBreadandWater"/&gt;)
* Admonition or reprimand, either written or verbal

The punishments listed above may be combined (with certain limitations listed in the Manual for Courts-Martial, Part 5, Section 5(d)). For example, extra duties, restriction and forfeiture of pay, and reduction in grade could be imposed.

If the member considers the punishment to be unjust or to be disproportionate to the misconduct committed, he or she may appeal the NJP to a higher authority. This is usually the next officer in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. Upon considering the appeal, the higher authority may set aside the NJP, decrease the severity of the punishment, or may deny the appeal. They may not increase the severity of the punishment.

Personnel are permitted to refuse NJP in favor of a court-martial; this might be done in cases where they do not feel their Commanding Officer will give them a fair hearing. But this option exposes them to a possible criminal court conviction. Navy and Marine Corps personnel assigned to or embarked aboard ship do not have the option of refusing NJP, nor can they appeal the decision of the officer imposing punishment; they may only appeal the severity of the punishment.

==Mast==
In naval tradition, '''mast''' is the traditional location of the non-judicial hearing under which a [[commanding officer]] studies and disposes of cases involving those in his command. 

If the individual conducting the proceeding is either a [[Captain (naval)|captain]], or a lower ranking officer (typically a [[commander]] or [[lieutenant commander]]) serving as [[commanding officer]] of a naval or coast guard vessel, an aviation squadron, or similar command afloat or ashore, then the proceeding is referred to as a '''captain's mast'''. 

If an [[admiral]] is overseeing the mast, then the procedure is referred to as an '''admiral's mast''' or a '''flag mast'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/21/admiral.convicted/|title=Navy: Admiral seeks retirement in lying case | work=CNN | date=2008-04-21 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A captain's mast or admiral's mast is a procedure whereby the commanding officer must:
* Make inquiry into the facts surrounding minor offenses allegedly committed by a member of the command;
* Afford the accused a hearing as to such offenses; and
* Dispose of such charges by dismissing the charges, imposing punishment under the provisions of [[military law]] or referring the case to a [[court-martial]].

A captain's mast is not:
* A trial, as the term "non-judicial" implies;
* A conviction, even if punishment is imposed;
* An acquittal, even if punishment is not imposed.

In the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard]], these proceedings take place under the authority of Article 15 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] ([[UCMJ]]).

The term ''mast'' may also refer to when a captain or commanding officer makes him/herself available to hear concerns, complaints, or requests from the crew. Traditionally, on a naval vessel, the captain would stand at the main mast of that vessel when holding ''mast.'' The crew, who by custom did not speak with the captain, could speak to him directly at these times. It could also refer to the naval punishment of tying one to a mast and lashing them with a whip.

In modern times, a '''meritorious mast''' refers to the commanding officer taking this time to single out a member of the crew for praise and present written recognition of work well done.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.netc.navy.mil/_documents/NSTCInstructions/doc77134.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4839">A '''performance bond''', also known as a '''contract bond''', is a [[surety bond]] issued by an [[insurance]] company or a [[bank]] to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a [[independent contractor|contractor]]. The term is also used to denote a collateral deposit of [[Earnest payment|good faith money]], intended to secure a [[futures contract]], commonly known as [[Margin (finance)|margin]].

==History==
Performance bonds have been around since 2,750 BC. The Romans developed laws of surety around 150 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surety bonds for construction contracts|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey Burton|publisher=ASCE Press|year=2000|isbn=0-7844-0426-7|location=Reston, Va.|pages=9|coauthors=|authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; the principles of which still exist.

==Overview==

A job requiring a payment and performance bond will usually require a bid bond, to bid the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-bid-bond-844376|title=What Happens if the Construction Bond Obligation is Not Met?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the job is awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion. For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued in favour of a client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the [[contract]] (most often due to the [[bankruptcy]] of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond.

Performance bonds are commonly used in the construction and development of real property, where an owner or investor may require the developer to assure that contractors or project managers procure such bonds in order to guarantee that the value of the work will not be lost in the case of an unfortunate event (such as insolvency of the contractor).  In other cases, a performance bond may be requested to be issued in other large contracts besides civil construction projects. Another example of this use is in commodity contracts where the seller is asked to provide a Bond to reassure the buyer that if the commodity being sold is not in fact delivered (for whatever reason) the buyer will at least receive compensation for his lost costs.

Performance bonds are generally issued as part of a 'Performance and Payment Bond', where a payment bond guarantees that the contractor will pay the labour and material costs they are obliged to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-payment-bonds-work-on-construction-projects-844794|title=Why You Need a Payment Bond for a Construction Project|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance bond cost===
Surety bond companies calculate the premium they charge for surety bonds based on three primary criteria: bond type, bond amount, and the applicant's risk. Once the bond type, amount, and applicant risk are adequately assessed, a surety bond underwriter is able to assign an appropriate surety bond price.

===Bond type===
Surety bond companies have actuarial information on the lifetime claims history for each bond type. Over time, surety bond underwriters are able to determine that some surety bonds are more risky than others. For example, a California Motor Vehicle Dealer bond has significantly more claims than a straightforward notary bond. If a given surety bond type has paid out a high percentage of claims, then the premium amount paid by applicants will be higher.

===Applicant's history/risk===
Surety bond companies attempt to predict the risk that an applicant represents. Those who are perceived to be a higher risk will pay a higher surety bond premium.  Since surety bond companies are providing a financial guarantee on the future work performance of those who are bonded, they must have a clear picture of the individual's history.

==In the United States==
In the United States, under the [[Miller Act]] of 1932, all Construction Contracts issued by the Federal Government must be backed by performance and payment bonds. States have enacted what is referred to as "[[Little Miller Act]]" statutes requiring performance and payment bonds on State Funded projects as well.

There are over 25,000 types of Surety Bonds in the United States. Each bond has a designated bond amount. Surety bond companies will determine bond rate based on risk and then charge a surety bond premium in the range 1-15% of the bond amount.

A '''private copying levy''' (also known as '''blank media tax''' or '''levy''') is a [[government]]-mandated scheme in which a special [[tax]] or [[Tax|levy]] (additional to any general [[sales tax]]) is charged on purchases of [[recordable media|recordable media]]. Such taxes are in place in various countries and the income is typically allocated to the developers of "content". (A distinction is sometimes made between "tax" and "levy" based on the recipient of the accumulated funds; taxes are received by a government, while levies are received by a private body, such as a [[copyright collective]].)

Levy system may operate in principle as a system of [[collectivisation]], partially replacing a [[property]] approach of sale of individual units.

==History==

Such levies were first introduced in Germany in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[WIPO]], [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/copyright/1037/wipo_pub_1037_2013.pdf International Survey on Private Copying - Law &amp; Practice 2013] (23rd ed.) p.4: "A levy was first introduced in Germany in 1966."&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[audio cassette]], legislators were persuaded that cassette recorders would decimate sales of records as friend after friend would then make copies of only one purchased album. Levies today are assessed on recordable compact discs, a form of media that did not exist when levies were first conceived. Although the bulk of unrecorded compact discs are actually used in the computing industry, they are still "taxed" to provide a revenue stream to the recording industry.

Levies are often considered a compensation for illegal [[file sharing]]. This is debatable, however: levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines, but rather, only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions. A notable exception in Europe is the UK, that does not allow private copies. But generally legislators allow private copies for two reasons: firstly, because otherwise the enforcement would be unfeasible for private reasons, and secondly because the administrative burden would be disproportional.

=== [[European Union]] review ===

On 2015-07-09 the [[European Parliament]] approved a non-binding resolution ([[Reda Report]]) asking a review of the levy in the [[European Union]], building on previous resolutions and studies.

==Questions on fairness==
A difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered "fair" by all copyright holders and consumers. Implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of [[Compact disc|CD]]s in music shops or amount of air-play on [[radio]] or the like. This ignores other distribution channels such as the [[Internet]], and it disproportionally benefits popular artists and publishers of the related products. Fairer methods would arguably involve extensive [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] of purchasers to determine actual recording behaviour, or alternatively paying all musicians at a simple flat-rate (the preferred method will depend on one's [[political]] views).

While the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors, some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes. In Germany this is even required by law. It acknowledges the purpose of cultural diversity - which is not necessarily identical to free market effects. This funding is usually executed by the same entities (collecting societies) that distribute the levy money to individual authors. One may question however whether these entities are properly qualified to make culture policy.

Levy systems assume that all authors want to exploit their work for money. However this is not always true, especially on the internet. Many authors do not write to entertain, but to inform readers, listeners and viewers. Often their purpose is to reach the widest possible audience rather than make the maximum profit from the copyrighted work by itself. The discrepancy between reality and the assumption underlying a levy system is growing as "web 2.0" matures, with pervasive user-supplied content, from Wikipedia to YouTube.{{original research inline|date=March 2013}}

A further problem is to find a proper tariff base for levies. Conceivably the levy may be a percentage of storage media sales price (e.g. 3% in the US). The implication of such a scheme is however that the author gets ever less as technology proceeds and becomes less expensive. But a price based on units of information (bits, or megabits) is not fair either, as for instance a DVD can be used to store a film, a computer game, a large amount of documents, or measurement data. The cost of producing a certain amount of bits widely varies by type of information. Measurement data is even not copyrighted at all. Yet in today's world of converging technology, storage media can be used for a wide range of purposes.

An implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as [[music]]. If it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes. The options include:

* Collecting the tax on all media, regardless of the end use, and ignoring the injustice to purchasers with non-covered uses.
* Allowing taxed and untaxed media to be sold, but with only the taxed media providing the copyright-relaxation benefits.
* Collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses.

Contrary Fairness arguments
* Although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies, there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made.
* With respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy. In countries that do not have the levy, many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted. This is the similar argument that non-proponents to the levy system use to show fault. They advocate that if the levy cannot be precisely applied to the people that are private copying, it is a faulty system. Likewise, if one cannot reprimand all people that are copying illegally and not compensating the music industry, this is also a faulty system. One system over subscribes, the other undersubscribes, both have faults.
* Finally, those countries that do not have private copying laws are in fact making many of their citizens criminals. A law which makes potentially more than 50% of the population criminals does not seem to be a fair business practice. Lawyers rather than artists may well be the greatest beneficiaries in non-private copying countries. This argument assumes that private copying can only be allowed with a levy.

==Legal effects==
It is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of [[copyright]] law, by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid. However, there is little evidence to support this theory. On the contrary, lobbyists representing publishers and copyright holders have increased pressures to implement more restrictive laws, even on countries that have implemented private copying levy. In 2007, it was reported that International Intellectual Property Alliance put 23 of the world's 30 most populous countries into Priority Watch List, even though the United States, which was not in the list, has laws that are more liberal than the laws from the countries within the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1679/1  |title=In Good Company |date=February 14, 2007 |publisher=[[Michael Geist]] |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when restricting levy system to devices that primarily play music, this itself creates loopholes that prevents collecting levies from cellphones, PDAs, and other all-in-one portable electronic devices. As a result, copyright holders will have to rely on even more laws to collect levy, and to increase rates of already levied product to recover perceived losses, which run against the political trends toward eliminating levy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1708/159/ |title=Recording Industry's Digital Strategy Out of Tune |date=February 19, 2007 |publisher=Michael Geist |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Examples of countries operating such schemes:

===Australia===

Australia has a public levy on [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]]. The legislation establishing the levy was passed in 1989, challenged in the High Court of Australia in ''[[Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v Commonwealth]]''. The court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose.

===Belgium===
In Belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to "Auvibel", which is in charge of distributing the funds. As of 1 February 2010, these fees are applicable for the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/2009/12/23_1.pdf |title=Belgian Official Journal p55-57|date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

A blank media levy was introduced in [[Canada]] in 1997, by the addition of Part VIII, "Private Copying", to the [[Copyright law in Canada|Canadian Copyright Act]]. The power to set rates and to set the distribution allocation is vested in the [[Copyright Board of Canada]]. The Copyright Board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the [[Canadian Private Copying Collective]], which is a non-profit private organization.

In Canada:

* The levy applies to "blank audio recording media", such as [[CD-R]]s.
* The levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within Canada (and typically passed on to the retailer, and passed on to the purchaser).
* With the exception of the zero-rating exemption, the levy is collected regardless of the purchaser's end use of the media.
* The private copying levy, less CPCC operating costs, is distributed as per the Copyright Board's allocation as: 58.2% to eligible authors and publishers, 23.8% to eligible performers and 18.0% to eligible record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Canadian Private Copying Collective has developed a methodology by which the proceeds are distributed to rights holders based on commercial radio airplay and commercial sales samples, ignoring radio/college airplay and independent record sales not logged by Soundscan. This methodology has been criticised as favouring major-label artists at the expense of the [[long-tail]]. As of September 7, 2007 over one hundred million dollars has been distributed.
* In conjunction with the levy, the Copyright Act allows individuals to make copies of sound recordings for their own private, non-commercial use. They may not distribute the copy.
* In 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal overruled a 2003 Copyright Board decision which had applied the blank media levy to [[MP3]] players such as [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPod]], on the basis that such devices did not qualify as "audio recording medium" as per the Copyright Act definition.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Canadian Storage Media Alliance'' [2005] 2 F.C.R. 654&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this, the proposed rates were [[Canadian dollar|$]]2 for players with less than 1 [[gigabyte|GB]] of capacity, $15 for players up to 15 GB, and $25 for players 15 GB and over.
*On February 12, 2007, CPCC asked the Copyright Board of Canada to reintroduce the levy of $5 to $75, this time onto the memory component of the digital audio recorders (such as MP3 players) in Canada.[https://www.engadget.com/2007/02/12/mp3-player-levy-could-be-reinstated-in-canada/] In addition, CPCC also proposed levies of $2 to $10 for memory cards (since withdrawn), 8 cent increases to CD, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio and MiniDiscs.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070222032623/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/story.html?id=cccd9ce1-5279-4145-9874-a179b5be067f&amp;k=26495]  Certain parties objected to this tariff based on the 2005 Federal Court of Appeal precedent and brought a preliminary motion before the Copyright Board that would have prevented that part of the tariff application from being considered. The Copyright Board dismissed this preliminary motion in July 2007.
*In September 2007, an application for judicial review was brought before the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] to appeal the Copyright Board's dismissal. On October 26, 2007, the court granted the Canadian Recording Industry Association's request to intervene in the private copying/iPod levy judicial review.[http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2334/125/] Some argue that CRIA wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy, given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy, possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not.[http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2238/125/]
*In January 2008, the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] overturned the Copyright Board's July 2007 decision, stating that its previous ruling in the 2005 ''Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Canadian Storage Media Alliance'' case is dispositive authority for the proposition that "the Copyright Board has no legal authority to certify a tariff on digital audio recorders or on the memory permanently embedded in digital audio recorders."[http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2008/01/11/levy-recorders.html]&lt;ref&gt;''Apple Canada Inc. v. Canadian Private Copying Collective'' [2008] F.C.J. No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's current private copying levies are as follows: $0.29 per unit for CD-R, CD-RW, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Finland===
Finland had a blank media levy 1984-2015. From 2015 on the funds come directly from the state budget.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1961/19610404#L2aP26a Tekijänoikeuslaki, 26 a §] {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of beginning of 2012, the fees were (in [[Euro]]s):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyvitysmaksu.fi/fin/hinnasto.html Teosto r.y.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* €0.005/min for analog audio tapes (e.g. €0.30 for a 60-minute cassette)
* €0.0076/min for analog video tapes (e.g. €1.37 for an E180 tape)
* €0.20 per disk for [[CD]] and [[MiniDisc]] (capacity: up to 1 GB)
* €0.60 per disk for [[DVD]], [[DVD-RAM]], [[DVD-R DL]] and [[DVD+R DL]] (capacity: from 1 GB to 10 GB)
* €1.20 per disk for [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]] (capacity: over 10 GB to 25 GB)
* €1.80 per disk for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD (capacity: over 25 GB)

** €9, over 50 GB to 250 GB
** €12, over 250 GB to 1 TB
** €18, over 1TB to 3 TB
** smaller and bigger drives have no levies

There was no levy fee on mobile phones, computers, memory cards, game consoles, [[USB flash drive]]s and {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} CDs/DVDs. [[VAT]] of 9% is added to the levies.

===Germany===

The world's first private copying system was created in Germany in 1965. It was a result of earlier successful litigation by [[GEMA (Germany)|GEMA]] against an audio equipment manufacturer in [[GEMA v. Grundig]].

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg is the only EU member state on the continent without a private copying levy,&lt;ref&gt;The other four EU member states lacking a private copying levy are Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom. Greece has a private copying levy scheme in place, but does currently not enforce it.&lt;/ref&gt; making it a popular "copying levy haven" for blank media buyers from countries such as France and Germany.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands a fee is charged on blank media which is passed on to "Stichting Thuiskopie" (Foundation Homecopy), which is in charge of distributing the funds. Fees for February 17, 2007 until January 1, 2010 are as follows;
* Data CD-R/RW: €0.14 per disc
* Audio CD-R/RW: €0.42 per hour (€0.52 per 74 minutes)
* Blank DVD-R/RW: €0.60 per 4.7 gigabyte
* Blank DVD+R/RW: €0.40 per 4.7 gigabyte
* Blank DVD-RAM: exempt
* Video analog (video tapes): €0.33 per hour
* Audio analog (cassette tapes)	 €0.23 per hour
* MiniDisc: €0.32 per hour
* HI-MD: €1.10 per carrier

===Portugal===

Portugal established a levy on cds and DVDs in 1998.

===Russian Federation===
Article 1245 of Civil Code of Russian Federation "Remuneration for free reproduction of phonograms and audiovisual products for private purposes" ("Вознаграждение за свободное воспроизведение фонограмм и аудиовизуальных произведений в личных целях") mandates a fee, which is to be distributed in the following proportion: 40% to the authors, 30% to the singers, 30% to the manufacturers of the media. In practice, this fee had not been charged until after the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110317150147/http://www.government.ru/gov/results/12613/ Regulation of the Government of Russian Federation 829] from October 14, 2010, which mandated a uniform 1% tax on computers, blank optical disks, memory sticks, TVs, video and audio recorders, radios, mobile phones, etc. The controversial decision of the government to award the collected funds to the [[:ru:Российский союз правообладателей|Russian Union of Rights-Holders]] for further distribution was criticized by the public and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/rolling_news/2011/03/110326_rn_mikhalkov_accreditation.shtml disputed in a lawsuit].

===Sweden===
In Sweden there is a fee called "privatkopieringsersättning" (private copy remuneration) earlier called "kassettersättning" (cassette tape remuneration) on compact cassettes, blank CDs, blank minidiscs and other storage media. As of September 1, 2011, this fee will also apply to external hard drives and other USB storage. The fee is 2.5 öre (0.025 SEK) per minute of storage for analog media or 0.4 öre per MB for re-recordable media or 0.25 öre per MB for write once media.{{clarify|These fees are maximum fees as defined in law. As a result of other features of that law, the current fees are much lower, as explained in the article on Swedish Wikipedia.|date=April 2011}} The money collected (224436151 SEK as of 2005) is handled by [[Copyswede]].

===United States===

====Audio home recording in general====
{{usc|17|1008}}, as legislated by the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992, says that non-commercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings is not copyright infringement. Non-commercial includes such things as resale not in the course of business, perhaps of normal use working copies which are no longer wanted. It is unlikely to include resale of copies in bulk; [[Napster]] tried to use the Section 1008 defense but was rejected because it was a business.

From House Report No. 102-873(I), September 17, 1992: "In the case of home taping, the [Section 1008] exemption protects all noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings" .

From House Report No. 102-780(I), August 4, 1992: "In short, the reported legislation [Section 1008] would clearly establish that consumers cannot be sued for making analog or digital audio copies for private noncommercial use".

The United States music industry{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} administers the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] and foreign hometaping royalties for artists on US sound recordings as well as US record labels. These royalties are administered by The [[Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies]] for featured artists and copyright owners, [[ASCAP]]/[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]/[[SESAC]] for writers, [[Harry Fox Agency]] for publishers, and The AFM/AFTRA Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund (Joint venture of [[American Federation of Musicians|AFM]] and [[AFTRA]] ) for non-featured artists. All societies also collect foreign remuneration for their respective funds.

{{usc|17|1008}} bars copyright infringement action and {{usc|17|1003}} provides for a royalty of 2% of the initial transfer price for devices and 3% for media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/forms/formdart-q.pdf|title=Quartery Statement of Account}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royalty rate in {{usc|17|1004}} was established by the [[Fairness in Music Licensing Act]] of 1998. This only applies to CDs which are labeled and sold for music use; they do not apply to blank computer CDs, even though they can be (and often are) used to record or "burn" music from the computer to CD. The royalty also applies to stand-alone CD recorders, but not to CD burners used with computers. Most recently, portable satellite radio recording devices contribute to this royalty fund.

Thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the [[Rio PMP300]] player, most [[MP3 player]]s are deemed "computer peripherals" and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the U.S.

Currently, private copy royalties are generated in the US by the sale of "blank CDs and personal audio devices, media centers, satellite radio devices, and car audio systems that have recording capabilities."&lt;ref&gt;http://wp.aarcroyalties.com/what-is-aarc/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Currently there is no proper private copy exception in the United Kingdom, there is only a narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting (s70(1) of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] (CDPA)).

On 1 June 2014, the UK implemented art. 5(2)b of the Infosoc Directive via the Copyright and Rights in Performance (Personal Copies for Private Use) Regulations 2014. This provided an exception limited to the personal use, to the owners of a personal copy and with the exclusion of indirectly commercial uses. It did not provide for compensation. The UK Government's view was that [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140603093549/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/response-2011-copyright-final.pdf "levies or other compensation are neither required nor desirable in the context of a narrow provision that causes minimal harm. Levies are an unnecessary and inefficient tax on consumers. They are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device (for example a hard disk) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device. Furthermore, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not right to extract more money from the pockets of hard pressed consumers.”]. The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), the Musicians' Union, and UK Music challenged the introduction of these regulations, and brought an application for judicial review. Their application succeeded when, in June 2015, the High Court ruled that the regulations were unlawful because of a flawed impact assessment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/1723.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional services networks''' are [[Business networking|networks]] of independent firms who come together to cost-effectively provide services to clients through an organized framework.&lt;ref&gt;Networks and Organizations, N. Nohria and R.G. Eccles, Harvard Business School Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; They are principally found in law and accounting. They may also be found in investment banking, insurance, real estate and architectural services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mergers.net/ M&amp;A International]&lt;/ref&gt; Any profession that operates locally, but has clients in multiple locations, are potential members of a network. This entry focuses on accounting, legal, multidisciplinary and specialty practice networks. Today members of these networks employ more than one million professionals and staff and have cumulative annual revenues that exceed $200 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/feature/1809718/international-networks-survey-chill|International Accounting Networks – The Big Chill] Accountancy Age, May 27, 2010, 11. Loxton, Liz, Accountancy Magazine, June 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/statistics.php#sotflf/ Harvard Law School Center on the Legal Profession]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[accounting networks and associations]] developed first to meet the requirement of the SEC of public company audits. They include the well-known accounting networks like [[PwC]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[KPMG]] (also known as the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 4 Audit Firms]]) as well as more than 30 other accounting networks and associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/1776670/top-accounting-networks-associations-2009 Accountancy Age – 35 Accounting Networks and Associations June 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly structured entities.

The [[law firm network]] developed in the late 1980s. They include [[law firm network|legal]] and [[multidisciplinary professional services networks|law firm based multidisciplinary networks]] like [[Lex Mundi]], [[World Services Group]], IR Global (IR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal 500 |url=http://www.legal500.com/assets/pages/networks/international-referral/about.html |website=Legal 500 |publisher=Legal 500 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TerraLex, [[Meritas (law)|Meritas]], and the State Capital Group.

There are more than 175 known networks in law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersandpartners.com/pdfs/LegalNetworks-Global2011.pdf Chambers and Partners]&lt;/ref&gt; 40 in accounting, and 20 specialty networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hg.org/largest-law-and-accounting-networks.html" 60 Largest Legal and Accounting Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual networks have revenues exceeding $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/IMG/627/179627/top35-networks-2011-table-1.jpg/ Accounting Age] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002150003/http://www.accountancyage.com/IMG/627/179627/top35-networks-2011-table-1.jpg |date=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognizing a network – the disclaimer ==

Every network from [[accounting networks and associations|accounting networks]] like [[PwC]]&lt;ref&gt;“PricewaterhouseCoopers" and "PwC" refer to the network of member firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwCIL). Each member firm is a separate legal entity and does not act as agent of PwCIL or any other member firm. PwCIL does not provide any services to clients. PwCIL is not responsible or liable for the acts or omissions of any of its member firms nor can it control the exercise of their professional judgment or bind them in any way. No member firm is responsible or liable for the acts or omissions of any other member firm nor can it control the exercise of another member firm's professional judgment or bind another member firm or PwCIL in any way."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[KPMG]]&lt;ref&gt;"International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), is a Swiss entity. Member firms of the KPMG network of independent firms are affiliated with KPMG International. KPMG International provides no client services. No member firm has any authority to obligate or bind KPMG International or any other member firm third parties, nor does KPMG International have any such authority to obligate or bind any member firm."&lt;/ref&gt; to [[law firm network]]s like [[Lex Mundi]]&lt;ref&gt;Lex Mundi members are not affiliated in the joint practice of law; each member firm is an independent law firm and renders professional services on an individual and separate basis.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Multilaw]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Multilaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}, and [[multidisciplinary professional services networks|multidisciplinary networks]] like [[World Services Group| World Services Group(WSG)]]&lt;ref&gt;WSG's members are independent firms and are not affiliated in the joint practice of professional services. Each member exercises its own individual judgments on all client matters&lt;/ref&gt; uses a “network disclaimer.” A network disclaimer states that the network members are independent firms that do not practice jointly and are not responsible for the negligence of each other. It further states that generally the network does not practice a profession or otherwise provide services to clients of the network’s members. This independence is the foundation of both network operations and governance.

== Why a network rather than a company ==

One of the major factors influencing the need for networks is the [[globalization]] of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Baskerville, Hat [https://eric-dev.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/29637 “Globalization of professional accounting: The Big 8 entering New Zealand”] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223081205/https://eric-dev.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/29637 |date=2012-12-23 }}, (June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Supply and demand are no longer local but global. The price of commodities is affected by the weather halfway across the world or by demand in developing countries. Production takes place wherever the assets and human resources can most effectively deploy. Professional services providers must be able to reach out globally to represent their clients everywhere in the world. Networks are the practical and cost-effective method to accomplish these objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sheth, Jagdish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54939452/Strategic-Importance-of-Information-Technology|title= Strategic Importance of Information Technology|journal= Advances in Telecommunications Management|volume =4|pages= 3–16|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of networks have access to other members who understand the local economic, legal and political factors.

From a theoretical point of view, networks are an effective model and a powerful system of enhancing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perera, H.A. Rahman and S. Cahan|year= 2003 |title=Globalization and the Major Accounting Firms|journal= Australian Accounting Review |volume=13|issue=1|pages= 27–37|doi=10.1111/j.1835-2561.2003.tb00217.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members and the networks are different parts of the resource equation for providing members seamless, high quality, reliable, local and global services. There is no real limit of what can be accomplished through a network when the network and its membership work in combination with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Freidheim, The Trillion Dollar Corporation How the Alliance Revolution Will Transform Global Business, Perseus Books (1999) {{ISBN|1841120308}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration is at the heart of the network.
			
Networks do not practice a profession or provide the services that their members provide to their clients. Networks do not provide accounting or legal services.  They operate for the benefit of the members by supporting their operations. The network can combine the resources of the individual members without risking the loss of their personal identities or financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ring, P.S. and A.H. Van de Ven|title= Structuring Cooperative Relationships Between Organizations|doi=10.1002/smj.4250130702|journal= Strategic Management Journal|year= 1992|volume= 13|pages= 483–498|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network is more than a support organization or collaborative framework in which the members can meet clients’ needs. It is an entity that has a common corporate identity or brand. The network name can represent a standard that is required of all its members. The logo and [[brand]] are owned by the network, not the members. Membership can create a global corporate identity. The objective of this identity is network participation that will translate into business for the individual independent members.

For a company to internally develop a global and local presence would take decades and billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, C. [http://works.bepress.com/carole_silver/11 “Globalization and the U.S. Legal Market in Legal Services – Shifting Identities”] 31 L &amp; Poly in Int’l bus. 1127–29 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a company/firms to start a network that develops the same market penetration may take a decade and cost only millions of dollars. However, these costs are allocated among the full membership so the cost per member is low. The cost for future members to gain direct and immediate access to these resources is de minimis.

== The formation of a network ==

Professional service networks are [[sui generis]], and each network is formed for a different reason. Current and potential members are attracted to networks in which they can pursue their own individual objectives. While networks clearly do have things in common, each must be viewed in the context of its uniqueness. A successful network is one that meets the expectations of all of its members.

The objective of a network is to create a framework which can allow the members to expand their services. Within the network they can operate to pursue their interests. These interests can include referrals, joint venturing, access to expertise, developing regional expertise, publishing articles for clients, branding, technical information exchange, market positioning, pro bono services, etc. The scope of these interests is defined not by the members but by the network.

Network organizations are defined by their purpose, structure and process. The purpose of a network is different from that of a company or professional firm in that it is limited to specific activities that will benefit its members and enhance its performance.  The network’s structure reflects the activities it seeks to promote and the underlying cultures of the members. [[Accounting networks and associations|Accounting]], [[law firm network|legal]], multidisciplinary and specialty networks will each be different. The process is defined by how they are governed and operated.

Networks are created around common specialized assets, joint control, and a collective purpose. The specialized assets reflect the defined activities of the network. In order to have joint control of the assets, there needs to be collaborations among members. The collaboration necessitates a commonly understood purpose or purposes. A professional services network is neither a mere extension of the members nor only a support organization for independent professional services firms, but is rather an independent organization. It is also a business, and very different from professional associations such as [[Bar association|bar]], accounting and other associations whose membership is generally open to all qualified professionals.

== Reasons for joining networks ==

When asked why they joined, members usually state that they joined for tangible reasons: to receive referrals from other members, to have reliable firms to which they can refer, to maintain independence, to meet clients’ needs, to retain existing clients by being able to provide services in other states or countries, and to obtain new clients in their market who know of the membership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law firm network]]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also want to exchange knowledge that can reduce risks in their own firm's operations, or gain access to other resources.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, T. ''Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganization for the Nanosecond Nineties'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf (1992) {{ISBN|0394559991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network members also minimize possible losses by spreading risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van Alstyne, M.|title=  The State of Network Organizations: A Survey of Three Frameworks|url=http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP192/CCSWP192.html|journal= Journal of Organizational Computing |year=1997|volume= 7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is a proactive way to profit from change and at the same time to conserve resources. Membership can also enhance the prestige of the member by being associated with prestigious firms that the client is already using. Networks achieve these objectives through different corporate structures in which executives have [[command and control]].

A '''Property Tax Circuit Breaker''' is a [[tax refund]] in the United States given to low income individuals and families whose [[property tax]] liability is a large percentage of their yearly income. The term was coined by John Shannon of the [[U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations|Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations]] in the 1960s. There are currently 18 states who use a wide scope of programs to relieve the property tax burden for low income individuals and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Property Tax Circuit Breaker {{!}} Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|url = http://www.cbpp.org/research/the-property-tax-circuit-breaker#_ftn1|website = www.cbpp.org|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1772_991_3%20Circuit%20Breakers.pdf|title = Property Tax Relief: The Case for Circuit Breakers|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-13|website = Lincoln Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as an electrical circuit breaker will prevent an electric circuit from being overloaded with energy, these programs prevent low income households from being overloaded with tax burden. Like all tax refunds, these programs require low income households to pay the entire property tax up-front then a credit or refund is given during the income tax processing. A popular feature of the property tax circuit breaker is that rather than limiting the amount of money someone pays in property taxes, relief is given after the property taxes are paid. This is done so that the locality who is in charge of levying the taxes and utilizing the revenue does not see a decrease in revenue from property taxes, rather the state government passes down relief for those property taxes that are paid.

== Types of Property Tax Circuit Breakers ==
'''Threshold Circuit Breakers:''' Threshold circuit breakers are the most popular type utilizing a specific threshold percentage that property taxes must exceed before any tax relief is available. With this type of circuit breaker relief would be equal to the amount of property taxes paid above the threshold. There are single-threshold formulas where a single threshold is established to focus on tax relief, and there is also multiple-threshold formulas where the relief can be applied more progressively in an incremental fashion. The multiple-threshold formula is more common than the single-threshold formula.

'''Sliding Scale Circuit Breakers:''' These circuit breakers utilize income brackets to formulate a reduction in property taxes regardless of the amount of property tax. The tax relief will be the same within each tax bracket and will decrease incrementally with each increase in the income bracket so that those with the lowest of incomes will receive the highest of property tax reductions. An example of this method would be: A 50% reduction for the first $10,000 income, a 40% reduction for the next $5,000 income, a 30% reduction for the next $5,000 in income. This sliding scale would eventually stop at a certain income level where a property tax reduction would possibly be deemed unnecessary.

== Eligibility for Property Tax Circuit Breaker ==
There are currently 18 different programs that provide property tax relief in the United States. The programs and their eligibility vary by state. The states with these programs limit eligibility in three ways; whether the tax payer is a renter or a homeowner, whether the tax payer is elderly or disabled, and the income level of the tax payer. Circuit breakers are offered to renters and homeowners in 16 states, only home owners in 1 state and only renters in 1 state; in 8 states the programs are limited to only the elderly or disabled and in all 18 states there is a maximum income level after which a taxpayer no longer qualifies for a refund.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbpp.org//sites/default/files/atoms/files/3-21-07sfp.pdf|title = THE PROPERTY TAX CIRCUIT BREAKER: An Introduction and Survey of Current Programs|date = |accessdate = 10/12/2015|website = www.cbpp.org|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some states have a much more generous income ceiling, participation in these programs is limited by a requirement that the property tax liability be a certain percentage of the taxpayers yearly income. In turn, it is believed by researchers that this type of tax relief is more beneficial to low income families rather than middle or high income families.

=== Examples of Eligibility by State ===
* [[Washington, D.C.]]: Both renters and home-owners are eligible for the program as long as they meet certain income and residency guidelines, and if their property taxes exceed a certain share of their income. The income ceiling is $40,000 and will be increased to $50,000 in 2016. Residents over the age of 70 who make less than $60,000 per year will be eligible. In order to claim this credit the tax filer must be a resident for the full year. The maximum credit is $1,000 dollars and for filers who make less than $25,000 per year the property tax must be over 3% of their yearly income. For tax filers who make between $25,000 and $40,000 the property tax must be over 4% of their yearly income. For those over the age of 70 who make under $60,000 per year the property tax must exceed 3% of their yearly income. Renters may claim 20% of their yearly rent paid as property tax but may only receive up to the maximum $1,000 for the credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dcfpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Schedule-H-Brief-2014-08-14c-Final.pdf|title = District of Columbia's Schedule H Tax Credit: Property Tax Assistance for Low-Income Renters and Owners|date = August 14, 2014|accessdate = November 11, 2015|website = www.dcfpi.org|publisher = |last = DC Fiscal Policy Institute|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Illinois]]: Elderly and the disabled were the only two groups that could qualify for the property tax circuit breaker program in the state of Illinois. The guidelines for eligibility were set by income with $27,610 being the maximum income for a single person household, $36,635 for two people, and $45,657 for three or more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Illinois.gov - Illinois Government News Network (IGNN) - Search the News Results|url = http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&amp;RecNum=10329|website = www3.illinois.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program also enabled renters to qualify for aid as well, including nursing home patients. As of fiscal year 2013, Illinois has ended its property tax circuit breaker program and has instead relied upon the [[Homestead exemption]] for property tax relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Illinois Circuit Breaker property tax help ending|url = http://www.sj-r.com/article/20120623/NEWS/306239974|website = The State Journal|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maine]]: Both homeowners and renters can qualify for the program here, which is based on yearly income as well as the percentage of income tax paid and certain residency requirements. Applicants must be a Maine resident for any time during the tax year and the income guidelines are based on a tier system as follows: $33,333 for a household of one, $43,333 for a household of two and $53,333 for a household of three or more. The income ceiling will be adjusted for cost of living by the year. To qualify for the program the applicant must have paid more than 6% of their yearly income in property tax, or 40% of their yearly income in rent. The return will be 50% of the total paid over 6% of the yearly income and is capped at $600. In Maine even people who live in subsidized housing can qualify for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get a Refund on Your Property Taxes or Rent|url = http://ptla.org/maine-property-tax-fairness-credit|website = ptla.org|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maryland]]: Only property owners can qualify for the program in Maryland, which has a unique formula for eligibility and calculating the actual credit itself. This program also takes total net worth as a factor. In Maryland an applicant must be the owner of the property and it must be their principle dwelling for at least 6 months out of the year including July 1. An applicants total net worth must be less than $200,000 not including the value of the property and an applicants household income must be less than $60,000 per year. The formula used to calculate the value of the tax credit is based on an incremental increase in income compared to the percentage of income used to pay for property tax. For those making less than $8,000 a year the credit will be the full value of what is paid in property tax, then it is 4% for those making between $8,000 and $12,000 per year, 6.5% for those making between $12,000 and $16,000 per year, and 9% for those making between $16,000 and $60,000. The credit is for those who pay more than the threshold percentage assigned to their level of income. An example would be, if an applicant made $10,000 and paid $480 in property taxes, the applicant would be eligible for a credit of $80 as long as they meet the other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDAT Homeowners Tax Credit|url = http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/htc.html|website = www.dat.state.md.us|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oklahoma]]: Applicants in Oklahoma must be a property owner over the age of 65 and file as the head of the household. The applicant must have lived in Oklahoma for the entire calendar year before filing for the credit and they must have a yearly household income under $12,000. The refund is equal to either $200 or the amount of property tax paid subtracted subtracted by the property tax cap which is set at 1% of the household income, whichever is less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oklahoma - Tax Credits for Working Families Tax Credits for Working Families|url = http://www.taxcreditsforworkingfamilies.org/state/oklahoma/#property-tax-circuit-breaker|website = www.taxcreditsforworkingfamilies.org|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">The '''Qatar Computer Emergency Response Team''' was created in December 2006 by [[CERT/CC]] and [[ictQATAR]]. It is [[Qatar]]'s coordination center in dealing with [[internet security]] problems. 

==History==
Q-CERT was the first-ever CERT to be established in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2nd-enisa-conference/presentations/Omar%20SHERIN-%20Q-CERT-%20Qatar%20-%202013%20CS%20drills%20for%20the%20Energy%20sector%20in%20Qatar.pdf|title=Qatar's National Cyber Drills|publisher=Supreme Council of Information &amp; Communication Technology|year=2013|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for Q-CERT were first announced in December 2006 after [[ictQATAR]] and the [[CERT Coordination Center]] entered into a partnership.&lt;ref name="sei"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/news/article.cfm?assetId=508928|title=CERT Coordination Center Partners With Qatar’s Supreme Council to Battle Cyber Risks|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=15 December 2005|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It signed a cooperation agreement with the [[SANS Institute]] to provide training courses in cyber security for IT specialists in Qatar's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite we|url=http://www.motc.gov.qa/en/news-events/news/ictqatar%E2%80%99s-q-cert-enhances-cyber-preparedness-critical-sectors-through-trainings|title=ictQATAR’s Q-CERT Enhances Cyber Preparedness in Critical Sectors Through Trainings|publisher=Ministry of Transport and Communications|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the first [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] cyber drill was held under the auspices of Q-CERT and was engaged in by internet security specialists from four GCC countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/521096/Q-CERT-holds-GCC-Cyber-Security-Drill|title=Q-CERT holds GCC Cyber Security Drill|publisher=Gulf Times|date=14 November 2016|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goals of Q-CERT are to:&lt;ref name="sei"/&gt;

# Create awareness of cybersecurity in private-public institutions and the public;
# Provide proactive and guided approaches for managing ICT security in the civil society;
# Assist private-public stakeholders in managing risks and vulnerabilities against the country's information infrastructures;
# Ensure integrity and confidentiality of data crucial to the wide range of online services that will be offered;
# Introduce cybercrime laws and [[privacy law]]s and educate the public on their rights.

In [[telecommunication]], the '''reframing time''' (or '''frame-alignment recovery time''') is the [[time]] interval between the instant at which a valid frame-alignment signal is available at the receiving [[data]] [[terminal equipment]] and the instant at which frame alignment is established. 

The reframing time includes the time required for replicated verification of the validity of the frame-alignment signal.

The case arose from a fatal accident that occurred in the chemistry laboratory of [[Patrick Harran]] at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA).  Research assistant Sheharbano "Sheri" Sangji&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Kate|title=A young lab worker, a professor and a deadly accident|url=http://t.thestar.com/#/article/news/world/2014/03/30/a_young_lab_worker_a_professor_and_a_deadly_accident.html?referrer=|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; suffered severe burns from a fire that occurred on December 28, 2008 when a plastic syringe she was using to transfer the [[pyrophoric]] [[reagent]] [[tert-Butyllithium|''tert''-butyllithium]] from one sealed container to another came apart, spilling the chemical, and igniting a fire. Sangji was not wearing a protective lab coat and her clothing caught fire, resulting in severe burns that led to her death 18 days later.&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.latimes.com/calosha-report-faults-professor-ucla-death-lab-assistant/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A 95-page report by Cal/OSHA adds new detail to the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheri Sangji, who was fatally burned in a 2008 lab fire at UCLA.|url=http://documents.latimes.com/calosha-report-faults-professor-ucla-death-lab-assistant/|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation was conducted by the [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (Cal/OSHA), which protects the public and workers from safety hazards and enforces the U.S. State of California's occupational and public safety laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) - Cal/OSHA|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/|website=CA.gov|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Cal/OSHA fined UCLA $31,875 for violations relating to the fire and in 2012, the Los Angeles District Attorney filed four felony charges against the Regents of the [[University of California]] and [[Patrick Harran]] for "willful violation of safety regulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report faults professor, UCLA in death of lab assistant|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Kim|last=Christensen|date=January 21, 2012|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ucla-lab-20120121-story.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prosecutors reached a deferred prosecution agreement after Harran agreed to pay a donation to a local burn center and do community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UCLA chemistry professor avoids prison time in fatal lab fire case|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ucla-professor-avoids-prison-fatal-lab-fire-20140620-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Kim|last=Christensen|date=June 20, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benderly|first1=Beryl|title=The Landmark Patrick Harran Case Ends Inconclusively|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2014_07_09/caredit.a1400176|website=Taken for Granted|publisher=AAAS|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2018, the court announced that Harran had fulfilled the terms of the agreement, and dismissed the charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;https://cen.acs.org/safety/lab-safety/Charges-dropped-against-UCLA-chemistry/96/web/2018/09&lt;/ref&gt;

Sangji's death and Harran's legal proceedings have led to a significant increase in the safety standards of research laboratories in academic settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2014_07_09/caredit.a1400176|title=The Landmark Patrick Harran Case Ends Inconclusively|work=sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sangji's family was unhappy with the terms of the settlement with Harran. Sangji's sister, Naveen, has called the sanctions against Harran and UCLA "barely a slap on the wrist."&lt;ref name="losangelestimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ucla-legal-20141016-story.html|title=UCLA's legal fees in fatal lab fire case neared $4.5 million|author=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2014|work=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michaeltorrice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/web/2014/06/Patrick-Harran-L-District-Attorney.html|title=Patrick Harran And L.A.

She noted that previous safety violations in his lab were not corrected before her sister's death and that UCLA had ignored the "wake-up calls" of earlier accidents in other labs. She decried the nearly $4.5 million in legal fees — enough to buy 86,000 lab coats. "Had UCLA spent even a tiny fraction of this money and effort on laboratory and chemical safety training and fire resistant gear … Sheri might still be with us today," Naveen said.&lt;ref name="losangelestimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="michaeltorrice"/&gt;

'''''The Sources of English Law''''' (as it is sometimes known) is an essay written by [[Heinrich Brunner]] and translated by others.

In 1909, it was described as a "valuable survey of the sources and literature of English law".&lt;ref name=EHR&gt;J T. "Short Notices". [[The English Historical Review]]. Volume 24. October 1909. Page 823. [https://archive.org/details/englishhistoric05edwagoog Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Winfield called it a "valuable" guide "to the materials of English law".&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Henry Winfield|Winfield, P H]]. "[[s:Some Bibliographical Difficulties of English Law|Some Bibliographical Difficulties of English Law]]" (1914) 30 [[Law Quarterly Review|LQR]] 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions, reprints and translations==
This essay was published under the title '''Ueberblick über die Geschichte der französischen, normannischen, und englischen Rechtsquellen''' in 1877 in the third edition of ''[[Encyclopädie der Rechtwissenschaft]]'', by [[Franz von Holtzendorf]], at pages 229 to 267, as Part II, section 4. It was reprinted in 1882, in the fourth edition of that work, at pages 277 to 317; and in 1890, in the fifth edition, at pages 303 to 347. It was omitted from the sixth edition published in 1904.

It was translated into English by W Hastie and published under the title '''The Sources of the Law of England''' at Edinburgh in 1888. This publication does not disclose the edition from which it is translated.

A translation by [[Ernst Freund]] was published under the title '''The Sources of English Law''' in  volume 2 of ''[[Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History]]'', at pages 7 to 52. The notes to this volume say that the version contained therein is "revised, enlarged and recast" by Brunning, who has omitted so much of the essay as relates to Norman and French sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History]]. Little, Brown and Company. Boston. 1908. Volume 2. Page 7. Footnote 1. [https://archive.org/details/selectessaysinan02assouoft Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; This version was published, "with some further revision", in its German dress, under the title '''Geschichte der Englischen Rechtsquellen im Grundiss''' in Leipzig in 1909 by Duncker and Humblot. This version has been described as follows:

{{Blockquote|It is indispensable to any student of English history who wishes to make himself rapidly acquainted with the latest expert estimate of the varied materials with which the legal historian has to deal. We find here, for instance, the best succinct account of Dr. Liebermann's work on Anglo-Saxon law, with references to his numerous articles in legal and other periodicals. Another of Dr. Brunner's encyclopaedia articles, that on the 'Sources of Norman Law,' is usefully added as an appendix. The learned author does not leave much scope to the critic, but he takes, we think, rather too seriously Hoveden's loose description of Duke Henry as 'justiciar of England' in the last days of Stephen's reign.&lt;ref name=EHR/&gt;}}

'''Thomas David Lukas Olsen''' (né '''Magnus Gäfgen'''; born 11 April 1975 in [[Frankfurt am Main]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[child murder]]er. In 2002, he was arrested for the murder of 11-year-old Jakob von Metzler, the son of a well-known Frankfurt banker (see [[Metzler Bank]]). The following year, Gäfgen was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;LG Frankfurt am Main, Urteil vom 28. Juli 2003 – 5/22 Ks 2/03 3490 Js 230118/02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DW1&gt;{{cite news|last=Grathwohl|first=Daphne|title=Convicted child murderer sues police for damages|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15290706,00.html|accessdate=3 August 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case drew some controversy over the fact that Gäfgen was threatened with [[torture]] during his interrogation by the police in order to save his victims life.

In January 2015, it became known that he had changed his name from Magnus Gäfgen to Thomas David Lukas Olsen, reportedly inspired by the fictional Danish/Norwegian criminal [[Egon Olsen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.fnp.de/lokales/frankfurt/Kindsmoerder-aendert-seinen-Namen;art675,1213267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bild.de/regional/frankfurt/magnus-gaefgen/darum-heisst-gaefken-jetzt-olsen-39288482.bild.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/nachrichten/indexhessen34938.jsp?rubrik=36082&amp;key=standard_document_54109687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/fuer-ein-neues-leben-kindsmoerder-magnus-gaefgen-hat-sich-umbenannt_id_4394720.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Oberschweinstiege.jpg|thumb|The Oberschweinstiege tram station in [[Frankfurt City Forest]], where the transfer of the ransom money for kidnapped boy Jakob von Metzler took place]]
Gäfgen has a modest family background, but went on to study law at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|Goethe University]] in 1996. On 27 September 2002 he kidnapped Jakob von Metzler in order to blackmail his parents, but killed him in his apartment. Gäfgen then demanded one million euro in ransom from the Metzler family.&lt;ref name="DW1"/&gt; He was observed by the police when he picked up the   ransom. After a few hours, during which he had booked a holiday and not released his victim, who was already dead, he was arrested. After being threatened&lt;ref name="DW1"/&gt; with [[torture]], as ordered by Frankfurt Police Vice President Wolfgang Daschner, he confessed and told where the body was hidden.

In his conviction for murder to life imprisonment in July 2003, the court established his grave level of guilt (''besondere Schwere der Schuld'').&lt;ref name="DW1"/&gt; As a consequence, he is not eligible for early release after 15 years, as is otherwise usual for life prisoners.&lt;ref name="DW1"/&gt; His appeal to the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] was rejected in May 2004. His complaint to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] was rejected in December 2004. In 2005, he filed a complaint against Germany at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (case no. 22978/05, ''Gäfgen v. Germany'') which he partially won in 2010: Germany was convicted for violation of article 3 ECHR (Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment), but was acquitted for violation of article 6 (Right to a fair trial). Additionally, he sued the state of Hesse and demanded compensation for allegedly suffering trauma after being threatened with torture, however, he lost the case.

===Life in Prison===
Magnus Gäfgen is serving his life sentence in [[Schwalmstadt Prison]] in the state of [[Hesse]]. He got his law degree while in prison, and published the autobiography ''Allein mit Gott – Der Weg zurück'' (''Alone with God – The way back'') in 2005. His plans to establish a "Gäfgen Foundation" that should help children who had been victims of crime sparked controversy, and after authorities stated they would never allow such a foundation to be registered, he dropped the plans.

In August 2011 Magnus Gäfgen was awarded €3,000 damages for the police threat to torture him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor|first=Richard|title=Child murderer wins damages over police torture threat|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15295473,00.html|accessdate=4 August 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gäfgen originally wanted €10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child murderer awarded damages for police threat|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110804-36747.html|accessdate=4 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Local]]|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His liquidator tried to seize the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Insolvenzverwalter will Gäfgens Geld|url=http://www.fr-online.de/politik/streit-ums-schmerzensgeld-insolvenzverwalter-will-gaefgens-geld,1472596,21423358.html|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=Frankfurter Rundschau Online|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871|other treaties|Treaty of Frankfurt (disambiguation)}}
The '''Treaty of Frankfurt''' ({{lang-fr|Traité de Francfort}}; {{lang-de|Friede von Frankfurt}}) was a [[peace treaty]] signed in [[Frankfurt]] on 10 May 1871, at the end of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

== Summary ==
The treaty did the following:
* Established the frontier between the [[French Third Republic]] and the [[German Empire]], which involved the ceding of 1,694 villages and cities under French control to Germany in:
:* [[Alsace]]: the French [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]], except for the city of [[Belfort]] and its [[Territoire de Belfort|territory]];
:* [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]: the French department of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], one-third of the department of [[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe]], including the cities of [[Château-Salins]] and [[Sarrebourg]], and the [[Cantons of France|cantons]] [[Saales]] and [[Schirmeck]] in the department of [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]]. 
[[File:Elsass-Lothringen in France.svg|thumb|right|alt=Ceded areas.|''[[Elsaß-Lothringen]]''.]]
* Gave residents of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region until 1 October 1872 to decide between keeping their French nationality and emigrating, or remaining in the region and becoming German citizens.
* Set a framework for the withdrawal of German troops from certain areas.
* Regulated the payment of France's war [[French indemnity|indemnity]] of five billion francs (due within five years).
* Recognized the acceptance of [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I of Prussia]] as [[Kaiser|German Emperor]].
* Required military occupation in parts of France until the indemnity was paid (The French paid the indemnity quickly).

The treaty also established the terms for the following:

* The use of navigable waterways in connection to Alsace-Lorraine 
* Trade between the two countries
* The return of prisoners of war

== Factors that influenced the boundary ==
=== Strategy ===
The German military spoke up for control of the Alsace region, up to the Vosges (mountain range) and the area between Thionville (Diedenhofen) and Metz as a requirement for the protection of Germany. Most importantly, the German military regarded control of the route between Thionville and Metz as the most important area of control if there were ever to be a [[World_War_I|future war]] with France.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Without a westward shift in the boundary, the new empire's frontier with France would have been largely divided between the states of [[Baden]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] whose governments were less than enthusiastic with the prospect of having a vengeful France on their doorstep. It also would have necessitated the stationing of substantial imperial forces within these states' borders, possibly compromising their ability to exercise the considerable autonomy that the southern states were able to maintain in the [[Constitution of the German Empire|unification treaty]].  A shift in the frontier alleviated these issues.

=== Nationalism ===
The new political border largely (though not entirely) followed the linguistic border.  The fact that the majority of the population in the new Imperial Territory (''Reichsland'') territory spoke [[Germanic dialects]] allowed Berlin to justify the annexation on nationalistic grounds.

=== Economy ===
Natural resources in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (iron-ore, and coal) do not appear to have played a role in Germany's fight for the areas annexed.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, 248&lt;/ref&gt; Military annexation was the main stated goal along with unification of the German people.
At the same time, France lost 1,447,000 hectares, 1,694 villages and 1,597,000 inhabitants. It also lost 20% of its mining and steel potential.
The treaty of trade of 1862 with Prussia was not renewed but France granted Germany, for trade and navigation, a [[Most favoured nation|most-favoured nation]] clause. France would respect the clauses of the Treaty of Frankfurt in their entirety until 1914.

France also had to pay a full payment of 5,000,000,000 francs in gold, with one billion in 1871, before any German forces withdrawal (which occurred on September 1873).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gander.chez.com/traite-de-francfort.htm Treaty of Francfort Full Text (fr) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
This treaty polarized French policy towards Germany for the next 40 years. The reconquest of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], the "lost provinces," became an obsession characterized by a [[revanchism]] which would be one of the most powerful motives in France's involvement in [[World War I]].

In 1918, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] addressed the issue as [[Fourteen_Points#Fourteen_Points|Point 8]] in his [[Fourteen Points]] speech, expressing the will of the United States to the restitution of the region to France. Thus Alsace-Lorraine returned to the French Republic under the [[Treaty of Versailles|1919 Treaty of Versailles]]. The Germans accepted to surrender under the term of the American proposal.

The '''United Software Association''' ('''USA''') was a [[warez]] organization which released games and software for the [[IBM PC]] platform during the 1990s. USA formed a co-op with the PC warez division of [[Fairlight (group)|Fairlight]] which was best known as "'''''USA/FLT'''''". USA was formed as the result of a split of several members from another noteworthy PC group, [[The Humble Guys]] (THG). Key members, such as Genesis and The NotSoHumble Babe, left THG, eventually resulting in public displays of animosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/a73d55 ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/united-software-association+fairlight |title=United Software Association, Fairlight |publisher=Defacto2 |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929005309/http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/united-software-association+fairlight |archive-date=2012-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}{{Self-published source|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USA had a subdivision known as "USA-DoX" which was responsible for transcribing or otherwise typing up [[documentation]] to accompany a release. This division was also carried over by Genesis from THG, which previously had its own documentation division known as "HumbleDox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|url=http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/SOFTDOCS/bic-sol2.dox |title=Bicycle Solitaire v2.01 |author=Swfte |publisher=Genesis-HubleDox |date=1991-05-29 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the news==
In late January 1992, several members of USA, including Mike Arnolds (The Grim Reaper) and "Amy" (The NotSoHumble Babe), were arrested by the [[United States Secret Service]] (in cooperation with the Farmington Hills Police and [[Michigan]] State Police) for ''carding'' ([[credit card fraud]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrack.org/phrack/38/P38-04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216172939/http://www.phrack.org/phrack/38/P38-04 |date=December 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vatican Radio lawsuit''' {{when|date=September 2015}} was started by the Regional Health Department{{vague|date=September 2015}} for "Throwing of dangerous things" on the Italian ground at their antenna site.

The Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the [[non-ionising radiation]] from the site has [[Non-ionizing radiation#Health risks|affected their health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_21_37/ai_72960576 Vatican Radio officials charged - in case concerning the electromagnetic force of radio transmitters - Brief Article] from [[BNET]]&lt;/ref&gt; However these claims are not accepted by the station. The only peer reviewed study of these statistics did find a statistically higher incidence of leukemia within 6&amp;nbsp;km of the transmitter site, but stated that no causal implication can be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/155/12/1096.full&lt;/ref&gt;   Every time it has been sued, the station cited the [[Lateran Treaty]], bilateral agreements signed by the Holy See and [[Benito Mussolini]] which exempt it from Italian law. (The area around the antennas at the time it was built was not heavily populated.)

Vatican Radio covers an area of [[Rome]], as set by the 'extraterritorial right' in Italian law. Within this area, some of the station's [[Radio masts and towers|pylons]] are higher than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. These transmitters have been in place since 1957. Since this part of [[Rome]] is not under Italian jurisdiction, these transmitters are not subject to the Italian laws that limit the radiation that a radio station can emit. In the vicinity of these pylons, the radiation emitted can be more than the double the amount allowed by Italian law, as verified officially by the Italian [[Civil Defense]] and the Department for the Environment of the region of [[Lazio]]. However, these levels are comparable to those allowed in other countries and are frequency dependent.

Residents who have moved to the area near the transmitters have experienced other disturbances relating to the station, as is common near transmitter sites the world over. The most common complaints are that one can hear the transmissions breaking through on telephones, and other electronic devices (due in many cases to the devices having poor [[Electromagnetic compatibility|electromagnetic immunity]] to the strong signals). The Region of [[Lazio]] has also found{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} that the people in the area around the transmitters are more likely to have [[leukemia]]; the closer those in the examined sample lived to the radio station, the more likely they were to have leukemia, up to six times the Italian national average.&lt;ref&gt;(Agenzia di Sanità Pubblica - Regione Lazio - March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; This study was not peer reviewed.

Dramatizing the study, a well known Italian TV program called ''[[Le Iene]]'' went to the radio station{{when|date=September 2015}} and replaced the radio's insignia with a new one stating 'Radio Erode' meaning 'Herod's Radio', referring to [[Herod the Great]] and the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], since the study showed{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} that the most affected people are children 0 to 14 years old.

'''Vladimir Georgievich Vinnichevsky '''(born July 1923 in [[Verkhnyaya Salda]], [[Ekaterinburg]] - November 11, 1940 in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]]), known as the "'''Urals Monster'''", was the youngest [[Soviet]]-[[Russia|Russian]] serial killer.

He was convicted of eighteen attacks on children aged between two and four years in 1938-1939 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], [[Nizhny Tagil]] and [[Kushva]]. Eight of these attacks resulted in murder.

On January 16, 1940, Vinnichevsky was sentenced to death and executed several months later.

== Early years ==
Vladimir Vinnichevsky was born in July 1923.&lt;ref name="rakit"&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; His father - George Ivanovich, was a master in the municipal public utilities of Sverdlovsk. And his mother - Elizaveta Petrovna, was an accountant. The family lived in a separate private house in the center of Sverdlovsk. The Vinnichevsky family was provided well by Soviet standards at the time: Vladimir had a suit, a tank helmet, a [[Swiss]] knife, and leather shoes. He also had pocket money - at the time of his arrest he was found to have more than 20 rubles, which was then the two-day earnings of an average worker. Vladimir also studied at the Sverdlovsk School № 16, in class 7 "B". Although his progress was low, he remained in the second year. However, Vinnichevsky sang well and knew many songs by heart.

Vinnichevsky was on friendly terms with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], who later became a famous sculptor. Neizvestny and Vinnichevsky were in the same year of schooling (Vinnichevsky was two years older than Neizvestny, but went to school a year later and once remained in the second year). The adolescents lived near and went to school together, went to the cinema together and attended performances in the Theater of Musical Comedy. Vinnichevsky often visited Neizvestny's apartment. During an interrogation on November 17, 1939, Ernst Neizvestny described Vinnichevsky&lt;ref&gt;State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region. - F. Р-148. - Op. 2. - D. 746. - L. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{Cquote|quote=I can say that he was a very humble boy, shy, loved to be alone, often in school he would be somewhere in a corner or standing by the wall. Being with him, I talked about girls, and he always spoke about them with some disgust and said that he would not like to have sexual intercourse and never had...

I personally often noticed for him that he, went to the restroom and stayed there for a very long time, what he did there, I do not know.}}

== Murders ==
[[File:Дневник Винничевского.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The list of victims with encrypting information, which lead to Vinnichevsky]]
It is now known when Vladimir committed the first murder, since the investigators could not find the relatives of the first victims, about whom Vinnichevsky gave evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; To commit his crimes, Vinnichevsky would go around yards, saying that he was under the orders of the Komsomol organization for the sponsored Pioneer squads collecting scrap metal, and therefore went around neighborhoods, figuring out which residents had scrap.&lt;ref&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first murder (or more precisely, the third, as there is no information on the previous murders) was that of 4-year-old Gerta Grebanova, committed in the summer or early autumn of 1938 in Sverdlovsk. Vinnichevsky entered the courtyard of the private house where the Gribanovs lived, took the girl to the kitchen garden, where he strangled her, and then struck her head 8 times with a kitchen knife, breaking it, and leaving a splinter in the victim's skull.&lt;ref name="rakit1"&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He later disposed of the broken knife and used a screwdriver and a folding knife in later murders.&lt;ref name="murd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://murders.ru/gnida_750_1.html|title=Винничевский Владимир (1938-1939 гг., Свердловск)|author=|website=|date=|publisher=murders.ru|accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:План убийства винническим девочки.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The planned map for the abduction and murder of a girl named Rita Fomina in Nizhny Tagil (case materials)]]
Although Vinnichevsky committed most of the attacks in Sverdlovsk, he made trips to other cities in the Sverdlovsk Oblast to confuse the investigation - one attack was committed in Nizhny Tagil, and another in Kushva.&lt;ref name="rakit2"&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; He attacked both boys and girls. The motive of the attack was a sexual act with the victim. At first, Vinnichevsky tried to perform a "natural" sexual act with the female victims, but he was convinced that, due to anatomical limitations, this could not be done. Then he began to perform anal intercourse, and in some cases (usually in the cold season) limited himself to rubbing his genitals.&lt;ref&gt;''Ракитин А. И.'' Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 270—273.&lt;/ref&gt; After the act Vinnichevsky would choke his victim, and sometimes stab them to death.

The murder of Gerta Gribanova gave the investigators evidence, as the girl's skull had a knife piece stuck in it. The girl's body was beheaded by the investigative authorities: the skull was left as evidence, and the rest given to the child's parents for the burial. The assumption was that the killer would use the same kitchen knife that ended Gribanova's life, but later, this assumption turned out to be false.

The fifth victim of Vinnichevsky was a boy who, most likely, survived, but could not be found. Then the killer suggested to 4-year-old Borya Titov to go sledging with him, took him to a wasteland, and attacked him after a snowdrift. Although Vinnichevsky prudently took the child with him, Borya was rescued, and later told the investigators about the murderer.

The seventh victim was 3-year-old Katya Lobanov in Kushva. The girl was killed, and her body later thrown into a swamp to hide the smell of degradation.

In Sverdlovsk, Vinnichevsky began to practice the kidnapping of children and killing them in the forest massifs to the outskirts, where the bodies were covered with branches. This is how 4-year-old Lida Surina and 3-year-old Valya Kamaeva died in the spring of 1939. Later, 3-year-old Alya Gubina was kidnapped, with whom Vinnichevsky had sexual intercourse, after which he stabbed her several times with a knife, leaving a wound 25 centimeters long. After that, he threw the girl away, but she survived, and quickly fled. At the same time, Vinnichevsky did not take the child further than 1 km away from the place where he picked her up. He killed not only in the outskirts, but also near his home on Mamin-Sibiryak Street, where he kidnapped two children.

The last victim - 4-year-old Taisia Morozov - after killing her, Vinnichevsky threw her body into a cesspool, placing her clothes into the front garden of the apartment building, hoping that it was there that they would search for the child's remains.

The wounded victims from Vinnichevsky's attacks who were thrown into cesspools had practically no chance to escape, even if they were still alive. However, 4-year-old Raya Rahmatulina, thrown by Vinnichevsky into a cesspool, woke up and began to scream, alerting passers-by who rescued her.

== Arrest ==
The Sverdlovsk criminal investigation department found it difficult to investigate cases of abductions of children. The kidnappings were very different - from the different locations, to the different disposal of the bodies. In addition, the surviving children could not give a clear description of the kidnapper. Finally, the parents of some of the victims did not file a complaint to the police. At the same time, the investigators made several erroneous assumptions about the murderer's identity. Everyone was sure that the killer had been [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|convicted earlier]], and, it was supposed, for crimes against the sexual inviolability of the person. It was assumed that the murder was between 20 and 25, and looked like a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;''[//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 Смыкалин А.

On October 24, 1939, during the commission of the crimes, Vinnichevsky was detained by three militia cadets named Popov, Angelov and Krylov.&lt;ref name="tod"&gt;[http://today-news.com/News/society/spetsproekt-«arhivnye-dela»-chast-iii-samyj-molodoj-manjak-v-istorii-sssr-pojmannyj-na-uralmashe-foto-55201.html Спецпроект «Архивные дела», ЧАСТЬ III: самый молодой маньяк в истории СССР, пойманный на Уралмаше (ФОТО)]&lt;/ref&gt; Patrolling at the tram stop in [[Verkhnyaya Pyshma]], the cadets noticed a tall man who was carrying a little boy into the forest. Vinnichevsky had kidnapped the 3-year-old Slava Volkov, whom his mother left for a few minutes at the entrance of the family home. The killer snatched the boy quickly, and got into the tram to get away from his pursuers. Cadets followed the teenager and found him at a time when Vinnichevsky was choking the boy. Slava was rescued, and Vinnichevsky was detained.

As Borya's neck covered his neck, Vinnichevsky had to unbutton his button and begin strangling Borya, leaving well-visible scrapes of skin on his fingernails.&lt;ref&gt;''[//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 Смыкалин А.

== Trial, sentence and execution ==
During the investigation, Vinnichevsky confessed to the murders, revealing that he had recorded all the murders on paper, encrypting the text.

Vinnichevsky's parents brought this statement to the regional newspaper titled "The Ural Worker":

{{Cquote|quote=We, the parents, renounce such a son and demand a supreme measure be applied to him - execution. Such people can not be alive in the Soviet family.

November 1, 1939 12 o'clock in the afternoon}}

The doctor of jurisprudence AS Skryalin emphasizes that the trial of Vinnichevsky was held when Soviet legislation provided for the death penalty for minors who had reached the age of 12 years. The People's Commissar for Defense, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], on March 19, 1935, sent [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin|Kalinin]] a letter with a proposal to introduce the death penalty for children, pointing to the statistics of child crime in Moscow and, in particular, on wounding a son of the deputy prosecutor of the Soviet capital by a 9-year-old boy. Voroshilov was well acquainted with Stalin for [[battle of Tsaritsyn]]. The letter quickly gave the result in the form of a normative legal act. On April 8, 1935, a joint resolution of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|CEC]] and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR "on measures to combat juvenile delinquency" was promulgated, providing for the imposition of the death penalty from the age of 12. This was known abroad. The famous writer [[Romain Rolland]], in a conversation with Stalin on June 28, 1935, questioned the humanity of such a measure. Stalin replied to him:

{{Cquote|quote=This decree has a purely [[pedagogical]] significance. We wanted to frighten them not so much hooliganous children as organizers of hooliganism among children ... The decree was issued in order to frighten and disorganize adult bandits and protect our children from hooligans... And could we give an explanation in the sense that this decree we published in pedagogical goals, to prevent crimes, to intimidate criminal elements? Of course, could not, because in this case the law would lose all power in the eyes of criminals.}}

On April 20, 1935, the top secret circular of the USSR Prosecutor's Office and the USSR Supreme Court No. 1/001537-30/002517, which was signed by the USSR Prosecutor [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] and the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR Vinokurov, is dated. The Circular explained to Prosecutor's Offices and Courts the Resolution "On measures to combat crime among minors":

{{Cquote|quote=... it is necessary to consider the indication in the footnote to Art. 13 of the "Basic Principles of the Criminal Legislation of the USSR and the Union Republics" and the relevant articles of the Criminal Codes of the Union Republics (Article 22 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR and the corresponding articles of the Criminal Code of other Union republics), according to which the execution to persons under the age of 18 years is not applied.}}

Тhus, the USSR prosecutor's office and the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]] virtually abolished article 22 of the Criminal Code, which explicitly abolished the execution against persons under the age of 18. On January 2, 1936, the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR indicated that if persons who have attained the age of 12 commit crimes not listed in Article 12, but connected with violence, bodily harm, mutilation or murder, they are liable under the relevant article of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;''[//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 Смыкалин А.

Secret circular № 1/001537 - 30/002517 also prescribed (under the proposal) prosecuting authorities and the courts to inform the prosecutor of the USSR and Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR "on all cases of criminal trial of juvenile offenders in respect of which it is possible the use of the death penalty".&lt;ref&gt;История сталинского Гулага.

On January 16, 1940, Vinnichevsky was sentenced to death by the Soviet court. The convict filed a [[pardon]], in which he claimed that he was ready to win forgiveness in battle, and expressed desire to become a [[Tank|tanker]], since at the time of the USSR was at [[Winter War|war with Finland]].&lt;ref name="rakit4"&gt;''Ракитин А.

== Place of burial ==
In the USSR, bodies of those executed were not given to relatives for burial, but were buried in special secret places. Vinnichevsky was probably buried at 12 km of the Moscow tract.&lt;ref name="vinni"&gt;[https://www.nakanune.ru/articles/113635/ «Маски скорби» по маньяку?]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only known burial place in the Sverdlovsk region, where the bodies of the executed were buried in the 1930s. These bodies were not divided for what they were shot for, therefore, in one mass grave, those executed for political reasons and on criminal charges, such as Vinnichevsky. In the 1990s, the burial place was turned into a memorial complex of victims of reprisals of the 1920-1950s. On November 20, 2017, at this complex a monument titled "Masks of Sorrow: Europe-Asia" was opened, the work of a friend of Vinnichevsky, Ernst Neizvestny.

== Vinnichevsky's case files and publications about him ==
Vinnichevsky's criminal case is No. 434. According to the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region, the archive contains four volumes of the criminal case against Vladimir Georgievich Vinnichevsky, considered by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in 1940. They are in the fund of the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region R-148 "Sverdlovsk Regional Court" (Inventory 2). In one media in the summer of 2017, information appeared that the materials of the criminal case of Vinnichevsky had been kept secret for more than 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-470855-section_id-164.html|title=Был хитрым и находчивым: в конце лета выйдет книга о свердловском маньяке-школьнике|publisher=www.e1.ru|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the answer of the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region on March 16, 2018, the Vinnichevsky case was archived in 1991, and since then has been freely available.

 In January 2018, A. Rakitin published a two-volume book dedicated to Vinnichevsky, titled: "The Urals Monster: Chronicle of the exposure of the most mysterious serial killer of the Soviet Union". In this book, the author put forward a version that Vinnichevsky had an accomplice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://murders.ru/lenta_190.html Новая книга в «ридеро». «Уральский Монстр».]&lt;/ref&gt;
