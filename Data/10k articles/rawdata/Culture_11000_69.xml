'''AEDIPS''', the '''Association of Educational Development and Improvement Professionals in Scotland''' is an association that supports the development of [[education in Scotland]], with a particular focus on [[entitlement]] and quality.

Formerly known as the '''AEAS''' (the '''Association of Educational Advisers in Scotland'''), AEDIPS updated its [[constitution]] and its name in 2005 to reflect the changing roles of professionals working in the areas of quality improvement, [[curriculum]], and professional development in Scottish education today.

AEDIPS acts as a forum for the approximate five hundred educational professionals now supporting schools in all sectors of education in the areas of improvement, curriculum, and professional development in local authorities in Scotland.

Membership of AEDIPS is open to permanent staff, secondees, [[consultants]], and former improvement and  development professionals who may have moved on from local authority work but wish to keep up with educational developments in Scotland.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Act to Restrain Abuses of Players ''''' (1606) was a [[censorship]] law passed by the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], and introduced fines for plays which 'jestingly or profanely' used the names of [[God (Christianity)|God]] or [[Jesus]]. Plays written after 1606 avoided such terms as a consequence of the act, and new editions of older plays removed profane words.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the Act had an important influence on the revision and publication of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Mowat 2005, 91-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of act==

This Act is listed as "Anno 3 Jacobi I Cap 21".

'''An Act to restrain Abuses of Players'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- This is the verbatim text of the Act. Please do not re-word or re-spell or re-punctuate it or change the word capitalization. --&gt; 
For the preventing and avoiding of the great Abuse of the Holy Name of God in [[drama|Stage Plays]], [[Entr'acte|Enterludes]], [[May Day|May Games]], Shews and such like; Be it enacted by our Sovereign Lord the [[James VI and I|King]]'s Majesty, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That if at any time or times after the End of this present [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|Session]] of Parliament, any Person or Persons do or shall in any Stage-play, Enterlude, Show, May-game or [[wikt:pageant|Pageant]], jestingly or profanely speak or use the holy Name of God, or of Christ Jesus, or the Holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, which are not to be spoken but with Fear and Reverence, shall forfeit for every such Offence by him or them committed Ten [[Pound (currency)|Pounds]]; the One [[wikt:moiety|Moiety]] thereof to the King's Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, the other Moiety thereof to him or them that will sue for the same in any [[Court of Record]] at ''Westminster'', wherein no [[Essoin]], Protection or [[Wager of Law]] shall be allowed.
----
(''Note that when this Act was passed, a pound in money was the value of a pound weight of [[silver]].'')

== Impact on dramatic works ==

Many scholars and editors have argued that the act had a significant impact on English early modern drama.&lt;ref name="Mowat 92"&gt;Mowat 2005, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to comply with the act has been used to explain differences in editions of plays published before and after 1606, such as ''[[Othello]]'' by William Shakespeare and ''[[Volpone]]'' by [[Ben Jonson]].&lt;ref name="Mowat 92"/&gt; However, Barbara Mowat has expressed reservations about the extent of the act's influence. She has highlighted the fact that the act only applied to dramatic ''performances'', and thus changes to printed editions of dramatic works may have stemmed from other influences.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat 2005, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; These influences may have included changing cultural attitudes towards swearing, alterations made by particular scribes (such as [[Ralph Crane]]), and the desire to avoid offending particular individuals, such as [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Sir Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]] from 1624 to 1642.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat 2005, 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boom tube''', in [[DC Comics]] is a slang expression for a fictional extra-dimensional point-to-point [[wormhole|Einstein-Rosen bridge]] (a form of [[teleportation]]) opened by a [[Mother Box]] used primarily by residents of [[New Genesis]] and [[Apokolips]]. The concept was created by [[Jack Kirby]] for his [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] series of comics.

==Overview==
The "science" of boom tubes has never been explained (as is normal for the New Gods, though [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], in the first issue of ''New Gods'', says that a tube "stems from the waves of the mind") but they allow people to quickly travel interstellar distances, and between dimensions, by creating an apparent tube between two points through which people can travel. When used, a low humming accompanies the formation of the "tube" (a tunnel of rippling circles of light) which increases in volume as the tube is maintained and traversed, ultimately culminating in a loud "booming" noise when it closes. This "[[Sonic boom|boom]]" has been known to knock bystanders off their feet and shatter glass, and gives the technology its name. The tubes are generated or opened by another device, a [[Mother Box]]. Boom tubes are powered by the mysterious X-element, which serves as a matter threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fastbak.tripod.com/ngterms.htm |title= New Gods: Tech and Terms |website= New Gods Library |first= Sean |last= Walsh |date= Aug 12, 2003 |accessdate= 2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial Kirby comics depict boom tubes as a sort of quasi-technological equivalent of [[Bifröst]], the Rainbow Bridge linking [[Asgard]] and Earth; indeed, boom tubes are described as a "bridge to Earth." Subsequent writers have allowed the tubes to be used for point-to-point transport between various locations on New Genesis, Apokolips, Earth, and other planets, thereby making them near-ubiquitous for the travel of the [[New Gods]].

== Later additions to the concept ==
*The "tubes only" idea was reinforced when later writers introduced the idea that the New Gods were, in fact, giants, and that the boom tube would appropriately shrink or enlarge people who traveled through it. The precise size ratio has varied, with New Gods in their "original" size being depicted as anywhere from tens of feet tall, to tens of thousands of miles tall (as in ''New Gods'' #10, 1996).
*In the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries they are also referred to as "star gates".

==Hush tube==
In [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #1, a villain named [[Doctor Impossible]] uses a "father box" to summon "hush tubes".

==Other media==
===Television===
* Outside of the comic books, boom tubes have been seen on a number of occasions. They are first seen in the last two seasons of the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series, ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' on a number of occasions. Here, they are referred to as "'''[[Jumpgate|Star Gates]]'''", and they are used by the natives of Apokolips, though without the sonic boom caused by boom tubes. New Genesis was never shown or mentioned.
* The [[DC Animated Universe]] incorporated the Boom Tubes in their shows: They were first seen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', as well as ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.
* In the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' television series, [[Eradicator (comics)|Superman X]] uses a device similar to a [[Mother Box]] called a "warp key" to open a portal to the past to recruit the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] to battle [[Imperiex]].
* In ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'', [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] uses a device that may be a boom tube, which is one of many things that have been shown in the series 7th season which has led to speculation about Darkseid making an appearance in the series.
* The Boom Tubes appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV special "Super Hero High".

===Film===
* A amalgamtion of Boom Tubes and The [[Metal Men]] appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'' as '''The Boom Tube Creatures'''.
* In the 2017 ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' movie, boom tubes feature as the method of travel used by the film's main antagonist, [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]], one of the New Gods.

===Video Games===
Boom tubes appear briefly in the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' as one of many transportation methods used.  In the first scene of the DC Universe side of the story, Darkseid attempts to escape defeat in Metropolis via a boom tube.  However, Superman blasts him with a heat ray as he enters the boom tube, coinciding with [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] of the [[Mortal Kombat]] multiverse blasting [[Shao Kahn]] with a lightning blast as he enters a portal in another plane.  The cosmic coincidence of Darkseid and Shao Kahn using similar portal-like apertures simultaneously combined with the also simultaneous energy discharge from the respective protagonists' attacks results in the being [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Dark Kahn|Dark Kahn]], the main antagonist of the game.

Boom tubes appear in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''. They appear in the hubs when player selects a playable character from the roster.

The episode received critical praise overall, but triggered a public controversy as many interpreted the sexual encounter between [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister]] as rape.&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;{{cite news|last=Saraiya|first=Sonia|title=Rape of Thrones.

This episode marks the final appearance of [[Jack Gleeson]] ([[Joffrey Baratheon]]) .

==Plot==
===In King's Landing===
Immediately following Joffrey's murder, Dontos and Sansa flee the feast while Cersei and Tywin order the city gates barred and all ships seized while they search the capital for Sansa. Dontos and Sansa arrive at a ship hiding in fog, where they are greeted by Lord Petyr Baelish. Baelish, who believes that Dontos will eventually reveal the conspiracy, orders his men to kill Dontos. Baelish also reveals that the necklace Dontos gave to Sansa was a fake and part of the ruse.

In the city gardens, Olenna and Margaery discuss Joffrey's murder, and how, as their marriage was unconsummated, she is not the Queen. In the Sept, Tywin speaks to Tommen about becoming the king and the qualities that a king must possess, then leaves Cersei to grieve for Joffrey alone. Jaime arrives soon after and consoles Cersei. She asks him to kill Tyrion before a trial can take place, adamant that he is responsible. Jaime refuses and rapes Cersei next to Joffrey's corpse.

While engaging in an intercourse, Prince Oberyn and Ellaria Sand are interrupted by Tywin, who requests to speak with Oberyn privately. Tywin believes that Oberyn may have had a hand in Joffrey's murder. Oberyn refutes his claims and directly accuses Tywin of ordering Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane to rape and murder his sister, [[Elia Martell|Elia]] years earlier. Tywin denies the accusations, but offers to have the Mountain speak with Oberyn about her murder, in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the three judges in Tyrion's trial and also as a member of the small council. In his cell, Tyrion is visited by his squire, Podrick. Podrick tells Tyrion he is to be tried in a [[fortnight]] and that Sansa has not been seen since the wedding. Before leaving, Podrick tells Tyrion that he was asked to testify against Tyrion in exchange for a knighthood. Tyrion orders him to bring Jaime and then flee the city, as he fears for Podrick's life.

===In the North===
Samwell is teased by Ser Alliser and Janos Slynt, who do not believe he was able to kill a White Walker. Samwell speaks with Gilly about moving her to Mole's Town to keep her safe, as many of the Night's Watch brothers were arrested for rape. Gilly wants to stay at Castle Black, but is taken to Mole's Town where Samwell finds her temporary lodging.

The wildling party led by Tormund Giantsbane raids a small village, and Styr forces a small boy, Olly, to run to Castle Black to tell the Night's Watch what they have done. At a gathering, Ser Alliser tells the men that their duty is to protect the Wall first, which is echoed by Maester Aemon. When Alliser asks Jon, he reluctantly agrees that they must prioritize the Wall, before he is interrupted by a horn blast indicating returning rangers. Edd Tollett and Grenn arrive and inform them that Karl and his band of mutineers are living in Craster's Keep. Jon remembers his lie to Mance Rayder about having 1,000 men guarding the Wall, ten times their actual number, and says they must ride north and kill the mutineers before Mance finds out the truth about the Night's Watch forces and realizes how badly he has them outnumbered.

===At Dragonstone===
Stannis has Davos read a letter sent to Dragonstone, informing them that Joffrey is dead. Stannis claims it is the result of leeching Gendry's blood and burning the leeches. He chastises Davos for releasing Gendry, and for not having managed to raise an army for their cause. Davos suggests hiring mercenaries from Essos, but Stannis points out that they have no gold. Davos then visits Shireen, who continues to teach him to read. During the lesson, he suddenly comes up with an idea and has her write a message to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis' name.

===In the Riverlands===
The Hound and Arya continue their journey east toward the Vale of Arryn, before accepting an offer of shelter from a farmer. At dinner, the Hound agrees to work for the farmer in exchange for some silver, but in the morning, he steals the farmer's silver despite Arya's protests.

===Outside Meereen===
Daenerys and her army arrive outside Meereen, where they are received by the Champion of Meereen. Ser Jorah informs her that she must send her own champion to battle the one from Meereen. Her advisors argue over the chance to fight for her, but Daario Naharis is selected. Daario easily kills the champion. Daenerys then speaks to the city's slaves, telling them of her victories in Astapor and Yunkai, including freeing those cities' slaves. She then orders her catapults to fire, and they launch barrels filled with broken slave collars into the city as a sign of the freedom she intends to bring them.

====Rape scene====
&lt;!-- Section lead, summarizing the section --&gt;The episode attracted controversy for a scene where Jaime Lannister forces himself upon Cersei Lannister in the Great Sept of Baelor. In the episode, Cersei repeatedly tells Jaime "no", "stop", and "it's not right" while attempting to push him away. In the [[A Storm of Swords|source novel]], however, Cersei initially rejects Jaime's advances but changes her mind, saying "yes",&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=George |date=2000 |title=A Storm of Swords |url= |location=New York |publisher= Bantam Dell|page=851 |isbn=0-553-57342-X |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some readers interpret it as implying rape.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Addressing the scene's interpretation as rape (or not) --&gt;[[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] stated that viewers interpreted the scene as a rape: "Though there aren't comments on these reviews at the moment, the reaction I've seen on Twitter, in emails and on other blogs suggests nobody is agreeing with [director Alex] Graves' interpretation of the scene and are viewing it as rape, plain and simple."&lt;ref name=HitFix&gt;{{cite news|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=REVIEW: 'GAME OF THRONES' - 'BREAKER OF CHAINS': UNCLE DEADLY?|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-game-of-thrones-breaker-of-chains-uncle-deadly|accessdate=April 27, 2014|newspaper=[[HitFix]]|date=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandy Hingston of ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' wrote that the scene had outraged many viewers, but had led others to make "tentative attempts in comments sections to explain why maybe actually this wasn't rape."&lt;ref name="Hingston"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hingston|first=Sandy|title=Furious Internet to Jaime Lannister: "Incest: You’re Doing It Wrong".

The episode's director, [[Alex Graves]], described the scene in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' as "and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her".&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-director-controversial-scene-697733/ |title='Game of Thrones' Director on Controversial Scene: Jaime 'Traumatized,' Cersei 'a Wreck' (Q&amp;A)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Aaron|last=Couch |date=April 20, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview with HitFix, Graves said "it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for [Jaime and Cersei] ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle."&lt;ref name=HitFix/&gt; In an interview with [[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]], Graves further elaborated: "The consensual part of it was that she wraps her legs around him, and she's holding on to the table, clearly not to escape but to get some grounding in what's going on. And also, the other thing that I think is clear before they hit the ground is she starts to make out with him. ... before he rips her undergarment, she's way into kissing him back." Graves stated that it was important for him and others involved with filming the scene to indicate to viewers that the sexual encounter was not completely one-sided, and that he hoped this aspect would not be overlooked.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|first=Denise |last=Martin |title=Breaking Down Jaime and Cersei’s Controversial Sex Scene, With Last Night’s ''Game of Thrones'' Director |work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]|date=April 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/game-of-thrones-director-on-the-rape-sex-scene.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that during filming, "nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters", he described the scene as "one of my favorite scenes I've ever done".&lt;ref name=HitFix/&gt;

Others involved with the series also commented on the scene. [[David Benioff]], who co-wrote the episode and serves as [[showrunner]] with [[D. B. Weiss]], described the interaction of the two siblings as "a really kind of horrifying scene, because you see, obviously, Joffrey's body right there, and you see that Cersei is resisting this. She's saying no, and he's forcing himself on her. So it was a really uncomfortable scene, and a tricky scene to shoot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game of Thrones Season 4: Inside the Episode #3 (HBO)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUScAGHJHR4|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[HBO]]|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], author of the novels from which the series is adapted, stated that the dynamic is different between Jaime and Cersei in the show because, as opposed to the books, "Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer." He stated that while the setting is the same, "neither character is in the same place as in the books" and that he surmises this "may be why Dan [Weiss] &amp; David [Benioff] played the sept out differently." Martin added that he never discussed the scene with them, and that the scene "was always intended to be disturbing... but [I] regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons."&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime, said in an interview that while many saw the scene as a brutal rape, "that was obviously never intended. I understand that one can see it as that, but for us it was much more complex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bergqvist|first=Mattias|title=Nikolaj Coster-Waldau om DEN DÄR scenen i "Game of thrones"|url=http://bloggar.expressen.se/tvbloggen/2014/04/28/nikolaj-coster-waldau-om-den-dar-scenen-i-game-of-thrones/|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=[[Expressen]]|date=28 April 2014}} As translated in: {{cite web|last=García|first=Elio|title=HEADEY, COSTER-WALDAU ON SEPT SCENE|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Headey_Coster_Waldau_on_Sept_Scene|work=Westeros.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lena Headey, who portrays Cersei, declined to comment about whether she interpreted the sex as consensual, but said that "it's a very complicated moment for many reasons ... There was this need and it wasn't right and yet it felt great and yet it wasn't right and it played out the way it did. And I was really happy with [the scene]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlossberg|first=Mallory|title='GAME OF THRONES' LENA HEADEY TALKS CONTROVERSIAL RAPE SCENE BUT LEAVES US WANTING MORE|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/22760-game-of-thrones-lena-headey-talks-controversial-rape-scene-but-leaves-us-wanting-more-video|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Bustle|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Discussion of what this means for the series and the broader culture--&gt;To Saraiya, the series' choice to portray this scene as rape appeared to be an act of "[[Exploitation fiction|exploitation]] for shock value".&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Marcotte and Josh Wigler of [[MTV]] commented that the rape scene may have damaged Jaime's character's arc of redemption from his earlier crimes, and Marcotte wrote that it might never recover from the rape.&lt;ref name="Marcotte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wigler"&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh |last= Wigler|title='Game Of Thrones' Author Reacts To 'Disturbing' Jaime-Cersei Scene|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=April 22, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1726555/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-jaime-cersei.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dustin Rowles of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' noted that viewers who were previously able to sympathize with Jaime despite his earlier crimes of murder and incest now became angry at the series' creators "for allowing a terrible person to do something more terrible than our minds will allow us to forgive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowles|first=Dustin|title=Why the "Game of Thrones" rape scene caused fans to respond in the worst possible way |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/24/why_the_game_of_thrones_rape_scene_caused_fans_to_respond_in_the_worst_possible_way_partner/|accessdate=April 27, 2014|newspaper=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Romano of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' opined that the scene "wasn't supposed to be a rape. It was supposed to look consensual. The filmmakers messed up." He cited the fact that "neither the director of the scene nor the two actors who played it seem to think that Jaime raped Cersei—and the story itself is continuing to chug along as if the rape never happened and Jaime is still a character we're supposed to root for." He suggested that viewers "ignore the rape—at least from a narrative perspective" because Benioff and Weiss had "botched" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/04/why-we-should-pretend-the-game-of-thrones-rape-scene-never-happened.html|title=Why We Should Pretend the ‘Game of Thrones’ Rape Scene Never Happened|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 4, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader context, Hingston credited the episode with furthering "the furious debate over [[consent]] going on in our culture".&lt;ref name="Hingston" /&gt; Laura Hudson of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described the scene and its appraisal by its director as "one that encourages the most dangerous thinking about rape imaginable: that when a woman is held down on the ground, screaming for the man to stop, that deep down inside her she might still really want it." She considered Graves' lack of realization that he was filming a rape scene disturbing because, according to Hudson, his comments encouraged the thinking that a man's persistence might "'turn' a rape into something consensual", and that it is a "dysfunctional, dangerous way of looking at sex and consent, one that is based on the idea of forcing women to give it".&lt;ref name="Wired 21 April 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=Laura|title=That Game of Thrones Scene Wasn’t a ‘Turn-On,’ It Was Rape|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/game-of-thrones-rape/|accessdate=April 27, 2014|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|it|Cantastoria}}''' ({{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrja|pron}}; also spelled '''{{lang|it|cantastorie}}''' {{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrje|}}, '''{{lang|it|canta storia}}''' or '''{{lang|it|canta historia}}''') comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] for "story-singer" and is known by many other names around the world. It is a [[theatrical]] form where a performer tells or sings a story while gesturing to a series of images. These images can be painted, printed or drawn on any sort of material.

==Picture stories in Asia==
[[File:Wayang Beber Opened.jpg|thumb|400px|right|{{lang|id|[[Wayang beber]]}}, a Javanese {{lang|it|cantastoria}} art thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in the 1960s.]]

In 6th-century [[India]], religious tales called {{lang|sa-Latn|saubhika}}s were performed by traveling storytellers who carried banners painted with images of gods from house to house. Another form called {{lang|sa-Latn|yamapapaka}} featured vertical cloth scrolls accompanied by sung stories of the afterlife. Nowadays, this Indian traditional art is still performed by [[Chitrakar]] women of [[West Bengal]]. In [[Tibet]] this was known as {{lang|bo-Latn|ma-ni-pa}} and in [[China]] this was known as {{lang|zh-Latn|pien}}. In [[Indonesia]] the scroll was made horizontal and became the ''{{lang|ms|[[wayang]] beber}}'' and employed four performers: a man who sings the story, two men who operate the rolling of the scroll, and a woman who holds a lamp to illuminate particular pictures featured in the story. Other Indonesian theater forms such as ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] kulit}}'', a [[shadow play]], and ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] golek}}'', rod [[puppet]]ry, developed around the same time and are still performed today.

In [[Japan]], {{lang|it|cantastoria}} appears as {{lang|ja-Latn|[[etoki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵解}}) or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[emaki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵巻}}) in the form of hanging scrolls divided into separate panels, foreshadowing the immensely popular [[manga]], or Japanese [[comics]]. {{lang|ja-Latn|Etoki}} sometimes took the shape of little booklets, or even displays of [[doll]]s posed on the roadside with backgrounds behind them. In the 20th century, Japanese candymen would bicycle around with serial shows called {{lang|ja-Latn|[[kamishibai]]}} ({{lang|ja|紙芝居}}) where the story was told to a series of changing pictures that slid in and out of an open-framed box. Some {{lang|ja-Latn|kamishibai}} shows had a [[peep show]] element to them, where a viewer could pay extra to peer through a hole and see a supposed [[cultural artifact|artifact]] from the story.

[[Image:Moritatenerzähler.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a Dutch ''{{lang|nl|liedjeszanger}}'' ("song-singer") and his ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' from the 17th or 18th century]]

In 16th-century [[Italy]], prayers would often be sung in the presence of illuminated scrolls while secular society produced the ''{{lang|it|cantambanco}}'' or "singing bench" where a person would stand on a bench point to pictures with a stick.

In [[Spain]] up to the 19th century there were blind men with a young "helper" who would make a living by going from town to town where they would display illustrations and the blind man would recite/sing the story, often about truculent crimes, while his helper pointed at the illustration relevant at that point. These were called "[[:es:Romances de ciego|romances de ciego]]" (blind man stories).

The singing bench migrated northward to Central and Northern Europe where it served as sensationalist quasi-news about murder, fires, death, affairs, sex scandals and the like. Performers of such controversial bench songs were seen as vagrants and troublemakers and were often arrested, exiled, or ostracised for their activities.

In [[Persia]], {{lang|fa-Latn|parda-dari}} (compare India's {{lang|hi-Latn|paradari}}) banner artists had the foresight to paint a handsome police officer in the corner as a fail-safe against the wrath of police harassment—the narrator would be relating the tale of a hero's exploits and when a cop would appear in the crowd the narrator would point to the cop on the banner and shower the character with flattery in the context of the story.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In [[Czechoslovakia]] banner shows were called ''{{lang|cs|kramářská píseň}}''. Most of them fell into an oblivion, with the notable exception of a parody song ''[[Cannoneer Jabůrek|Cannoneer {{lang|cs|Jabůrek|nocat=y}}]]''.

In [[Hungary]] the term is ''{{lang|hu|képmutogatás}}''.

In [[Germany]] [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] [[ballad]]eers performed ''{{lang|de|Moritat}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' (bench song) banner shows for four centuries until the [[Nazi]]s banned the practice in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The German ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' survives in {{lang|de|[[Bertolt Brecht]]}}'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' ({{lang-de|Die Dreigroschenoper}}) and in the performance work of {{lang|de|[[Peter Schumann]]}}.

==Picture stories elsewhere in the world==

In [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] [[Australia]] storytellers paint story sequences on tree bark and also on themselves for the purposes of performing the tale.

In the 19th century, giant scrolling [[moving panorama]] performances were performed throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]. The 20th century has seen cantastoria employed by the radical art, theater and puppetry movements to tell stories from perspectives outside of the mainstream media, especially by the [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]. Elements of picture storytelling can also be seen in the portable [[mural]]-[[posters]] of the [[Beehive Collective]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26673">{{short description|A form of computer-based test that adapts to the examinee's ability level}}
'''Computerized adaptive testing''' ('''CAT''') is a form of [[Computer-based assessment|computer-based]] [[Test (student assessment)|test]] that adapts to the examinee's ability level. For this reason, it has also been called '''tailored testing'''. In other words, it is a form of computer-administered test in which the next item or set of items selected to be administered depends on the correctness of the test taker's responses to the most recent items administered.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==

CAT successively selects questions for the purpose of maximizing the precision of the exam based on what is known about the examinee from previous questions.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Kingsbury | first2 = G. G. | year = 1984 | title = Application of computerized adaptive testing to educational problems | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Measurement | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 361–375 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1984.tb01040.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the examinee's perspective, the difficulty of the exam seems to tailor itself to their level of ability. For example, if an examinee performs well on an item of intermediate difficulty, they will then be presented with a more difficult question. Or, if they performed poorly, they would be presented with a simpler question. Compared to static [[multiple choice]] tests that nearly everyone has experienced, with a fixed set of items administered to all examinees, computer-adaptive tests require fewer test items to arrive at equally accurate scores.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury"/&gt;  (Of course, there is nothing about the CAT methodology that requires the items to be multiple-choice; but just as most exams are multiple-choice, most CAT exams also use this format.)

The basic computer-adaptive testing method is an [[Iteration|iterative]] [[algorithm]] with the following steps:&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"&gt;Thissen, D., &amp; Mislevy, R.J. (2000).  Testing Algorithms. In Wainer, H. (Ed.) Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Primer. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The pool of available items is searched for the optimal item, based on the current estimate of the examinee's ability
# The chosen item is presented to the examinee, who then answers it correctly or incorrectly
# The ability estimate is updated, based upon all prior answers
# Steps 1&amp;ndash;3 are repeated until a termination criterion is met

Nothing is known about the examinee prior to the administration of the first item, so the algorithm is generally started by selecting an item of medium, or medium-easy, difficulty as the first item.

As a result of adaptive administration, different examinees receive quite different tests.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, B.F. (2000). System design and operation. In Wainer, H. (Ed.) Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Primer. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The psychometric technology that allows equitable scores to be computed across different sets of items is [[item response theory]] (IRT).  IRT is also the preferred methodology for selecting optimal items which are typically selected on the basis of ''information'' rather than difficulty, per se.&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"/&gt;

In the United States, the [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] are currently primarily administered as a computer-adaptive test.  A list of active CAT programs is found at [http://www.iacat.org/ International Association for Computerized Adaptive Testing], along with a list of current CAT research programs and a near-inclusive bibliography of all published CAT research.

A related methodology called [[multistage testing]] (MST) or [[Computer adaptive sequential testing|CAST]] is used in the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]]. MST avoids or reduces some of the disadvantages of CAT as described below.  See the [http://www.leaonline.com/toc/ame/19/3 2006 special issue of Applied Measurement in Education]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for more information on MST.

==Advantages==

Adaptive tests can provide uniformly precise scores for most test-takers.&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy" /&gt;  In contrast, standard fixed tests almost always provide the best precision for test-takers of medium ability and increasingly poorer precision for test-takers with more extreme test scores.

An adaptive test can typically be shortened by 50% and still maintain a higher level of [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] than a fixed version.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt; This translates into a time savings for the test-taker.  Test-takers do not waste their time attempting items that are too hard or trivially easy.  Additionally, the testing organization benefits from the time savings; the cost of examinee seat time is substantially reduced.  However, because the development of a CAT involves much more expense than a standard fixed-form test, a large population is necessary for a CAT testing program to be financially fruitful.

Large target populations can generally be exhibited in scientific and research-based fields. CAT testing in these aspects may be used to catch early onset of disabilities or diseases. The growth of CAT testing in these fields has increased greatly in the past 10 years. Once not accepted in medical facilities and laboratories, CAT testing is now encouraged in the scope of diagnostics.

Like any [[computer-based testing|computer-based test]], adaptive tests may show results immediately after testing.

Adaptive testing, depending on the item selection [[algorithm]], may reduce exposure of some items because examinees typically receive different sets of items rather than the whole population being administered a single set.  However, it may increase the exposure of others (namely the medium or medium/easy items presented to most examinees at the beginning of the test).&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy" /&gt;

==Disadvantages==
The first issue encountered in CAT is the calibration of the item pool.  In order to model the characteristics of the items (e.g., to pick the optimal item), all the items of the test must be pre-administered to a sizable sample and then analyzed.  To achieve this, new items must be mixed into the operational items of an exam (the responses are recorded but do not contribute to the test-takers' scores), called "pilot testing", "pre-testing", or "seeding".&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy" /&gt;   This presents logistical, ethical, and security issues.  For example, it is impossible to field an operational adaptive test with brand-new, unseen items;&lt;ref name="WainerMislevy"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wainer, H.|author2=Mislevy, R.J.|year=2000|title=Item response theory, calibration, and estimation|editor=Wainer, H.|work=Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Primer|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;  all items must be pretested with a large enough sample to obtain stable item statistics.  This sample may be required to be as large as 1,000 examinees.&lt;ref name="WainerMislevy" /&gt; Each program must decide what percentage of the test can reasonably be composed of unscored pilot test items.

Although adaptive tests have ''exposure control'' algorithms to prevent overuse of a few items,&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy" /&gt;  the exposure conditioned upon ability is often not controlled and can easily become close to 1.  That is, it is common for some items to become very common on tests for people of the same ability.  This is a serious security concern because groups sharing items may well have a similar functional ability level.  In fact, a completely randomized exam is the most secure (but also least efficient).

Review of past items is generally disallowed.  Adaptive tests tend to administer easier items after a person answers incorrectly.  Supposedly, an astute test-taker could use such clues to detect incorrect answers and correct them.  Or, test-takers could be coached to deliberately pick wrong answers,  leading to an increasingly easier test.  After tricking the adaptive test into building a maximally easy exam, they could then review the items and answer them correctly—possibly achieving a very high score.  Test-takers frequently complain about the inability to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edres.org/scripts/cat/catdemo.htm|title=An On-line, Interactive, Computer Adaptive Testing Tutorial|author=Lawrence M. Rudner|work=EdRes.org/scripts/cat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the sophistication, the development of a CAT has a number of prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasttestweb.com/ftw-docs/CAT_Requirements.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152205/http://www.fasttestweb.com/ftw-docs/CAT_Requirements.pdf|archivedate=April 25, 2012|deadurl=y|title=Requirements of Computerized Adaptive Testing|work=FastTEST Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The large sample sizes (typically hundreds of examinees) required by IRT calibrations must be present.  Items must be scorable in real time if a new item is to be selected instantaneously.  Psychometricians experienced with IRT calibrations and CAT simulation research are necessary to provide validity documentation.  Finally, a software system capable of true IRT-based CAT must be available.

In a CAT with a time limit it is impossible for the examinee to accurately budget the time they can spend on each test item and to determine if they are on pace to complete a timed test section. Test takers may thus be penalized for spending too much time on a difficult question which is presented early in a section and then failing to complete enough questions to accurately gauge their proficiency in areas which are left untested when time expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-03/gmat-tip-adapting-to-a-computer-adaptive-test|title=GMAT Tip: Adapting to a Computer-Adaptive Test|date=April 3, 2013|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; While untimed CATs are excellent tools for formative assessments which guide subsequent instruction, they are unsuitable for summative assessments used to measure aptitude for jobs and educational programs.

==Components==

There are five technical components in building a CAT (the following is adapted from Weiss &amp; Kingsbury, 1984&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt; ).  This list does not include practical issues, such as item pretesting or live field release.

# Calibrated item pool
# Starting point or entry level
# Item selection [[algorithm]]
# Scoring procedure
# Termination criterion

===Calibrated item pool===
A pool of items must be available for the CAT to choose from.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;  Such items can be created in the traditional way (i.e., manually) or through [[Automatic Item Generation]]. The pool must be calibrated with a psychometric model, which is used as a basis for the remaining four components.  Typically, [[item response theory]] is employed as the psychometric model.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;  One reason item response theory is popular is because it places persons and items on the same metric (denoted by the Greek letter theta), which is helpful for issues in item selection (see below).

===Starting point===
In CAT, items are selected based on the examinee's performance up to a given point in the test.  However, the CAT is obviously not able to make any specific estimate of examinee ability when no items have been administered.  So some other initial estimate of examinee ability is necessary.  If some previous information regarding the examinee is known, it can be used,&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;  but often the CAT just assumes that the examinee is of average ability - hence the first item often being of medium difficulty.

===Item selection algorithm===
As mentioned previously, [[item response theory]] places examinees and items on the same metric.  Therefore, if the CAT has an estimate of examinee ability, it is able to select an item that is most appropriate for that estimate.&lt;ref name="WainerMislevy"/&gt;   Technically, this is done by selecting the item with the greatest ''information'' at that point.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt; [[Information]] is a function of the discrimination parameter of the item, as well as the conditional variance and pseudoguessing parameter (if used).

===Scoring procedure===
After an item is administered, the CAT updates its estimate of the examinee's ability level.  If the examinee answered the item correctly, the CAT will likely estimate their ability to be somewhat higher, and vice versa.  This is done by using the item response function from [[item response theory]] to obtain a [[likelihood function]] of the examinee's ability.  Two methods for this are called ''maximum likelihood estimation'' and ''Bayesian estimation''.  The latter assumes an ''a priori'' distribution of examinee ability, and has two commonly used estimators: ''expectation a posteriori'' and ''maximum a posteriori''. [[Maximum likelihood]] is equivalent to a Bayes maximum a posteriori estimate if a uniform (f(x)=1) prior is assumed.&lt;ref name="WainerMislevy"/&gt;  Maximum likelihood is asymptotically unbiased, but cannot provide a theta estimate for a nonmixed (all correct or incorrect) response vector, in which case a Bayesian method may have to be used temporarily.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;

===Termination criterion===
The CAT [[algorithm]] is designed to repeatedly administer items and update the estimate of examinee ability.  This will continue until the item pool is exhausted unless a termination criterion is incorporated into the CAT.  Often, the test is terminated when the examinee's standard error of measurement falls below a certain user-specified value, hence the statement above that an advantage is that examinee scores will be uniformly precise or "equiprecise."&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;   Other termination criteria exist for different purposes of the test, such as if the test is designed only to determine if the examinee should "Pass" or "Fail" the test, rather than obtaining a precise estimate of their ability.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinSpray2000"&gt;Lin, C.-J. &amp; Spray, J.A. (2000). Effects of item-selection criteria on classification testing with the sequential probability ratio test. (Research Report 2000-8). Iowa City, IA: ACT, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Pass-fail===
In many situations, the purpose of the test is to classify examinees into two or more [[mutually exclusive]] and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]] categories.  This includes the common "mastery test" where the two classifications are "pass" and "fail," but also includes situations where there are three or more classifications, such as "Insufficient," "Basic," and "Advanced" levels of knowledge or competency.  The kind of "item-level adaptive" CAT described in this article is most appropriate for tests that are not "pass/fail" or for pass/fail tests where providing good feedback is extremely important.  Some modifications are necessary for a pass/fail CAT, also known as a [[computerized classification test|computerized classification test (CCT)]].&lt;ref name="LinSpray2000" /&gt;  For examinees with true scores very close to the passing score, computerized classification tests will result in long tests while those with true scores far above or below the passing score will have shortest exams.

For example, a new termination criterion and scoring algorithm must be applied that classifies the examinee into a category rather than providing a point estimate of ability.  There are two primary methodologies available for this.  The more prominent of the two is the [[sequential probability ratio test]] (SPRT).&lt;ref name="Wald"&gt;Wald, A. (1947). Sequential analysis. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reckase"&gt;Reckase, M. D. (1983). A procedure for decision making using tailored testing. In D. J. Weiss (Ed.), New horizons in testing: Latent trait theory and computerized adaptive testing (pp. 237-254). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This formulates the examinee classification problem as a [[hypothesis test]] that the examinee's ability is equal to either some specified point above the [[cutscore]] or another specified point below the cutscore.  Note that this is a point hypothesis formulation rather than a composite hypothesis formulation&lt;ref name="Weitzman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = R. A. | year = 1982 | title = Sequential testing for selection | url = | journal = Applied Psychological Measurement | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 337–351 | doi=10.1177/014662168200600310}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is more conceptually appropriate.  A composite hypothesis formulation would be that the examinee's ability is in the region above the cutscore or the region below the cutscore.

A [[confidence interval]] approach is also used, where after each item is administered, the algorithm determines the probability that the examinee's true-score is above or below the passing score.&lt;ref name="KingsburyWeiss"&gt;Kingsbury, G.G., &amp; Weiss, D.J. (1983).  A comparison of IRT-based adaptive mastery testing and a sequential mastery testing procedure.  In D. J. Weiss (Ed.), New horizons in testing: Latent trait theory and computerized adaptive testing (pp. 237-254). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EggenStraetmans"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eggen | first1 = T. J. H. M | last2 = Straetmans | first2 = G. J. J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Computerized adaptive testing for classifying examinees into three categories | url = | journal = Educational and Psychological Measurement | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 713–734 | doi=10.1177/00131640021970862}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the algorithm may continue until the 95% [[confidence interval]] for the true score no longer contains the passing score.  At that point, no further items are needed because the pass-fail decision is already 95% accurate, assuming that the psychometric models underlying the adaptive testing fit the examinee and test. This approach was originally called "adaptive mastery testing"&lt;ref name="KingsburyWeiss"/&gt; but it can be applied to non-adaptive item selection and classification situations of two or more cutscores (the typical mastery test has a single cutscore).&lt;ref name="EggenStraetmans"/&gt;

As a practical matter, the algorithm is generally programmed to have a minimum and a maximum test length (or a minimum and maximum administration time). Otherwise, it would be possible for an examinee with ability very close to the cutscore to be administered every item in the bank without the algorithm making a decision.

The item selection algorithm utilized depends on the termination criterion.  Maximizing information at the cutscore is more appropriate for the SPRT because it maximizes the difference in the probabilities used in the [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]].&lt;ref name="SprayReckase"&gt;Spray, J. A., &amp; Reckase, M. D. (1994). The selection of test items for decision making with a computerized adaptive test.  Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the National Council for Measurement in Education (New Orleans, LA, April 5–7, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximizing information at the ability estimate is more appropriate for the confidence interval approach because it minimizes the conditional standard error of measurement, which decreases the width of the confidence interval needed to make a classification.&lt;ref name="EggenStraetmans" /&gt;

===Practical constraints of adaptivity===
[[Educational Testing Service|ETS]] researcher Martha Stocking has quipped that most adaptive tests are actually ''barely adaptive tests'' (BATs) because, in practice, many constraints are imposed upon item choice. For example, CAT exams must usually meet content specifications;&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"/&gt; a verbal exam may need to be composed of equal numbers of analogies, fill-in-the-blank and synonym item types. CATs typically have some form of item exposure constraints,&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"/&gt; to prevent the most informative items from being over-exposed.  Also, on some tests, an attempt is made to balance surface characteristics of the items such as [[gender]] of the people in the items or the ethnicities implied by their names.  Thus CAT exams are frequently constrained in which items it may choose and for some exams the constraints may be substantial and require complex search strategies (e.g., [[linear programming]]) to find suitable items.

A simple method for controlling item exposure is the "randomesque" or strata method. Rather than selecting the most informative item at each point in the test, the algorithm randomly selects the next item from the next five or ten most informative items.  This can be used throughout the test, or only at the beginning.&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"/&gt;  Another method is the Sympson-Hetter method,&lt;ref name="SympsonHetter"&gt;Sympson, B.J., &amp; Hetter, R.D. (1985). Controlling item-exposure rates in computerized adaptive testing.  Paper presented at the annual conference of the Military Testing Association, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a random number is drawn from U(0,1), and compared to a ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter determined for each item by the test user.  If the random number is greater than ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the next most informative item is considered.&lt;ref name="ThissenMislevy"/&gt;

Wim van der Linden and colleagues&lt;ref name="vanderLinden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Linden | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Veldkamp | first2 = B. P. | year = 2004 | title = Constraining item exposure in computerized adaptive testing with shadow tests | url = | journal = Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.3102/10769986029003273}}&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced an alternative approach called ''shadow testing'' which involves creating entire ''shadow tests'' as part of selecting items. Selecting items from shadow tests helps adaptive tests meet selection criteria by focusing on globally optimal choices (as opposed to choices that are optimal ''for a given item'').

===Multidimensional===

Given a set of items, a multidimensional computer adaptive test (MCAT) selects those items from the bank according to the estimated abilities of the student, resulting in an individualized test. MCATs seek to maximize the test's accuracy, based on multiple simultaneous examination abilities (unlike a computer adaptive test – CAT – which evaluates a single ability) using the sequence of items previously answered (Piton-Gonçalves and Aluisio, 2012).

New York, New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; grounded in teachers' displaying cultural competence: skill at teaching in a cross-cultural or multicultural setting.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, J., &amp; Moule, J. (2005). Cultural competence: A primer for educators, Thomson Wadsorth: Belmont, California.&lt;/ref&gt; They enable each student to relate course content to his or her cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Scherff, L., &amp; Spector, K. (2011). Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education: Lanham, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term often deals specifically with instruction of African American students in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ladson-Billings, Gloria (1994). The dreamkeepers: Successful teachers of African American children. Jossey-Bass Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been proven to be an effective form of pedagogy for students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. For instance, in Canada, research reflects the need to bridge the gap between traditional Aboriginal education and Western education systems by including spirituality in Aboriginal educational practices.  By making education culturally relevant, it is thought to improve academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curwin | first1 = D | last2 = Lynda | first2 = A | year = 2003 | title = A missing link: Between traditional aboriginal education and the western system of education | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 144–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of this practice is undertaken in a primary or secondary school setting, Baumgartner and Johnson-Bailey (2008), have experienced the implementation and discussions of culturally relevant teaching within a higher education environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumgartner | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Johnson-Bailey | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Fostering awareness of diversity and multiculturism in adult and higher education | url = | journal = New Directions for Continuing Education | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 45–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Context==
Culturally relevant teaching was made popular by [[Gloria Ladson-Billings|Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings]] in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the term she created was defined as one "that empowers students to maintain cultural integrity, while succeeding academically."&lt;ref&gt;Ladson-Billings, Gloria (1995a).  Toward a theory of culturally relevant pedagogy.  American Research Journal.  32(3) 465-491.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culturally relevant pedagogy can also be found in the literature as “culturally appropriate” (Au &amp; Jordan, 1981), “culturally congruent” (Mohatt &amp; Erickson, 1981), “culturally responsive” (Au, 2009; Cazden &amp; Leggett, 1981; Erickson &amp; Mohatt, 1982; Lee, 1998), and “culturally compatible” (Jordan, 1985; Vogt, Jordan &amp; Tharp, 1987).  Ladson-Billings (1992) also provides some clarification between critical and culturally relevant pedagogy, with the difference being that culturally relevant pedagogy urges collective action grounded in cultural understanding, experiences, and ways of knowing the world. This has become more widely known and accepted in the education field. For example, the U.S. Department of Education's Equity Assistance Centers, such as the Equity Alliance at [[Arizona State University|ASU]] help states, school districts and schools to establish the conditions for equitable educational outcomes for all students, using cultural responsiveness as one of the measures of the needed capabilities of teachers, principals and school communities as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Equity Alliance (2011). The Equity Alliance at ASU. Retrieved from http://www.equityallianceatasu.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 
The theory surrounding culturally relevant teaching is connected to a larger body of knowledge on [[multicultural education]] and helping culturally diverse students excel in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castagno | first1 = A. | last2 = Brayboy | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Culturally responsive schooling for indigenous youth: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 941–993 | doi = 10.3102/0034654308323036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers argue that there are gaps in academic achievement between mainstream culture and immigrants or ethnic cultural groups. Early theories suggest, the disconnect between these groups were due to student/teacher language difficulties or that ethnic cultures don’t value education as heavily as the Western culture does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmeichel | first1 = Mardi | year = 2012 | title = Good teaching?

In her landmark book, ''Culturally Responsive Teaching: Theory, Research, and Practice'', Geneva Gay expanded the traditional view of culture beyond race and ethnicity.  She wrote, "Even without being consciously aware of it, culture determines how we think, believe, and behave" &lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching: Theory, research, and practice (2nd Ed.). New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, culture is a student's beliefs, motivations, and even social groups and norms.  Thus, the teacher who practices culturally relevant teaching understands that culture manifests in a variety of adaptations within how students prefer to learn.  A culturally responsive teacher uses differentiated instruction to tailor learning to every aspect of a student's culture.

Many of these researchers and educators support the [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist theories of education]] because such perspectives recognize the value of multiple cultural viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006). Becoming culturally responsive educators: Rethinking teacher education pedagogy. National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011338/http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In constructivism, learners are taught to question, challenge, and critically analyze information rather than blindly accept what it taught; which leads to exactly the type of teaching advocated by the originators of culturally relevant teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J.A. (2004). Multicultural education: Historical development, dimensions, and practice. In J.A. Banks &amp; C.A.M. Banks, Handbook of research on multicultural education (2nd Ed., pp. 3 - 29). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;  James Banks lays out 5 dimensions of multicultural education.  These dimensions laid the foundation for the move toward culturally relevant teaching.  The first dimension is content integration where teachers make a conscious effort to represent a variety of cultures in the curriculum and teaching.  The second dimension of knowledge construction asks learners to begin questioning and critically analyzing the biased, and previously accepted, curriculum.  In the third dimension, the teaching focus shifts to encouraging cross-cultural interactions in an effort to reduce prejudice.  By the fourth dimension, equitable pedagogy, the teacher uses culturally relevant teaching to change teaching approaches.  The purpose of Banks' fourth dimension is to tailor teaching methods to ensure success of students from all cultures.  If successful, the fourth dimension and culturally relevant teaching will manifest into Banks' fifth dimension of an empowered school culture.  It is in this stage when teachers and learners critically examine the institution of education for inequities. Banks' fourth and fifth dimensions are the perfect example of culturally relevant teaching.  Teachers who achieve these dimensions, and thus fully realize the impact of culturally relevant teaching, cherish learners who question, seek answers through inquiry, and embrace a mindset of social justice.  All of which are the key components of constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, D.J., &amp; Thornton, S.J. (2009). The curriculum studies reader, 3rd Ed. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Scheurich believes that culturally relevant pedagogy has a significant importance on our youth because it benefits students no matter what the ethnic background or culture of the students. In a video James Scheurich explains how the success of our country is in the hand of our children and in a society where students of color will no longer be the minority, he expresses how teachers must teach to their audience in order for students to be successful.

In multicultural cities like Toronto, Ontario CRP is currently being used in arts-education alongside other pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, that encourage authenticity, reclaiming personal power, and self-love through exploration of one's own familial and ethnic history.

== Characteristics ==

A number of authors, including Gay and Lipman have identified characteristics of culturally responsive teaching. These characteristics are:

#'''Validating and Affirming:''' Culturally responsive teaching is validating and affirming because it acknowledges the strengths of students’ diverse heritages&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 31)&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Comprehensive''': Culturally responsive teaching is comprehensive because it uses "cultural resources to teach knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 32); Hollins, E. (1996). Culture in school learning: Revealing the deep meaning. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers, Mahwah, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Multidimensional''': Culturally responsive teaching encompasses many areas and applies multicultural theory to the classroom environment, teaching methods, and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 32)&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Liberating''': Culturally responsive teachers liberate students.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, P. (1995). Bringing out the best in them: The contribution of culturally relevant teachers to education reform. Theory into Practice, 34(3), 202-208. Retrieved from: http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED374173.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Empowering''': Culturally responsive teaching empower students, giving them opportunities to excel in the classroom and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gay | first1 = G | year = 2010 | title = Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 34); Castagno, A., &amp; Brayboy, B. (2008). Culturally responsive schooling for indigenous youth: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 941–993 | doi = 10.3102/0034654308323036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Empowerment translates into academic competence, personal confidence, courage, and the will to act."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally Responsive Teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 34)&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Transformative''': Culturally responsive teaching is transformative because educators and their students must often defy educational traditions and the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally Responsive Teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press. (Page 36); Ladson-Billings, Gloria (1994). The dreamkeepers: Successful teachers of African American children. Jossey-Bass Publishing;Scherff, L., &amp; Spector, K. (2011). Culturally relevant pedagogy, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education: Lanham, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP)==
#'''Identity Development''': Good teaching comes from those who are true to their identity (including genetic, socioeconomic, educational and cultural influences) and integrity (self-acceptance).  Teachers who are comfortable with themselves and teach within their identity and integrity are able to make student connections and bring subjects alive.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Parker. (1998). The heart of a teacher: Identity and integrity in teaching. In, Courage to teach. (pp. 9-34). San Francisco: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is critical for the student-teacher connection when implementing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Equity and Excellence''': Within this principle the following concepts are addressed: "dispositions, incorporation of multicultural curriculum content, equal access, and high expectations."&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The integration of excellence and equity in CRP is predicated upon establishing a curriculum that is inclusive of students cultural experiences, and setting high expectations for the students to reach.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#'''Developmental Appropriateness''': Several concepts collectively define Developmental Appropriateness within the context of CRP. These concepts include, "...learning styles, teaching styles, and cultural variation in psychological needs (motivation, morale, engagement, collaboration)."&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to assess students cognitive development progress and incorporate learning activities within the lesson plan that are challenging and culturally relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Teaching the Whole Child''': Similar to 'Developmental Appropriateness', 'Teaching the Whole Child' is a theme that includes the concepts of "skill development in a cultural context, home-school-community collaboration, learning outcomes, supportive learning community and empowerment."&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; When teaching a child wholly, educators must be cognizant of the socio-cultural influences that have attributed to the learning progress of that child even before they enter the classroom. These outside influences must naturally be accounted for when designing a culturally relevant curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011).

Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Student Teacher Relationships''': The theme of Student-Teacher Relationship within the context of CRP aligns itself closely with the concepts of "caring, relationships, interaction, and classroom atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011). Toward a Conceptual Framework of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: an Overview of the Conceptual and Theoretical Literature. Teacher Education Quarterly. V38 N1 p65-84. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators must combine the willingness to bond with their students with the desire to grow that relationship into one vested in personal care and professional vigilance. Students must feel that the teacher has their best interest at heart to succeed in implementing CRP.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Jeffy, S. &amp; Cooper, J. E. (2011).

Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ914924.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Manage Student Emotions''': When teaching adult learners it is also important to exhibit Culturally Relevant Pedagogies.  Educators must be prepared to manage students that may have strong emotional experiences to culturally diverse readings &lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, L.M. and Johnson-Bailey, J. (2008). Fostering awareness of diversity and multiculturism in adult and higher education.  New Directions for Continuing Education. 120. 45-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive emotions may enhance the learning experience, whereas negative emotions may cause discourse and prevent students from engaging &lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, L.M. and Johnson-Bailey, J. (2008). Fostering awareness of diversity and multiculturism in adult and higher education.  New Directions for Continuing Education. 120. 45-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Educators should explore strong emotions, particularly in adult learners, and use it as a cultural teachable moment.

==Suggested Teaching Strategies==
In order to be culturally relevant, teachers must create an accommodating and inviting classroom culture, if they are to reach diverse audiences. Classrooms have become more and more diverse as generations of students enter the school system, so it has become increasingly important to integrate cultural awareness in the classroom. Teachers must demonstrate that they care for their students and their cultural needs, because a genuine attitude of interest is likely to yield positive emotions that empower and motivate students.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One way teachers can make their classroom less intimidating is through '''[[reciprocal teaching]]''', where students and teachers take turns leading the class discussions. In this method, the students' voice is heard, and the classroom teacher becomes more of a facilitator than a "director". Students then feel more empowered, and autonomous in their own learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. (2008). Teaching by creating cognitive apprenticeship in classrooms and beyond. In Learning and instruction, (pp. 458-489). 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocal teaching  such as through this method, gives students the opportunity to express the material according to their cultural viewpoints, which is very important according to the constructivist and progressive educator.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006). Becoming culturally responsive educators: Rethinking teacher education pedagogy. National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011338/http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintaining Relationships==
Gloria Ladson-Billings has several research projects and articles where she interviewed diverse schools. She mainly focused on low socioeconomic schools. After identifying several exceptional teachers in public schools in low-socioeconomic, mostly African American school districts, Ladson-Billings spent time observing and trying to explain their success with students who are typically pushed to the margins by public education. Ladson-Billings found that all of the teachers shared pride in and commitment to their profession and had an underlying belief that all children could be successful.The participating teachers maintained relationships with their students that were “fluid and equitable” and often attended community events in order to demonstrate support for their students. These teachers also believed in creating bonds with students and developing a “community of learners,” which means that all students worked collaboratively to become responsible for each other's learning. Ladson-Billings maintains that in order for teachers to use culturally relevant pedagogy successfully, they must also show respect for students and “understand the need for the students to operate in the dual worlds of their home community and the white community.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coffey|first1=Heather|title=Culturally relevant teaching|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/4474|website=Learnnc.org|publisher=UNC|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, many educators recommend '''[[cooperative learning]]''' methods as effective teaching strategies to promote culturally relevant learning.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, J., &amp; Moule, J. (2005). Cultural competence: A primer for educators, Thomson Wadsorth: Belmont, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than fostering competitiveness among students, group learning strategies encourage collaboration in the completion of assignments. This way students learn to work together towards common goals. Students learn important skills such as teamwork, and embracing other learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. (2008). Teaching by creating cognitive apprenticeship in classrooms and beyond. In Learning and instruction, (pp. 458-489). 2nd ed.

There have been many studies done in response to how students respond to teachers that exhibit the above characteristics, incorporating the principles and use of these strategies within the classroom. In the article "Telling Their Side of the Story: African American Students' Perceptions of Culturally Relevant Teaching." &lt;ref&gt;Howard,Tyrone C. (2001).

Retrieved from http://curriculumstudies.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/51210877/Howard2001TellingTheirSide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrone C. Howard looked at the "perceptions and interpretations" of students who have experienced this type of learning environment. The qualitative data which included students response, is evidence that this is a positive and effective form of pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Howard,Tyrone C. (2001).

'''Games and cross-cultural activities''' allow students personal interaction with different cultures. For instance, in the three-hour game, "Ba Fa Ba Fa", students participate in one of two very different cultures and must learn the languages and customs of that cultural group. Similar to this activity, is the program "Tribes" implemented into many elementary classrooms, to help stunts understand their school and classroom as unique and diverse communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H.

Other suggested strategies include '''family history research''' where students interview family members and learn about familial cultural influences on their own lives, and '''[[reflective writing]]''' where students write about  and share their beliefs and cultural assumptions. Meta-reflection through these activities is very important to student learning, about themselves and their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006).

Learning about new cultures through this activity can be very engaging for students.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006).

It is very important that teachers advocate for students sharing their own personal experiences with their classmates. This allows students to learn more about one another and new cultures in general. As a teacher prepares to implement culturally relevant teaching into the classroom, it is most effective for the teacher to recognize the student's diversity and incorporate their backgrounds into the lesson and classroom environment. The 21st century classroom, and learner are always evolving, and it is important that our students are global thinkers. Understanding and embracing the variety of cultural backgrounds which make up a classroom is pivotal to lifelong learning, and developing transformative skills for life beyond the education system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.education.com/reference/article/culturally-relevant-pedagogy/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Using Technology to Promote CRT'''

Optimistically, technology offers the unique chance for educators to bridge the curriculum of school to the 21st century learner, as culturally relevant teaching intends. The most significant barrier to the implementation of culturally relevant teaching has been the prevailing disconnect between school learning and the real-world needs of students - particularly minority students.  Yet, when used correctly, "computer technology can provide students with an excellent tool for applying concepts in a variety of contexts, thereby breaking the artificial isolation of school subject matter from the real-world situations" &lt;ref&gt;Roschelle, J., Pea, D., Hoadley, C., Gordin, D., &amp; Means, B. (2000).  Changing how and what children learn in school with computer-based technologies. Children and Computer Technology. 10 (2) 76 - 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Technology permeates the real-world environment of the 21st century student.  It is literally integral in the culture of the digital native learner.  According to their literature review, Conole et al. found that for today's students, technology is transferable, integrated, personalized, organized, adaptive, and pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;Conole, G., de Laat, M., Dillon, T., &amp; Darby, J. (2008). Disruptive technologies, pedagogical innovation: What's new? Findings from an in-depth study of students use and perception of technology. Computers and Education. (50) 511 - 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today's student is continuously connected and in many cases far more of an expert than their teacher.  Thus, if schools utilize technology, the curriculum becomes truly relevant and responsive to the learner of the 21st century.  In school learning mirrors the learning they engage in outside of school.

With technology, students possess the ability to connect and interact with colleagues, across the globe, who share their views and beliefs.  In interviews, digital natives report that, "lost cost communication technologies such as Skype, MSN chat, and email were considered invaluable forms of communication." &lt;ref&gt;Conole, G., de Laat, M., Dillon, T., &amp; Darby, J. (2008) Disruptive technologies, pedagogical innovation: What's new? Findings from an in-depth study of students use and perception of technology. Computers and Education. (50) 511 - 524.&lt;/ref&gt; With technology, learners are able to form social groups and engage in cross-cultural interactions that provide instant feedback and learning challenges beyond the capacity of a single textbook, classroom, or neighborhood.  These cross-cultural interactions, nearly impossible before global technologies, lead to the depth of questioning and critical thought needed to be successful in the 21st century, global society.  In short, students use social networking and technological connections to connect with social and cultural peers but ultimately engage in interactions with members of a variety of cultural groups.  These interactions can be quite empowering for modern learners.

The 21st century learner is what Neil Selwyn refers to as an, "empowered digital native".&lt;ref&gt;Selwyn, N. (2009). The digital native - myth and reality. Institute of Education. 61 (4) 364 - 379.&lt;/ref&gt;  This empowered learner is no longer held hostage to the culturally insensitive curriculum of public schools.  In contrast, they are proficient at using technology to tailor their own learning.  Within seconds, learners can access a wealth of information and knowledge and no longer must trust solely the limited perspective presented in their textbook. The 21st century learner is accustomed to using technology to challenge preconceived information.  "Research indicates that computer technology can help support learning, and that it is especially useful in developing the higher-order skills of critical thinking analysis, and scientific inquiry." &lt;ref&gt;Roschelle, J., Pea, D., Hoadley, C., Gordin, D., &amp; Means, B. (2000).  Changing how and what children learn in school with computer-based technologies. Children and Computer Technology. 10 (2) 76 - 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearly, technology offers the potential of helping students achieve and benefit from culturally relevant teaching.

Other suggested best practices in teaching race and diversity into the curriculum are:

1.  Create a positive learning environment:  attentive skills, teaching skills, and teacher/student interaction (Radical Pedagogy, 2003).

2.  Utilize a diverse curriculum (Gollnick and Chinn, 2013).

3.  Know, understand, and work with families that come from different race and ethnicities (Gonzalez-Mena and Pulido-Tobiassen, 1999).

4.  Expose children to role models from their own culture as well as those from other cultures (Gonzalez-Mena and Pulido-Tobiassen, 1999).

5.  Utilize student's cultures to help them learn the subjects and skills taught in school (Gollnick and Chinn, 2013).

6.  Start teaching multi-cultural education to students at an early age (Russel, 2007).
&lt;ref&gt;Gollnick, D. and Chinn, P. (2013). Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society. Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Mena, J. and Pulido-Tobiassen, D.

Retrieved October 31, 2012 from www.radicalpedagogy.icaap.org.content/issues5_1/02_grant.html&lt;/ref&gt;

7. Use literacy and children's books in the classroom to promote culturally relevant teaching. By using texts that have characters of all different backgrounds, students can easily learn about new cultures (Ladson-Billings, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00405849209543558 | volume=31 | title=Reading between the lines and beyond the pages: A culturally relevant approach to literacy teaching | journal=Theory Into Practice | pages=312–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to Culturally Relevant Teaching==

Not all educators favor culturally relevant teaching. Indeed, there are many practical challenges to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy including a lack of enforcement of culturally relevant teaching methods, and the tendency to view students as individual units only, rather than seeing them as linked inseparably with their cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2010). Culturally responsive teaching, 2nd Ed. New York, New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In culturally relevant pedagogy, new teachers must be taught how to adapt their curriculum, methodology, teaching methods, and instructional materials to connect with students’ values and cultural norms. Therefore, another challenge for educators is to prepare reflective practitioners who can connect with diverse students and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006). Becoming culturally responsive educators: Rethinking teacher education pedagogy. National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems.  Retrieved from http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though some schools of education acknowledge credibility in training culturally relevant educators, many wrestle with how fit such training into their program and "grudgingly add a diversity course to their curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;Kea, C., Campbell-Whatley, G., &amp; Richards, H. (2006). Becoming culturally responsive educators: Rethinking teacher education pedagogy. National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011338/http://www.niusileadscape.org/docs/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}. (Page 3).&lt;/ref&gt; One contributor to this reluctance comes from the education professors’ discomfort with or fear of addressing issues such as racism in their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran-Smith, M. (2004). Walking the road: Race, diversity, and social justice in teacher education. New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
"The student population of America's classrooms has changed. Currently, 43% of students in our nation's schools come from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Latinos account for 20% of the school population and Blacks 17%. Nationally, white students now represent 57% of public school enrollment, down from 61% in the 1993-94 school year.  Given these demographics, [[Kenneth Fasching-Varner]] and Vanessa Dodo-Seriki have suggested that disconnects in teacher and student identity lead to "Free and Reduced Pedagogy," or a non-student first approach that reduces students to cultural differences, discrediting students based on their identitites and differences in identities between teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;Fasching-Varner, K.J., Dodo-Seriki, V.C. (2012). Moving beyond seeing with our eyes wide shut: A response to  "There is no culturally responsive teaching spoken here." Democracy and Education, 20(1), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the largest school districts, half or more of the students are non-white. Demographic projections predict that cultural and ethnic diversity will increase. Students of color will become the majority in the United States by 2023." (James Scheurich, N/A)&lt;ref&gt;Scheurich James. (N/A). Why is culturally relevant pedagogy important.

==Examples of Culturally Relevant Programs==
There are many examples of culturally relevant programs:
[[Advancement Via Individual Determination|Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID)]] is a program from the San Diego (California) public schools that helps underrepresented students (including those from different cultural groups) by mixing low-achieving students with high-achieving students in college preparation programs. "AVID employs many principles of cooperative learning in its "writing, inquiry, and collaboration" approach to curriculum and instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mehan, H. (1996). Constructing school success. The consequences of untracking low-achieving students. New York: Cambridge University Press. (Abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another California-based group focused on culturally relevant teaching is the Umoja Community.&lt;ref name="Umoja"&gt;{{cite web |title=Umoja Community |url=http://umojacommunity.org/ |website=Umoja Community |accessdate=24 September 2018 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program roots itself in the principles and practices of Culturally Relevant Teaching. Umoja works with students, colleges and the community to promote awareness, instill values and provide the foundations needed to achieve success, particularly for African American students, although it is committed to helping all students. The Umoja Community is recognized by the California Community Colleges Board of Directors and helps serve over 2,000 students a year.&lt;ref name="Umoja"/&gt;

The Russian Mission School in Alaska incorporates Native American culture with the standard curriculum and emphasizes hands-on activities that are relevant to their local lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castagno | first1 = A. | last2 = Brayboy | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Culturally responsive schooling for indigenous youth: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 941–993 | doi = 10.3102/0034654308323036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her book ''The Dreamkeepers: Successful Teachers of African American Children'', [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]] presents several examples of excellent cultural relevant teaching in African American classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Ladson-Billings, Gloria (1994).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6242">[[File:Elagabalium - pianta.svg|thumb|Plan of the Elagabalium. On the lower-left the plan of the church of [[San Sebastiano al Palatino]].]]
The '''Elagabalium''' was a temple built by the Roman emperor [[Elagabalus]], located on the north-east corner of the [[Palatine Hill]]. During Elagabalus' reign from 218 until 222, the Elagabalium was the center of a controversial religious cult, dedicated to [[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]], of which the emperor himself was the high priest.

== History ==
The temple was a colonnaded structure some 70 metres by 40 metres, in front of the [[Flavian Amphitheatre|Colosseum]], within a colonnaded enclosure. The temple platform was originally built under [[Domitian]] between 81 and 96, and may have been a place of worship to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Zoonen |first=Lauren |title=Temple of Elagabal |url=http://www.livius.org/a/italy/rome/t_heliogabalus/temple_elagabal.html |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=2007-08-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073703/http://www.livius.org/a/italy/rome/t_heliogabalus/temple_elagabal.html |archivedate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of this terrace are still visible today at the north-east corner of the [[Palatine Hill]].

When Elagabalus became emperor in 218 the temple was expanded and rededicated to the god [[El-Gabal]], the patron deity of his homeplace [[Emesa]] in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-5"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre505.html V.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Elagabalus renamed the god ''[[Elagabalus Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'' and personally led a cult that worshipped this deity. Deus Sol Invictus was personified by a conical [[baetylus|black stone]], which has been suggested to have been a piece of [[meteorite]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre503.html#3_5 V.3.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Elagabalus' death the temple was again dedicated to Jupiter by [[Severus Alexander]]. A second, smaller temple to the god El-Gabal was built where the church of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] now stands. If still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]].

== The cult of Elagabalus ==
[[File:Elagabalus Aureus Sol Invictus.png|thumb|right|300px|Roman [[aureus]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Sanct Deo Soli Elagabal'', and depicts a [[quadriga|four-horse]], gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the [[Emesa]] temple.]]
Since the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], sun worship had increased throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Halsberghe | first = Gaston H. | title = The Cult of Sol Invictus | year = 1972 | location = Leiden | page = 36 |publisher= Brill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elagabalus saw this as an opportunity to set up his god, El-Gabal, as the chief deity of the [[Dii Consentes|Roman pantheon]]. El-Gabal, renamed ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'' or ''God the Undefeated Sun'', was placed over even [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxx-11"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of the union between the two religions, Elagabalus gave either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]], [[Urania]], or some combination of the three, to El-Gabal as a wife.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodian]] writes that Elagabalus forced senators to watch while he danced around the altar of El-Gabal to the sound of drums and cymbals,&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/&gt; and that each summer [[solstice]] became a great festival to El-Gabal popular with the masses because of its widely distributed food.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/&gt; During this festival, Elagabalus placed El-Gabal on a [[chariot]] adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city, after which he threw gifts into the Roman crowds:&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After thus bringing the god out and placing him in the temple, Heliogabalus performed the rites and sacrifices described above; then, climbing to the huge, lofty towers which he had erected, he threw down, indiscriminately, cups of gold and silver, clothing, and cloth of every type to the mob below.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the [[Ancile|Shields]] of the [[Salii]] and the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 I.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient history records lurid tales of [[human sacrifice]] taking place inside the temple, involving children which were collected all over [[Italica|Italy]] from the richest and noblest families.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#8 I.8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casssius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11.3 LXXX.11.3]&lt;/ref&gt; The religious excesses of Elagabalus' reign eventually contributed to his demise. On March 11, 222, Elagabalus was killed by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and replaced by his cousin [[Severus Alexander]]. Elagabalus' religious edicts were reversed, and the statues which had been moved to the Elagabalium were restored to their original shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre601.html VI.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9612">{{Genocide}}
'''Ethnocide''' refers to [[cultural genocide|extermination of national culture]] as a [[genocide]] component.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoC2-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DelantyKumar2006"/&gt;

Reviewing the legal and academic history of usage of the terms genocide and ethnocide, [[Bartolomé Clavero]] differentiates between them in that "Genocide kills people while ethnocide kills social cultures through the killing of individual souls".&lt;ref name="Clavero2008"/&gt; In addition, "since cultural genocide can only be the cultural dimension ''of'' genocide", the idea of ethnocide is more than just "cultural genocide", but also part of broader genocidal process.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Shaw|title=What is Genocide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVnl-HgG4QEC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=20 March 2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3182-0|pages=65–67|quote=So the idea of ethnocide as 'cultural genocide' distinct from physically violent genocide is misleading, since cultural genocide can only be the cultural dimension ''of'' genocide, something which is integral to every genocidal attack. ... It is better to refer to cultural suppression for pre-genocidal denial of culture, the cultural dimension of genocide for suppression that is part of broader genocidal process, and unintentional group destruction for cases where groups are destroyed by disease and famine that are originally unintended.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because concepts such as [[cultural genocide]] and ethnocide have been used in different contexts, the anthropology of genocide examines their inclusion and exclusion in law and policies.&lt;ref name="BloxhamMoses2010"/&gt;

==Origin of the word==
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
[[Raphael Lemkin]], the linguist and lawyer who coined ''genocide'' in 1943 as the union of "the Greek word ''genos'' (race, tribe) and the Latin ''cide'' (killing)", also suggested ''ethnocide'' as an alternative form representing the same concept, using the Greek ''ethnos'' (nation) in place of ''genos''.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-1"/&gt; However, the term genocide has received much wider adoption than ethnocide.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"/&gt;

==Usage==
As early as 1933, lawyer Raphael Lemkin proposed a cultural component to genocide, which he called "cultural genocide".&lt;ref name="AutoC2-2"/&gt; The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage.

The drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but dropped it from their consideration.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-3"/&gt; The legal definition of [[genocide]] is left unspecific about the exact nature in which genocide is done only that it is destruction with intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-4"/&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] uses both the word "ethnocide" and the phrase "cultural genocide" but does not define what they mean.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-5"/&gt; The complete article reads as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and [[cultural genocide]], including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions "genocide", not "cultural genocide", although the article is otherwise unchanged.

==Notions of ethnocide==

===UNESCO===
In [[UNESCO]] "Declaration of San Jose":&lt;ref name="Schabas2000"/&gt;

{{quote|Ethnocide means that an ethnic group is denied the right to enjoy, develop and transmit its own culture and its own language, whether collectively or individually. This involves an extreme form of massive violation of human rights and, in particular, the right of ethnic groups to respect for their cultural identity.}}

===Robert Jaulin===
{{main|Robert Jaulin#The concept of ethnocide}}
The French ethnologist [[Robert Jaulin]] (1928-1996) proposed a redefinition of the concept of ethnocide in 1970, to refer not  the ''means'' but the ''ends'' that define ethnocide.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-6"/&gt; Accordingly, the ethnocide would be the systematic destruction of the thought and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the ethnocide kills them in their spirit.

'''''Fortress America''''' is a strategic [[board game]] designed by [[Michael Gray (game designer)|Michael Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.costik.com/justice.html
 | title=Simple Justice
 | publisher=[[Greg Costikyan]]
 | accessdate=2009-08-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and published in [[1986 in games|1986]] by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]]. ''Fortress America'' was the fourth of five games in the ''[[Gamemaster (board game series)|Gamemaster]]'' series.

==Overview==
Set in the 21st century, the board game begins with the premise that during the [[Cold War]], nuclear [[Terrorism|terrorists]] destroyed much of the [[Middle East]]'s supply of oil.  In response, the [[United States]] launched into orbit a satellite based [[Solar power|solar-power]] system to solve the [[energy crisis]].  At the same time, the U.S. had perfected the so-called "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" technology and incorporated a satellite-based laser system into the solar satellites.  This system was capable of destroying [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs) before impact. Thus, the USA was completely safe from nuclear threat, ending the era of [[Mutual Assured Destruction]].

This creates a great deal of political turmoil - the [[USSR]] is especially upset at the nuclear [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] being shifted - and while the rest of the world realigns in various ways (through alliances and treaties as well as conventional military conflict) the United States, complacent in its technical superiority, becomes [[Isolationism|isolationist]] in nature.

The game opens with the world divided into three major [[world power]]s outside of the US:

1) The [[Asia|Asian]] Peoples Alliance (yellow player)

2) The [[Central America|Central American]] Federation (blue player)

3) The [[Western Europe|Euro]]-[[Eastern Bloc|Socialist]] Pact (red player)

These three powers have launched a surprise [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]] on the now-conventionally-weak United States: Asian invaders on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]], Central American invaders along the [[Mexico–United States border|Southwestern border]] with [[Mexico]], and the Euro-Soviet invaders along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].  The [[United States Navy]] is brushed aside. The [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], still capable of resistance, are nevertheless insufficient to halt the multi-pronged invasions.

The unique nature of this game is the notion of three of four players cooperating for the elimination of one player (the US). The game has an interesting dynamic of the US player being outnumbered 3:1 in military strength but steadily being reinforced by laser relay towers which each have a 60% chance to destroy an enemy unit anywhere on the board each turn. The rules of [[combat]] also favor the defender.  Also, the invaders must place their reinforcements, which arrive on an even basis over the first few turns and then run out entirely, in their own invasion zones, which are sometimes far from the [[Front (military)|front]], while the U.S. never runs out and can often be reinforced right at the front.  The American player receives reinforcements by drawing two cards per turn, which sometimes specify for [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] or military forces to appear behind enemy lines.  Others allow the U.S. to reconstruct shattered units from the dead pile in home cities, while all invading units are permanently out of play when lost in combat.  The result is a game that - if played well by all players - will result in a very close contest.  There are 30 cities represented on the board and the invaders must capture, and hold until the end of an entire turn, 18 or more of them to win the game.  This allows the U.S. one round to counterattack and recapture after all the invaders have played a round and temporarily achieved their goal of 18.

==Original Milton Bradley release==
Commercially, this was considered to be the third most successful board game in Milton Bradley's ''Gamemaster Series'' placing it in the middle of the pack. However, world events and popular culture and Hollywood have influenced a small resurgence in the game's popularity evidenced by the 2012 remake and re-issue.  In 1987, ''Fortress America'' won the [[Charles S. Roberts Award]] for ''Best 20th Century Game of 1986''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original game also had two different covers.  The first had an image which resembled [[Saddam Hussein]] and the other cover replaced the Saddam look-a-like with a bearded and sunglasses-wearing version.

==Fantasy Flight Game Release==
In 2012 [[Fantasy Flight Games]] released a remake of Fortress America with a few design changes.  A few new rule changes have been implemented.  The game now has a fixed maximum number of turns. Mechanized units can "transport" foot units. A few objectives were changed on the map. Reflecting population shifts, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] are no longer depicted, [[Las Vegas]] and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] have been added, plus resource areas were juggled. The attackers have optional event cards. A few of the old cards were changed, and one new "free laser complex" card was added for a total of 31 cards.

The '''GloFish''' is a [[patent]]ed and [[trademark]]ed brand of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] fluorescent fish. A variety of different GloFish are currently on the market. [[Zebrafish]] were the first GloFish available in pet stores, and are now sold in bright red, green, orange-yellow, blue, and purple [[fluorescent]] colors. Recently "Electric Green", "Sunburst Orange", "Moonrise Pink", "Starfire Red", "Cosmic Blue", and "Galactic Purple" colored [[tetras|tetra]] (''[[Gymnocorymbus ternetzi]]''), an "Electric Green" tiger barb (''[[Puntius tetrazona]]'')&lt;ref name=gf&gt;{{cite web | title=GloFish web page | url=http://www.glofish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a glo-Rainbow Shark (''[[Rainbow shark|Epalzeorhynchos frenatum]])'' have been added to the lineup. Although not originally developed for the ornamental fish trade, it is one of the first genetically modified animals to become publicly available. It is sold only in the United States, where it remains the only genetically modified animal to be publicly available. The rights to GloFish are owned by Spectrum Brands, Inc., which purchased GloFish from Yorktown Technologies, the original developer of GloFish, in May 2017.

== History ==

=== Early development ===
[[File:Zebrafisch.jpg|thumb|right|An ordinary Zebra Danio]]
The original zebrafish (or zebra danio, ''Danio rerio'') is a native of rivers in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. It measures three centimeters long and has gold and dark blue stripes.

In 1999, Dr. Zhiyuan Gong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/staff/gong.htm|title=NUS - National University of Singapor|work=nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues at the [[National University of Singapore]] were working with a gene that encodes the [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), originally extracted from a [[jellyfish]], that naturally produced bright green [[fluorescence]]. They inserted the gene into a zebrafish embryo, allowing it to integrate into the zebrafish's [[genome]], which caused the fish to be brightly fluorescent under both natural white light and ultraviolet light. Their goal was to develop a fish that could detect [[pollution]] by selectively fluorescing in the presence of [[natural environment|environmental]] [[toxin]]s. The development of the constantly fluorescing fish was the first step in this process, and the National University of Singapore filed a patent application on this work.&lt;ref&gt;Published PCT Application WO2000049150 "Chimeric Gene Constructs for Generation of Fluorescent Transgenic Ornamental Fish." National University of Singapore [http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2000049150]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, his team developed a line of red fluorescent zebra fish by adding a gene from a sea [[coral]], and orange-yellow fluorescent zebra fish, by adding a variant of the jellyfish gene. Later, a team of researchers at the [[National Taiwan University]], headed by Professor Huai-Jen Tsai (蔡懷禎), succeeded in creating a [[medaka]] (rice fish) with a fluorescent green color, which, like the zebrafish, is a [[model organism]] used in biology.

The scientists from NUS and businessmen Alan Blake and Richard Crockett from Yorktown Technologies, L.P., a company in Austin, Texas, met and a deal was signed whereby Yorktown obtained the worldwide rights to market the fluorescent zebrafish, which Yorktown subsequently branded as "GloFish". At around the same time, a separate deal was made between Taikong, the largest [[aquarium]] fish producer in Taiwan, and the Taiwanese researchers to market the green medaka in Taiwan under the name TK-1. In the spring of 2003, Taiwan became the first to authorize sales of a genetically modified organism as a pet. One hundred thousand fish were reportedly sold in less than a month at US$18.60 each. The fluorescent medaka are not GloFish, as they are not marketed by Yorktown Technologies, but instead by Taikong Corp under a different brand name.

=== Introduction to the United States market ===

GloFish were introduced to the United States market in late 2003 by Yorktown Technologies, after two years of research. The governmental environmental risk assessment was made by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which has jurisdiction over all genetically modified (GM) animals, including fluorescent zebra fish, since they consider the inserted gene to be a drug. The FDA determined in December 2003:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because tropical aquarium fish are not used for food purposes, they pose no threat to the food supply. There is no evidence that these genetically engineered zebra danio fish pose any more threat to the environment than their unmodified counterparts which have long been widely sold in the United States. In the absence of a clear risk to the public health, the FDA finds no reason to regulate these particular fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Statement Regarding Glofish |url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/GeneticEngineering/GeneticallyEngineeredAnimals/ucm161437.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141709/http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/GeneticEngineering/GeneticallyEngineeredAnimals/ucm161437.htm |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marketing of the fish was met by protests from a [[non-governmental organization]] called the [[Center for Food Safety]]. They were concerned that approval of the GloFish based only on a Food and Drug Administration risk assessment would create a precedent of inadequate scrutiny of biotech animals in general.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The group filed a lawsuit in US Federal District Court to block the sale of the GloFish. The lawsuit sought a court order stating that the sale of [[transgenic]] fish is subject to federal regulation beyond the FDA's charter, and as such should not be sold without more extensive approvals. In the opinion of Joseph Mendelson, the Center for Food Safety's legal director:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's clear this sets a precedent for genetically engineered animals. It opens the dams to a whole host of nonfood genetically engineered organisms. That's unacceptable to us and runs counter to things the National Academy of Sciences and other scientific review boards have said, particularly when it comes to mobile GM organisms like fish and insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=GloFish draw suit | journal=The Scientist | author = Charles Choi | date= January 7, 2004 | url =http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/22641/title/GloFish-draw-suit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Center for Food Safety's suit was found to be without merit and dismissed on March 30, 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== Subsequent developments ===
In addition to the red fluorescent zebrafish, trademarked as "Starfire Red", Yorktown Technologies released a green fluorescent zebrafish and an orange-yellow fluorescent zebrafish in mid-2006. In 2011, blue and purple fluorescent zebrafish were released. These lines of fish are trademarked as "Electric Green", "Sunburst Orange", "Cosmic Blue", and "Galactic Purple", and incorporate genes from sea coral.&lt;ref name=gf /&gt; In 2012, Yorktown Technologies introduced a new variety of "Electric Green" GloFish, derived from a different species of fish, the [[black tetra]].&lt;ref name=gf /&gt; This was followed by the "Electric Green" Barb, which is a variety of [[tiger barb]]. In 2013, Yorktown Technologies introduced a "Sunburst Orange" Tetra and a "Moonrise Pink" Tetra, the first fluorescent pink fish to be marketed. This was followed in 2014 by the release of a "Starfire Red" and "Cosmic Blue" Tetra.

Despite the speculation of aquarium enthusiasts that the eggs{{vague|date=November 2015}}&lt;!-- What eggs? --&gt; are pressure treated to make them infertile, it has been found some GloFish are indeed fertile and will reproduce in a captive environment.&lt;ref name="Finformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpasi.org/Apr04.pdf |pages=4–5 |title=Finformation |format= |work=Greater Pittsburgh Aquarium Society |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217173629/http://www.gpasi.org/Apr04.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the GloFish Fluorescent Fish License states "Intentional breeding and/or any sale, barter, or trade, of any offspring of GloFish fluorescent ornamental fish is strictly prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= GloFish license | url=http://www.glofish.com/license.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sale or possession of GloFish was made illegal in California in 2002 due to a regulation that restricts genetically modified fish. The regulation was implemented before the marketing of GloFish, largely due to concern about a fast-growing biotech salmon. The regulations were lifted in 2015 due to a growing body of evidence and the findings of the Food and Drug Administration and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. GloFish are now legal in California for importation and commercial sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Letter from Director Charlton H.

The import, sale and possession of these fish is not permitted within the European Union. On November 9, 2006, however, the Netherlands’ Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) found 1,400 fluorescent fish, which were sold in various aquarium shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=25069 vrom.nl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309084310/http://www.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=25069 |date=March 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration formalized their recommendations for genetically engineered animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cvm/geanimals.htm|title=Genetically Engineered Animals|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-binding recommendations describe the way in which FDA regulates all GM animals, including GloFish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Regulation of Genetically Engineered Animals Containing Heritable Recombinant DNA Constructs | url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM113903.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2014 assessed the environmental safety associated with GloFish. One paper concluded that there is little risk of [[Genetically modified food controversies#Environment|invasiveness]] into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/00028487.2014.880741 | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/nvuFmCDyamiIZp4qAMeW/full#.U7cfS_ldWQE| title=Assessment of the Risks of Transgenic Fluorescent Ornamental Fishes to the United States Using the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK)| journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society| volume=143| issue=3| pages=817–829| year=2014| last1=Hill| first1=Jeffrey E.| last2=Lawson| first2=Larry L.| last3=Hardin| first3=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second study concluded that there is no difference in risk between GloFish and wild-type danios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Risk Assessment of Transgenic Fluorescent Ornamental Fishes to the United States Using FISK v2 | url=https://www.was.org/documents/MeetingPresentations/AA2014/AA2014_0314.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of colors ==
{{Further|Reporter gene}}
Examples of sources of fluorescent protein genes include [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] (''[[Aequorea victoria]]'', [[jellyfish]]), GFP ([[Sea pansy|''Renilla reniformis'']], sea pansy), dsRed (''[[Discosoma]]'', [[Corallimorpharia|mushroom coral]]), eqFP611 (''[[Entacmaea quadricolor]]'', [[sea anemone]]), RTMS5 ([[Montipora|''Montipora efflorescens'']], [[Scleractinia|stony coral]]), [[dronpa]] (''[[Pectiniidae]]'', chalice coral), KFP (''[[Anemonia sulcata]]'', Venus hair anemone), eosFP ([[Lobophyllia|''Lobophyllia hemprichii'']], open brain coral), and dendra (''[[Dendronephthya]]'', [[Octocorallia|octocoral]]).

In early 2014, scientists identified approximately 200 species of naturally occurring fluorescent fish, suggesting that the fluorescence trait is widespread in fish lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083259| pmid=24421880 | pmc=3885428 | title=The Covert World of Fish Biofluorescence: A Phylogenetically Widespread and Phenotypically Variable Phenomenon | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=e83259 | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083259| year=2014 | last1=Sparks | first1=John S. | last2=Schelly | first2=Robert C. | last3=Smith | first3=W. Leo | last4=Davis | first4=Matthew P. | last5=Tchernov | first5=Dan | last6=Pieribone | first6=Vincent A. | last7=Gruber | first7=David F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other experimental uses ==
Fluorescent zebrafish also have been used for other experimental research. The alterations in the zebrafish's genes have given the organism the ability to fluoresce as a bio-indicator. This genetic ability has been used to detect pollution and other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.02.002|pmid=16488034|title=Go with the glow: Fluorescent proteins to light transgenic organisms|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=155–62|date=April 2006|last1=Stewart|first1=C. Neal, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemicals that mimic natural [[estrogen]]s have well-documented effects on the reproductive systems of vertebrates, typically acting as [[endocrine disruptors]], and GloFish fluorescence is being used to detect levels of estrogenic chemicals.&lt;ref name=Holtcamp&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3404679 |year=2012 |author1=Holtcamp |first1=W |title=Glow Fish: A New Biosensor to Detect How Environmental Estrogens Affect Tissues |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=120 |issue=7 |pages=a284 |doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a284b |pmid=22759863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that muscles such as the heart are more affected by estrogen than the liver.&lt;ref name=Holtcamp /&gt; Using the GloFish may thus give insights into endocrine disrupting chemical actions.&lt;ref name=Holtcamp /&gt;

The sentiments of aquarium retailers towards the GloFish have also been used as an indicator of the public's positive reaction to controversial agricultural biotechnologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peddie|first=Brian|title=A Grounded Theory of Florida Aquarium Retailers' Acceptance of the GloFish |url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/E0/02/00/00/00001/peddie_b.pdf|publisher=University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vulnerability to predation ==
GloFish are more vulnerable to predation compared to the wild-type, according to a study published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00028487.2011.603980 |title=Fluorescent Transgenic Zebra Danio More Vulnerable to Predators than Wild-Type Fish |journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society |volume=140 |issue=4 |pages=1001–1005 |year=2011 |last1=Hill |first1=Jeffrey E. |last2=Kapuscinski |first2=Anne R. |last3=Pavlowich |first3=Tyler }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">The term '''hermit kingdom''' can be used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world - The country of [[North Korea]] is a prime example of a hermit kingdom.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]' 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by [[Koreans]] themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
Several other countries reluctant to engage in dialogue with the outside world have also been described as hermit kingdoms, including: [[Bhutan]],{{cn}} the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]],{{cn}} and the early African civilization of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum]].{{cn}}

[[File:Homograph homophone venn diagram.png|thumb|400px|[[Venn diagram]] showing the relationships between homophones (blue circle) and related linguistic concepts]] 

A '''homophone''' is a word that is [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] the same (to varying extent) as another word but differs in meaning. A homophone may also differ in spelling. The two words may be [[Spelling|spelled]] the same, such as [[wikt:rose#Noun|''rose'']] (flower) and [[wikt:rose#Verb|''rose'']] (past tense of "rise"), or differently, such as ''[[Carat (unit)|carat]]'', ''[[caret]]'', and ''[[carrot]]'', or ''to'', ''two'', and ''too''. The term "homophone" may also apply to units longer or shorter than words, such as phrases, letters, or groups of letters which are pronounced the same as another phrase, letter, or group of letters. Any unit with this property is said to be "homophonous".

Homophones that are spelled the same are also both [[homograph]]s and [[homonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;According to the strict sense of homonyms as words with the same spelling ''and'' pronunciation; however, homonyms according to the loose sense common in nontechnical contexts are words with the same spelling ''or'' pronunciation, in which case all homophones are also homonyms. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homonym?r=66 Random House Unabridged Dictionary entry for "homonym"] at Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophones that are spelled differently are also called '''heterographs'''.

==Etymology==
"Homophone" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''homo-''&amp;nbsp; (ὁμο&amp;#8209;), "same", and ''phōnḗ'' (φωνή), "voice, utterance".

==In wordplay and games==
[[File:Auction-storage-no-trespassing-sign-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|A sign reads, "Trespassers will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;shot on {{sic|site}}."  Note that "site" is a homophone of "sight".]]

Homophones are often used to create [[pun]]s and to deceive the reader (as in [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]) or to suggest multiple meanings. The last usage is common in [[poetry]] and creative [[literature]]. An example of this is seen in [[Dylan Thomas]]'s radio play ''Under Milk Wood'': "The shops in mourning" where ''mourning'' can be heard as ''mourning'' or ''morning''. Another vivid example is [[Thomas Hood]]'s use of "birth" and "berth" and "told" and "toll'd" (tolled) in his poem "Faithless Sally Brown":

:His death, which happen'd in his berth,
:At forty-odd befell:
:They went and told the sexton, and
:The sexton toll'd the bell.

In some accents, various sounds have [[phonemic differentiation|merged]] in that they are no longer distinctive, and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction (a [[minimal pair]]) are homophonous in the accent with the merger. Some examples from [[English language|English]] are:

:''pin'' and ''pen'' in many [[Southern American English|southern American accents]].
:''merry'', ''marry'', and ''Mary'' in most American accents.
:The pairs ''do'', ''due'' and ''forward'', ''foreword'' are homophonous in most American accents but not in most English accents.
:The pairs ''talk'', ''torque'', and ''court'', ''caught'' are distinguished in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents such as [[Scottish English]] and most dialects of American English, but are homophones in many [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] accents such as British [[Received Pronunciation]].

Wordplay is particularly common in English because the multiplicity of linguistic influences offers considerable complication in spelling and meaning and pronunciation compared with other languages.

[[Malapropism]]s, which often create a similar comic effect, are usually near-homophones. See also [[Eggcorn]].

===Oronyms===
Homophones of multiple words or phrases (as sometimes seen in [[word game]]s) are also known as "oronyms". This term was coined by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and first published in his book ''The Joy of Lex'' (1980), and it was used in the [[BBC]] programme ''Never Mind the Full Stops'', which also featured Brandreth as a guest.

Examples of "oronyms" (which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of English) include:

:"ice cream" vs. "I scream" (as in the popular song "I scream. You scream. We all scream for ice cream.")
:"euthanasia" vs. "[[Youth in Asia]]"
:"depend" vs. "deep end"
:"Gemini" vs. "Jim and I" vs. "Jem in eye"
:"the sky" vs. "this guy" (most notably as a [[mondegreen]] in [[Purple Haze]] by [[Jimi Hendrix]])
:"[[four candles]]" vs. "fork handles"
:"sand which is there" vs. "sandwiches there"
:"[[philanderer]]" vs. "[[Flanders]]"
:"example" vs. "egg sample"
:"some others" vs. "some mothers" vs. "smothers"
:"minute" vs. "my newt"
:"[[vodka]]" vs. "[[Ford Ka]]"
:"foxhole" vs. "[[Vauxhall (disambiguation)|Vauxhall]]"
:"big hand" vs. "began"
:"[[Mégane]]" vs. "Meg's hand"
:"real eyes" vs. "realize" vs. "real lies"
:"a dressed male" vs. "addressed mail"
:"them all" vs. "the mall"
:"Isle of Dogs" vs. "I love dogs."

In his Appalachian comedy routine, American comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] frequently uses oronyms which play on exaggerated "country" accents. Notable examples include:

:Initiate: "My wife ate two sandwiches, ''initiate'' [and then she ate] a bag o' tater chips."&lt;br&gt;Mayonnaise: "''Mayonnaise'' [Man, there is] a lot of people here tonight."&lt;br&gt;Innuendo: "Hey dude I saw a bird fly ''innuendo'' [in your window]."&lt;br&gt;Moustache: "I ''Moustache'' [must ask] you a question."

==Number of homophones==

===English===
There are sites, for example, https://web.archive.org/web/20160825095711/http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/fun/wordplay/multinyms.html, which have lists of homonyms or rather homophones and even 'multinyms' which have as many as seven spellings. There are differences in such lists due to dialect pronunciations and usage of old words.  In English, there are approximately 88 triples; 24 quadruples; 2 quintuples; 1 sextet and 1 septet. The septet is:

:''raise'', ''rays'', ''rase'', ''raze'', ''rehs'', ''res'', ''réis''

Other than the three common words (''raise'', ''rays'' and ''raze''), there are:

* ''rase'' – a verb meaning "to erase";
* ''rehs'' – the plural of ''reh'', a mixture of sodium salts found as an efflorescence in India;
* ''res'' – the plural of [[re (musical note)|''re'']], a name for one step of the musical scale;
* ''réis – the plural of real, a currency unit of Portugal and Brazil.

If proper names are allowed then a nonet is ''Ayr'' (Scottish town), ''Aire'' (Yorkshire River), ''Eyre'' (legal term and various geographic locations), ''heir'', ''air'', ''err'' (some speakers), ''ere'' (poetic "before"), ''e'er'' (poetic "ever", some speakers), ''are'' (unit of area; some speakers).

===Japanese===
There are a large number of homophones in Japanese, due to the use of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]], where borrowed words and morphemes from Chinese are widely used in Japanese, but many sound differences, such as tones, are lost. These are to some extent disambiguated via Japanese pitch accent, or from context, but many of these words are primarily or almost exclusively used in writing, where they are easily distinguished as they are written with different [[kanji]]; others are used for puns, which are frequent in Japanese. An extreme example is ''kikō'', which is the pronunciation of at least 22 words (some quite rare or specialized, others common; all these examples are two-character compounds), including: 機構 (organization/mechanism), 紀行 (travelogue), 稀覯 (rare), 騎行 (horseback riding), 貴校 ((school (respectful)), 奇功 (outstanding achievement), 貴公 (word for "you" used by men addressing male equals or inferiors), 起稿 (draft), 奇行 (eccentricity), 機巧 (contrivance), 寄港 (stopping at port), 帰校 (returning to school), 気功 (breathing exercise/qigong), 寄稿 (contribute an article/written piece), 機甲 (armor, e.g. of a tank), 帰航 (homeward voyage), 奇効 (remarkable effect), 季候 (season/climate), 気孔 (stoma), 起工 (setting to work), 気候 (climate), 帰港 (returning to port).

===Korean===
The Korean language contains a combination of words that strictly belong to Korean and words that are [[loanwords]] from Chinese. Due to Chinese being pronounced with varying tones and Korean's removal of those tones, and because the modern Korean writing system, Hangeul, has a more finite number of phonemes than, for example, Latin-derived alphabets such as that of English, there is a large number of homonyms with both same spelling and pronunciation. For example, '화장(化粧)하다': 'to put on makeup' and '화장(火葬)하다': 'to cremate'. Also, '유산(遺産)': 'inheritance' and '유산(流産)': 'miscarriage'. '방구': 'fart', and '방구(防具)': 'guard'. '밤[밤ː]': 'chestnut', and '밤': 'night'. There are heterographs, but far fewer, contrary to the tendency in English. For example, '학문(學問)': 'learning', and '항문(肛門)': 'anus'.  Using [[hanja]] (한자,漢字), which are Chinese characters, such words are written differently. 

Implicit above, like in other languages, Korean homonyms can be used to make puns. The context in which the word is used indicates which meaning is intended by the speaker or writer.

==Use in psychological research==

===Pseudo-homophones===
Pseudo-homophones are [[pseudoword]]s that are [[phonetic]]ally identical to a word. For example, groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs, whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words. Both types of pairs are used in [[lexical decision task]]s to investigate [[word recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. C. (1982). The pseudohomophone effect: The role of visual  similarity in nonword decisions. Quarterly Journal of Experimental
Psychology, 34A, 395-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as ambiguous information===
Homophones, specifically heterographs, where one spelling is of a threatening nature and one is not (''e.g.'' slay/sleigh, war/wore) have been used in studies of [[anxiety]] as a test of cognitive models that those with high anxiety tend to interpret ambiguous information in a threatening manner.&lt;ref&gt;Mogg K, Bradley BP, Miller T, Potts H, Glenwright J, Kentish J (1994). Interpretation of homophones related to threat: Anxiety or response bias effects? ''Cognitive Therapy and Research'', '''18'''(5), 461-77&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India Catalina''' (c. 1495 – ?) was an [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]] woman (almost certainly [[Calamari people|Calamari]]) from the Colombian [[Atlantic]] coast, who accompanied [[Pedro de Heredia]] and played a role in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Colombia]], acting as interpreter and intermediary.

==History==
Catalina was abducted in 1509 by Spanish conqueror [[Diego de Nicuesa]] from an indigenous settlement known as Zamba o Galerazamba, where she was the daughter of the local chief. She was sent to [[Santo Domingo]], where she learned the [[Spanish language]] and adopted the [[Catholic]] religion. Pedro de Heredia required her to serve as an interpreter to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Afterwards, she married [[Alonso Montanez|Alonso Montañez]], Pedro de Heredia's nephew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The events of the Spanish conquest in the area of modern [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] ended with the complete annihilation of the Calamari people, which happened while she was enslaved and abducted by the Spaniards.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The name of Catalina India appeared in a letter sent for Pedro de Heredia to [[Carlos V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Carlos V]] in 1533. No one knew what her real name was because he{{clarify|reason=Pedro? Diego?|date=December 2014}} began calling her 'Catalina' from 1509 when the Diego de Nicuesa expedition kidnapped and took her to Santo Domingo where was educated as a Spaniard. From that time she would use Spanish dress only but was still considered a slave.

'''Insects''' have long been used '''in religion''', both directly (with live insects) and as images or symbols.

==Live insects in religious ceremonies==

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''[[Pachycondyla]] commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399-422.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]], a red harvester ant, has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.  Taxonomic Identity of "Hallucinogenic" Harvester Ant (Pogonomyrmex californicus) Confirmed.  2001.  Journal of Ethnobiology 21(2):133-144&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], the dung beetle now known as ''[[Scarabaeus sacer]]'' (formerly ''Ateuchus sacer'') was revered as sacred, as [[Charles Darwin]] noted in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', describing the genus ''[[Ateuchus]]'' as the "sacred beetle of the Egyptians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Darwin | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Darwin | title = On the Origin of Species | publisher = John Murray | year = 1859 | page = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maurice Burton &amp; Robert Burton |year=2002 |series=The International Wildlife Encyclopedia |title=Volume 16 |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]] |isbn=978-0-7614-7282-7 |chapter=Scarab beetle |pages=2252–2254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QQCfJnu_6oC&amp;pg=PA2252}}&lt;/ref&gt; To them, the insect was a symbol of [[Khepri]], the early morning manifestation of the sun god [[Ra]], from an analogy between the beetle's behaviour of rolling a ball of dung across the ground and Khepri's task of rolling the sun across the sky.&lt;ref name="Remler"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pat Remler |year=2010 |title=Egyptian Mythology A to Z |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-60413-926-6 |chapter=Scarab beetle |pages=169–171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLUjtPDyu-IC&amp;pg=PT185}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accordingly held the species to be [[sacred]]. The Egyptians also observed young beetles emerging from the ball of dung, from which they mistakenly inferred that the female beetle was able to reproduce without needing a male. From this, they drew parallels with their god [[Atum]], who also begat children alone.&lt;ref name="Remler"/&gt;

In the [[Shinto]] of Japan, [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] are mentioned in [[haiku]] poems, for example behaving as if on [[pilgrimage]], or gathering in the Bon festival of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lanoue|first1=David G.|title=Animals and Shinto in the Haiku of Issa|url=http://haikureality.theartofhaiku.com/esejeng109.htm|website=Haiku Reality|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Quran]], the honeybee is the only creature that speak directly to God. Mohammed wrote in the 68-69 verses: &lt;blockquote&gt;And your Lord taught the honey bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations; Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought. (Surat an-Nahl (The Bee), 68-69)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Honey Bee|url=http://www.islamicity.com/science/quranandscience/animals/generatedfiles/thehoneybee.htm|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Allen Paulos''' (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of [[numeracy|mathematical literacy]]. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical [[innumeracy]]; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in [[Denver Colorado]] and grew up in Chicago, [[Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic.&lt;ref name=Podcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Skeptics!|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|publisher=Christopher Brown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062748/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to high school in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967) and his  Master of Science at [[University of Washington]] (1968) he received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1974). He was also part of the [[Peace Corps]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/786/000041663/|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic work is mainly in [[mathematical logic]] and [[probability theory]].

His book ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]'' (1988) was a bestseller and ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses [[innumeracy]] with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way.

He has also written on other subjects often "combining disparate disciplines", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in ''Mathematics and Humor'' and ''I Think, Therefore I Laugh'', the [[stock market]] in ''A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market'', quantitative aspects of narrative in ''Once Upon a Number'', the arguments for God in ''Irreligion'', and most recently "bringing mathematics to bear on...biography" in ''A Numerate Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |interviewer=Jim Stein |title=A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours |url=http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |date=10 November 2015 |work=New Books in Mathematics |access-date=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115193717/http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and is a [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow (formally known as Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]])).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|url=http://www.csicop.org|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part [[BBC]] adaptation of ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' and appearances on the [[Lehrer News Hour]], [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]], [[Larry King]], and [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulos at David Letterman |url=https://math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |publisher=Temple University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411001818/http://www.math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |archivedate=April 11, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His long-running "[[ABCNews.com]]" monthly column ''Who's Counting''&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/ Who's Counting] at ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news. All the columns over a 10- year period are archived here.&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"/&gt;

He is married and the father of two.

==Awards==
Paulos received the 2013 JPBM ([[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]]) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Award for Communicating Mathematics|url=http://math.mit.edu/mathcomm/archives/john-allen-paulos-to-receive-math-communications-award/|publisher=JPBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos received the 2003 AAAS ([[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAAS|url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public2003.shtml|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he received the University Creativity Award at [[Temple University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Creativity Award|url=http://www.temple.edu/provost/faculty/awards/research-and-creative.html|publisher=Temple University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos' article "Counting on Dyscalculia," which appeared in Discover Magazine in 1994, won a Folio Award that year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Magazine|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/countingondyscal351#.UqCSc8RDsvw|publisher=Discover Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kommissar X''' or '''Commissioner X''' is a German [[crime fiction]] series of books from the Pabel Moewig publishing house.  "Kommissar X" is a [[private detective]] named Joe Louis Walker who was a counterpart of the German [[crime fiction]] [[FBI]] [[Special Agent]] [[Jerry Cotton]].  In addition to the vast collection of books, between 1965 and 1971 seven Kommissar X films were made with [[Tony Kendall (actor)|Tony Kendall]] as the laid back swinging [[New York City]] private eye Joe Walker balanced against the serious muscular [[New York City Police]] [[Police captain|Captain]] Tom Rowland played by [[Brad Harris]].

==Beginnings==
The Kommissar X series of crime novels were written by Bert F. Island whose real name was Paul Alfred Mueller (18 October 1901 – 1 January 1970).&lt;ref name="crime-surf"&gt;http://www.hinternet.de/weblog/2005/02/crime-surf-bert-f-island&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1959, Island wrote 620 "Kommissar X" books.&lt;ref name="crime-surf" /&gt;

==Films==
With the international success of the films of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] and the German [[Jerry Cotton]] (played by [[George Nader]]) series, seven Commissioner X films, mostly written and directed by [[Gianfranco Parolini]] and starring [[Tony Kendall (actor)|Tony Kendall]] as [[private detective]] Joe Walker and [[Brad Harris]] as [[New York City Police]] Lieutenant Tom Rowland, were made.  These films were not only released internationally, but became a staple of American television movies in the mid-1960s when American stations sought colour films to show.

The films were

*1965: ''[[Kommissar X – Jagd auf Unbekannt]]'' - ''Hunt for the Unknown'' a.k.a. ''Kiss Kiss Kill Kill'' 
*1966: ''[[Kommissar X – Drei gelbe Katzen]]'' - ''Three Yellow Cats'' a.k.a. ''Death is Nimble, Death is Quick'' 
*1966: ''[[Kommissar X – In den Klauen des goldenen Drachen]]'' - ''So Darling, So Deadly'' 
*1967: ''[[Kommissar X – Drei grüne Hunde]]'' - ''Death Trip'' 
*1968: ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kommissar X – Drei blaue Panther|de}}'' - ''Three Blue Panthers'' a.k.a. ''Kill Panther Kill''
*1969: ''[[Kommissar X – Drei goldene Schlangen]]'' - ''Three Golden Serpents'' a.k.a. ''Island of Lost Girls''
*1971: ''[[Tiger Gang|Kommissar X jagt die roten Tiger]]'' - ''FBI: Operation Pakistan'' a.k.a. ''Tiger Gang''

==DVD release==
The first three Kommissar X films have been released in the United States but in the same faded and English dubbed versions that were on American television in the 1960s. Remastered versions of the first six films were released in Germany, which include the English dub.

==In popular culture==

In 2012 a German comedy dirercted by [[Reginald Ginster]] titled ''Die X-Männer schlagen zurück'' featured Harris, Kendall and Parolini.

'''''Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future''''' is a "[[future history]]" science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author [[Olaf Stapledon]]. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/last-and-first-man-of-vision/161949.article|title=Last and first man of vision|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=23 January 1995|access-date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eighteen distinct human [[species]], of which our own is the first. The book employs a [[List of narrative techniques|narrative conceit]] that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a [[List of modern channelled texts|channelled text]] from the last human species.

Stapledon's conception of history is based on the [[Hegelian Dialectic]], following a repetitive cycle with many varied [[civilisations]] rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but it is also one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of [[genetic engineering]], and is an early example of the fictional [[Group mind (science fiction)|supermind]]; a consciousness composed of many [[telepathy|telepathically]]-linked individuals.

In 1932, Stapledon followed ''Last and First Men'' with the far less acclaimed ''[[Last Men in London]]''. Another Stapledon novel, ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), could also be considered a sequel to ''Last and First Men'' (mentioning briefly man's evolution on Neptune), but is even more ambitious in scope, being a history of the entire universe.

It is the 11th title in the [[SF Masterworks]] series.

== Human species ==
* '''First Men'''. (Chapters 1–6) Our own species: rivalries of nation-states in Europe, the rivalry of America and China, the First [[World State]], its destruction as a result of using up all natural resources, followed by the [[Patagonia]]n Civilization 100,000 years hence, with the cult of [[Youth]], and its destruction after the sabotage of a mine which leads to a colossal subterranean atomic explosion and the ensuing intercontinental [[nuclear holocaust]], rendering most of the Earth's surface uninhabitable for millions of years save for the poles and the northern coast of [[Siberia]]. The only survivors are thirty-five humans stationed at the [[North Pole]], who eventually split up into two separate species, the Second Men and some sub-humans.
* '''Second Men'''. (Chapters 7– 9) "Their heads, indeed, were large even for their bodies, and their necks massive. Their hands were huge, but finely moulded...their legs were stouter...their feet had lost their separate toes...blonde [[hirsute]] appearance...Their eyes were large, and often [[jade]] [[Shades of green#Jade|green]], their features firm as carved [[granite]], yet mobile and [[wikt:lucent|lucent]]. ...not till they were fifty did they reach maturity. At about 190 their powers began to fail..." Unlike our species, [[egotism]] is virtually unknown to them. At the acme of their highly advanced civilization, just as they are about to create a superior human species by genetic engineering, a protracted war with the Martians finally ends with the Martians extinct and the Second Men gone into eclipse.
*'''Third Men'''. (Chapter 10) "Scarcely more than half the stature of their predecessors, these beings were proportionally slight and lithe. Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of red-gold hairs... golden eyes... faces were compact as a cat's muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and in races. ... But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of living steel." Deeply interested in music and in the [[genetic engineering|design of living organisms]].
*'''Fourth Men'''. (Chapter 11) Giant brains, built by the Third Men. For a long time they help govern their creators, but eventually come into conflict. After reducing the Third Men to the status of lab animals, they eventually reach the limits of their scientific abilities and discover that emotions and body are also necessary for complete understanding of the cosmos.
*'''Fifth Men'''. (Chapters 11–12) An artificial human species designed by the brains. "On the average they were more than twice as tall as the First Men, and much taller than the Second Men... the delicate sixth finger had been induced to divide its tip into two [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputian fingers]] and a corresponding thumb. The contours of the limbs were sharply visible, for the body bore no hair, save for a close, thick [[wikt:skullcap|skull-cap]] which, in the original stock, was of ruddy brown. The well-marked eyebrows, when drawn down, shaded the sensitive eyes from the sun." After clashing with and finally eliminating the Fourth Men, they develop a technology greater than Earth had ever known before. When Earth ceases to be habitable, they [[Terraforming|terraform]] [[Venus]], committing [[genocide]] on its marine native race which tries to resist them – but do not cope well after the move.
*'''Sixth Men'''. (Chapter 13) "Sadly reduced in stature and in brain, these abject beings... gained a precarious livelihood by grubbing roots upon the forest-clad islands, trapping the innumerable birds, and catching fish... Not infrequently they devoured, or were devoured by, their [[Pinniped|seal]]-like relatives." After tectonic changes provide them with a promising land mass, they fluctuate like the First Men and repeat all their mistakes.
*'''Seventh Men'''. Flying humans, "scarcely heavier than the largest of terrestrial flying birds", are created by the Sixth Men. After 100 million years, a flightless pedestrian subspecies appears which re-develops technology.
*'''Eighth Men'''. "These long-headed and substantial folk were designed to be strictly pedestrian, physically and mentally." When Venus becomes uninhabitable, about to be destroyed along with the entire inner solar system, they design the Ninth Men, who will live on [[Neptune]].
*'''Ninth Men'''. (Chapter 14) "Inevitably it was a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] type, limited in size by the necessity of resisting an excessive [[gravitation]]... too delicately organized to withstand the ferocity of natural forces on Neptune... civilization crumbled into savagery." After the Ninth Men's civilization collapses, the Ninth Men themselves devolve into various animal species.
*'''Tenth to Thirteenth Men'''. (Chapter 14) "Nowhere did the typical human form survive." About three hundred million years after the colonization of Neptune, a rabbit-like species evolves into the Tenth Men. The Tenth Men are sentient but primitive. After a plague wipes out the Tenth Men, several other primitive human species rise and fall.
*'''Fourteenth to Seventeenth Men'''. The Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Men are essentially Neptunian versions of the First, Second and Fifth Men, respectively. The Fourteenth Men create great civilisations and destroy them, frustrated with their own imperfections. The Fifteenth improve upon that, creating a spirituality based on "a devotion to the fulfilment of human capacity". They eventually create the Sixteenth Men - the first Neptunian artificial species. Thus the cycle of rise and collapse of civilisations ends, and steady progress takes its place. The Sixteenth Men achieve the highest level of civilisation possible "to the individual human brain acting in physical isolation" and to avoid stagnation create the Seventeenth Men, with an ability for "mental fusion of many individuals" to succeed them; however, the Seventeenth Men are "flawed" in some unspecified way, unimagined by the 16th due to their lesser awareness, and last only a short period of time before being replaced by the Eighteenth Men.
*'''Eighteenth Men'''. (Chapters 15–16) The most advanced humans of all, essentially a perfected version of the 17th species. A race of philosophers and artists with a very liberal sexual morality. "Superficially we seem to be not one species but many." (One interesting aspect of the Eighteenth Men is that they have a number of different "sub-genders," variants on the basic male and female pattern, with distinctive temperaments. The Eighteenth Men's equivalent of the family unit includes one of each of these sub-genders and is the basis of their society. The units have the ability to act as a group mind, which eventually leads to the establishment of a single group mind uniting the entire species.). This species no longer died naturally, but only by accident, suicide or being killed. Despite their hyper-advanced civilisation, they practice ritual [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 15, subchapter 1: "[W]henever a human being has chosen to die, his body is ceremoniously eaten by his friends".&lt;/ref&gt; They are eventually extinguished on [[Neptune]] after a [[supernova]] infects the sun, causing it to grow so hot that it consumes the remains of the [[solar system]], faster than any means of escape they can devise. Unable to escape, this last species of man devises a virus to spread life to other worlds and cause the evolution of new sentient species throughout the galaxy.

===Sub-humans===
*'''Baboon-like Submen'''. (Chapter 7) "Bent so that as often as not they used their arms as aids to locomotion, flat-headed and curiously long-snouted, these creatures were by now more baboon-like than human".
*'''Seal-like Submen'''. (Chapter 13) "The whole body was moulded to stream-lines. The lung capacity was greatly developed. The spine had elongated, and increased in flexibility. The legs were shrunken, grown together, and flattened into a horizontal rudder. The arms also were diminutive and fin-like, though they still retained the manipulative forefinger and thumb. The head had shrunk into the body and looked forward in the direction of swimming. Strong carnivorous teeth, emphatic gregariousness, and a new, almost human, cunning in the chase, combined to make these seal-men lords of the ocean".
*'''Period of Eclipse'''. (Chapter 14) "Man's consciousness was narrowed and coarsened into brute-consciousness. By good luck the brute precariously survived." Nature succeeds in colonising Neptune where sentient life fails. Human-derived mammals of all shapes come to dominate Neptune's [[ecosystem]] before adapting well enough for the vestiges of opposable thumbs and intelligence to become assets again.

== Appearances in other media ==
Characters discuss the novel in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[Star-Begotten]]''.

The novel appears in the computer game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' as a reference when a corporation in the game allegedly tries to develop the Second Men in the series, but also in a much broader aspect as the game deals with [[genetic engineering]], the next phase of [[evolution]] and human augmentations. Also similar to the book are the options presented to the player as to where human kind will go next: a fall back into an almost savage state of humanity, a keeping of the status quo or an extreme progression with the danger of sacrificing basic rights.

Icelandic composer [[Jóhann Jóhannsson]] directed and scored a multimedia ''Last and First Men'', "combining a film narrated by actress [[Tilda Swinton]] and accompanying score played by the BBC Philharmonic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://confidentials.com/manchester/mif-2017-last-and-first-men-reviewed-manchester-international-festival |title=MIF 2017 - Last and First Men, Reviewed |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=7 July 2017 |website=Confidentials Manchester |publisher= |access-date=25 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on other writers ==
[[Brian Aldiss]], in his preface to the 1962 edition, acknowledges the deep impression on him—and considerable influence on his own later writing–of Stapledon's book, which he encountered in 1943 while a British soldier fighting the Japanese in [[Burma]] – "An appropriately unusual period of life at which to encounter a vision so far outside ordinary experience".

Aldiss also mentions [[James Blish]] as another writer deeply influenced by Stapledon.

[[C. S. Lewis]] in his own preface to ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', notes: "I believe that one of the central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations I had with a scientific colleague, some time before I met a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow".

The reference to "objecting to Stapledon's philosophy" was no accident. In particular, the Christian Lewis objected to Stapledon's idea, as expressed in the present book, that mankind could escape from an outworn planet and establish itself on another one; this Lewis regarded as no less than a [[Satan]]ic idea – especially, but not only, because it involved [[genocide]] of the original inhabitants of the target planet. [[Professor Weston]], the chief villain of Lewis' [[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]], is an outspoken proponent of this idea, and in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' Lewis opposes to it the depiction of the virtuous and stoic [[Martians]]/Malacandrians who choose to die with their dying planet, even though they possessed the technology to cross space and colonise Earth.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] has said of Stapledon's 1930 book ''Last and First Men'' that "No other book had a greater influence on my life&amp;nbsp;... [It] and its successor ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career".&lt;ref name="testermanscifi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |title=Arthur C. Clarke Quotes |accessdate=8 February 2007 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123183810/http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |archivedate=23 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. P. Lovecraft]] held the book in very high regard (though he did not say whether it influenced any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to [[Fritz Leiber]]&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Fritz Leiber on 18 November 1936. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's ''Last and First Men'' ... Probably you ''have'' read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Fritz Leiber on 19 December 1936. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of ''Last and First Men''—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that [[Forrest J Ackerman|Master Ackerman]] would denominate "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Arthur Widner on 20 February 1937. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; he said "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of [[H. G. Wells]]'s [[H. G. Wells bibliography|novels]], [[S. Fowler Wright]]'s ''[[The World Below]]'', &amp; that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, ''Last &amp; First Men''."

[[John Maynard Smith]] has said "A man called Olaf Stapledon was a marvellous predictor who wrote science fiction books that I read when I was 16 and that completely blew my mind; and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] put his finger on quite a number of bright thoughts. He and I have something in common: we both took out of the public library the same science fiction book when we were boys of about 15 or 16, which was Stapledon's ''Last and First Men''. We took it out of the same country library in [[Porlock]] in Somerset. Whoever put that book on the shelves had a lot to answer for!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Hart Davis]] (2004) ''talking science'' Wiley {{ISBN|0-470-09302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Patrick Moore]] has said "The science fiction novel ''Last and First Men'' by Olaf Stapledon is immensely thought-provoking and I've read it time and time again."&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4122975.ece |title=Best science books |accessdate=6 September 2009 |format= |work= The Times | location=London | date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olympic mascots''' are [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]], usually an animal native to the area or human figures, who represent the cultural heritage of the place where the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Paralympic Games]] are taking place. The mascots are often used to help market the Olympic Games to a younger audience, in particular [[toddler]]s and [[children]].
Ever since the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]], the Olympic Games have always had a [[mascot]]. The first major mascot in the Summer Olympic Games was [[Misha]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]]. Starting with the [[Miga, Quatchi, Sumi and Mukmuk|2010 Vancouver mascots]], the Olympic and [[Paralympic mascots]] have been presented together.

==History==
The first Olympic mascot was born at the Grenoble Olympic Games in 1968. It was named "Schuss" and it was a little man on skis, designed in an abstract form and painted in the colors of France: blue, red and white.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Olympic Mascots 1968–2014 – Photos &amp; Origins|url = http://www.olympic.org/mascots-history|website = www.olympic.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first official Olympic mascot appeared in the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. It was [[Waldi]], a Dachshund dog, a popular breed in [[Bavaria]] and it represented the attributes required for athletes – resistance, tenacity and agility. On it we can see three of the colors of the Olympic flag (blue, yellow, green).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Olympic Games Mascots|url = http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/mascots.htm|website = www.topendsports.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ολυμπιακές Μασκότ Χειμερινοί Αγώνες – Athens Info Guide|url = http://www.athensinfoguide.com/gr/olympicmascotssummer.htm|website = www.athensinfoguide.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of those first mascots helped the idea of a mascot become a symbol of the Olympic Games and developed into an institution. Mascots are very popular and despite the importance of the message they convey, they are designed in simple manner with bright, happy colors appropriate for the ‘festive’ atmosphere of the Olympic Games.

The mascots for the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], were Phevos and Athena, two dolls inspired by a bell-shaped archaic sculpture that is on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.  In ancient times, these dolls, the ‘daidala’, as they were called, were also items of worship as well as toys.  Phevos and Athena are brother and sister and so they symbolize the joy of play and the values of Olympism.  The choice of a brother and sister was purposely made to promote the values of equality and brotherhood.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Lookism''' is discriminatory treatment toward people considered physically [[unattractive]], mainly in the workplace but also in dating and other social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Lookism | publisher = The Free Dictionary | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lookism | accessdate = September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not classified in the same way as racial, cultural, sexual discrimination, "lookism" is widespread and affects how people are perceived as well as affecting their opportunities in terms of romantic relationships, job opportunities, etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is associated with good things; in contrast, physical unattractiveness is associated with negative things. Many people make judgments of others based on their physical appearance that influence how they respond to those people. Research on the "What is beautiful is good" stereotype shows that, overall, those who are physically attractive benefit from their good looks: physically attractive individuals are perceived more positively and physical attractiveness has a strong influence on judgment of a person's competence.&lt;ref name="Eagly et al., 1991)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = Alice| last2 = Ashmore | first2 = Richard | last3 = Makhijani| first3 = Mona G.| last4 = Longo| first4 = Laura C.| year = 1991 | title = What is beautiful is good, but. | journal = Psychological Bulletin| volume = 110 | pages = 109–128 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.110.1.109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, physically attractive people benefit from these stereotypical beliefs. Research shows that on average, physically attractive individuals have more friends, better social skills, and more active sex lives. However, attractiveness does not have any effect on the level of happiness experienced by the individual.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, Simmons, &amp; Peters, 2005)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 =  Gillian | last2 =  Simmons | first2 = Leigh | last3= Peters | first3= Marianne | year = 2005 | title = Attractiveness and Sexual Behavior: Does Attractiveness Enhance Mating Success?| journal = Evolution and Human Behavior| volume = 26 | issue =  2 | pages = 186–201 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.08.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
Though the term "lookism" is of recent coinage, cultures and traditions worldwide have often warned against placing undue value on physical appearance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To judge by appearances is to get entangled in the Veil of Maya [in Buddhist thought] ... From ancient times until relatively recently, there was widespread worry about lookism, because the appearance of others may deceive, especially in romance, or it may be personally or politically imprudent to judge or act on appearances. Judging by appearances was prohibited by monotheistic religions ("no graven images") and criticized in ancient and medieval philosophies. [[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptics]], [[Stoics]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Epicureans]] and [[Scholastics]] elaborated various reasons to avoid or subordinate the role of appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap (2005). "[https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust? The History and Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]." ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Vol. 19 No. 2, Spring 2005, pp. 31–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the term "lookism" was first coined in the 1970s within the [[fat acceptance movement]]. It was used in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Magazine in 1978, which asserted that the term was coined by fat people who created the word to refer to "discrimination based on looks."&lt;ref&gt;John Ayto, ''20th Century Words'', Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears in several major English language dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com Bartleby.com] — "[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html Lookism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205050857/http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html |date=2008-12-05 }}". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some overlap between the terms teratophobia, cacophobia and lookism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Bee. "Buddhism and disability: toward a socially engaged Buddhist ‘theology’of bodily inclusiveness." Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Universities (JIABU) 9.1 (2017): 26–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narozny, W. A. L. D. E. M. A. R., J. E. R. Z. Y. Kuczkowski, and B. O. G. U. S. L. A. W. Mikaszewski. "Measuring severity of tinnitus with a visual analog scale." Am Fam Physician 71.5 (2005): 855–856.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Lookism has received scholarly attention both from a [[cultural studies]] and an [[economics]] perspective. In the former context, lookism relates to preconceived notions of [[beauty]] and cultural [[stereotyping]] based on appearance as well as [[gender role]]s and expectations. Important economic considerations include the question of income gaps based on looks, as well as increased or decreased productivity from workers considered beautiful or ugly by their co-workers. Due to this, new problems arise that are tied to other social issues like racism and ageism (young over old). The idea of beauty is also linked directly to social class because people who have more free time and money have the ability to work on their appearance. Weight is also linked to social class because people who are overweight do not have the exercise equipment or the healthy food choices that wealthier people do. Judging people on the basis of attractiveness decreases a person's self-esteem leading to a negative self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grollman|first1=Dr. Eric Anthony|title=Prejudice And Attraction: Is Beauty Really In The Beholder's Eye?|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/prejudice-attraction-beauty-beholders-eye/|website=Kinsey Confidential|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have examined this phenomenon among [[gay men]]. According to the block quote on page 117 of a 2004 work by Todd Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| title        = Eclectic Views on Gay Male Pornography: Pornucopia  &lt;!-- edited? by 'Morrison, Todd'? or ... "compiled" by? or, [...]? --&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Michelangelo Signorile]] (in a 1997 overview of contemporary trends in the gay male community) described "body fascism" as&lt;blockquote&gt;the setting of a rigid set of standards of physical beauty that pressures everyone within a particular group to conform to them. Any person who doesn't meet those very specific standards is deemed physically unattractive and sexually undesirable. In a culture in which the physical body is held in such high esteem and given such power, body fascism then not only deems those who don't or can't conform to be sexually less desirable, but in the extreme – sometimes dubbed "looksism" – also deems an individual completely worthless ''as a person,'' based solely on his exterior. In this sense it is not unlike racism or sexism or homophobia itself. ...

==Empirical support==
According to [[Nancy Etcoff]], a psychologist at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], "we face a world where lookism is one of the most pervasive but denied prejudices".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-8-27-00-on-language-lookism.html "The Way We Live Now: 8-27-00: On Language; Lookism"], ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', August 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to several studies, Angela Stalcup writes that "The evidence clearly indicates that not only is there a premium for prettiness in Western culture, there is also penalty for plainness."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Stalcup. [http://angelastalcup.com/sample_article.pdf ''The Plainness Penalty: Lookism in Western Culture''.]&lt;/ref&gt; When discrimination on the grounds of a person's appearance turns into fear or conveyed aversion, it is referred to as cacophobia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Sometimes cacophobia may be internalized and thus directed inwards rather than towards others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/10/28/2003603118|title=Woman sues clinic after it refuses her cosmetic surgery – Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on newborns have found that human infants as young as 14 hours from birth prefer to look at attractive faces rather than unattractive faces.&lt;ref name=gaze&gt;New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6355-babies-prefer-to-gaze-upon-beautiful-faces/ Babies prefer to gaze upon beautiful faces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newborn&gt;Slater et al., [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016363839890011X Newborn infants prefer attractive faces]&lt;/ref&gt; The preference also extends to non-human animals such as cats.&lt;ref name=conspecifics&gt;Quinn et al., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566458/ Preference for attractive faces in human infants extends beyond conspecifics]&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that lookism is an innate product of how the human visual system functions.&lt;ref name=asa&gt;American Psychological Association, [http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct06/pretty.aspx Pretty faces: Easy on the brain?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by [[Dan Ariely]] found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.&lt;ref&gt;"Ariely found that a 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10" man would need $32,000 more." Lori Gottlieb (2010). ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough''. Penguin, {{ISBN|9781101185209}} p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ethics===
In the article "Is Lookism Unjust", Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap discuss when discrimination based on looks can legitimately be described as unjust.&lt;ref name = "xxx"&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap. (2005). "[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust?: The Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]". ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' 19 (2): 31–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tietje and Cresap quote evidence that suggests there exists "a 7–to–9 percent 'penalty' for being in the lowest 9 percent of looks among all workers, and a 5 percent 'premium' for being in the top 33 percent". While accepting that the evidence indicates that such discrimination does occur, the authors argue that it has been pervasive throughout history and that judgments of aesthetics appear to be a biological adaptation (rather than culturally conditioned) to aid reproduction, survival and social interaction, allowing people to determine viable mates (level of attractiveness being indicative of health) and the status of others as "friend or enemy, threat or opportunity". The authors also argue that if physical attractiveness can improve a company's success, then awarding people for it is justifiable, as the trait is thus relevant to the job and discrimination only occurs when irrelevant traits are used. In addition, the authors question the practicality of both redressing any injustices based on lookism and of determining whether such injustices have in fact occurred. Thus the authors conclude that there can be no clear model of injustice in such discrimination, nor would legislation to address it be practicable – "We do not see how any policy interventions to redress beauty discrimination can be justified."&lt;ref name = "xxx"/&gt;

==Political lookism==
Lookism has been an issue in politics for centuries, with a long tradition in the United Kingdom of "mercilessly exaggerat[ing]" the physical flaws of politicians in newspaper cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Johnathan (2012). "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/too-ugly-for-politics-ed-miliband Can you be too ugly for politics?]", ''The Guardian'' 10 January 2012; accessed 19 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1960#Debates|1960 Presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon]], it was often believed that Kennedy's more conventionally handsome appearance contributed to his winning more approval in their first televised debate,&lt;ref name="museum.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=kennedy-nixon |title=THE KENNEDY-NIXON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, 1960 – The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications (MBC) |date= |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some researchers have challenged this widespread idea and argued that Kennedy's appearance had little or no influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978709368226 |title=The myth of viewer‐listener disagreement in the first Kennedy‐Nixon debate|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=38|pages=16|publisher=The Central States Speech Journal  |year= 1987 |accessdate=August 7, 2012|doi=10.1080/10510978709368226|last1=Vancil|first1=David L.|last2=Pendell|first2=Sue D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variables that might contribute to the objectification of masculinity and femininity in politics. Scholar Charlotte Hooper argued that "gender intersects with other social divisions such as class, race and sexuality to produce complex hierarchies of (gendered) identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Charlotte|title=Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics|journal=Review of International Studies|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=475–480|doi=10.1017/s0260210599004751}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooper argues that institutional practices, such as military combat in war, have greatly defined what it means to be a man. Furthermore, the symbolic dimension, which includes sports, media, current affairs, etc. has "disseminate[d] a wealth of popular iconography which links Western masculinities to the wider world beyond the borders of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Charlotte|title=Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics|journal=Review of International Studies|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=475–580|doi=10.1017/s0260210599004751}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where the ideology of lookism is firmly entrenched according to Hooper. Similarly, Laura Shepherd suggests that men are required to fit into the "matrix of intelligibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura J.|title=Sex or Gender? Bodies in World Politics and Why Gender Matters|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by acting a certain way, dressing a certain way, and have a mentality that is devoid of emotion or anything effeminate; if they are successful in becoming the ultimate "man's man" then they are virtually untouchable. However, others have suggested that there is only an explicit interest in the analysis of masculinity within this political sphere, it will be impossible to develop a reliable analysis of femininity within this same sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enloe|first=Cynthia|title='Gender' is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness|journal=International Affairs |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing examples from [[Madeleine Albright]]'s TED talk in 2010, "On Being a Woman and Diplomat", Albright expressed her frustrations with how her male colleagues and media commentators would pick apart her appearance. Being the first female Secretary of State for the United States, Albright was in the spotlight on the domestic and international stage; everything from her age, weight, hairstyle and choice of dress were scrutinized; yet ironically, the policy positions she believed to be her most important accomplishments (initiation of the G7, attempts to promote gender equality, etc.) were hardly taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albright|first=Madeleine|title=On Being a Woman and a Diplomat|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/madeleine_albright_on_being_a_woman_and_a_diplomat.html|work=TED Talk|publisher=TEDwomen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Albright's general appearance didn't fit into the narrow category of "attractive" made it even more difficult for her to navigate the space between being a woman and a diplomat. Albright is not the only woman in a position of power, or otherwise, that has been discriminated against because of her appearance. An article published in ''The Washington Post'' in 2005 labeled Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]], as a "[[dominatrix]]" when she stepped out in knee-high black-heeled boots during a visit to Wiesbaden Military Base in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Givhan|first=Robin|title=Condoleezza Rice's Commanding Clothes|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the article was meant to give credit to Rice for "challeng[ing] expectations and assumptions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gavhin|first=Robin|title=Condoleezza Rice's Commanding Clothes|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=October 2013}} argue that the article gave her a hyper-sexualized image, and further removed the audience from focusing on the purpose of her visit to the military place. Similarly, media commentators have often chosen to report on Hillary Clinton's "man suits" and Julia Gillard's short hairstyle, instead of focusing on these women's professional accomplishments.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, was the subject of much media attention due to her conventionally attractive appearance,&lt;ref&gt;Frick, Ali (2008).

==Law==

===United States===
Until the 1970s, lookism in the [[United States]] was sometimes codified into law. In many jurisdictions, so-called "[[ugly law]]s" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, Patricia Leigh. "Viewing Ahab and Barbie Through the Lens of Disability." New York Times (August 20, 2000) as quoted by http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29736932_ITM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29736932_ITM|title=AML - support.gale|website=www.accessmylibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] considers extreme [[obesity]] to be a [[disability]] protected by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], and a few cities protect against discrimination based on appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Evangeline|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangelinegomez/2012/01/31/should-businesses-worry-about-appearance-based-discrimination-in-the-workplace/|title=Should Businesses Worry About Appearance-Based Discrimination in the Workplace?|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, there is no federal law protecting against discrimination based on physical appearance.

The '''phonology''' of the '''Massachusett language''' was re-introduced to the Mashpee, Aquinnah, Herring Pond and Assonet tribes that participate in the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, co-founded by Jessie Little Doe Baird in 1993.  The phonology is based regular sound changes that took place in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian from Proto-Algonquian, as well as cues in the colonial orthography regarding pronunciation, as the writing system was based on English pronunciation and spelling conventions in use at the time, keeping in mind differences in late seventeenth century English versus today.  Other resources included information from extant Algonquian languages with native speakers.&lt;ref name="Project History"&gt;Baird, J. L. D. (2014). 'Project History.' Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project. Retrieved 09 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusett language is an [[Eastern Algonquian languages|eastern]] branch [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] within the [[Algic languages|Algic language family]].  It was historically spoken by the Massachusett people of Greater Boston, the Pawtucket of southernmost Maine, coastal [[New Hampshire]] and the lower [[Merrimack River]] watershed, the Wampanoag of southeastern Massachusetts but specifically Cape Cod and the Islands and portions of Rhode Island, the Nauset (possibly a Wampanoag sub-group) of the outer Cape and the Coweset of north-western Rhode Island, and likely spread as a common second language to many Nipmuc and Pennacook speaking groups.  In a simplified Pidgin form, it was a common medium of intertribal communication across most of New England and Long Island.&lt;ref name="dialects"&gt;Goddard, Ives. 1996. "Introduction." Ives Goddard, ed., The Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17. Languages, pp. 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical phonology of the language is hampered by the dormancy of the language with the death of the last speakers at the end of the nineteenth century as well as dialect leveling.  Since the Bible and most of the missionary translations were based on the dialect of the Massachusett people, specifically its Natick variety, that form gained prestige.  The use of Natick as a training center for Indian missionaries and teachers, who were literate and often drawn from Natick's local families, helped spread the prestige of the particular variety, so that most dialectal differences were quickly lost.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R. (1996). Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts. (p. 59). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dialects certainly existed given the diversity of peoples that used it and its broad distribution.&lt;ref name="dialects"/&gt;

Massachusett vowels can be subdivided into two categories, the short vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} and the long vowels {{IPA|/aː/, /ã/, /aːj/, /iː/}},  and {{IPA|/uː/}}—although {{IPA|/ã/}} is sometimes considered in its own category of nasal vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical features of massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs'' [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 229-230). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/aːj/}} is technically a diphthong, and is particularly prevalent in inanimate intransitive verbs that translate as 'it is X.'  PA *''wapyawi'' &gt; PEA *''wa·pe·yɘw'' &gt; PSNEA *''wąpa·yɘw'' &gt; Massachusett ''wompi'' (''wôpay'') {{IPA|/wãpaːj/}}, ('it is white.')&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary. *''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Algonquian/wa%C2%B7p- wapyawi].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocalic allophones===
The exact values and ranges for allophonic variation of the vowels is unknown, given the death of the last native speakers a century and a quarter in the past, but given that the colonial orthography was based on English values as spoken in the seventeenth century, some clues are provided. The short vowel {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often replaced by {{angbr|u}} in colonial documents.  Given that open front unrounded {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/h/}} was often syncopated, it is likely this allophone approached {{IPA|[ə]}}.&lt;ref name="soixante-neuf"&gt;Goddard, I. (1981). p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dialectal variation aside, it is likely that {{IPA|/a/}} may have also backed to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in some environments.&lt;ref name="Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9"/&gt;

The long vowel {{IPA|/iː/}} was often written with {{angbr|i}} in colonial documents before {{IPA|/sk/}} or {{IPA|/ʃk/}}, indicating it may have shortened to {{IPA|[i]}} in these environments.  A similar process also occurs in Abenakian languages. In the development of Massachusett, {{IPA|/iː/}} weakens to {{IPA|[ə]}}, which triggers k-palatization and vowel affection in certain environments.&lt;ref name="soixante-neuf"/&gt;

The long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}} is written in a myriad of ways, which may just be the difficulty in rendering the vowel according to English spelling rules as used in the colonial orthography. It is likely that most instances were generally {{IPA|[aː]}}, but it most likely backed {{IPA|[ɑː]}} or {{IPA|[ɔː]}}.&lt;ref name="soixante-neuf"/&gt;

The long, nasal vowel {{IPA|/ã/}} (possibly better represented by {{IPA|/ãː/}} to indicate length in addition to nasality) may also frequently approach the mid-open nasal {{IPA|[ɔ̃ː]}}.  Before {{IPA|/h/}}, colonial writers used {{angbr|u}}, possibly indicating an allophone {{IPA|[ə̃ː]}} before {{IPA|/h/}}.  The colonial orthography assigns vowels with a circumflex to write them, but this was not done consistently. A silent {{angbr|m}} (before {{IPA|/p/}}) and {{angbr|n}} (elsewhere) was often used to indicate nasality, but writers often confused usage of the circumflex, to mark nasality, and the acute accent, to mark stress and length.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. (1981). p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The long vowel {{IPA|/uː/}}, represented in the colonial orthography by{{angbr|ꝏ}} or {{angbr|oo}} and {{angbr|8}} in the modern one, was often written with {{angbr|o}} in the earliest colonial writings, suggesting a change from a mid-back vowel or close-mid vowel {{IPA|[oː]}} to a close-back {{IPA|[uː]}}, which can be reconstructed from development.&lt;ref name="soixante-neuf"/&gt;  For example, 'snake' is ''askꝏk'' (''ask8k'') {{IPA|/askuːk/}} and descends from Proto-Algonquian *''aθko·ka'' and Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''axko·k''.&lt;ref&gt;Based on regular patterns of sound change from Proto-Algonquian. Wiktionary *''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Algonquian/a%CE%B8ko%C2%B7ka aθko·ka''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot created a letter {{angbr|ꝏ}} represented in the modern Wampanoag script as {{angbr|8}} to distinguish the long 'oo' from the short 'oo,' but noted that the vowel he was trying to represent was between the two.&lt;ref name="soixante-neuf"/&gt;  Just as {{IPA|/oː/}}, represented in Algonquian linguistics as {{angbr|*''o·''}}, shifted to {{IPA|/uː/}}, a similar process occurred in English just a few generations before Eliot's time during the [[Great Vowel Shift]], and both ''book'' and ''mood'' would have rhymed with the current pronunciations of ''poke'' and ''mode''; even in the [[Early Modern English]] of Eliot's time, the distinction between ''mood'' and ''book'' shared the same vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1991). ''Introduction to Early Modern English''.

Massachusett has thirteen consonant phonemes, not including possible allophones. They are divided into the [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}; [[stop consonants|stop]] {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/, /kʷ/}} and the voiceless [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] stop {{IPA|/tʲ/}}; the voiceless affricates {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} and the voiced continuants, which comprises the voiced nasal {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and the voiced approximants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}. The stop consonants were particularly difficult for early English missionaries to record with the Latin alphabet because Massachusett did not make phonemic distinctions of voicing with these consonants, and these consonants likely had voiced allophones of {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ, ɡʷ, dʲ]}}, dependent upon word environment, dialect, or speaker. In addition, Massachusett consonants probably lacked distinctions based on [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] for these consonants. In English, the equivalent stop consonants are aspirated in stressed and in final positions, but not in consonant clusters after {{IPA|/s/}} (for example, English ''spin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[spɪn]}} while ''pin'' is pronounced {{IPA|[pʰɪn]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical Features of Massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs'' [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 227–244). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these differing phonologies, the colonial orthography can be separated into unvoiced/voiced pairs that do not change meaning, such as {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}/{{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}}/{{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|q[u]}}/{{angbr|g[w]}}, {{angbr|s}}/{{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|d}}/{{angbr|t}}, which correspond to {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|t}}, respectively, in the modern orthography.&lt;ref name="Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9"&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot and the other colonial missionaries often switched between the unvoiced-voiced pairs, and it is possible that the consonants themselves had allophones dependent on word position and dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). Native writings in Massachusetts. In Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society (185 ed. Part II, pp. 276-279). Philadelphia, PA: American Philosophical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9"/&gt;

The phonetic value of {{IPA|/s/}} in clusters probably approached {{IPA|[s̪]}}, given the alteration of {{IPA|/hs/}} and {{IPA|/hʃ/}} and {{IPA|/sk/}} and {{IPA|/ʃk/}} in representation in the colonial orthography. As {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} had merged in Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, restoration of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in consonants, especially in clusters with {{IPA|/h/}}, indicates that the allophone of {{IPA|/s/}} in these environments was generally {{IPA|[s̪]}}, which sounds closer to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}{{dubious|the diacritic used here is a dental one. Is it supposed to be retracted?|date=September 2018}} and generally represented by {{angbr|sh}} in the WLRP new orthography.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. (1981). pp. 59-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of borrowings, English-language religious, technical, agricultural, legal, societal, cultural, and governmental terminology was adopted by the Indians. Foreign sounds, or recognition of the preferred allophone, led to the adoption of {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /dʒ/, /ʒ/, /θ/, /ð/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as phonemes in these English loanwords. However, it is likely that only bilingual speakers or those exposed to English speakers pronounced these words more akin to their English values, whereas monolingual Massachusett speakers and those further from English contact would have likely used native approximantions. For example, colonial-era documents include both preserved ''Frenchmenog'' (possibly {{IPA|[frɛntʃmənak]}}) vs. nativized ''panachmanog'' (possibly {{IPA|[pənãtʃmənak]}}). In addition, anecdotal evidence from accounts of English colonists indicate that the Massachusett or related N-dialect speakers had trouble with English {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, even though they existed in related languages, since they pronounced English words ''sleep'' and ''lobster'' as ''sneep'' and ''nobstah''.  However, final {{IPA|/r/}} goes unnoticed as English in New England developed non-rhotically.

Although the revived dialect of the Wampanoag continues to use some loan words from English (such as ''pâyum-'', {{IPA|/paːjəm/}} from English ''pay''), most borrowings are eschewed for native equivalents, neologisms coined from known Massachusett radicals and adoption of terms from cognate, extant Algonquian languages since the new speakers of the language are all bilingual or more proficient in English.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the colonial-era Indians adopted the English calendrical system, and adopted all the terms for units of time and names for the days and months. Thus, '[[Thursday]]' and as well as its alternate Early Modern English form ''Y&lt;sup&gt;urſday&lt;/sup&gt;'' existed along the lesser-used Massachusett coinage ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' (''nôpanatahshuquneehshôk'') {{IPA|/nãpanatahʃəkʷəniːhʃãk/}}, which can be translated as 'that which goes five days long' (after the [original] Sabbath).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Portuguese ''quinta-feira'', 'fifth day' or 'Thursday.'&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''nappanatashikquinishonk'' is created from Massachusett radicals by the Indians, even if it referred to a Western cultural introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, J. (1830). ''Vocabulary of the Massachusetts (or Natick) Indian Language'' in ''Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society''. John Davis (ed.) Vol II(3). pp. 242-243. Cambridge, Massachusetts: E. W. Metcalf Company.  Publication of notes compiled in 1707-1708 of by Josiah Cotton, some with the help of his father, John Cotton, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonotactics==
Few consonant clusters, especially in relation to Proto-Eastern Algonquian and Proto-Algonquian, are permitted in the Massachusett language; however, syncopation, i.e., deletion of {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}} or {{IPA|/iː/}} when they fall in weak or weaker stress positions in a word, increased the number of possible clusters in the rare Massachusett dialects that employed it. Clusters also tend to occur at the end of a root word before a following suffix, often restoring etymological /ʷ/ and /ʲ/{{clarify|what is etymological /ʷ/ and /ʲ/? Labialization and palatalization?|date=September 2018}} or even entire syllables, which were dropped at the end of consonants as early as Proto-Eastern Algonquian, but are common enough that they have to be learned. For example, ''annum'' (''anum'', 'dog,') but ''annúmm'''w'''ag'' (''anum'''w'''ak'', {{IPA|/anəmwak/}}, 'dogs')&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, additional morphemes attached to the root word often begin with consonants themselves, thus increasing their likelihood at these junctures.

Massachusett uses {{IPA|/hk/, /hkʷ/, /hp/, /hpw/, /hs/, /hsw/, /hʃ/, /hʃw/, /htʲ/, /htʃ/, /htw/, /hw/, /mw/, /nw/, /pw/, /sk/, /skʷ/, /sp/}} and {{IPA|/ʃk/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the rare dialects that permitted syncopation, combinations such as {{IPA|/kskʷ/, /ths/, /skʷ/, /ks/, /kʷs/, /skʷh/}} and {{IPA|/mʃ/}} have been recorded in the literature, although some examples from translations of the [[Book of Psalms]] that were intended to be sung were forcibly altered to fit the meter of the music.  The Massachusett word, ''wussuhquohhonk'' (''wusuhqahôk'' {{IPA|/wəsəhkʷahɔ̃k/}}, 'writing' or 'book') was altered to ''wussukwhonk'' (*''wusuhqhôk'' {{IPA|/wəsəhkʷhãk/}}),&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 55. From (''wusuhqahw-''), 'to write,' plus nominalizer (''-ôk'').  When vowels are deleted in same locations as cited in Costa, it yields the cluster {{IPA|/hkʷh/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yielding a cluster {{IPA|/hkʷh/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). 'pp. 97-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosody==
Stress in the language is unknown, but Massachusett likely had a stress system similar to extant languages, such as Ojibwe, Algonquin, M'ikmaq, Munsee and Unami.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, V. J.  (2001). ''Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar''. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ojibwe, the rule is as follows: A metrical foot consists of two syllables, ideally with the stress on the second syllable.  All long vowels are stressed, and when they occur in the weaker syllable of a metrical foot, the syllable that contains them is counted as its own foot and counting begins on the next syllable pair, and the last syllable is always stressed.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;Hayes, B. (1995). ''Metrical Stress Theory: Principles and Case Studies.'' (pp. 215-227). Urbana-Champagne, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In M'ikmaq, Unami and Munsee, languages that are more closely related to Massachusett, the rules are a little more complex. In these languages, metrical feet consist of two syllables or [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], forming either strong right-foot iambs or strong left-foot trochees. Primary stress generally falls on either the rightmost (iambic) or leftmost (trochaic) syllables, but there are numerous exceptions. Unlike the Ojibwe system, these Eastern Algonquian languages allow for word-final unstressed syllables. Long vowels tend to be stressed, but may be shortened when long vowels fall in the weaker position. Long vowels and short syllables in the strong part of the foot receive secondary stress.  Stressed words, especially the primary stress, are pronounced louder and at a higher pitch, with secondary stress the effects less so.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;  Because Massachusett, generally, does not undergo vowel syncope, weak vowels can receive secondary stress and entire words can consist of weak, short vowel syllables as in Mi'kmaq and Unami.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, E. (Presenter.). (2012). Describing the Accent System of Listuguj Mi’gmaq. Chicago, Il: 44th Algonquian Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

==Phonological processes==
===Vowel affection===
A {{IPA|/j/}} is inserted before vowels that follow  {{IPA|/n/, /ht/, /t/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}, only when these consonants in turn come after the vowels {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}  This {{IPA|/j/}} is written with a single {{angbr|e}} in both the colonial and modern orthographies of the Massachusett language. This is not triggered in every instance, but it generally occurs when the short vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} is the weakened form of Proto-Algonquian *''i·'' and *''i'' (both of which merged into Proto-Eastern Alqonquian *''i'' before weakening in Proto-Southern New England Algonquian) or {{IPA|/iː/}} which did not undergo weakening.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I.

===Palatization of /k/===
Unique to Southern New England Alonquian, the same processes that trigger vowel affection also bring about palatization.  When {{IPA|/k/}} is followed by an {{IPA|/ə/}} that is etymologically a weakened form of PEA *''ī'', which is in turn followed by either {{IPA|/hp/, /p/, /m/, /hk/}} or {{IPA|/k/}}, the consonant shifts to {{IPA|/tʲ/}}.  Palatization is also triggered when {{IPA|/k/}} is followed by {{IPA|/aː/}}, which derives from PEA *''ē'', and {{IPA|/əw/}}, which remains unchanged from PEA *''əw''.  The palatization of {{IPA|/k/}} followed by {{IPA|/ə/}} is common, but in Massachusett, {{IPA|/k/}} is often restored before {{IPA|/aː/}} and {{IPA|/əw/}} by analogy to prevent excessive alteration of forms.&lt;ref name="G230"&gt;Goddard, I. (1990). p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonial orthography, this was represented by {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|dj}}, {{angbr|j}}, {{angbr|te}}, {{angbr|ti}}, {{angbr|ty}}, or simply {{angbr|t}} before {{angbr|u}}.  In the modern orthography, {{angbr|ty}} represents {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, the palatization of {{angbr|k}}, and {{angbr|te}} represents {{IPA|/t/}} followed by the {{IPA|/j/}} of the following affected vowel, or {{IPA|/t/}} + {{IPA|/j/}}[vowel]; this has the same pronunciation, but is distinguished for etymological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J.

The most ancient reconstructed ancestor of the Massachusett language is Proto-Algic, believed to have been spoken circa 5000 BC in what is now the [[Northwest Plateau]] region, such as the inland regions of the [[Pacific Northwest]] along the Columbia River separated from the coast by rugged mountains.  Movements of people and competition for resources, shifts to other languages that developed or arrived in the region pushed the Algic languages out of their original homeland.  The only known non-Algonquian Algic languages are Yurokan and Wiyotan, known only from the current languages [[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]], which despite sharing cultural similarities and inhabiting adjacent areas of the northernmost coastal area of California, their languages are relics of a historically more widespread group of languages which diverged in the very distant past.&lt;ref&gt;Cambell, L. (1997). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. In (pp. 151-153). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives (1994). 'The West-to-East Cline in Algonquian Dialectology'. In Cowan, William. ''Actes du Vingt-Cinquième Congrès des Algonquinistes''. Ottawa, ON: Carleton University. pp. 187–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an unknown Algic ancestor, Proto-Algonquian emerged sometime around 1000 BC, posited to have been spoken anywhere from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains of Montana or an area just west of the Great Lakes.  The Algonquian languages spread, covering southern Canada and the northern half of the United States from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.  Around 1000 AD, Proto-Eastern Algonquian emerged, probably somewhere in southern Ontario about the Great Lakes region, and spread from the Maritimes to the Carolinas and separated by speakers of Iroquoian languages.  The Eastern languages, which are the only genetic grouping to have emerged from Algonquian, can be further differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;Bragdon, K. J. (2005). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. (pp. 93-95, 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Eastern Algonquian had a daughter language, Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, which is the ancestor of all the languages of southern New England and most of Long Island.  This includes related languages such as Nipmuc, Mohegan-Pequot, Niantic, Narragansett and Quiripi-Naugatuck.  The timeline for the development of PSNEA is unclear, but it might be linked to the local adoption of corn, beans and squash agriculture slowly introduced from the south.  When Massachusett as a spoke language is unclear, but by the 1400s, cultural practices and peoples would probably be recognizable to the Pilgrims and Puritans that encountered their descendants two centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Bragdon, K. (1999). pp. 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonant development===
The most striking feature in the development of Proto-Eastern Algonquian was the collapse of PA *''θ'' and *''l'' into PEA *''r''.  As a result, reconstructed PA *''aθemwa'' ('dog') and *''*e·likwa'' ('ant') become PEA *''arəm'' and *''e·ri·kw'', respectively. This is in contrast to Arapaho ''heθ'' (''he3'', 'dog'), which preserves PA *''θ'' and the 'Illu' dialects of western [[Innu language|Montagnais]] (Innu) ''eylig'' and the 'Irru' dialect of the [[Atikamekw language|Atikamekw]] ''eyrig'' (since PA *''l'' was most likely realized as {{IPA|[r]}} in most Algonquian languages, or a fricative {{IPAblink|ɬ}} that was somewhere between {{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[l]}}). Note that PSNEA inherited *''arəm'' unaltered, but either reduplication or an unknown prefix, PA *''e·ri·kw'' yields Massachusett ''anuneks'' or ''annuncks'' (possibly *{{IPA|/aː[nə]nəkw[ee]s/}} with diminutive suffix) instead of expected PSNEA *''a·nəkw''.

In consonant clusters, however, PA *''θ'' and *''l'' behave very differently. Proto-Algonquian *C''θ'' generally yields *C''x'', save PA *''nθ'' which develops into PEA *''hr''.  In clusters of PA *''θ''C, most merge into PEA *''s''C with the exception of PA *''θp'' which is realized as PEA *''šp''.  Very few PA clusters of *C''l'' are permitted.  The development of PA *''ˀl'' to PEA *''hr'' is expected, but PA *''hl'' falls into PEA *''hx'' and PA *''nl'' is even more erratic.  Under normal development, *''nl'' would yield PEA *''hr'', but it morphs into *''h'' in transitive inanimate singular imperatives.  Furthermore, PA *''ˀl'', *''nl'' and *''nθ'' &gt; PEA *''hr'', *''PA *''hl'', *''hθ'' and *''ˀθ'' &gt; PEA *hx''.

Other general mergers include the collapse of PA *''h''C and *''ˀ''C into PEA *''h''C.  For example, PA *''ht'' and *''ˀt'' &gt; PEA **''ht'' and PA *''ht'', PA *''hp'' and *''ˀp'' &gt; PEA **''hp'' and *''hč'' and *''ˀč'' &gt; PEA **''hč''.   With the exception of *''nl'' and *''nθ'', all instances of PA *''n''C are retained in PEA.  Proto-Algonquian *''ç'' develops into *''r'' in PEA even in clusters.  PA *''č'' before *''p'' and *''k'' altered to PEA *''š'' and *''s'', respectively.  Also, PA *''x'' and *''s'' merge into PEA *''s''.  Proto-Eastern Algonquian also prefers to drop PA *''w'' and *''y'' after consonants and clusters in PEA, but these are often restored by analogy when there are inflectional endings.  For example, PA *''maθkwa'' &gt; PEA *''maxk'' &gt; PSNEA *''mask'' &gt; Massachusett ''mosk'' (''masq'') {{IPA|/mask/}}, but Massachusett ''mosgq&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;ak'' (''masqash'') {{IPA|/mask&lt;u&gt;ʷ&lt;/u&gt;ash/}}.

In the development of Proto-Southern New England Algonquian, several notable developments take place, especially in regards to PEA *''r''.  In PEA, all instances of *''r'' that descend from PA *''ç'' must have been unstable or had a unique treatment in PEA as they all shifted to PSNEA *''s'', e.g., PA *''ç'' &gt; PEA *''r'' &gt; PSNEA *''s'', PA *''çk'' &gt; PEA *''rk'' &gt; PSNEA *''sk'' and PA *''çp'' &gt; PEA *''rp'' &gt; PSNEA *''sp''.  Clusters from PEA with *''r'' also show the same instability.  Whereas PEA *''r yields PSNEA *''r'', in final positions, it becomes PSNEA *''š'', most noticeable in treatments of inanimate plurals.  For example, PA *''meçkw-'' &gt; PEA *''mərkw-'' &gt; PSNEA *''məskw-'' &gt; Massachusett ''musqu'' (''mushq-''), 'red.'  But also PA *''mehθo·θši'' &gt; PEA *''məhxo·r'' &gt; PSNEA *''məhšo·r'' &gt; Massachusett ''mishoon'' (''muhsh8n'') {{IPA|/məhʃuːn/}}.

In a similar vein, PEA *''hr'', *''hš'' and *''hx all merge into PSNEA *''hš''.  As a result of these mergers, the sound of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} was preserved in PSNEA, since PEA *''s'' and *''š'' merge in PSNEA as *''s''.  Even PEA *''nš'' and *''šp'' yield PSNEA *''s'' and *''sp'', respectively.  For example, PA *''le·hle-'' &gt; PEA *''re·hxe-'' &gt; PSNEA *''ra·hš'' &gt; Massachusett ''náhsh-'' (''nâhsh-'') {{IPA|/naːhʃ/}}&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and PEA *''wi·nkwe·hre·w'' &gt; PSNEA *''wi·kwahš'' &gt; Massachusett ''wégquosh'' (''weeqahsh'') {{IPA|/wiːkʷaːʃ/}}&lt;ref&gt;Costa. D. J. (2007). p. 37. Based on reconstruction from PEA *''wi·nkwe·hre·w'' ('swan')&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development is the palatization of PEA *''k''.  As described in other sections, this causes a shift to PSNEA *''ty'' in restrictive environments.  For example, PA *''kakakiwa'' &gt; PEA *''kakakiw'' &gt; PSNEA *''kąkąntyəw'' &gt; Massachusett ''kôkontu'' (''kôkôtyuw'') {{IPA|/kãkãtʲəw/}}, 'crow.'  Furthermore, PEA *''sk'' undergoes palatization to PSNEA *''hč''.  For example, PA *''niswineθke·k'' &gt; PEA *''ni·sinǝxke·k'' (northern PEA *''ni·sinǝške·k'' and possibly even *''ni·sinǝske·k'' in New England PEA) &gt; PSNEA *''ni·sǝnǝhča·k'' &gt; Massachusett ''nesnehchag'' (''neesnuhchâk'') {{IPA|/niːsnəhtʃaːk/}}, 'twenty' (literally 'two [pairs of] hands'). Otherwise, the typical development of PA *''θk'' is PSNEA *''sk''.

In the development of Massachusett from PSNEA, a few noticeable differences arise.  Mainly, PSNEA *''r'' is {{IPA|/n/}} in Massachusett dialects, but within the SNEA languages, there are varieties that have replaced PSNEA *''r'' with {{IPA|/l/}} (Nipmuc), {{IPA|/j/}} (Niantic), {{IPA|/n/}} (some Narragansett dialects) or retained historical {{IPA|/r/}} (Quiripi).  For instance, PSNEA *''arəm'' ('dog') was Massachusett ''anum'', Narragansett ''ayimp'', Nipmuc ''alum'', and Quiripi ''arum''.  Massachusett preserves final PEA *''r'' as {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and the general merger of PSNEA merger of *''s'' and *''š'', but {{IPA|[ʃ]}} re-appears as an allophone of {{IPA|/s/}}, probably due to the influence of emerging {{IPA|/hʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in other environments, but the alteration may have varied by dialect or perhaps imparted some unknown semantic meaning.

The instability of PA *''nl'' is also preserved.  While it tends to follow that it evolves into PEA *''hr'' and then it should yield PSNEA *''hš'', however, it seems to have, in certain words, evolved into PEA *''r'' or *''h'', especially in transitive inanimate second person imperative verbs but appears in Massachusett as {{IPA|/n/, /s/}} or {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (and not {{IPA|/hʃ/}}), however, words in this category seem to have been altered by analogy to other words, such as PA *''no·nle·waki'' &gt; PEA *''no·hre·wak'' &gt; PSNEA *''no·ra·wak'' &gt; Massachusett ''nꝏnáog'' (''n8nâwak'' {{IPA|/nuːnaːwak/}}, 'she suckles them' or 'she nurses them') or appears as {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}.

The vowels of Proto-Algonquian were very symmetric, comprising short vowels *''a'', *''e'', *''i'' and *''o'' followed by their long counterparts *''a·'', *''e·'', *''i·'' and *''o·''.  These remained relatively intact in some of the Central Algonquian languages, but were radically restructured in most of the Plains Algonquian languages and Eastern Algonquian languages.

Both PA *''i'' and *''o'' are lost and merge into their long counterparts in PEA, e.g., PA *''i'' and *''i·'' &gt; PEA *''i·'' and PA *''o'' and *''o·'' &gt; PEA *''o·''.  Proto-Algonquian *''e'' alters to PEA *''ə'' but PA *''a'', *''a·'' and *''e·'' remain unchanged.  This left PEA Algonquian with two short vowels *''a'' and *''ə'' and four long vowels *''a·'', *''e·'', *''i·'' and  *''o·''.

Proto-Southern New England Algonquian kept the PEA vowels *''a'', *''ə'' and *''o·'' unaltered. Proto-Eastern Algonquian *''e·'' shifted to PSNEA *''a·''. However, PEA *''a·'' was lost, instead it was altered to the PSNEA nasal vowel *''ą''.  Although this appears to be diagnostic of the SNEA languages, the intrusive nasal is possibly a feature shared with Algonquian. The PEA long vowel *''i·'' underwent some alteration. When not in the initial syllable of a word, and probably in an unstressed position often shortened to PSNEA *''ə'', a process that may also trigger vowel affection and {{IPA|/k/}} palatization.

The vowel inventory of PSNEA *''a'', *''a·'', *''ą'', *''ə'', *''i·'' (which are equivalent to their Massachusett phonological representation {{IPA|/a/, /aː/, /ã/, /ə/}} and {{IPA|/iː/}}, respectively) is retained, but PSNEA *''o·'' becomes *''uː'' or {{IPA|/uː/}}. This is reflected by the double-o ligature {{angbr|ꝏ}} or the digraph {{angbr|oo}} in the colonial-era documents and {{angbr|8}} in the modern orthography implemented by the WLRP.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, J. (1832). The Indian Grammar Begun. Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, IX(2), 243-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermino, J. L. D. 2000. p. 9"/&gt; Eliot claimed that the double o ligature was pronounced like English ''book'' and ''mood'', both of which were also pronounced {{IPA|/oː/}} before shifting to {{IPA|/uː/}}, but the word ''book'' was probably still pronounced closer to {{IPA|[buːk]}} than current {{IPA|[bʊk]}} in Eliot's time, as the effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English were still going on, and may reflect Eliot's use of {{angbr|o}} in his earliest Massachusett writings, whereas the majority use {{angbr|ꝏ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lass, Roger (2000). "Chapter 3: Phonology and Morphology". In Lass, Roger. The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476–1776. Cambridge University Press. pp. 56–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot also used {{angbr|ꝏ}} for what has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/əw/}}, especially word-medial or word-final positions, and {{IPA|/wə/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}} word initially. However, in the modern orthography, {{angbr|8}} is only used for what can be traced back to developments from Proto-Algonquian *''o·''.

{{Muhammad}}
'''Na'at''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|نعت}}}}) refers to [[poetry]] in praise of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]]. The practice is popular in South Asia ([[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]), commonly in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Urdu]] or [[Punjabi language]]. People who recite Na'at are known as ''Na'at Khawan'' or ''sana'a-khua'an''. Exclusive "Praise to God" and God alone is called [[Hamd]], not to be confused with 'Na'at', which contains "praise to The Prophet Muhammad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naat Sharif ( Meaning of Naat &amp; Hamd ) - Naat by Sahaba-e-Ikhram|url=http://sufisaints.com/forumss/index.php?topic=642.0|website=Sufi Saints|publisher=SMF|accessdate=10 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113062202/http://sufisaints.com/forumss/index.php?topic=642.0|archivedate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Arab countries, lyrics and praises said for the [[Muhammad]] are called [[Madih nabawi]].

==History==
It is difficult to trace the history of Na'at khawani since no authenticated record of when it was initiated can be found.  One early author, Hassan, was known as ''Shair-e-Darbaar-e-Risalat''.  Even before accepting Islam he was a poet, but after embracing Islam he gave a new turn to his poetry and started writing Na'ats in honor of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;'URDU ZABAN MEIN NA’T GŪ’Ī KA FUN' (Literary Criticism) Book in URDU by Syed Waheed Ashraf&lt;/ref&gt; He was famous for his poetry that defended Muhammad in response to rival poets who attacked him and his religion. Therefore, Hassan is known as the first ''sana-khawaan'' (na'at reciter) of that time. After that many a poet followed this trend and totally dedicated themselves towards writing of na'ats.

[[Tala' al Badru 'Alayna]], a song sung to Muhammad during his completion of migration to Medina in 622 CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/ihame/Sec2.htm|title= "Islam and Islamic History in Arabia and the Middle East"}}, islamicity.com website, Retrieved 10 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be one of the earliest na'ats.

==Language==
Commonly the term ''Na'at-Shareef'' (exalted poetry) is reserved and used for poetry in the praise of Muhammad written in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[English language|English]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] &amp; [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]].

In Arabic, Na'at is usually called ''[[Madih nabawi|madih]]'' (praise) or ''[[Nasheed]]'' (poetry), although the latter can describe any type of religious poetry.

'''No nit policy''' is a treatment system recommended by health authorities in Canada and Australia to assist in the elimination of [[head lice infestation]].

The no nit policy involves a number of issues, such as the circumstances under which children will be inspected, the criteria to infer infestation, the procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery, and the criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school. These issues are controversial.  In particular, a number of health researchers and organizations object to the required removal of nits.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Barbara L.

Contributing to the controversial nature of school head lice policies is a lack of available data on their importance and efficacy.

==Inspection==

A 1991 survey of American nurses reported that 27% have regular inspection programs in place at their schools.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;  85% reported inspection on an "as-needed" basis.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt; Routine inspection of children is advocated by a variety of nurses, researchers, organizations, and governments.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CA2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clore1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ellen Rudy Clore |author2=Leah Ann Longyear | date=May 1990 | title = Comprehensive pediculosis screening programs for elementary schools | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 212–214 | pmid = 2366522 | doi = 10.1111/j.1746-1561.1990.tb05917.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some health researchers oppose regular inspections.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASN2004"/&gt;  This opposition to school inspections coincides with opposition to no-nit policies, and is based on similar reasoning (i.e., that they are ineffective).&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;

Barbara Frankowski, a critic of school screenings, argues that time spent screening children by school nurses is better spent on other tasks.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;  This attitude reflects those held by some American school nurses themselves, 27% of whom believe that eliminating lice infestations in ''not'' an important role of school nursing.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Even more telling, only 11% of American school nurses find treating head lice to be professionally gratifying.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Similar attitudes exist among Canadian school nurses.&lt;ref name="Mathias1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathias RG, Wallace JF | title = Control of headlice: using parent volunteers | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 80 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–463 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2611749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keoki Williams and others acknowledge this shortcoming of school screening, and suggest that children found to have nits undergo an additional 5- to 10-minute examination to exclude the presence of live lice.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues not for increased inspection time, but elimination of the school screenings altogether, with parents being educated and encouraged to inspect their own children at home.&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;  This attitude, coupled with the AAP's opposition to the no-nit policy,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt; would essentially absolve school administrators of responsibility to directly manage pediculosis in their student body.

==Nits==

A [[Nits (lice)|nit]] is the egg of a louse. They are white, resembling dandruff, 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm long, cement to the hair base where they are difficult to remove, and may survive for three weeks away from the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSUMZ5ECEbMC&amp;pg=PA896#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The 5-minute Clinical Consult 2007 |page=896| author=Frank J.

These difficulties have, at times, lead to the recommendation that the presence of nits alone be used to infer infestation:[[File:Fig. 5. Louse nits.jpg|thumb|right|Head louse nits on human hair]]

{{quote|When nymphs or adults are not observed, the presence of nits is diagnostic.|U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 1984&lt;ref name="Darsie1984"&gt;{{cite book  | editor = Darsie RE | title = Controlling Head Lice.

A 1998 American study attempted to clarify the infestation risk associated with a "nits-only" diagnosis.  They found that 18% of children with nits (but no apparent lice) became infested (i.e., lice appeared) 14 days later.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Whether these new lice came from viable eggs or via transmission from other hosts was not clear.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Transmission from other hosts would tend to overestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  In addition, some children were treated with [[pediculicide]]s during this 14-day period.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;  Successful treatments (i.e., killing eggs or recently hatched nymphs) would tend to underestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  These limitations of the study notwithstanding, the authors concluded:

{{quote|Most children with nits alone will not become infested; therefore, excluding these children from school and requiring them to be treated with a pediculicide is probably excessive.|L. Keoki Williams and others (2001)&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;}}

Although "nits-only" children are unlikely to become infested, this is not to say that a nit-free population is without value.  Much of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing head lice stems from the possibility that observed nits are due to an extinct infestation.  However, if a policy of required nit removal is enforced, this is no longer an issue.  Against a background of nit-free children, spotting new infestations through routine screening becomes as easy as spotting the nits.&lt;ref name="Brainerd1998"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  This ease in screening comes at a price, though, namely the effort expended (typically by parents) in removing nits.  And to the extent that no-nit policies result in absenteeism, the child's education suffers, and the school's funding (e.g., from government sources) may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdSource"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edsource.org/iss_fin_sys_dollarstodistricts.html | title = Dollars to Districts | accessdate = 2008-12-22 | publisher = EdSource | location = Mountain View, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of infested students==

===Immediate exclusion from school===
Discovery of infested students typically occurs during a school day.  Assuming the presence of live lice is the criteria used to infer infestation, an ethical dilemma is presented to school nurses and administrators.  Should this student, now known to be infectious, be returned to class where transmission to other students could occur?  Or alternatively, should the student be immediately removed from the group setting?  Schools have very limited capacity to individually supervise students outside of the classroom, so removal from the classroom means requesting that the child's parents pick up their child.

Parents often become upset when the school nurse telephones their place of employment to inform them of their child's infestation and to request they come and collect their child.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  Nonetheless, immediate exclusion policies are explicitly advocated by some nurses.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  A 1998 survey revealed that almost all (96%) American [[School nursing|school nurses]] send home infested students upon discovery.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"&gt;

Opponents to immediate exclusion policies point out that the discovery of infestation is merely recognition of what has been an infectious condition for a number of months.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder1983"/&gt;  Given that context, they argue, one more day of group contact is unlikely to result in more transmission than has already occurred.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder1983"/&gt;  This contrasts with more short-term and highly communicable [[virus|viral]] diseases such as [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]], or [[measles]] where immediate exclusion might reasonably reduce disease spread within the school.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The value of immediate exclusion for lice depends to some extent on the frequency of asymptomatic screening at the school.  More frequent screening would tend to decrease the average time between infestation and discovery of that infestation.  This would make the one day associated with immediate exclusion a more significant fraction of the total time the student was infectious.  But even ardent supporters of asymptomatic screening do not advocate screenings more than once every three months.&lt;ref name="Clore1990"/&gt;  This suggests that the effect of immediate exclusion might be an exposure time reduction of as little as 1.6%, even under strict screening guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Three months includes approximately 90 days, which in turn includes approximately 64 weekdays.  One out of 64 days is 0.0156 or 1.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changing attitudes on immediate exclusion appear to be affecting public policy.  For example, in Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that infested children need not be sent home upon discovery.&lt;ref name="Australia2005"/&gt;  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a head lice policy that does not immediately exclude infested children.&lt;ref name="CA2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Documents/2012SchoolGuidanceonHeadLice.pdf | title = Guidelines on head lice prevention and control for school districts and child care facilities | accessdate = 2013-12-30 | author = Infectious Diseases Branch, Division of Communicable Disease Control | year = 2007 | format = pdf | publisher = California Department of Public Health | pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicability in school settings===
Evaluating immediate exclusion policies is difficult, because {{as of|2008|lc=on}} the communicability of head lice in school settings has not been carefully studied.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  This has not, however, prevented authors from confidently asserting their opinion:

{{quote|In some areas... crowded conditions at home may predispose persons to head lice.  Nevertheless, evidence indicates that most transmission actually occurs at school.|Norman G. Gratz, 1997&lt;ref name="Gratz1997"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Lice transmission in schools is rare because close head-to-head contact would have to occur and this generally does not happen in the school setting.|Patricia Sciscione and Cheryl A. Krause-Parello, 2007&lt;ref name="Sciscione2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Patricia Sciscione |author2=Krause-Parello CA | title = No-nit policies in schools: Time for change | journal = The Journal of School Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1177/10598405070230010301 | pmid = 17253890}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two studies have noted clustering of head louse infestation by classroom.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speare1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Richard Speare |author2=Buettner, PG | year = 1999 | title = Head lice in pupils of a primary school in Australia and implications for control | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 38 | pages = 285–290 | publisher = International Society of Dermatology | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00680.x | pmid = 10321945 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the authors differ in their interpretation of this clustering.  In 1997, Richard Speare and Petra Buettner noted prevalence ranges of 0% to 72.2% across classrooms in the same grade (3rd) and in the same Australian school.  This led them to favor the idea that "opportunities for transmission are prominent within the classroom".&lt;ref name="Speare1999"/&gt;  Indeed, their data suggest that classrooms synchronize in terms of infestation status.

In contrast, Janis Hootman suggests that school communicability is low.&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  In 1998 she found that infestations within American classrooms were restricted to a minority of chronically infested students.  Hootman concluded that the infested students have access to an infectious source that their classmates do not.  Similarly, she found that clusters of pediculosis within classrooms were associated with social interactions outside school (e.g., [[sleepover]]s).&lt;ref name="Hootman2002"/&gt;  This indicates that transmission can occur between classmates, but again, these transmission events may be occurring away from school grounds.

==Barring return to school==

After identifying and isolating an infested student, school policy typically requires some sort of verification that the student is no longer infectious before being readmitted to the school.  Typically, this involves inspecting the child for evidence of continued infestation (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  Schools commonly enforce either a "no-nit" policy or a "no-lice" policy.

===The no-nit policy===
The consensus has been changed more recently and the ""no-nit" policy is considered worse than the nits themselves to a child's education and family burden the missed days cause. The EPA, CDC, and NASN all agree "no-nit" policies should be done away with and that kids should remain in school the entire day even if lice is found and notify the parents so they can treat it at home.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/managing-head-lice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasn.org/advocacy/professional-practice-documents/position-statements/ps-head-lice&lt;/ref&gt;
No-nit policies bar readmission of students found to have lice, eggs, or nits.  This policy is popular with health authorities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;  A 1998 survey revealed that a majority (61%) of American [[School nursing|school nurses]] prevent return of treated students to school if they are not (also) nit-free.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  A similar percentage (60%) felt that "forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea."&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Data from a primarily American study during 1998–1999 revealed even higher prevalence—no-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation.&lt;ref name="Pollack2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A | title = Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America | journal = Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 689–93 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10959734 | doi=10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James H. Price and colleagues estimate that infested students lose two to four days of school for treatment and nit removal.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;  Based on their 1998 survey of American school nurses, they estimate that approximately 6 million U.S. children lose 12 to 24 million child-schooldays annually due to lice infestation under no-nit policies.&lt;ref name="Price1999"/&gt;

====Controversy surrounding no-nit policy====
{{Rquote|right|The no-nit policies may appeal to laypersons, and it is difficult to explain why they are not effective, particularly when some consumer organizations strongly support them.  Nevertheless, there is no scientific basis to confirm the effectiveness of such programs...|Barbara L. Frankowski (2004)&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;}}

Although the no-nit policy has the appearance of a simple and popular tool against pediculosis transmission, its implementation has been opposed by a number of health researchers and organizations.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankowski2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASN2004"/&gt;  Opponents argue that enforcement of no-nit policies has not significantly reduced head lice incidence in school settings,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt; and that the risks and disadvantages of the no-nit policies outweigh their associated benefits.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;

As is the case in assessing school screening efforts (see [[School head lice policy#Screening|Screening]] above), assessing the effectiveness of no-nit policies is complicated by the sparseness of head lice prevalence data.&lt;ref name="Donnelly1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billstein1979"/&gt;  To the extent that no-nit policies increase the efficiency of school screening programs (see [[School head lice policy#Benefits of nit-free population|Benefits of nit-free population]] above), no-nit policies may lead to more rapid containment of head lice outbreaks.  However, {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, the [[correlation]] between no-nit policies and head lice [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] has not been examined.

====Inherent conflict over no-nit policy====
Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and colleagues indict required nit removal policies as an attempt to minimize the effort expended by school nurses on differentiating active and extinct infestations.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;  They further argue that this minimization comes at the expense of excessive efforts on the part of parents to remove signs of previous infestations (i.e., the nits), which have no clinical importance.&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt;

The difficulty parents face in advocating more lax attitudes towards children with nits, is that the parents have no concomitant guarantee from school administrators that those admitted children will truly be lice-free.  Indeed, admitting children with nits ''increases'' the difficulty in identifying actively infested students (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  In contrast to diseases such as [[measles]] or [[influenza]], pediculosis does not inherently prevent school attendance.  The financial incentive for schools, therefore, is to minimize expenditures on lice control and screening programs because (absent a no-nit policy) they have little effect on attendance.&lt;ref name="Sciscione2007"/&gt;  This is a formula for maximizing lice infestation within the student body, not minimizing it.  Thus, while the no-nit policy may be seen as off-loading school nurse responsibilities to parents,&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/&gt; it is perhaps more correctly viewed as imposing parental priorities on school administrators.

In the absence of such policies, school and parental priorities with respect to lice are inherently at odds.  The parents wish to minimize lice transmission. In contrast, schools wish to maximize attendance, which is largely unaffected by lice transmission.  Barring return of children until nits are removed has the effect of transforming the pediculosis "problem" for which schools have no inherent incentive to solve, into an attendance "problem" for which schools have a direct financial interest.  Unfortunately, the solution advocated by many to this attendance "problem" is to simply remove the no-nit policy,&lt;ref name="Frankowski2002"/&gt; leaving the inherent conflict between parents and school administrators unaddressed.

===The no-lice policy===
The no-lice policy bars readmission of students with crawling lice, but are indifferent to the presence of eggs and nits.  These policies are advocated by a number of government agencies, but {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, no data on the overall prevalence of no-lice policies exists.  In Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that treated children can return with nits so long as they are lice-free.&lt;ref name="Australia2005"/&gt;  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a policy that permits students to return to school with nits.&lt;ref name="CA2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[modal logic]], a term is said to be a '''non-rigid designator''' (or '''flaccid designator''') or '''connotative term''' if it does not extensionally designate (denote, refer to) the same object in all [[possible worlds]]. This is in contrast to a [[rigid designator]], which does designate the same object in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and does not designate anything else in those worlds in which that object does ''not'' exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Revised Second Edition |year=2008 |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Saul Kripke]] in his 1970 lecture series at [[Princeton University]], later published as the book ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Naming and Necessity]] |year=1980 |last=Kripke |first=Saul |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example, consider the phrase "The 43rd [[President of the United States|President]] of the United States of America": while the 43rd President of the United States is ''actually'' [[George W. Bush]], things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that the 43rd President might have been [[Al Gore]] or [[Ralph Nader]] instead. (''How remote'' these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for [[many-worlds interpretation|physics]] and [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactualism]].) "The 43rd President of the United States of America" is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.

Non-rigid designators are defined by contrast with Kripke's notion of a rigid designator, which picks out the same thing uniquely in ''every'' possible world; while there are possible worlds in which the 43rd President of the United States is Al Gore instead of George W. Bush, there are ''no'' possible worlds where ''George W. Bush'' is anyone other than the man who, in fact, he is. (There ''are'' worlds where some person other than George W. Bush is ''named'' "George W. Bush," but that's neither here nor there.)  Kripke uses this apparent asymmetry to argue (in ''Naming and Necessity'') that no [[definite description]] can be the meaning of a [[proper name]], because names must always be rigid designators, while definite descriptions can designate non-rigidly.

==Criticism==
Some philosophers, such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]], have expressed doubt as to whether non-rigid expressions ought to be called ''designators'' at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Varieties of Reference |year=1982 |last=Evans |first=Gareth |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online community|Online communities]] build off [[social movement]]s, enabling the connection of persons worldwide to develop a base and gain awareness to the cause. Online social movements gained momentum in the late 20th century and early 21st century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/social-movements-how-people-make-history/|title=Social Movements: How People Make History|last=Ideas|first=Mobilizing|date=2012-08-01|website=Mobilizing Ideas|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as new generations sought social change. With access to the internet and the fast growing [[World Wide Web]], online social movements brought awareness to issues both political and social. Online social movements have been praised and criticized; the former for its ability to raise awareness to important causes, and the latter for its ability to perpetuate problems like [[slacktivism]]. Although online activism has received criticism, it has had real impacts on social movements.

== The impact of online movements ==

The impact of online movements has been substantial since the introduction of the internet. With the ever-growing medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites as [[Facebook]] and content-sharing sites as [[YouTube]], the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T. (2011). From Slacktivism to Activism: Participatory Culture in the Age of Social Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays the importance of giving voice to priorities such as public health, political unrest, disaster relief, and climate change have introduced internet as a source for social change.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Beneficial impacts ===

Several social media movements have raised money for causes, such as the ALS Ice Bucket challenge raising $100million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html|title=The ALS Association Expresses Sincere Gratitude to Over Three Million Donors|website=ALSA.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 30 days. Even if they do not directly involve monetary funding, many online social movements raise awareness for causes such as institutionalized racism against African Americans with the [[Black Lives Matter movement]] and the inappropriate use of force by police authorities against black females, such as with the [[Say Her Name]] social movement. In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-social-movements-are-using-internet-change-politics|title=How Social Movements are Using the Internet to Change Politics {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detrimental impacts ===

Some experts believe there are potential weaknesses and long-term repercussions that can be identified with online movements. Some examples are [[Slacktivism|clicktivism]] and [[slacktivism]], where the use of social media to promote a cause include activities such as:&lt;ref&gt;Clicktivist.(2014). What is clicktivism?. Retrieved 16 May 2014 from http://www.clicktivist.org/what-is-clicktivism/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Organising protests
* Facilitating boycotts
* Online parody and satire
An example of a social movement that has received harsh criticism due to the effects that it had is the [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter movement]] with incidents of looting and arson following the grand jury's decision to not indict the police officer that fatally shot [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]] in August 2014. There was public outcry after over 100 people burglarized stores and marketplaces in Ferguson, Missouri following the release of the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/dellwood-market-looting_n_6519186.html|title=St. Louis County Police Release Footage Of Looting In Ferguson Grand Jury Aftermath|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=2015-01-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online movement was criticized heavily by the conservative news source [[TheBlaze]], saying that the online movement exacerbated feelings of injustice that ultimately led to looting and riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/no-theyre-not-protesters-theyre-terrorists/|title=No, they’re not ‘protesters.’ They’re terrorists.|date=2016-09-22|work=TheBlaze|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of online movements ==
Social movements advance their work through the media. It is easier, less costly and time consuming to link collective behaviour as real time communication can occur vastly and simultaneously via social media. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=John|title=The Media and Modernity: A Social Theory of the Media|isbn=978-0804726795|edition=0|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;Some examples of online movements include:

== The future ==

The future of online movements is hard to predict. However, there are some clear directions where they could certainly lead towards. [[Vanessa DiMauro]] believes the biggest trend concerning online communities in the near future is private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a day-to-day basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment these groups need to be much smaller and manageable. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vanessa DiMauro|DiMauro, V.]] (2011). The Future Of Online Community. Retrieved from http://www.leadernetworks.com/2011/10/future-of-online-community.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online Social Movements and Commercial Social Media Platforms ==
Since the late 2000s, an increased use of commercial social media platforms by social movements has been reported. According to Lopes, "Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard." [https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/departments/PoliticalScience/Journal_of_Political_Research__JPR_/2014_JSP_papers/Lopes_JPR.pdf]However, the adoption of these commercial platforms has concerned analysts as they highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, "Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance."[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742766507086852]For example, "in his analysis of the Purple Movement (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, [http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14714/ Coretti (2014)] demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements" (Fenton, 2016, p.184).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Misunderstanding-the-Internet-2nd-Edition/Curran-Fenton-Freedman/p/book/9781138906228|title=Misunderstanding the Internet: 2nd Edition (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietary nature of the design of platforms such as Facebook pages fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in terms of a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coretti|first=Lorenzo|date=June 2015|title=The rise and fall of collective identity in networked movements: communication protocols, Facebook, and the anti-Berlusconi protest|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=18|issue=8|pages=951–967|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1043317}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Persona 5'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||ペルソナ5|Perusona Faibu}}}} is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Atlus]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]]. ''Persona 5'' is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released in Japan in September 2016, and worldwide in April 2017, where it was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia.

''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]], and follows a player-named protagonist after his transfer to the fictional Shujin Academy after being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During the course of a school year, he and other students awaken to their Persona powers, becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts who explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires, to change malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous titles in the series, the party does battle with enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche, called Personas. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.

Preparatory work began around the same time as the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. The game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier entries included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's initial Personas were based around the theme of outlaws and rebels.

First announced in 2013, the game was delayed from its original late 2014 release date so its quality could be further improved. ''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, being nominated for and winning multiple year-end accolades, including several [[Game of the Year]] awards. It has since been considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time. The game went on to ship over two million copies worldwide by the end of 2017, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. [[Persona 5: The Animation|An anime adaptation]], a [[manga]], and a [[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight|spin-off rhythm game]] have also been produced.

''Persona 5'' is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] game where the player takes on the role of a high school student who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events — the protagonist attends school, can perform part-time jobs, and pursue leisure activities or create items for use in battle. These various activities raise character attributes, which in turn grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.&lt;ref name="RPGgameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemCharactersB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay"/&gt; When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Each relationship is symbolized by one of the [[Major Arcana]] of the Tarot card deck. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the "Baton Pass" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt; Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt;

Alongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, which are physical manifestations of suppressed psyches modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a "Confidant" links.&lt;ref name="RPGgameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilGameplayPersonas"/&gt; While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as "Third Eye",&lt;ref name="P5FamBattle"/&gt; which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an "Alertness Meter" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically over night.&lt;ref name="P5gameplayBits"/&gt; Throughout Palaces are locations known as "safe rooms". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.

As with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, which are the manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche and are used mainly for magical attacks.&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShackMasks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5FamBattle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShackMasks"/&gt; If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a "Hold Up" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating "All-Out Attack", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows the protagonist to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if the protagonist is their level or higher.&lt;ref name="RPGgameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DigiGameplay"/&gt; Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.&lt;ref name="P5gameplayBits"/&gt;

New Personas are gained from battle through a successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or "fused", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm the protagonist visits as part of his journey through the story.&lt;ref name="SilGameplayPersonas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSeriesInfo"/&gt; Within the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with "Guillotine" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. In addition, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: "Hanging" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and "Electric Chair" sacrifices one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into "Solitary Confinement", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.&lt;ref name="SilGameplayPersonas"/&gt;

Minor multiplayer elements via the [[PlayStation Network]] are incorporated into the game through the "Thieves Guild" feature. Similar to the "Vox Populi" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5gameplayBits"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}
''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, which are physical manifestations of their inner psyche.&lt;ref name="GIpersona"/&gt; ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo in April of the year "20XX" (Though the in game calender matches 2016, and [[Persona 4]] character Rise Kujikawa being mentioned as 20 years old place the game in 2016) with navigable real world locations within the city, including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]], and [[Shibuya]].&lt;ref name="P5year"/&gt; Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants, and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school the protagonist attends.&lt;ref name="GemCharactersB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamTokyo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemCharactersA"/&gt; The second major location is the "Metaverse", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with large enough desires form their own unique "Palace", which is modeled after their own distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves.&lt;ref name="FamTokyo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5persona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PMythDetail"/&gt; Palaces are populated by various types of Shadows, who take their forms after each Palace and become subservient to its leader. At the center of Palaces exists the source of the leader's desires, known as the "Treasure". The act of removing a Treasure forces the person in the real world to come to terms with themselves, publicly renouncing their crimes, sins, and vices if they were a criminal. A location that returns from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.&lt;ref name="PSeriesInfo"/&gt;

The player character is a silent protagonist in common with other ''Persona'' games: he becomes the leader of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts vigilante group, who take treasures from the Palaces of criminals and other malevolent people.&lt;ref name="GemCharactersA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; His first companion is school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto, who forms the group with the protagonist. A third founding member is Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature they aid within the Metaverse. Over the course of the game, further people join the group, including the withdrawn quarter-American Ann Takamaki; art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa; Shujin student council president Makoto Niijima; [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura; and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.&lt;ref name="GemCharactersB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemCharactersA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Also interacting with the protagonist are Goro Akechi, a high schooler and detective; Sae Nijima, a public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine, with Justine referring to him as "He Who Will Save The Souls of Humanity" .&lt;ref name="GemCharactersB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotakuLysis"/&gt;

===Plot===
After the protagonist defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, the protagonist is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. The protagonist is sent to Tokyo to stay with family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation.&lt;ref name="shujin"&gt;{{cite web |author=Taka |url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/357/1357758/ |title=『ペルソナ5』秀尽学園高校の制服が11月下旬発売。キャラクターデザイナー・副島成記さんの完全監修 |work=Dengeki Online |publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten|Kadokawa]] |language=Japanese |date= |accessdate= |9= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701091122/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/001/357/1357758/ |archivedate=July 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must "rehabilitate" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads the protagonist into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. The protagonist meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their "Treasure", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, the protagonist and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults in an attempt to reform the city.

As the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grow, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Nijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that a secret group, including a black-masked assassin, are using the Metaverse to murder their targets and are framing them for the killings. In their pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against the protagonist. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son, and has been secretly plotting to get revenge on Shido for years of neglect. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemy cognitions, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.

Despite Shido's arrest and confession after his heart has been changed, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to steal the Treasure of Mementos, the people's Palace at the Metaverse's core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their own autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merging with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, the protagonist confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals Igor to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is Yaldabaoth, the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given the protagonist and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor. The protagonist rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. The protagonist's Confidants rally the popular support of the people, severing Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing the protagonist to awaken Satanael to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse.

After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, the protagonist must turn himself into the police. While the protagonist is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his Confidants successfully help secure evidence of the protagonist's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, the protagonist's friends drive him back to his hometown.

==Development==
Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="KotakuPersonaA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGSinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaPersonaA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt; Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' title's development. Development lasted five years.&lt;ref name="PersonaBlog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4Gstory"/&gt; The game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, leaving to form a separate internal team, Studio Zero, following the game's release.&lt;ref name="P5studioA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5studioB"/&gt; When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modelling work for the ''[[Trauma Team]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt;

While the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without any extensive change to the core system.&lt;ref name="PSblogHashino"/&gt; A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' titles. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.&lt;ref name="USGp5Interview"/&gt; A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' titles and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The "Hold Up" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the title being in part a celebration of the series' history.&lt;ref name="4Gstory"/&gt; While designing the gameplay elements, the weather and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, "institutions" such as the protagonist's high school, and dungeon environments.&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt; Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.&lt;ref name="P5hashinoUI"/&gt; Lead programmer for the game was Yujiro Kosaka, who previously served the same role on ''Persona 4'' and ''Catherine''.&lt;ref name="P5credits"/&gt;

While ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.&lt;ref name="AndriaPersonaA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathBryon"/&gt; The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries so as to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt; Character modelling in general was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine tuning.&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt; The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was "wrong" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.&lt;ref name="P5magazine"/&gt; In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.&lt;ref name="CGMagInterview"/&gt; ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt;

===Story and themes===
The original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.&lt;ref name="P5credits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persona5Maniacus"/&gt; The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with "self-discovery" and "journey" being its keywords.&lt;ref name="PSblogHashino"/&gt; Originally using the frame story of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref name="4Gstory"/&gt; Following that, and seeing the way people were bonding in the face of the crisis, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being through the ever-shifting Palace.&lt;ref name="PSblogHashino"/&gt; According to Hashino, the central theme of the game is freedom and how the characters attain it.&lt;ref name="Persona5Theme"/&gt; He wanted to make the game more "thematically approachable" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that presents players with a mix of emotions that leaves its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on their own modern-day problems.&lt;ref name="Persona5Theme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilCath"/&gt;

The story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes Hashino saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.&lt;ref name="PMythDetail"/&gt; The narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.&lt;ref name="P5persona"/&gt; The three main stories the team used for inspiration were ''[[Water Margin]]'' by [[Shi Nai'an]], Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the anonymously authored Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.&lt;ref name="PMinspiration"/&gt; The setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the question the team originally asked in that regard was how a character like [[Arsène Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.&lt;ref name="GemHashino"/&gt; These themes were carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.&lt;ref name="SilGameplayPersonas"/&gt; Having a more "stereotypical" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of "masks" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries.&lt;ref name="SilP5Fam"/&gt; The game's main locations were based heavily on their real world counterparts.&lt;ref name="P5FamGameplay"/&gt;

The main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they "no longer have a place where they belong in society": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Hashino stated that while the last few titles were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would feature more of the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during their activities. The characters have been described as "juvenile academics".&lt;ref name="GemHashino"/&gt; Their activities as thieves is part of the way they break way from societal norms and express themselves. The main aim of the game was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.&lt;ref name="GemHashino"/&gt; In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.&lt;ref name="PSCsecrets"/&gt; Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both story and gameplay due to its growing prevalence in modern society.&lt;ref name="P5hashinoUI"/&gt;

The characters' initial Personas ([[Arsène Lupin|Arsène]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], and [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.&lt;ref name="GemCharactersB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemCharactersA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5persona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persona5Artbook"/&gt; The protagonist's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Arsène as the latter character better fit the game's themes.&lt;ref name="PSCsecrets"/&gt; The cast's alternate Personas (Satanael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.&lt;ref name="Persona5Maniacus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persona5Artbook"/&gt; The three main inspirations behind the protagonist's alter ego were the original Arsène Lupin, [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Ishikawa Goemon.&lt;ref name="PMinspiration"/&gt; The name of the protagonist's high school, "Shujin", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Shūjin''|囚人}}, the Japanese word for "prisoner".&lt;ref name="KotakuPersonaB"/&gt; Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].&lt;ref name="PSeriesInfo"/&gt; The use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.&lt;ref name="PSblogHashino"/&gt; The game's villains and protagonists were parallels of each other, both being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice.&lt;ref name="4Gstory"/&gt; This questioning extended to their mission as a whole, which was influenced by the way a vocal minority online could draw public attention to events and scandals in the news.&lt;ref name="USGp5Interview"/&gt;

===Art design===
[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' titles, returned as character designer.&lt;ref name= "P5magazine"/&gt; The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier titles included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt; The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt; As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to "fun" but not be well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.&lt;ref name="P5cedecUI"/&gt; According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.&lt;ref name="RPGSinterview"/&gt; Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.&lt;ref name= "P5magazine"/&gt; Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.&lt;ref name="GematsuFreedom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5cedecUI"/&gt; Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt; There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.&lt;ref name="GematsuFreedom"/&gt; Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as the protagonist's Persona Arsène were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt; The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so "aggressively animated" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.&lt;ref name="P5hashinoUI"/&gt; Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of the protagonist which would change position depending on the selected menu.&lt;ref name="P5cedecUI"/&gt;

The first character sketches were submitted in 2012.&lt;ref name="AndriaPersonaB"/&gt; Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.&lt;ref name="Persona5Theme"/&gt; Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, instead expressing their individuality through their thief costumes.&lt;ref name="Meguro/Soejima"/&gt; The protagonist's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. The protagonist needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall artstyle, and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by the protagonist voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, the protagonist was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the "phantom thief" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew the protagonist and main cast in a style similar to [[shōnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, the protagonist was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine the ''Persona 5'' protagonist as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.&lt;ref name="FamSoejima"/&gt; The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.&lt;ref name="Meguro/Soejima"/&gt;

The game's [[anime]] [[cutscene]]s were created by [[Production I.G]], and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt; Kono was directed three and a half years prior to the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].&lt;ref name="P5FamIG"/&gt; The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.&lt;ref name="GemDetails"/&gt; The scene where the protagonist first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear "wild", which again was difficult to the protagonist's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.&lt;ref name="P5FamIG"/&gt;

===Music===
The original score for the game was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].&lt;ref name="P5liners"/&gt; Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5liners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5Album"/&gt; Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.&lt;ref name="Meguro/Soejima"/&gt; Seven tracks, including the opening theme "Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There", were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.&lt;ref name="P5liners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5Album"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LynTwitter"/&gt; Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme.&lt;ref name="PSCmusic"/&gt; The lyrics for her tracks were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the lyrics for the ending song "Hoshi To Bokura To" was written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.&lt;ref name="P5liners"/&gt;

In order to express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.&lt;ref name="SilComposer"/&gt; He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.&lt;ref name="Meguro/Soejima"/&gt; Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a "[[Solmization|do-la]]" syllable: the opening used "so la re mi" on strings as a hook, which then led into the "do-la" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.&lt;ref name="FamMusicArt"/&gt;
 
The game's official soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records as a three-disc set on January 17, 2017.&lt;ref name="P5Album"/&gt; Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.&lt;ref name="P5OSToricon"/&gt; The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.&lt;ref name="P5AlbumInfo"/&gt; In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.&lt;ref name="P5Album"/&gt; The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].&lt;ref name="P5ostItunes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5’s complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=2 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off titles ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.&lt;ref name="PolyPersona"/&gt; The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.&lt;ref name="PersonaPS4"/&gt; The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.&lt;ref name="ANNreveal"/&gt; The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.&lt;ref name="SilComposer"/&gt; During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to Q3 2016.&lt;ref name="GIdelay"/&gt; Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary in order to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.&lt;ref name="PersonaDelay"/&gt;

In April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special [[livestream]] was announced titled ''Take Tokyo Tower'', which would coincide with the countdown date. During the Take Tokyo Tower livestream on that day, the release date for the game was revealed in a trailer shown during the livestream. The game was released in Japan on September 15, 2016.&lt;ref name="IGNtake"/&gt; Along with the standard edition, a ''20th Anniversary Edition'' was released, which features all [[downloadable content]] (DLC) based on ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', a five-CD [[best-of]] album set featuring music from all six main games in the series, and the official artbook for the game by Soejima.&lt;ref name="GemRelease"/&gt; In honor of the game's Japanese release, the series-focused variety show ''Persona Stalker Club'' featured a new programming block titled ''Persona Stalker Club V''.&lt;ref name="PSCchange"/&gt; In promotion of the game in Japan, Atlus partnered with [[AKG Acoustics]] to release a limited edition wireless [[headphone]] based on the one Futaba wears in-game.&lt;ref name="AKG"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sato|title=Persona 5 Is Getting Futaba Sakura Collaboration Headphones From AKG|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/07/19/persona-5-getting-futaba-sakura-collaboration-headphones-akg/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|date=July 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522231221/http://www.siliconera.com/2016/07/19/persona-5-getting-futaba-sakura-collaboration-headphones-akg/|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headphones came with box art designed by Soejima, as well as a music CD featuring two remixed tracks from the game by Meguro and Kozuka.&lt;ref name="AKG"/&gt; Certain character apparel from the game were also made and released in Japan, such as jackets and tote bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sato|title=Persona 5 Is Getting Real-Life Ann’s Hoodie And Futaba’s Jacket, Supervised By Shigenori Soejima|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/09/28/persona-5-getting-real-life-anns-hoodie-futabas-jacket-supervised-shigenori-soejima/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|date=September 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103134832/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/09/28/persona-5-getting-real-life-anns-hoodie-futabas-jacket-supervised-shigenori-soejima/|archivedate=January 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Alistair|title=Persona 5 Tote Bags Were Probably Something You Did See Coming|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/persona-5-tote-bags-probably-something-see-coming/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=January 3, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103134801/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/28/persona-5-tote-bags-probably-something-see-coming/|archivedate=January 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its release, character skins and additional Personas were released as paid [[downloadable content]] (DLC). The costumes included those incorporated into the ''20th Anniversary Edition'' based on ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', in addition to new costumes based on the characters of ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'', the ''Persona 2'' duology (''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin|Innocent Sin]]'' and ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment|Eternal Punishment]]''), ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'', ''Catherine'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei IV]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army]]'', ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'', and ''Dancing All Night''.&lt;ref name="P5blogDLC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5dlc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5dlcWest"/&gt; The costumes were accompanied by arranged battle music from each costume set's respective game, which replaces the default battle theme based on what costume the protagonists wears. The Personas were reskinned and original versions of key Personas from ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''. In addition, PlayStation themes and avatar sets were released based on the central characters of ''Persona 5''.&lt;ref name="P5dlc"/&gt; An additional difficulty setting known as "Merciless" was also released as free DLC.&lt;ref name="P5dlc2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wan|first1=Zhiqing|title=Persona 5: How to Unlock Merciless Difficulty|url=http://twinfinite.net/2017/04/persona-5-unlock-merciless-difficulty-how/|website=Twinfinite|accessdate=December 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705015638/http://twinfinite.net/2017/04/persona-5-unlock-merciless-difficulty-how/|archivedate=July 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-order bonuses and its initial North American release date was announced a week prior to [[E3 2016]].&lt;ref name="P5NA"/&gt; As with the Japanese release, the North American version was delayed so it would keep with other ''Persona'' games.&lt;ref name="P5psBlog"/&gt; In Europe and Australia, the game was published by [[Deep Silver]].&lt;ref name="P5euPub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5auPub"/&gt; Initially planned for a Western release on February 14, 2017,&lt;ref name="P5NA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p5euDate"/&gt; the game was pushed back two months to April 4; the stated reason was that Atlus wanted the game to be at its highest possible quality.&lt;ref name="P5WestDelay"/&gt; As with previous ''Persona'' games, the English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]] and led by Yu Namba. According to Namba, the team began with a "blank slate" when choosing the English voice cast, as it was a new setting to earlier ''Persona'' titles.&lt;ref name="P5local"/&gt; Localizing ''Persona 5'' was described by Namba as a massive project with the largest staff yet dedicated to the series. Namba, as project lead, made the final call on issues brought up by the team during the localization process.&lt;ref name="P5PSblogLocal"/&gt; The localized script was estimated as being 50% bigger than that of ''Persona 4 Golden''.&lt;ref name="P5EngScript"/&gt; The game's title also dropped the use of the "''Shin Megami Tensei''" moniker in English regions, which was used for ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''.&lt;ref name="P5WestDelay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PersonaLocal"/&gt; While the English voice track was included on the game disc, the Japanese voices were made available as free DLC.&lt;ref name="P5WestDelay"/&gt;

===Sales===
The game received a boost to pre-order sales following the delayed release of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', which was originally scheduled for the same month as ''Persona 5''.&lt;ref name="P5salesPre"/&gt; Sales went up on [[Amazon.com|Amazon Japan]] by 450%, bringing the game to second place in their best-seller charts behind ''[[Tales of Berseria]]''.&lt;ref name="P5salesPre"/&gt; In its first week of release, the PS4 version reached first place with sales of 264,793 units, while the PS3 version reached second place with 72,974, resulting in total sales of 337,767 units. This made ''Persona 5'' the fastest-selling title in the series' history, surpassing ''Revelations: Persona'', and together with ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 2017]]'' pushed sales of the PS4 up significantly over the previous week.&lt;ref name="P5salesW1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5salesW2"/&gt; It was later reported by Hashino that combined physical shipments and digital sales had reached over 550,000 units.{{when|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref name="P5blogDLC"/&gt; Within three weeks of its launch in Japan, the game became Atlus' best-selling title in the country.&lt;ref name="P5salesW3"/&gt;

"'''Pheng Sat Lāo'''" ({{Lang-lo|ເພງຊາດລາວ}}, {{Literal translation|"Hymn of the Lao People"}}) is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]].  Dr. Thongdy Sounthonevichit composed the music and wrote the lyrics in 1941.  This was adopted as the [[national anthem]] of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] in 1945.  The original lyrics were revised after the [[Pathet Lao]] won the [[Laotian Civil War]] and the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established in 1975, with the new lyrics written by [[Sisana Sisane]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

==History==
In 1893, Laos became a [[History of Laos to 1945#French Laos|protectorate]] of [[France]] within [[French colonial empire|its colonial empire]].  The French claimed their takeover was intended to protect Laos from its hostile neighbours like [[Thailand|Siam]], which was forced to cede Laos to the colonial power.  Consequently, nationalistic sentiment did not develop as quickly as it did in Vietnam.  However, the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] saw the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]].  The new right-wing government in Siam saw this as an opportunity to reconquer Laos.  To counteract this, the French actively promoted nationalism among the [[Lao people]].&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Laos|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/laos/history|date=|accessdate=May 8, 2013|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a direct result of this new liberalization, many patriotic songs were composed during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8hy1pzrc0sC&amp;pg=PA137|title=Youth Mobilization in Vichy Indochina and Its Legacies: 1940 to 1970|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2005|last=Raffin|first=Anne|pages=137–38|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Pheng Xat Lao" was one of them, having been composed by Dr. [[Thongdy Sounthonevichit]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkuSVaUuiVgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=pheng+xat+lao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VFmDUaGzLKOXigeMg4CoDw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=pheng%20xat%20lao&amp;f=false|title=Laos in Pictures|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2007|last=Doedan|first=Matt|pages=69|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song was chosen as the national anthem of Laos in 1945,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Laos|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|date=|accessdate=May 9, 2013|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the king was forced by the Japanese to declare Laos' independence from France.  This newfound freedom was short-lived as France soon regained control of [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;  Two years later, the French granted Laos limited autonomy within the [[French Union]] and "Pheng Xat Lao" once again became the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-first=Stanley I.|editor-last=Kutler|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War|title=Laos|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=WHIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CBT2336200278&amp;mode=view|accessdate=May 9, 2013|year=1996|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Pathet Lao]] emerged victorious in the [[Laotian Civil War]] in 1975, the Communist government decided to change the lyrics to the anthem in order to reflect the ideology of the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a72gff91-u0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=laos+national+anthem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PWmDUauUEKa5iQfqi4CgCw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=laos%20national%20anthem&amp;f=false|title=Spirits of the place: Buddhism and Lao religious culture|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|last=Holt|first=John Clifford|pages=133|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the anthem became all-encompassing in mentioning all [[List of ethnic groups in Laos|ethnic groups in Laos]], instead of focussing solely on the [[Lao people|Lao race]] and [[Buddhism]].  However, the music from the former anthem was retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBquBoKAytYC&amp;pg=PA1780&amp;dq=laos+national+anthem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TmaDUaz2GcLYigey-oGACA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=laos%20national%20anthem&amp;f=false|title=Revolution, Reform and Regionalism in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam|publisher=Routledge|date=January 11, 2013|last=St. John|first=Ronald Bruce|pages=|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love the King, the Ancestors, the Old Citizens.&lt;br&gt;
Join root join religion ever since the ancestors,&lt;br&gt;
protect the soil the boundary.&lt;br&gt;
Do not allow any nation to conquer, influence, threaten, take, occupy any thing &lt;br&gt;
Anyone steps up enters to conquer, influence, threaten, occupy, fight to the last breath, stand strong against enemies &lt;br&gt;

Once our Laotian race in Asia highly honored stood&lt;br&gt;
And at that time the folk of Laos were united in love&lt;br&gt;
Today they love their race and rally round their chiefs&lt;br&gt;
They guard the land and the religion of their ancestors&lt;br&gt;
They will resist each foe who may oppress them or invade&lt;br&gt;
And such invaders will be met with battle unto death&lt;br&gt;
They'll restore the fame of Laos and through ills united stand.&lt;br&gt;

The '''Pomoan''', or '''Pomo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|m|oʊ}},&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; languages are a small family of seven languages indigenous to northern [[California]] that spoken by the [[Pomo people]], who formerly occupied the valley of the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] and the [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]] basin. Four languages are extinct, and all surviving languages but [[Kashaya language|Kashaya]] have fewer than ten speakers.

==Geographical distribution==

[[John Wesley Powell]], who was the first to define the extent of the family, noted that its boundaries were the Pacific Ocean to the west, [[Wintuan languages|Wintuan]] territory in the Sacramento Valley to the east, the head of the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] to the north, and [[Bodega Head]] and present-day [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] to the south (Powell 1891:87-88). Only [[Northeastern Pomo language|Northeastern Pomo]] was not contiguous with the other Pomoan languages, being separated by an intervening region of [[Wintuan languages|Wintuan]] speakers.

==Internal relationships of languages==

[[File:Pomoan languages map.svg|300px|thumb|The seven Pomoan languages with an indication of their pre-contact distribution within California. Of the current speakers of these languages, many live within the same areas.|alt=]]

Pomoan is a family of seven languages. Their relationship to one another was first formally recognized by [[John Wesley Powell]], who proposed that they be called the "Kulanapan Family" (Powell 1891). Like many of Powell's obscure nomenclatural proposals, particularly for California languages, "Kulanapan" was ignored. In its place, [[Pomo]],&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the term "Pomo" is complex. It seems to be a combination of the Northern Pomo words '''{{IPA|[pʰoːmoː]}}''', "at red earth hole" and '''{{IPA|[pʰoʔmaʔ]}}''' (containing {{IPA|[pʰo-]}}, "reside, live in a group"), together suggesting "those who live at red earth hole" (Campbell 1997:397, citing McLendon &amp; Oswalt 1978:277)&lt;/ref&gt; the term used by Indians and Whites alike for [[Northern Pomo]] was arbitrarily extended to include the rest of the family. It was thus as "Pomo" that all seven languages were first systematically identified by [[Samuel Barrett]] (1908). To avoid complications, Barrett named each of the Pomoan languages according to its geographic position ("Northern Pomo," "Southeastern Pomo," etc.). This naming convention quickly gained wide acceptance and is still in general use, except for the substitution of "Kashaya" for Barrett's "Southwestern Pomo". Regrettably, however, Barrett's geographical language names often lead those unfamiliar with the Pomoan languages to the misconception that they are dialects of a single "Pomo" language.

Various genetic subgroupings of the family have been proposed, although the general outlines have remained fairly consistent. The current consensus view (cf. Mithun 1999) favors the tree presented in Oswalt (1964), shown below.

* [[Southeastern Pomo language|Southeastern Pomo]]
* [[Eastern Pomo language|Eastern Pomo]] †
* [[Northeastern Pomo language|Northeastern Pomo]] †
* Western
** [[Northern Pomo language|Northern Pomo]] †
** Southern
*** [[Central Pomo language|Central Pomo]] †
*** [[Southern Pomo language|Southern Pomo]]
*** [[Kashaya language|Kashaya]] (Southwestern Pomo)

[[File:Pomoan family tree.svg|400px|right|thumb|The current consensus view of the internal relationships of the Pomoan family, based on Oswalt (1964).]]

::: 

Essentially identical versions of this classifications are presented in Oswalt and McLendon's "Introduction" to the Pomo chapters in Heizer, ed. (1978) and in Campbell (1997).  The most important dissenter was [[Abraham M. Halpern]], one of the few linguists since Barrett's time to collect comparative data on all of the Pomoan languages. Halpern's classification differed from Oswalt's mainly in the placement of [[Northeastern Pomo language|Northeastern Pomo]]. Instead of considering it an independent branch of the family, Halpern grouped it with the languages of Oswalt's "Western" branch, suggesting the possibility that Northeastern Pomo represents a recent migration of a [[Northern Pomo]] subgroup (Halpern 1964; Golla 2011:106-7).

[[Image:Mihrab, Great Mosque of Kairouan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A specimen of Islamic sacred art: in the '''[[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]]''' also called the Mosque of Uqba (in [[Tunisia]]), the upper part of the mihrab (prayer niche) is decorated with 9th-century lusterware tiles and painted intertwined vegetal motifs.]]
'''Religious art''' or '''sacred art''' is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual. Sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist's religious tradition.

==Christian art==
{{main|Christian Art|Art in Roman Catholicism|Byzantine art}}
{{see also|Religious image#Christianity|Madonna (art)|Icon|Images of Jesus}}

Christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of [[Christianity]], though other definitions are possible.It is to make imagery of the different beliefs in the world and what it looks like.Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity. Most Christian art is allusive, or built around [[theme (literary)|theme]]s familiar to the intended observer. One of the most common Christian themes is that of the Virgin Mary holding the [[Child Jesus|infant Jesus]]. Another is that of [[Christ]] on the [[Cross]]. For the benefit of the illiterate, an elaborate [[iconographic]] system developed to conclusively identify scenes. For example, [[Saint Agnes]] depicted with a lamb, [[Saint Peter]] with keys, [[Saint Patrick]] with a shamrock. Each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art.

===History===
[[Image:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|left|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest surviving Christian paintings are from the site at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], dated to around the year 70, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

[[Image:Sandro Botticelli 061.jpg|110 px|thumb|right|An example of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], commissioned by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Renaissance]].]]

The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] painted the [[Sistine Chapel]] and carved the famous ''[[Pietà]]'', [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] created the massive columns in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] painted the ''[[Last Supper]]''. The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, secular artists occasionally treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]). Only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]). However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a social interpretation of Christianity, [[Fritz von Uhde]] also revived the interest in sacred art, though the depiction of Jesus in ordinary places in life.

Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

The last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in Christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith, Christ, God, the Church, the Bible and other classic Christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world. Artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]], Gary P. Bergel, Carlos Cazares, Bruce Herman, Deborah Sokolove, and [[John August Swanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | title=Contemporary Religious Art | publisher=Mozaico | date=21 May 2015 | accessdate=2 June 2015 | author=Buenconsejo, Clara | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929011640/http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | archivedate=29 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist art==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
{{main|Buddhist art}}
Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of [[Islam]] alongside [[Hinduism]].

===Tibetan Buddhist art===
Most Tibetan Buddhist artforms are related to the practice of [[Vajrayana]] or Buddhist tantra.
[[Tibetan art]] includes [[thangka]]s and [[mandala]]s, often including depictions of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s. Creation of Buddhist art is usually done as a [[meditation]] as well as creating an object as aid to meditation. An example of this is the creation of a [[sand mandala]] by monks; before and after the construction prayers are recited, and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings (palace) of a Buddha on which is meditated to train the mind. The work is rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects, such as the [[vajra]] and the [[phurba]].

===Indian Buddhist art===
Two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of Buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century AD. One is Ajanta, a site in India long forgotten until discovered in 1817. The other is Dunhuang, one of the great oasis staging posts on the Silk Road...The paintings range from calm devotional images of the Buddha to lively and crowded scenes, often featuring the seductively full-breasted and narrow-waisted women more familiar in Indian sculpture than in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?gtrack=pthc&amp;ParagraphID=bdc#bdc |title=History Of Buddhism |publisher=Historyworld.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major art included mosques and a madonna (art of Mary and possibly her child)

==Islamic  art==
{{main|Islamic art}}
A prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art, as well as the naturally decorative nature of Arabic script, led to the use of calligraphic decorations, which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns and vegetal forms ([[arabesque]]s) that expressed ideals of order and nature. These were used on religious architecture, carpets, and handwritten documents.&lt;ref name="huntfor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218232141/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-date=2004-02-18 |dead-url=yes |title=Islamic Art - Islamic Art of Calligraphy and Arabesque |accessdate=2014-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view. It focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form.

While there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through Islamic history, this is a distinctly modern [[Sunni]] view. [[Persian miniature]]s, along with medieval [[depictions of Muhammad]] and [[angels in Islam]], stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern Sunni tradition. Also, [[Shi'a]] Muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures, including the Prophet's as long as the depiction is respectful.

===Figure representation===
The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the [[Hadith]] (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms," or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. [[Iconoclasm]] was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As with other forms of Islamic ornamentation, artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms, giving rise to a great variety of figural-based designs.

===Arabesque===
{{main|Arabesque}}

{{empty section|date=October 2018}}

===Calligraphy===
{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphy is a highly regarded element of Islamic art. The [[Qur'an]] was transmitted in Arabic, and inherent within the Arabic script is the potential for ornamental forms. The employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying [[talisman]]ic component. While most works of art had legible inscriptions, not all Muslims would have been able to read them. One should always keep in mind, however, that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text, albeit in a decorative form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cali/hd_cali.htm |title=Calligraphy in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century AD, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of Islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art. The main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles, called generally the [[Kufic]], and the soft cursive styles, which include [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]], [[Thuluth]], [[Nastaliq]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|many others]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |title=Art of Arabic Calligraphy |publisher=Sakkal |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
{{main|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric patterns make up one of the three nonfigural types of decoration in Islamic art. Whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation, geometric patterns are popularly associated with Islamic art, largely due to their aniconic quality. These abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental Islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], Pincus-Witten earned his undergraduate degree at [[The Cooper Union]], in New York City in 1956. He wrote his master's degree (1962) and Ph.D. (1968) both at the [[University of Chicago]]. His dissertation, on [[Joséphin Péladan]] and the [[Salon de la Rose + Croix]] was written under Joshua Taylor and [[John Rewald]].

Pincus-Witten joined the [[City University of New York]] in 1964. In 1970 he was promoted to professor at [[CUNY]]. Pincus-Witten retired from CUNY in 1990.

In 1966 he began writing criticism for [[Artforum]] magazine as its senior editor. He became associate editor of Artforum in 1976.

An initial book on [[minimalism]] and the era following it was issued in 1977. His collected [[art criticism]] was published as Eye to Eye: Twenty Years of Art Criticism, in 1984. His treatise on [[post-modern]] art, [[Postminimalism]] into Maximalism: American Art 1966-1986, appeared in 1987. Postminimalism is an art term coined (as "post-minimalism") by Pincus-Witten in 1971&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 569. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used in various artistic fields for work which is influenced by, or attempts to develop and go beyond, the aesthetic of [[minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

Pincus-Witten curated art shows for the [[Gagosian Gallery]] (East) in New York City, until 1996. That same year he joined the staff of C&amp;M Arts (Mnuchin Fine Arts), New York City as Director of Exhibitions and then retired after eleven years.

On July 3, 2013, Pincus-Witten and Leon Hecht were married in NYC.

'''Ruyi''' ({{zh|c=如意|l=as desired; as [you] wish}}) is a curved decorative object that serves as a ceremonial [[sceptre]] in [[Chinese Buddhism]] or a [[amulet|talisman]] symbolizing power and good fortune in [[Chinese folklore]]. A traditional ''ruyi'' has a long S-shaped handle and a head fashioned like a fist, cloud, or [[lingzhi mushroom]]. ''Ruyi'' are constructed from diverse materials. For example, the [[Palace Museum]] in [[Beijing]] has nearly 3000 ''ruyi'' that are variously made from valuable materials like gold, silver, iron, bamboo, wood, ivory, coral, rhinoceros horn, lacquer, crystal, jade, and precious gems. The "ruyi" image frequently appears as a motif in Asian art.

==Word==
The Chinese term ''ruyi'' is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''ru'' [[Wikt:如|如]] "as; like; such as; as if; for example; supposing; be like; be similar; accord with" and ''yi'' [[Wikt:意|意]] "wish; will; desire; intention; suggestion; thought; idea; meaning; imagination". 

[[Standard Chinese]] uses ''ruyi'' either as a [[stative verb]] meaning "as desired; as one wishes, as one likes; according to one's wishes; following your heart's desires", or as an [[adjective]] meaning "satisfied, pleased, happy, comfortable". The word is combined with ''suanpan'' 算盤 "[[abacus]]" in the expression ''ruyi suanpan'' "wishful thinking; smug calculations". 

Chinese ''ruyi'' was borrowed as a Buddhist [[loanword]] into [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], with corresponding [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] (see Infobox above).

==History==
[[File:HB-Ruyi.JPG|thumb|left|Qing Dynasty wood and jade three-inlay ''ruyi'']]

[[Chinese classic texts]] from the Former [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 24 AD) have the earliest usages of the word ''ruyi''. For example, the ''[[Shiji]]'' history uses it both literally for "as desired" and for the given name of [[Liu Ruyi]] 劉如意 (d. 195 BC), who was the son of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] and [[Concubine Qi]]. The ''[[Hanshu]]'' biography of the ''[[fangshi]]'' astrologer and mathematician [[Jing Fang]] (78–37 BCE) quotes him using ''ruyi'' meaning "as you wish" in an audience with [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (tr. Edkins 1904: 238), "I fear that though your Majesty acts in this way you will still not obtain what accords with your wish."
[[File:Chinese Ruyi Scepter.png|thumb|Chinese ruyi scepter crafted of hardwood with foliate silver inlay and five white nephrite jade insets. Qing Dynasty, 19th Century]]
The anthropologist [[Berthold Laufer]] (1912:336) said that the Chinese accounts of the ''ruyi'' are "more unsatisfactory" than for any other object in [[Chinese culture]]. Scholars have proposed two basic theories for the origin of the ''ruyi'', writes Kieschnick (2003:141). The former is that ''ruyi'' originated from Sanskrit ''anuruddha'' "a ceremonial scepter" used by Buddhist monks in India, who later brought it to China, transliterated as ''analu'' 阿那律 or translated as ''ruyi''. The latter theory is that ''ruyi'' originated as a [[backscratcher]] in early China, and was amalgamated with the Buddhist symbol of authority. Davidson (1950:239) suggests "as desired" signifies a backscratcher owing to "its apparent ability to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the human body".

During the Later Han dynasty (25–220 AD) and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420 AD), literati and nobles often held ''ruyi'' during conversations and other social occasions. It was called a ''tanbing'' 談柄 "conversation baton" (cf. the Native American [[talking stick]]) and was used much like ''zhuwei'' 麈尾 "deer tail; fly-whisk", which practitioners of the ''[[qingtan]]'' 清談 "pure conversation" movement popularized during the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220–589 AD). Besides the ''ruyi'', other objects used as a ''tanbing'' "discussion stick" included the ''tanshan'' 談扇 "discussion fan" and ''tanzhu'' 談麈 made from the tail of a [[Père David's deer]]. Davidson (1950:247) says "there seems no doubt that the primary and original function of the ''ju-i'' was that of a scepter qualifying the holder to "take the floor." Its origin was probably in India where the branch of a tree seems to have served a similar function. Any other purposes the ''ju-i'' served, such as a note tablet, honorific insignia, good luck gift, or even backscratcher, were merely later accruals."

The ca. 554 AD ''[[Weishu]]'' history records a story that when [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei]] (r. 471–499 AD) wanted to retire from the throne, he tested his sons by letting them choose among a number objects, and the one who selected a bone ''ruyi'' (symbolizing political rule) became [[Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei]] (r. 500–515). Kieschnick (2003:144) concludes "that by the end of the sixth century, not only was the ''ruyi'' common at court, but it had even begun to take on emblematic significance as the mark of a ruler." Although the ''ruyi'' symbolized imperial political power, it differed from the Western royal scepter because Chinese officials and monks commonly used it.

In Buddhist usage, holding a ''ruyi'' when teaching gave the holder the right to talk. The biography of [[Tiantai]] Buddhist patriarch [[Zhiyi]] (538-597) says that when he was teaching ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]]'' in place of his teacher [[Huisi]] 慧思 (515–577), Huisi would sit holding a ''ruyi'' in his hand (Davidson 1950:244).

The (c. 886) ''Duyang zabian'' 杜陽雜編, which is a collection of [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) stories, records that [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]] presented an ivory ''ruyi'' to his tutor Li Xun 李訓 (d. 835) and said (tr. Kieschnick 2003:145), "The ''ruyi'' may serve you as a lecture baton (''tanbing'')." The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' biography of Li Xun (tr. Davidson 1950:247) says this occurred on a hot summer day and the emperor's ''ruyi'' present was made from "heat-repelling [[Rhinoceros#Horn trade and use|rhinoceros horn]]", which is believed to be cooling in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]. ''Ruyi'' were both emblems of power and tools of discourse. 

[[Herbert Giles]] (1912:185) quoted the [[Song dynasty]] archaeologist Zhao Xigu 趙希鵠 (d. 1240) that the ''ruyi'' "was originally made of iron, and was used 'for pointing the way' and also 'for guarding against the unexpected,' i.e. for self-defence. It was, in fact, a kind of blunt sword, and traces of basket-work are still to be found inside what must have been the sword-guard." 

In the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), ''ruyi'' became popular as ornaments or gifts symbolizing blessings and good luck. The ca. 1627 AD ''Zhangwuzhi'' 長物志 "Treatise on Superfluous Things", by Ming painter [[Wen Zhenheng]], discussed ''ruyi'' aesthetics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''ruyi'' was used in ancient times to give directions or to protect oneself from the unexpected. It was for this reason that it was made or iron, and not on the basis of strictly aesthetic considerations. If you can obtain an old iron ''ruyi'' inlaid with gold and silver that sparkle now and then, and if it has an ancient dull color, this is the best. As for ''ruyi'' made of natural branches or from bamboo and so on, these are all worthless. (tr. Kieschnick 2003:151) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912 AD), ''ruyi'' scepters became luxuriant symbols of political power that were regularly used in imperial ceremonies, and were highly valued as gifts to and from the [[Emperor of China]]. Since 3 and 9 are considered lucky [[numbers in Chinese culture]], Qing craftsmen elaborated the traditional handle and head type ''ruyi'' into two-headed ''sanjiang-ruyi'' 三鑲如意 "3-inlay ''ruyi''" with precious stones set in both heads and middle of the handle and ''jiujiu-ruyi'' 九九如意 "9-9 ''ruyi''" presentational sets of nine. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] presented a ''ruyi'' to the British ambassador [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|George Macartney]] in 1793, and in his description (quoted by Kieschnick 2003:139-140), "It is a whitish, agate-looking stone, about a foot and a half long, curiously carved, and highly prized by the Chinese, but to me it does not appear in itself to be of any great value."

During the historical evolution of Chinese ''ruyi'' "as desired", they have been used as backscratchers, ritual objects in Buddhism and later [[Daoism]], pointers for public speakers, prized icons of political power and wealth, and auspicious gifts expressing best wishes.

In [[Chinese art]], ''ruyi'' scepters often appear as attributes of Buddhist [[saint]]s and Daoist [[xian (Taoism)|''xian'']]. The god of prosperity [[Cai Shen]] 財神 is often depicted holding a ruyi. Stylized repetitions of the shape are incorporated as a motif in the depiction of heavenly clouds. ''Ruyi'' symbolize achieving prosperity in ''[[fengshui]]'' practice. The ''ruyi'' shape appears as a motif in decorative knots, [[Oriental rug]] patterns, folk artifacts, and even modern corporate logos. Stylized ''ruyi'' often function as a kind of [[ante-fixae]] or [[palmette]] in traditional and modern [[Chinese architecture|architecture]].

Two types of ''ruyi'' are seen in Chinese [[Buddhist art]]. The early ''ruyi'' was common in Buddhist sculpture and painting from the late [[Six dynasties]] (220–589) through the Tang dynasty (618–906). It was a slender stick, varying from about 15 to 24 inches, which widened and curved slightly at one end. Not only were these utensils frequently portrayed by artists and sculptors, but the [[Shōsōin]] treasure house of [[Tōdai-ji]] temple, in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], has preserved several 8th-century ''ruyi'' (Davidson 1950:242). The modern ''ruyi'', which first appeared in the art of the Song dynasty (960–1279) has two forms. The first type shows minor elaborations upon the basic slender-handled structure of the early ''ruyi'', but the slight curve at the top was exaggerated into a decorative ornament, a medallion-like form, frequently a stylized fungus. The second type of contemporary ''ruyi'' shows a radical change, in addition to the decorated end, two other smaller inlaid plaques or medallions, with one at the middle of the handle and the other at the base. Variations occur where the center medallion becomes a rectangle, or the second is omitted (Davidson 1950:242-243).

In early Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]] is usually depicted holding a sword (representing wisdom that cuts through ignorance), except in representations of his ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]'' discussion with the layman [[Vimalakirti]], when Manjusri holds a ''ruyi'' scepter (Davidson 1950:240). This representation expanded in the 10th century, concurrent with the change in ''ruyi'' forms, and holding a ''ruyi'' became an attribute of other divinities as well as [[Chinese emperors]] (Davidson 1950:244).

Berthold Laufer (1912: 339) believed the first Chinese representation of a ''ruyi'' was in an 8th-century Mañjuśrī painting by [[Wu Daozi]], which showed it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. Laufer noted the artistic similarly between the curved handle of a ''ruyi'' and the long stem of a lotus blossom, which was frequently depicted in the hands of Bodhisattvas, e.g., the [[Longmen Grottoes]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not mean to say that the Buddhist emblem called ''Ju-i'' has developed from the lotus, though I think that the alternation of both is suggestive. But it is not necessary at all to assume that the Chinese ''Ju-i'' in general is of Buddhist origin... It may very well be that the implement is Chinese in origin and even prebuddhistic, and that, as in so many other things, a kind of compromise took place, resulting in the assimilation and amalgamation of two ideas and two forms. (1912:339) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Admitting that the "original significance of this implement has been lost long ago", Laufer hypothesized that the ''ruyi'' may have developed from a [[Chinese jade#Six Ritual and Six Ceremonial Jades|ritual jade]] that began as a [[Zhou dynasty]] "symbol of light, generative power and fertility".

Two of the emperors in the famous ''Thirteen Emperors Scroll'' by [[Yan Liben]] (d. 673) are holding ''ruyi'' (Davidson 1950:247), [[Emperor Wen of Chen]] (r. 559–566) and [[Emperor Xuan of Chen]] (r. 569–582).

Japanese painters variously pictured Manjusri holding a ''ruyi'' in either hand (Laufer 1912:338).  [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506) showed one in his left hand and nothing in his right. Kichizan Minchō 吉山明兆 (1352–1431) and [[Kanō Sanraku]] (1559–1635) showed the Bodhisattva with a ''ruyi'' in his right and a book-roll in his left. A 12th-century Manjusri painting attributed to the [[Kose Kanaoka|Kose School]] a sword in his right and a sacred lotus-flower in his left hand.

==Word usage in East Asian Buddhism==
With the introduction of [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism to China]], scholars used Chinese ''ruyi'' {{lang|zh|如意}} to translate various [[Sanskrit]] terms, which [[Buddhism in Japan]] subsequently borrowed as ''nyoi''. The primary terms and Chinese/Japanese translations are:
*''anuruddha'' "a ceremonial mace; a priest's staff", ''ruyi''/''nyoi'' 如意
*''[[kalpavriksha]]'' "wish fulfilling tree; the manifestation of what one wishes", ''ruyishu''/''nyoiju'' 如意樹
*''[[cintamani]]'' "wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires", ''ruyizhu''/''nyoiju'' 如意珠 or ''ruyibaozhu''/''nyoi-hōshu'' 如意宝珠
First, the ''anuruddha''/''ruyi''/''nyoi'' scepter is defined in the ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;An instrument held, especially by the abbot of a temple, during ceremonies and sermons shaped as a short staff curled in an S-shape and made out of wood, or more precious materials, such as ivory. One end is broader than the other, and often has a metal plate with a decorative cloud-shaped stamp. It is said to originally have been a back-scratcher that was carried by Buddhist monks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some schools of [[Zen]] like [[Sanbo Kyodan]], the ceremonial scepter of a ''[[rōshi]]'' is called ''kotsu'' {{nihongo|bone, relic|骨|kotsu}} instead of ''nyoi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The scepter has a slight S-shaped curve, like a human spinal column. The rōshi uses the ''kotsu'', for example, to emphasize a point in a ''teishō'', to lean on when sitting, or also occasionally to strike a student. (Diener, Erhard, and Fischer-Schreiber 1991:119) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the divine ''kalpavriksha''/''ruyishu''/''nyoiju'' is a [[wishing tree]] in [[Hindu mythology]]. The Buddhist translator [[Samuel Beal]] (1884:105) explained it denotes "power to produce whatever was wished". The Chinese Buddhist monk Yi Jing 義凈, who travelled in India from 673 to 695, translated ''kalpavriksha'' as ''ruyishu'' in describing the [[Uposatha]] day celebration (tr. [[Takakusu Junjiro|Takakusu]] 1896:49), "Then gifts are distributed. Sometimes the host provides a 'wishing tree' (Kalpa-vriksha), and gives it to the priests". Since it is unlikely that a real tree could have been given, Davidson (1950:247) notes that "some sort of symbolic tree was deemed appropriate as a gift to a Buddhist priest." 

Third, the legendary ''cintamani'' "wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires" is translated either with ''zhu''/''shu'' 珠 "pearl; bead" or ''baozhu''/''hōju'' 寶珠 "precious pearl; jewel". This famous term is frequently used in literature and art. The ''Digital Dictionary of Buddhism'' explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A ''maṇi''-jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. ''maṇi'', ''cintā-maṇi'', ''cintāmaṇi-ratna''). According to one's desires, treasures, clothing and food can be manifested, while sickness and suffering can be removed, water can be purified, etc. It is a metaphor for the teachings and virtues of the Buddha. … Said to be obtained from the dragon-king of the sea, or the head of the great fish, Makara, or the relics of a Buddha.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erik Zürcher (1997:407) suggests that association between ''ruyi'' and the legendary ''ruyibao'' "wish-fulfilling gem" explains the dichotomy between it being both a mundane backscratcher and a Buddhist symbol.

The ca. 1150 AD ''Fusō ryakki'' 扶桑略記 "Brief History of [[Fusang]]" by Kōen 皇圓, the teacher of [[Hōnen]], recounts a Japanese ''nyoi-hōju'' legend involving the monk Foshi {{lang|zh|佛誓}} "Buddha's Vow" (Japanese ''Bussei'').
&lt;blockquote&gt;There lived in Northern India a Buddhist abbot, "Buddha's vow" by name, who for the sake of mankind sought the "Precious pearl which grants all desires". He went on board a ship and, when in the midst of the sea, by Buddha's power called up the Dragon-king. After having bound him by means of mystic formulae (tantras), he required the pearl from him, whereupon the dragon, unable to escape, took the pearl from his head and prepared to hand it over to the priest. The latter stretched out his left hand, at the same time making the "sword-sign"', a mudrā (mystic finger-twisting), with his right hand. The Dragon-king, however, said: "In former times, when the Dragon-king Sāgara's daughter gave a precious pearl to Cākyamuni, the latter received it with folded hands; why should a pupil of the Buddha accept it with one hand?" Then the priest folded his hands, giving up the mudrā, and was about to take the pearl, when the Dragon-king, no longer suppressed by the mystic sign, freed himself from his bands and ascended to the sky, leaving the abbot behind with empty hands, and destroying his boat. The only man who was saved was the priest himself. Afterwards the same abbot met Bodhidharma, the patriarch, who came across the sea from Southern India (in 526), and together they went to Japan. (tr. de Visser 1913:189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two additional [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] Buddhist translations are:
*''Ruyiwutan''/''Nyoi Muton'' 如意無貪 "fulfill wishes without craving" translates Analu 阿那律 [[Anuruddha]], one of the original disciples of [[Gautama Buddha]]
*''Ruyilun''/''Nyōi-rin'' 如意輪 "wish-fulfilling wheel" or ''Ruyilun Guanyin''/''Nyoirin Kannon'' 如意輪観音  translates Sanskrit ''Cintamanicakra'', a manifestation of [[Guanyin]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, who is usually depicted with the ''cintamani'' magic jewel and the ''falun''/''nyo-rin'' 法輪 "wheel of dharma, [[dharmacakra]]"

'''''Sleepers, Wake! Technology and the Future of Work''''' is a book written by [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person135889|title=Prof Hon Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=The University of Melbourne|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1982 and reprinted many times. A revised and updated edition was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6993736|title=''Sleepers, Wake! : Technology and the Future of Work'' / Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the premise that technologically advanced nations are currently passing through a [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] or [[information revolution]], Jones analyzes the unique threats and opportunities of the sudden rise in information to the field such as manufacturing, service employment, and basic income.

Jones argues that science and technology have changed the quality, length, and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology, or religion. Therefore, inventors such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]] have shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

Some of the book's key points, such as the claim that technological innovation is a major component of economic growth, are more widely accepted now than in 1982. But, to quote Barry Jones himself, "The central thesis was that people were going to be living longer, far longer, ''but it was possible that they would be working a good deal less''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_future/Transcripts/s616084.htm ''New Dimensions'': "Future of Work"], broadcast transcript, 24 July 2002, with [[George Negus]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] {{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/BasicIncome|title=Basic income: a radical idea enters the mainstream|last=Arthur|first=Don|date=18 November 2016|website=Parliament of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=February 2017}}

Due to the rising issues for the labour force, Jones proposed the need to assist workers in income support and choosing to stay or leave the workforce. However, Jones noted in the 1990 edition that the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Hawke Government|government]] did not pursue the idea of basic income when it won office [[Australian federal election, 1983|in 1983]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Sleepers, Wake!'' analyzes the major changes in the workforce and presents the possible political programs to assist the society in profiting from the technological advancements.

The fourth edition uses [[Census in Australia|1991 Commonwealth census]] data as confirmation of his thesis about changes in the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=525198|title=Sleepers, Wake!: Technology and the Future of Work|last=|first=|date=|website=The ACM Digital Library|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Jones was Australia's [[Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Australia)|Minister for Science]] in the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Hawke–Keating Government|government from 1983]] to 1990.

'''Technoself studies''', commonly referred to as '''TSS''', is an emerging, [[interdisciplinarity]]  domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of [[human]] [[identity (social science)|identity]] in a technological society&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"&gt;Luppicini pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the changing nature of relationships between the human and technology. As new and constantly changing experiences of human identity emerge due to constant technological change, technoself studies seeks to map and analyze these mutually influential developments with a focus on identity, rather than technical developments. Therefore, the self is a key concept of TSS. The term "technoself", advanced by Luppicini (2013), broadly denotes evolving human identity as a result of the adoption of new technology, while avoiding ideological or philosophical biases inherent in other related terms including [[#Cyborg|cyborg]], [[#Posthuman|posthuman]], [[#Transhuman|transhuman]], techno-human,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/techno-human-condition | title=The Techno-Human Condition | publisher=MIT Press | author2=Daniel Sarewitz | author1=Braden R. Allenby}}&lt;/ref&gt; beman (also known as bio-electric human), [[#Digital identity and virtual life|digital identity]], [[#Real and virtual identities|avatar]], and [[#Homotechnicus|homotechnicus]] though Luppicini acknowledges that these categories "capture important aspects of human identity".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Technoself is further elaborated and explored in Luppicini's "''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Environment''".

==History and contextual framing==

Technoself evolved from early groundwork in identity studies, [[philosophy of mind]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; [[René Descartes]] is often credited as one of the first identity theorists of [[Modernity]] to question the material world and the certainty of knowledge from the self. Despite heavy criticism, the question he posed regarding the necessary relation between the mind and body is still considered a prevalent theme in contemporary discussions of identity and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dixon, D.|year=1990|title=Man after man: An anthropology of the future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major development in identity studies came from early [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. Beginning with [[Freud]], the psychoanalytic tradition shed some light on the dynamics of identity and personality development. [[Goffman|Erving Goffman]] expanded the inquiry of identity with his [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical theory]], which emphasized the centrality of the social realm and the notion of self-presentation to identity. Later, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] further expanded the area of inquiry by contemplating how technologies could facilitate the emergence of new ways of relating to oneself.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most entrenched area of technoself studies is revolved around [[ontological]] considerations and conceptualizations of technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The effort to identify the essence of human being is frequent in philosophical circles and is entrenched within emerging theoretical scholarship on technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; DeGrazia's (2005) examination  on identify/numerical identity to shed light on the ethics of human enhancement. According to DeGrazia, human identity is divided into two parts: 1) numerical identity (concerns the continuity of an individual as the same object over time or across procedure), and 2) narrative identity (concerns the changes in self-perception experienced by an individual over time).&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi=10.1080/03605310590960166}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing human identity into two parts, DeGrazia is facilitating a discussion on the ethics of human enhancements.&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"/&gt; Meanwhile, Croon Fors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:144413/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Being-with Information Technology: Critical explorations beyond use and design|author=Anna Croon Fors|isbn=9173051179|publisher=Department of Informatics, Umeå University|location= Umeå, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;(2012) research on the entanglement of the self and digitalization have helped frame ontological considerations related to the conceptualization of technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Furthermore, the changing nature of identity is a common theme within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; As a result, this has given way for scholars to analyze questions such as: How are advances in sensing technologies, biometrics, and genetics changing the way we define and recognize identity? How are technologies changing the way people define themselves and present themselves in society? These types of questions are being heavily analyzed as the conceptualization of identity is changing rapidly.

Central to the understanding of the development of technoself studies as a field of research is the idea that human identity is shaped by the adoption of new technologies and the relationship between humans and technology. Advancements in digital technology have recently forced researchers to consider the conception of the [[self]] in relation to the increasing reliance of society on the use of technologies (such as cellphones, tablets, and [[social media]]) in daily tasks in peoples' personal and professional lives.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; New technologies, particularly [[computer-mediated communication]] tools, have raised questions related to identity in relationship to privacy issues, virtual identity boundaries, [[Internet fraud|online fraud]], citizen surveillance, etc. These issues come as our perspective on technology shifts from one of functionality to one of interaction. According to John Lester, in the future, "we won't simply enjoy using our tools, we will come to care for them".&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt;

==Related terms==

===Noeme=== 
The noeme is a term coined in 2011 by biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalimmortality.blogspot.co.uk/2011_03_01_archive.html|title=Evolutionary Replicators in the Global Brain|date=March 7, 2011|work=Human Indefinite Lifespans}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it denotes a "combination of a distinct physical brain function and that of an outsourced virtual one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klemm WR|title=Making a Scientific Case for Conscious Agency and Free Will|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|page=68|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MTiOCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=noeme+kyriazis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XUhVnAeio4&amp;sig=dZzl1CPJQyA4oRbAPF1A9Faha0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjborH9jKLMAhVEIcAKHcqqAl4Q6AEIKjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=noeme%20kyriazis&amp;f=false|isbn=9780128052891}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noeme is the intellectual "networked presence" of an individual within the [[global brain]], a meaningful synergy between each individual human, their social interactions and artificial agents, globally connected to other noemes through digital communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4319389 | pmid=25705180 | doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00007 | volume=9 | title=Systems neuroscience in focus: from the human brain to the global brain? | year=2015 | journal=Front Syst Neurosci | pages=7 | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriazis further clarifies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Technological integration and hyperconnectivity: Tools for promoting extreme human lifespans | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.21626/abstract | journal = Complexity | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 15–24 | doi=10.1002/cplx.21626| arxiv = 1402.6910 | bibcode = 2015Cmplx..20f..15K }}&lt;/ref&gt; that: ''"...The noeme is structurally coupled with its medium, i.e. the computer/internet. It continuously generates its own organisation and specifies its operation and content. As a self-organising system it adjusts to external influences and reinvents itself in order to adapt to its environment i.e. it reproduces (self-replicates) horizontally in a process that can be termed 'noemic reproduction'. This digital intellectual manifestation of a person, if successful, will lead to others copying it, thus noemes are replicating... A noeme is not just a collection of single ideas or solitary intellectual achievements. It is the total sum of all individual cognitive efforts and active information-sharing accomplishments of a person, the intellectual standing of a person within the [[Global brain]].''

===Cyborg===

A [[cyborg]] (cybernetic organism) is a term referring to individuals with "both biological and artificial parts." Cyborgs are known as being half-human, half machine organisms, due to the fact that they are always connected with technology. This term, which was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]], refers to and acknowledges those beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology. The notion of cyborg has played a part in breaking down boundaries between humans and non-humans living within a technologically advanced society. For example, those who have installed pacemakers, hearing aids, artificial body parts, cochlear implants as well as other technologies that may aid in enhancing an organisms abilities and capacities to perform, either physically or mentally.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;
[[Hugh Herr]], an American rock climber, engineer, and biophysicist, has successfully invented the next generation of cyborg (bionic limbs and robotic prosthetics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strickland, E.|date=May 27, 2014|title=We Will End Disability by Becoming Cyborgs|accessdate=November 5, 2014|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/we-will-end-disability-by-becoming-cyborgs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of the Media Lab's Biomechatronics group in MIT, he shared his experience and presented the team achievement first time in a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDsNZJTWw0w | title=The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | people=Hugh Herr |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhuman===
[[Transhuman]] is a concept that emerged as a result of the transhumanist movement which is centred around the notion of improving the abilities of human beings mainly through both 'scientific and technical means.' Unlike the posthuman concept, the notion of transhuman is based on human augmentation but does not commit itself to positing a new separate species.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The philosophy of [[transhumanism]] was developed in the 1990s by British philosopher [[Max More]] who articulated the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy. However, the transhuman philosophy has also been subject to scrutiny by prominent scholars such as [[Francis Fukuyama]].

===Posthuman===

[[Posthuman]] is a concept that aims towards signifying and characterizing a fresh and enhanced type of being. This organism is highly representative of a being that embraces drastic capabilities that exceed current human capabilities that are presently defining human beings. This posthuman state of identity has mainly resulted from the advancement of technological presence. According to Luppicini, posthuman capabilities "suggest a new type of being over and above human. This compromises the neutrality needed for a clear conception of human identity in the face of human-technological integration." This concept aims towards enabling a brighter future concerned with gaining a better perception of the world through various viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Homotechnicus===

Homo technicus is a term "first coined by Galvin in 2003 to help refine the definition of human beings to more accurately reflect the evolving condition of human beings intertwined within advancing technological society".&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"&gt;"Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society", ''Information Science Reference'' (2013), by Rocci Luppicini.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the notion that human beings are technological by nature and evolve simultaneously with technology. Galvin states in his article titled "On Technoethics", "mankind cannot do away with the technical dimension, going even to the
point of considering this part of its constitution: mankind is technical by nature. Technology is not an
addition to man but is, in fact, one of the ways in which mankind distinguishes itself from animals."&lt;ref name="Galvan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Galván, José María|date=December 2003|title=On Technoethics|url=http://bib26.pusc.it/teo/p_galvan/technotehics%20ieee%20tradotto.pdf|journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine|volume=10|issue=4|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luppicini builds upon the concept of homo technicus in his book ''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society''. Luppicini feels that the notion of homo technicus contributes to the conception of humans as technoselves in two ways. First it helps to solidify the idea of technology as being a key component in defining humans and society and secondly it demonstrates the importance of technology as a human creation that aligns with human values.&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"/&gt; He further goes onto explain that human interactions with the material world around them helps to create meaning and this unique way of creating meaning has affected how humans have evolved as a species.

Note: the term homo technicus was coined earlier than 2003.  For instance, it was used by Russell E. Willis in his 1990 PhD dissertation for Emory University: Toward a Theological Ethics of Technology: An analysis in Dialogue with Jacques Ellul, James Gustafson, and the Philosophy of Technology.  It was later used by Willis in "Complex Responsibility in an Age of Technology," in Living Responsibly in Community, ed. Fredrick E. Glennon, et al. (University Press of America, 1997): 251ff.  In both publications homo technicus is offered as a model for the responsible self in an age of pervasive technology.

===Avatar===
[[Avatar (computing)|Avatars]] represent the individual, the individual's alter ego, or character(s) within virtual environments controlled by a human user. Avatars provide a unique opportunity to experiment with one's identity construction within virtual worlds (Turkle, 1995) and to do so with others". Examples of avatars can include personas in online games or virtual life simulations such as Second Life.

===Technohuman===
A new hybrid form of creature that results from an intertwinement between human and machine.

===Technosapien===
A techno-sapien would be a slang term for a human being who is familiar and comfortable with technology. Someone who has the latest gadgets and electronic machinery would be techno-sapien.

===Digital identity===
[[Digital identity]] is the data that uniquely describes a person or a thing and contains information about the subject's relationships. The social identity that an internet user establishes through digital identities in cyberspace is referred to as online identity.

==Key areas and issues==
The areas of focus in TSS are: philosophical inquiry and theoretical framing, [[digital identity]] and [[virtual life]], [[human enhancement]] [[Technology|technologies]], and their regulation.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; These areas of study have been influenced by extensive research, and input from an editorial advisory and review board over the course of several years.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Digital identity and virtual life===
Digital identity and virtual life looks at how individuals explore, develop and represent their identities in online, virtual, or mediated environments. Research on virtual life and digital identities is concerned not only with how individuals relate to their own mediated identities, but also with how they relate to those of others. With the current popularity of [[social networking service]] sites, it is no surprise that TSS scholars have also begun studying the effects that such constant and mediated social connections have on identity. Topics that fall under this category have included [[intellectual disability]], [[gender identity]], and [[mass media]] in sport.

Critical areas of research include: how individuals treat the identity of others in an online space; how people use media to develop and project their identity; and how digital representation can alter life meaning and identity (Luppicini, 2013). Such research examines the advantages and disadvantages of online life and digital identity construction.&lt;ref name=LuppicicniP15P16&gt;Luppicini, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of digital identity and virtual life have become quite popular, e.g. online avatars. Scholars are now focused on the role avatars play in identity exploration, priming behaviours, and self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = R. | last2 = Guadagno | first2 = R. | year = 2012 | title = My avatar and me - Gender and personality predictors of avatar-self discrepancy | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 97–106 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research looks at the use of [[communication]] technologies by immigrant individuals as part of a digital [[diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elias | first1 = N. | last2 = Lemish | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Spinning the web of identity: Internet's roles in immigrant adolescents' search of identity | url = | journal = New Media and Society | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi=10.1177/1461444809102959}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars examine a trend in which diasporic immigrants who feel disconnected from their cultural identities have turned to digital technologies as a way to reconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Papacharissi, Z.|year=2011|title=A networked self: Identity, community, and culture on social networking sites|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technoself" is often used interchangeably with "virtual self". In this case, technoself is used to refer to a virtual manifestation of one's self.  The ability to project one's self into a virtual world allows users to control their appearance and personality. Users are able to customize their virtual identity and craft a persona to their liking. The malleability of online identities allows users to not only create their own virtual self, but also to continually change and mold their online selves in ways impossible to do with their real identities. Users can edit and change their virtual selves' appearance and behavior to control other users' perception of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seung-A|first=Annie Jin|title=The virtual malleable self and the virtual identity discrepancy model: Investigative frameworks for virtual possible selves and others in avatar-based identity construction and social interaction|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2012|volume=28|issue=6|page=2161|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to create and change your identity in this way, is due to anonymity. [[Anonymity]] is a paramount and dynamic feature of virtual social interaction within the online [[public sphere]]. As individuals are not required to reveal their real identity, they are able to explore new and undiscovered aspects of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N | year = 2009 | title = The Proteus Effect: Implications of Transformed Digital Self-Representation on Online and Offline Behavior | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi=10.1177/0093650208330254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this expansion of the self, anonymous individuals may try on various identities which break traditional social norms, without fear of retribution or judgment. This contributes to the creation of 'super-selves', through which individuals may amplify aspects of their projected identities in order to form an ideal expression of the self.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"/&gt; The fact that the vast majority of virtual encounters are anonymous in nature allows a 'strangers on a train' phenomenon to
take place. Through invented and unknown personae, individuals are able to engage in self-disclosure, transvestism, and fantasies. However, this freedom may not be absolute, as there are many risks in participating in an online community, including identity theft and the potential linkage between anonymous and manifest identities.&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Anonymity also may have legal ramifications, making it difficult for law enforcement to maintain control over online communities. Tracking down online law-breakers is difficult when their identity is unknown. Anonymity also frees individuals so that they are able to behave in socially undesirable and harmful ways, which can result in forms of hate speech and cruel online behaviour. Lastly, anonymity also diminishes the integrity of information, and as a result, diminished the overall trust of online environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Johnson|first1=D.|last2=Miller|first2=K.|year=1998|title=Anonymity, Pseudonymity, or Inescapable Identity on the Net|conference=Ethics and Social Impact: Privacy Issue|volume=28|issue=2|doi= 10.1145/276755.276774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many online users choose to attempt anonymity through the use of avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avatar|year=2012|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar?s=t|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users associate themselves with avatars as digital representatives within a duplicated and simulated [[virtual community]]. The user's body is essentially plugged in within the avatar world, thereby creating the illusion of infinite "space" behind the computer screen. As a result, they provide the opportunity for users to manipulate their worlds and the spaces and objects with which they interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davis, K.|year=2011|title=Tensions of identity in a networked era: Young people's perspectives on the risks and rewards of online self-expression|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=4|pages=634–651|doi=10.1177/1461444811422430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in online communities has resulted in the creation of a virtual economy based on the semantic value of digital products.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Y. | last2 = Huang | first2 = S. | last3 = Shang | first3 = R. | year = 2012 | title = A private versus a public space: Anonymity and buying decorative symbolic goods for avatars in a virtual world | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.030 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 2227–2235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of online consumerism is centered on the creation of avatars as extensions of the self. The purchase of symbolic goods for these avatars relates to the emotional and social value that the user holds for these items. These products may indicate roles or personality traits of players within a community and consist primarily of task oriented and nonfunctional items.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"/&gt;

Luppicini argues that the rise of online life creates serious questions on the advantages and disadvantages of [[Online community|online communities]] along with the challenges to online identity construction (Turkle, 1999). He notes the negative influence of the impersonality of virtual communities on offline interaction and the consequence of [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet addiction]]. [[Sherry Turkle]] states: "We discovered the network – the world of connectivity – to be uniquely suited to the overworked and overscheduled life it makes possible. And now we look to the network to defend us against loneliness even as we want it to control the intensity of our connections".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and surveillance of the technoself===
{{See also|Surveillance#Psychological/social effects}}
[[Computer networking]] and smart technologies such as [[radio frequency identification]] (RFID), [[geographical information systems]] (GIS), and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) are providing new tools and techniques for monitoring individuals and their behavior.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The rise in these types of technologies has raised concerns over the invasion of privacy, and the misuse of information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;  That is because the networked identity of technoselves can be exploited by third parties who may want to gain access and control over personal information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Moreover, the implications of the sophisticated technologies for identifying and tracking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/sites/default/files/2005_03_Loctech.pdf | title=Location Technologies: Mobility, Surveillance and Privacy | publisher=Surveillance Studies Centre | date=March 2005 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |author1=David Lyon |author2=Stephen Marmura |author3=Pasha Peroff }}&lt;/ref&gt; people, the storage of this data, and the governmental use of surveillance   to track suspicious types of people are significant issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/ | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |title=Surveillance Studies Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; in privacy/[[surveillance]] and TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The availability of related technologies (e.g. [[EyeTap]], [[Memoto]]) to individuals (as opposed to governments or commercial interests) has also led to the phenomenon dubbed [[sousveillance]], whereby individuals track or record authorities' activities either online or in real environments.

Leading scholars in the study of surveillance include [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] and Mark Andrejevic.  In addition to contributing to the advent of [[citizen journalism]], the proliferation of sousveillance technologies has suggested a number of legal/regulatory, ethical, and social implications for democratic and consumer rights. A dramatic illustration of these concerns comes from University of Toronto Professor [[Steve Mann]], a privacy rights advocate and pioneering engineer of such technologies. After being allegedly assaulted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | title=Physical assault by McDonald's for wearing Digital Eye Glass | work=wearcam.org | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGSr4dBe?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a French McDonald's restaurant for wearing an augmented-reality digital eye glass device, Mann was, ironically, allegedly denied access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | title=Unanswered letter to McDonalds' Head of Customer Services | work=wearcam.org | date=August 17, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGXfTquv?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to McDonald's own surveillance camera footage.

===Human enhancement technology===

[[Human enhancement]] technology (HET) is the study of tools that would better and improve a human being's way of life.&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15&gt;Luppicini, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to advance and progress what humans already do within their normal lives. However, customarily it seeks to aid any illnesses and weaknesses in the body.  Popular topics within this new area of study include, [[sex reassignment surgery]], mood enhancers, [[genomics]], and [[neuroenhancement]].&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15/&gt; Enhancement within the workplace is a new topic of discussion, while the workplace should be adapting to the various types of human impairment, it seems that improving the workers is of more concern to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Human enhancement. (2012). ''Psychologist'', 25(12), 875-875.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[cyborg]] prosthetics one can assemble themselves in their own vision, any disfigurement or handicap can possibly disappear.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hogle | first1 = L. F. | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and the body | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 695–716 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.144020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the evolution of cyborg prosthetics a human is able to physically grasp things more easily, allowing more of the population to engage in whatever they choose.  A large aspect of this technology stems from the ability to determine who may and may not benefit, as well as how  access to these new technologies should be controlled.

Human bodies can now not only be improved upon through natural means, but through the effects of technology.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; This new form of enhancement is connected with what humans perceive of themselves, and as to how their own identity is created.  A human operates based on their abilities; these capabilities are the factors and characteristics that create a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity 1 | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi = 10.1080/03605310590960166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The augmentation of these aptitudes leads to a new human, who has a renewed sense of who they are. The term 'free to be me' is closely related to this new form of enhancement, wherein technological enhancements can be either cosmetic or reconstructive.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt;  Through the incorporation of medicine and technology "...[[cosmetic surgery]] then becomes a technology through which the body is normalized and homogenized as much as enhanced".&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; A proper example relating to human enhancement and cyborgs could be the recently convicted [[Oscar Pistorius]]. In past years, [[Pistorius]] fought with the International Olympic Committee to have a place in the hurdles events of the 2012 Olympics in London. The controversy surrounding Pistorius extended to his artificial legs, and how they compared to the natural human anatomy; did Pistorius have an unfair advantage over his competitors? The ruling was left up to a scientific analysis of his legs and running stride which ultimately lead to his participation in the Olympic Games. Therefore, we've come to a time where decisions, and thus human panels, need to determine what is human, what is natural, and what is artificial.

Rights and privacy issues over human enhancement technology has given rise to challenging topics within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; For example, the consideration of ethical policies and guidelines in the deployment of HET is an emerging topic within TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Further, the question of access to HET, and where we draw the line between necessary therapeutic technologies, and frivolous human enhancement are being raised in TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Therefore, the emerging topic regarding the rights and privacy over HET is of great interest within TSS. Popular HET's topics in recent research academia include: Sex (re assignment) (Diamond &amp; Sigmundson, 1997; Zucker, 2002), mood enhancers (Rabin, 2006), cognitive enhancers (Walker, 2008), genomics (Zwart, 2009), and [[neuroenhancement]] (Northoff,1996). A second line of inquiry explores social, legal, and ethical aspects of human enhancement and possible threats to human dignity that could arise from the implementation of human enhancements
(Bostrom, 2005).

Some critiques engage a discussion between the development of HET and the socio-economic environment. [[Francis Fukuyama]], an American political scientist concerns about the future of HET might cause the extension of contradiction between the rich and poor within comparatively rich, industrialized nations because HET is likely to be a luxury product.&lt;ref&gt;Society for Computers &amp; Law. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment, HET seems to be hard to be mainstream in public health services due to the price, which creates a deeper distinctions among those who can afford the technology and those who will remain disabled.

===Transhumanism===

[[Transhuman]] thought focuses on beliefs held that the fundamental transformation of the human condition will be through the development of various technology, which will eventually eliminate human aging and will enhance human capacities, both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moravec, Hans|year=1998|title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?|journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology|volume=1|accessdate=2006-06-23|url=http://www.ee.sc.edu/classes/Fall11/elct762/Class_Notes/Moravec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in this theory think that the future of human development will see a new intelligent species that will be enhanced by the technological advances. They use these technological advances to approach various issues regarding the human experience, like morality and health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moreno, Jonathan D.|year=2006|title=Mind Wars: Brain Research and National Defense|publisher=Dana Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see this convergence happening through the support of current technologies and the vision of technology in the future; using these advances to eventually make humans more than human, enhanced through this technology. Their central argument is that humans need to be able to choose whether or not this technology is used by them or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clark, Amanda C. R.|date=March 12, 2010|title=Transhumanism and Posthumanism: Lifting Man Up or Pulling Him Down?|website=Ignatius Insight|accessdate=2012-05-18|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2010/aclark_tranhumanism_mar2010.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory expands on the notion of technoself, as [[transhumanism]] poses what to many who hold these beliefs is the natural evolution of the human condition. Many look to the history of technological advancements as proof that these future advancements are possible, at least in theory.

===Real and virtual identities===

[[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s are a visual representation of a user in an online environment. This representation may be an accurate physical representation of the user, or may be completely different. This online representation may affect the offline self. Pena and his colleagues explored a phenomenon known as the "[[Proteus effect]]" wherein "avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings".&lt;ref name="Pena et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peña | first1 = J. | last2 = Hancock | first2 = J. | last3 = Merola | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The priming effects of avatars in virtual settings | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 838–856 | doi = 10.1177/0093650209346802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a study that demonstrated how the appearance and affiliations of an individual's online avatar can alter the individual's offscreen personality and attitudes. Pena's group used virtual group discussions to gauge the aggressiveness of individuals using avatars wearing black cloaks versus their control group counterparts wearing white and found more aggressive intentions and attitudes in the black cloak group.

Similar results were found in a second study that used Thematic Apperception Test studies to determine the differences between values and attitudes of a control group and a group using a [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan (KKK)]]-associated avatar. Individuals using the KKK-associated avatars were less affiliative and displayed more negative thoughts than the control group. Further support for Pena et al.'s work can be found in other studies that yielded similar results: "Yee and Bailenson found that, in an immersive 3D environment, participants using avatars with more attractive faces walked closer and disclosed more information when compared to those using avatars with less attractive faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N. | last2 = Bailenson | first2 = J. | last3 = Ducheneaut | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The proteus effect | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi = 10.1177/0093650208330254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition...participants using taller avatars tended to negotiate more forcefully in comparison to those using shorter avatars."&lt;ref name="Pena et al" /&gt; A growing body of evidence supports how our online personas can affect our offline self; altering our attitudes and values.

===Online anonymity and presentation of the self===

[[Anonymous post|Online anonymity]] is commonly described using the phrase "[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog]]". Online anonymity allows users to present different versions of themselves in online environments. Unconstrained by physical limitations, users are free to choose and construct their virtual form(s) and identities. Virtual spaces which foster such freedom and anonymity therefore allow  users to depart from the expectations, norms, and behaviours of their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardey | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Life Beyond the Screen: embodiment and identity through the internet | journal = The Editorial Board of Sociological Review | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 570–585 |doi=10.1111/1467-954X.00399|url=http://www.jimelwood.net/students/grips/man_group_comm/hardey_2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be said that this unlimited freedom of anonymous expression allows for the transfer of real world suppressed emotions to the online domain. However, if one continually chooses to express their true self anonymously online as opposed to in the real world via face to face interaction, which realm would be more 'real'? As extreme as this scenario may seem, one could say the suppression of norms and natural expression would deem the physical self the avatar, and the online avatar the true self.

A user's [[online identity]] is a social identity that represents the user in the online environment, allowing a user a high level of control over their identity in a way that differs from the offline world. Turkle found that the level of control over creating an online identity also extends to the intensity of connections made in such virtual spaces, as users may engage and disengage at will.&lt;ref name=Turkle&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turkle|first1=Sherry|title=Alone Together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465031467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dervin and Abbas note that Turkle, in her early work was "one of the first to show how anonymity 'provides ample room for individuals to express unexplored parts of themselves' more easily than in face-to-face interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|contribution=Introduction|url=http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074020/http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archivedate=August 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this notion of being free in online anonymity, technoself studies also looks at what the element of hiding does to us.  Turkle suggests that, "our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other".&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Technoself studies explores what these profiles do to the human unconscious.  While people are "exposing" themselves, they question their level of exposure and sharing compared to extent in what they are truly hiding in reality.
Furthermore, when creating online profiles, people risk others' perceptions of the information shared and if they receive the messages that the sender intended. Without verbal communication misperceptions, messages can alter identity or personal development.

Avatars can be an important element of the online presentation of the user. In many cases, "avatars in blogging were created to accurately reflect their owners' physical appearance, lifestyle and preferences. By contrast, participants in the dating and gaming treatments accentuated certain aspects of their avatar to reflect the tone and perceived expectations of the context".&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vasalou | first1 = A. | last2 = Joinson | first2 = A. N. | year = 2009 | title = Me, myself and I: The role of interactional context on self-presentation through avatars | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 510–520 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2008.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals often emphasize or downplay certain characteristics depending upon the context of their online interactions. These inconsistencies tend to be trivial, however. For instance, men tend to mildly exaggerate their height, while women often underestimate their weight. This is typically not an attempt to mislead others but to be as honest as possible while still presenting themselves in the best light.

According to Vasalou &amp; Joinson, although various online forums may present people with the opportunity to create (an) alternate persona(s), they typically choose to create an avatar or represent themselves in a way that is consistent with reality: "In having equal access to everyday artifacts and fantasy options, participants were inclined to draw on existing self-views rather than grasping the opportunity to explore other personas". Furthermore, Vasalou and Joinson also claim that, in the context of online communication, high self-awareness (as demonstrated by an avatar largely consistent with an individual's offline persona), contributes to a higher rate of interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson" /&gt;

One consequence of online anonymity and creating false identities is the ability to "catfish". [[Catfishing]] is a recent internet phenomenon, of manipulating, deceiving and luring people into relationships, through creating an online fictional persona. In many cases these deceptions are used to create romantic or intimate affairs. Since the affair happens entirely through technology, one is able to hide their true identity and carry on the relationship through their made up character. The majority of these incidences happen through social media sites, such as [[Facebook]], and internet dating sites where people are already looking for love, and therefore can be easily manipulated by peoples personas and deceptions.

==New directions and opportunities in research==

===Personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures===
{{See also|Ubiquitous robot|Cloud robotics|Domestic robot}}
New directions and opportunities in technoself research involving personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures is becoming an increasing reality. Considering the work of pioneering computer scientists and robotics experts such a Rodney Brooks and Hiroshi Ishiguro, human interaction with personal and social robots reached mainstream audiences beginning with the popularization of robotic dolls and pets for children.&lt;ref name=LuppP17&gt;Luppicini, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by [[Sherry Turkle]] examines many of the effects of these social robots on children, middle and elderly. There are also robots for adults aimed at therapeutic (technotherapy), personal, and social applications ([[Paro (robot)|Paro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cute Baby Seal Robot - PARO Theraputic Robot #DigInfo|date= August 11, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq5PQZHU-I&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phobot]], [[Roxxxy]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; These types of therapeutic robots are used in nursing homes and hospitals, with the purpose of creating an environment where one can nurture and communicate with an animal. This allows people in a lonely or isolated environment the ability to have something to care for and interact with that is also able to respond and interact back. This has shown to provide happiness and a larger sense of purpose for the individuals, even if for a short period of time.  With personalized robots and the social integration of artificial intelligence, technoself is developing in children through relationships with robotic pets and related robotic technologies based on animals, objects, or people ([[Tamagotchi]], [[Furby]], [[AIBO]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;  Current areas of interest in this topic are reported in [[Melson]] (2012), which provide helpful insights into children's views about robot pets, children's relationship with robotic pets and, conceptualizations of self-identity within child-robot relationships.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; Other research is focusing more on personalized robots for adults. If the trend towards the personalization of robots and social integration of artificial creatures continues, it is expected that this research will become more prevalent.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; David Levy, the artificial intelligence researcher in [[University of Maastricht]] contains the forecast of robot and human relationship in his thesis, "Intimate Relationships with Artificial Partners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Sitewide/Pers/LoveAndSexWithRobots1.htm|title=Love and Sex with Robots|date=October 8, 2007|publisher=University of Maastricht}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview Forecast: Sex and Marriage with Robots by 2050 with ''[[LiveScience]]'', Levy says :"My forecast is that around 2050, the state of Massachusetts will be the first jurisdiction to legalize marriages with robots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/1951-forecast-sex-marriage-robots-2050.html|title=Forecast: Sex and Marriage with Robots by 2050|work=LiveScience|date=October 12, 2007|author=Charles Q. Choi}}&lt;/ref&gt; are real life experience suggesting that humans can develop an psychological level relationship with artificial subjects, even if the subject itself is not in any physical shape. [[Judith Newman]] wrote an article on ''[[New York Times]]'' about the relationship between the [[Siri]] system and her 13-year-old son who has [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html?_r=0|title=To Siri, With Love|date=October 17, 2014|first=Judith|last=Newman|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman says his son develops a close relationship with the system and learning to show affection to it even though he knows Siri is not 'real'. Newman suggest that Siri could be a potential companion to those children who have a hard time to communicate with people. Duggan (2016) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Duggan|first1 = G.B.|title = Applying psychology to understand relationships with technology: from ELIZA to interactive healthcare |journal = Behaviour and Information Technology|date = 2016|volume = 35|pages = 536–547|doi=10.1080/0144929X.2016.1141320}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how users already form relationships with technology that share many of the features of relationships between humans. These relationships have important implications for the future of healthcare as interactive technology increasingly replaces roles traditionally filled by humans.

===Human enhancement regulation and governance===
{{See also|:Category:Regulation of technologies}}
Human enhancement regulation, governance, and legal concerns has become another growing concern for the opportunity of TSS research. According to Saner and Geelen (2012), there is one framework to guide technoself governance which distinguishes six different approaches to which emerging technologies may affect human identity:
# physical alteration of existing human beings
# changes to how existing human bodies are perceived
# the creation of novel humanoid bodies
# physical alteration of existing human environments
# changes to the way humans perceive existing human environments
# creation of novel human environments.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;

Luppicini posits that this sort of model could "prove invaluable for guiding future decision making directed at the framing of HET regulation debates, as well as leveraging strategic planning and decision making concerning HET adaption standards."&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; [[Technoethics]] relates to the ethical considerations concerning technology in society.Human enhancement improves aspects of human function and may temporarily or permanently overcome the limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. The consequences of such technological alterations implies ethical questions such as the unfair physical and mental categorization of certain individuals. Therefore, further consideration will need to be associated with ethical questions surrounding the evolution of technology. With growing trends of artificial intelligence and technological devices, such as [[Google Glass]], stricter regulation will be necessary. Furthermore, [[Elon Musk]] recently stated that "We need to be careful with AI (artificial intelligence). Potentially more dangerous than nukes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-may-be-more-dangerous-than-nukes/|title=Elon Musk: Artificial intelligence may be "more dangerous than nukes"|date=August 4, 2014|work=CBS News|first=Eliene|last=Augenbraun}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that there may be need to worry about the evolution of technology, and specifically how humans employ it to their benefit.

The '''Territory-wide System Assessment''' ([[Abbreviation]]: TSA; {{zh|全港性系統評估}}) is an assessment introduced by the [[Education Commission]] in the report of [http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/about-edb/policy/edu-reform/ "Reform Proposal for the Education System in Hong Kong"] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority|url = http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/sa_tsa/tsa/|website = www.hkeaa.edu.hk|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is held in June every [[year]] since 2004 for students of Primary 3, Primary 6 (implemented in alternate year starting from 2011) and Secondary 3. The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is designed for facilitating learning and teaching after evaluating the [[average]] learning standard of the students in the subject of [[Chinese language]], [[English language]] and [[Mathematics]] at the end of key stage 1-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url = http://www.bca.hkeaa.edu.hk/web/TSA/en/Faq.html#Q01|website = http://www.bca.hkeaa.edu.hk/web/TSA/en/Faq.html#Q01|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' (TSA) is a territory-level assessment launched and administered by the [[Education Bureau]] (Chinese:[[cmn:教育局 (香港)|教育局]]) since 2004. The aims of the ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is to objectively assess the basic learning competencies and learning progress of the students at different stages of learning. The capabilities of students are analysed through the ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' in order to improve the [[effectiveness]] in learning and teaching. Educational policies can be reviewed with the help of the [[data]] collected through the ''Territory-wide System Assessment''.

The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is conducted in the form of pencil and paper (except Chinese and English [[oral exam|oral]] assessment) and the examined [[Course (education)|subjects]] are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] Language, [[English language|English]] Language and [[Mathematics]].  The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is compulsory for all Primary 3, Primary 6 and Secondary 3 students from government-subsidised schools. The assessment results of the students with intellectual disabilities, e.g. suffering from [[dyslexia]] or [[Eddie Ng|mental retardation]] can be excluded after getting medical approval.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''''The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations''''' is a descriptive list which was created by [[Georges Polti]] to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this Polti analyzed classical [[ancient Greece|Greek]] texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of [[Carlo Gozzi]], who also identified 36 situations.

==Publication history==
{{quote box|align=right|width=300px|quote=“Gozzi maintained that there can be but thirty-six tragic situations. Schiller took great pains to find more, but he was unable to find even so many as Gozzi.” |source= —[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polti |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Polti |title=The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:The_thirty-six_dramatic_situations_(1921).djvu |year=1921 |month= |origyear=1916 |publisher=James Knapp Reeve |location=Franklin, Ohio |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples.  The original French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted to this day.

The list is popularized as an aid for writers, but it is also used by dramatists, [[storytelling|storyteller]]s and many others. Other similar lists have since been made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13808">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Translations of ''One Thousand and One Nights''}}
The translations of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' have been made into virtually every major language of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors=[[Wen-chin Ouyang]], Geert Jan van Gelder | title =New Perspectives on Arabian Nights| publisher =Routledge | year =2014 | page =ix | isbn =1317983939}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began with the French translation by [[Antoine Galland]] (titled ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'', finished in 1717). Galland's translation was essentially an adapted Arabic manuscript of Syrian origins and oral tales recorded by him in [[Paris]] from a [[Maronite]] Arab from [[Aleppo]] named Youhenna Diab or Hanna Diab.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zipes|2007|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English translation appeared in 1706 and was made from Galland's version; being anonymous, it is known as the [[Grub Street]] edition. It exists in two known copies kept in the [[Bodleian Library]] and in the [[Princeton University Library]].&lt;ref name="1001 nights"&gt;{{harvnb|Nishio|Yamanaka|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several English reissues appeared simultaneously in 1708. As early as the end of the 18th century the English translation based on Galland was brought to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Montreal]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="1001 nights"/&gt; Galland-based English translations were superseded by that made by [[Edward William Lane]] in 1839–41. In the 1880s an unexpurgated and complete English translation, ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'', was made by [[Richard Francis Burton]].

The original scattered Arabic texts were collected in four corpuses: the so-called [[Calcutta I]] or the Shirwanee Edition (1814–18, 2 volumes), [[Bulaq Edition|Bulaq]] or the Cairo Edition (1835, 2 volumes), [[Breslau Edition]] (1825–38, 8 volumes) and [[Calcutta II]] or the W.H. Macnaghten Edition (1839–42, 4 volumes). Some translations starting from Galland were [[censored]] due to lewd content.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marzolph|2004|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French translations==
===Galland===
{{main|Les mille et une nuits}}
Galland based his translation on a three- or four-volume manuscript from the 14th or 15th century.&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three volumes of that manuscript were placed in the [[National Library of France]].&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 16"/&gt; Galland's translation altered the style, tone and content of the Arabic text. Designed to appeal, it omitted sophisticated or dark elements while enhancing exotic and magical elements and became the basis of most children's versions of ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sallis | first =Eva | title =Sheherazade Through the Looking Glass: The Metamorphosis of the 'Thousand and One Nights'| publisher = Routledge| year =2013 |page=49| isbn =1136817522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mardrus===
In 1926–1932 a lavishly decorated 12-volume edition of [[J. C. Mardrus]]' translation, titled ''[[Le livre des mille nuits et une nuit]]'', appeared. Soviet and Russian scholar [[Isaak Filshtinsky]], however, considered Mardrus' translation inferior to others due to presence of chunks of text, which Mardrus conceived himself to satisfy the tastes of his time.&lt;ref name="Salye"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sheherazade.ru/about-translations-1001-night.htm| script-title=ru:О переводах '1001 ночи'|publisher= Sheherazade.ru|work=Тысяча и одна ночь. Избранные сказки|language=Russian|author=[[Isaak Filshtinsky]]| accessdate =17 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], "Mardrus took elements which were there in the original Arabic and worked them up, exaggerating and inventing, reshaping the ''Nights'' in such a manner that the stories appear at times to have been written by [[Oscar Wilde]] or [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism of his translation by academic Arabists, Mardrus promised to produce a tome of learned commentary and justificatory pieces which he, however, failed to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translations==
Unlike the Grub Street version, [[Jonathan Scott (orientalist)|Jonathan Scott]] made the first [[literal translation]] of Galland. Titled ''The Arabian Nights Entertainments'', it appeared in 1811. Then Henry Torrens translated the first fifty nights from Calcutta II, which were published in 1838. Having heard that [[Edward William Lane]] began his own translation, Torrens abandoned his work.&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane translated from the Bulaq corpus.&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 23"/&gt; He declared that "Galland has excessively perverted the work".&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lane, Galland's "acquaintance with Arab manners and customs was insufficient to preserve him always from errors of the grossest description".&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 24"/&gt;  Working with the Bulaq corpus, Lane occasionally cross-checked against Calcutta I and Breslau corpus.&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His translation, however, became incomplete.&lt;ref name="Irwin 2004 25"/&gt; In 1923 a translation by [[Edward Powys Mathers]] based on the French translation by [[J. C. Mardrus]] appeared.

Another translation attempt was made by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] (''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'', 1882–84). He, however, printed just 500 copies for private circulation and ceded the work to [[Richard Francis Burton]]. Burton's translation (''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'', 1885–88) enjoyed a huge public success, but at the same time was criticized for its reportedly archaic language and excessive erotic details.&lt;ref name="Marzolph 2004 507"&gt;{{harvnb|Marzolph|2004|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, Burton's translation remains the most complete version of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' in English.&lt;ref name="Marzolph 2004 507"/&gt; It is also generally considered as one of the finest unexpurgated translations from Calcutta II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zipes|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008.

==German translations==
In 1825 a Galland-based translation was made by [[Maximilian Habicht]]. Later, however, [[Duncan Black MacDonald]] showed that the  Tunisian provenance of a manuscript Habicht claimed to use during the translation was a forgery which Habicht committed himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Ulrich Marzolph| title =The Arabian Nights in Transnational Perspective| publisher =Wayne State University Press | year =2007 | page =60 | isbn =0814332870}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839–42 ''One Thousand and One Nights'' were translated into German by [[Gustav Weil]]. In 1895–97 [[Max Henning]] published another German translation in 24 small volumes; the first seven volumes were based on the Bulaq edition, while volumes 18–24 were largely translated from Richard Francis Burton. In 1912–13 another translation was made by [[Felix Paul Greve]].

In 1921–28 [[Enno Littmann]] produced a six-volume translation of the whole ''One Thousand and One Nights'' on the basis of Calcutta II into German, including the poetry. At the same time he translated one lewd portion into Latin, not German. Nonetheless, [[Isaak Filshtinsky]] considered Littmann's translation to be "the most complete and accomplished".&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt; [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] called it "the best German translation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch translations==
There have been several Dutch translations made from the French editions of Galland and Mardrus.&lt;ref&gt;Richard van Leeuwen (1999). De wereld van Sjahrazaad. {{ISBN|9054602155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the final volume of "De vertellingen van duizend-en-één nacht" was published; the first an so far only Dutch translation from the Arabic texts by Dr. Richard van Leeuwen. For his translation Van Leeuwen used the Bulaq-edition (Cairo 1835), the Calcutta-edition (1842) and the edition by Mahdi (Leiden 1984).&lt;ref&gt;http://bulaaq.nl/literatuur/105-de-vertellingen-van-duizend-en-een-nacht. Accessed 16 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian translation==
In 1949 Arabist [[Francesco Gabrieli]], who headed the team of anonymous translators, produced the four-volume Italian translation, based on Bulaq collated with Calcutta II.

==Russian translations==

The first Russian translation of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' was made by Alexey Filatyev in 1763–1774.&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt; It was based on Galland's translation and consisted of 12 volumes.&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt; Later Russian translations were also based on European translations. For instance, a three-volume translation by [[Yulia Doppelmayr]] (1889–1890) was based on Galland, the six-volume translation by [[Lyudmila Shelgunova]] (1894) was based on that by Edward William Lane and an anonymous translation (1902–1903) was based on Mardrus.&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt;

The first Russian translation directly from the Arabic source (from Calcutta II) was made by [[Mikhail Salye]]&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt; and published in eight volumes by [[Academia (publishing house)|Academia]] in 1929–1939. Salye also translated into Russian seven tales not contained in Calcutta II (from the manuscript in the [[National Library of Russia]]).&lt;ref name="Salye"/&gt;

==Spanish translations==
The stories about [[Sinbad the Sailor]] were translated into Spanish already in 1253.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2004|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Spanish translations were made particularly by Pedro Pedraza (from Galland), [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] (from Mardrus), [[Eugenio Sanz del Valle]], and [[Luis Aguirre Prado]], [[Alfredo Domínguez]] (from Mardrus). More accurate translations were made by the Arabists [[Juan Vernet]] and [[Rafael Cansinos Asséns]].

==Chinese translations==
A selection of stories from ''One Thousand and One Nights'', titled ''Yi Qian Lin Yi Ye'' appeared in 1900.&lt;ref name="SOAS"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/8331/1/The_Arabian_Nights_in_Chinese.pdf| title =The Arabian Nights in English and Chinese Translations: Differing Patterns of Cultural Encounter |publisher =[[SOAS, University of London]]|author=Wen-chin Ouyang| accessdate =20 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 a four-volume translation was made by Xi Rou, published in Shanghai.

In the 1930 new translations, primarily from Bulaq, appeared under the title ''Yi Qian Lin Yi Ye''.&lt;ref name="SOAS"/&gt; In that period a five-volume translation by Na Xun was made. In the 1950s Na Xun produced another, three-volume translation titled ''Yi Qian Lin Yi Ye''.

In 1982 a six-volume Beijing edition of Na Xun was published. It became the source of the 1980s two-volume translation titled ''Tian Fang Ye Tan'', which appeared in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref name="SOAS"/&gt;

==Japanese translations==
''One Thousand and One Nights'' appeared in Japanese in as early as 1875 – the two-volume translation, made by {{nihongo||永峰秀樹|[[Hideki Nagamine]]}}, was titled {{nihongo||暴夜物語 : 開巻驚奇|Arabiya monogatari : Kaikan kyōki}} and published by {{nihongo||日本評論社|Nihon Hyōronsha}} in Tokyo. In the preface Nagamine wrote that he used G. F. Townsend's ''The Arabian Nights's Entertainments'', which was based on Jonathan Scott's English translation of Galland. Nagamine also used Edward William Lane's English translation as a supplement. The second Japanese translation by [[Inoue Tsutomu]], titled ''Zensekai ichidai kisho'' (''The Most Curious Book in the Whole World''), appeared in 1883 and became more popular than Nagamine's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nishio|Yamanaka|2006|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently other Japanese translations were made, but the first complete Japanese translation from Arabic was published in 1976–92 by [[Shinji Maejima]] and [[Ikeda Osamu]], in nineteen volumes (titled ''Arabian Naito'').

==Hebrew translations==
In the years 1947-1971 Arabist Yosef-Yoel Rivlin produced a 32-volume Hebrew translation, based mainly on Bulaq. A selection of stories, translated by Hanna Amit-Kohavi, appeared in two volumes, in the years 2008 and 2011, under the title ''Leylot Arav''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12881">The '''Tucson artifacts''', sometimes called the '''Tucson Lead Crosses''', '''Tucson Crosses''', '''Silverbell Road artifacts''', or  '''Silverbell artifacts''', were thirty-one [[lead]] objects that Charles E. Manier and his family found in 1924 near [[Picture Rocks, Arizona]]  which were initially thought by some to be created by early Mediterranean civilizations that had crossed the Atlantic in the first century, but were later determined to be a hoax.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum|first=Kenneth L.|last=Feder|pages=257–258|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlRz2symkAsC&amp;pg=PA257|accessdate=2011-11-01|isbn=9780313379192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find consisted of thirty-one [[lead]] objects, including crosses, swords, and religious/ceremonial paraphernalia, most of which contained [[Hebrew]] or [[Latin]] engraved inscriptions, pictures of temples, leaders' portraits, angels,  and a dinosaur (inscribed on the lead blade of a sword). One contained the phrase "Calalus, the unknown land," which was used by believers as the name of the settlement. The objects also have Roman numerals ranging from 790 to 900 inscribed on them, which were sometimes interpreted to represent the date of their creation.  The site contains no other artifacts, no pottery [[sherd]]s, no broken glass, no human or animal remains, and no sign of hearths or housing.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"&gt;Williams, Stephen (1991) ''Fantastic Archaeology: A Walk on the Wild Side of North American Prehistory'', University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess, Don.

Retrieved February 23, 2013. {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On September 13, 1924 Charles Manier and his father stopped to examine some old lime kilns while driving northwest of Tucson on [[Silver Bell, Arizona|Silverbell Road]]. Manier saw an object protruding about {{convert|2|inch|cm}} from the soil. He dug it out, revealing that the object was a {{convert|20|inch|cm}}-long lead cross which weighed {{convert|64|lb}}. Between 1924 and 1930 additional objects were extracted from the [[caliche]], a layer of soil in which the soil particles have been cemented together by lime.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Erickson /&gt; Caliche often takes a long period of time to form, but it can be made and placed around an article in a short period of time, according to a report written by James Quinlan, a retired Tucson geologist who had worked for the U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess notes that Marshall Payn asked Quinlan to prepare his report for his article: Payn, Marshall. (1996) "The Tucson Artifacts: Case Closed." New England Antiquities Research Association Journal 30(3-4): 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Quinlan also concluded that it would be easy to bury articles in the soft, silt material and associated caliche in the lime kiln where the objects were found at the margin of prior trenches.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; The objects were believed, by their discoverer and main supporters, to be of a Roman Judeo-Christian colony existing in what is now known as Arizona between 790–900 AD. No other find has been formally established as placing any Roman colony in the area, nor anywhere else in North America.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

In November 1924, Manier brought his friend Thomas Bent to the site and Bent was quickly convinced of the authenticity of the discovery. Upon finding the land was not owned, he immediately set up residence on the land in order to [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] the property. Bent felt there was money to be made in further excavating the site.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

===Latin inscriptions===

The first object removed from the caliche by Manier was a crudely cast metal cross that weighed {{convert|62|lb}}; after cleaning it was revealed to be two separate crosses riveted together. After his find, Manier took the cross to Professor Frank H. Fowler, Head of the Department of Classical Languages at the [[University of Arizona]], at Tucson, who determined the language on the artifacts was Latin. He also translated one line as reading, "''Calalus, the unknown land''", from which the name of the supposed Latin colony was garnered.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

The Latin inscriptions on the alleged artifacts supposedly record the conflicts of the leaders of Calalus against a barbarian enemy known as the "''Toltezus''",  which some have interpreted as a supposed reference to the [[Mesoamerican]] [[Toltec]] civilization.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; However, the Latin on the artifacts appears to either be badly [[inflection|inflected]] original Latin, or inscriptions brazenly plagiarized from Classical authors such as [[Virgil]], [[Cicero]], [[Livy]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], and [[Horace]], among several others. This has led many experts to condemn the artifacts as frauds.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; What is perhaps most suspicious, however, is that most of the inscriptions are identical to what appeared in widely available Latin grammar books, like ''Harkness's Latin Grammar'' and ''Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar'', as well as dictionaries like ''The Standard Dictionary of Facts''.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

==Views on authenticity==
Manier took the first item to the [[Arizona State Museum]] to be studied by archaeologist Karl Ruppert. Ruppert was impressed with the item, and went with Manier to the site the next day where he found a {{convert|7|lb}} caliche plaque with some inscriptions including an 800 AD date. A total of thirty-one objects were found.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt; Other contemporary scholars including George C. Valliant, a Harvard University archaeologist who visited the University of Arizona in 1928 and Bashford Dean, curator of arms and armor of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City thought the articles were fakes,&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; Neil Merton Judd, curator of the National Museum at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] happened to be in Tucson at the time of the discovery of the objects and, after examining them, also thought they were fakes, proposing that they may have been created by "some mentally incompetent individual with a flair for old Latin and the wars of antiquity".&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilstrap, Peter. (3/21/1996) [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-03-21/news/a-reputation-in-ruins/2/ 'A Reputation in Ruins'] ''Phoenix New Times''. Retrieved February 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporters===
In the 1960s, Bent wrote a 350-page manuscript titled "The Tucson Artifacts" about the objects which is unpublished, but kept by the Arizona State Museum.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;   Both Manier and Bent were supporters of the objects as a genuine archaeological find.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

Lara Coleman Ostrander, a Tucson immigrant and high school history teacher studied the historical background of the research, and translated the alleged history of Calalus from the writings on the items. Geologist Clifton J. Sarle worked with Ostrander to present the Tucson Artifacts to the press and the academic profession.

Tucson University administrator and director of the Arizona State Museum Dean Byron Cummings led archaeologists at the university to the location where the items were found. He brought ten of the objects to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and showing them at museums and universities on the east coast. Astronomer [[Andrew E. Douglass]], known for his work in [[dendrochronology]] also considered the items to be authentic.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

In 1975, [[Wake Forest University]] professor Cyclone Covey re-examined the controversy in his book titled ''Calalus: A Roman Jewish Colony in America from the Time of Charlemagne Through Alfred the Great''. Covey was in direct contact with Thomas Bent by 1970, and planned to carry out excavations at the site in 1972, but was not allowed, due to legal complications preventing Wake Forest University from leading a dig at the site.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt; Covey's book proposes that the objects are from a Jewish settlement, founded by people who came from Rome and settled outside of present day Tucson around 800 AD.&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:ADSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EACE604A615B05F&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 | title=Silverbell Road artifacts puzzle new generation | date=September 1, 1996 | agency=Arizona Daily Star | accessdate=February 23, 2013 | author=Erickson, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeptics===
Professor Frank Fowler originally translated the Latin inscriptions on the first items and found that the inscriptions were from well known classical authors such as [[Cicero]], [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]]. He researched local Latin texts available in Tucson at the time and found the inscriptions on the lead items to be identical to the texts available.

Dean Cumming's student and excavator, [[Emil Haury]], closely examined scratches on the surface of the objects as they were removed from the ground and concluded that they were planted, based partly on a cavity in the ground which was longer than a lead bar removed from it. After Cummings became president of the university, his views changed in an unclear manner, possibly due to Haury's skepticism, or the increasing sentiment that the items were nothing more than a hoax and as university president had to take a different stand on the matter. George M. B. Hawley staunchly opposed Bent's views about the objects. Hawley even accused Ostrander and Sarle as perpetrators of the hoax.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal | title=Glimpses of the Young Emil Haury | author=Thompson, Raymond H. | journal=Journal of the Southwest | year=2004 | volume=46 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible creator===
A local news article identified Timotéo Odohui as the possible creator of the items. Odohui was a Mexican boy who lived near the site and was a sculptor. The article mentions his possible connection to the site and his ability to craft lead objects. Bent wrote that a craftsman in the area had recalled the boy, his love for sculpture of soft metals and his collection of books on foreign languages, and told the excavators this.&lt;ref name=Erickson /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Cold Trail"&gt;Stevens, Kristina (1990) "A Cold Trail," ''Zocalo Magazine'', Tucson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[H. P. Lovecraft]] alludes to the Tucson artifacts in "[[The Mound (short story)|The Mound]]," a short story ghost-written for [[Zealia Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. P. Lovecraft]]. "[[The Mound (short story)|The Mound]]". ([[wikisource:The_Mound/full|Wikisource]]) {{quote|The manuscript’s age looked appallingly genuine ... It must be a shocking hoax ... Surely this was the clever forgery of some learned cynic — something like the leaden crosses in New Mexico, which a jester once planted and pretended to discover as a relique of some forgotten Dark Age colony from Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist and Lovecraft scholar Marc A. Beherec argues that the items influenced some of Lovecraft's other writings.&lt;ref name="A Cold Trail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovecraft Roman Arizona"&gt;Beherec, Marc A.  2008.  "H. P. Lovecraft and the Archaeology of 'Roman' Arizona." ''Lovecraft Annual'' 2: 192-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tucson artifacts were featured on [[The History Channel]] show ''[[America Unearthed]]'' in the episode titled "The Desert Cross," on February 22, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/america-unearthed/season-1/episode-10 |work=America Unearthed |title=The Desert Cross |publisher=the History Channel |accessdate=December 16, 2016 |format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This episode was criticised for its methodology, its ignorance (or deliberate omission) of the complete text on the crosses, and its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/review-of-america-unearthed-s01e10-the-desert-cross |first1=Jason |last1=Colavito |title=Review of America Unearthed S01E10 "The Desert Cross" |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuyet Nguyet''' ("Snow Moon") is the Vietnamese publisher, editor and founder of ''[[Arts of Asia]]'' magazine which has been published continuously since 1970. Nguyet conceived of the magazine after her brother was killed in the Vietnam War in 1969.

==Early life==
Nguyet was born in [[Tan An]] province, Vietnam, near the [[Mekong River]] in the south of the country. Her name means "Snow Moon" in English. Nguyet's father had attended university in Paris and graduated with a degree in [[agronomy]]. He was responsible for the introduction of fertilisers on the French model into Vietnamese rice farming. Her mother was a school teacher.&lt;ref name=sheaf&gt;[http://images1.bonhams.com/original?src=Images/live/2014-08/29/S-22319-0-1.pdf "The Markbreiter Collection"] by Colin Sheaf in ''Art of Asia from the Tuyet Nguyet and Stephen Markbreiter Collection'', Bonhams, Hong Kong, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyet was educated at the [[Marie Curie High School|Lycee Maris Curie]] in Saigon. In 1955, she was awarded a scholarship to study Journalism at the [[Mundelein College]] in Chicago. She received her B.A. in journalism in 1958.&lt;ref name=sheaf/&gt;

==Marriage &amp; Hong Kong==
In 1959, Nguyet married [[Stephen Markbreiter]] (deceased), an English architect, and moved to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=nguyet&gt;[http://images1.bonhams.com/original?src=Images/live/2014-08/29/S-22319-0-1.pdf "A Valedictory Editorial"] by Tuyet Nguyet Markbreiter in ''Art of Asia from the Tuyet Nguyet and Stephen Markbreiter Collection'', Bonhams, Hong Kong, 2014, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four sons between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt;

In Hong Kong, Nguyet developed her journalistic skills while writing for ''Asia Magazine'' (the Sunday magazine for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''), the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', ''[[Agence France Presse]]'', and ''[[Modern Asia]]''.&lt;ref name=sheaf/&gt;

==Asian arts==
In 1969, after her brother was killed in the [[Vietnam War]], Nguyet began to plan a magazine about Asian arts and a preview edition of ''Arts of Asia'' magazine was published in 1970&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt; with the first regular edition appearing in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/about/about.php About us.] Arts of Asia. Retrieved 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/publications/20100308.pdf "Arts of Asia Magazine 40th Anniversary Celebrations"] ''The Standard'', 8 March 2010, p. 1. [https://www.webcitation.org/6bNAkrUwq Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the magazine, Nguyet sought to combine authoritative content from experts with detailed coverage of the Asian art market. Since its establishment the magazine has chronicled, through its saleroom reports and articles on collections and collectors, the expanding market for Asian art in Hong Kong. The executive editor of the magazine is Nguyet's son, [[Robin Markbreiter]].&lt;ref name=bridge&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/publications/20060526.pdf "Arts of Asia Magazine"] Sponsored feature. Vicki Williams, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 24 May 2006, p. A13. [https://www.webcitation.org/6bN9tVdrr Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Nguyet helped to set up a vetting committee for the Asia International Arts &amp; Antiques Fair (AIAA 2006) at the [[AsiaWorld-Expo]] in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt;

==Art collection==
The Nguyet-Markbreiters formed an art collection from the early 1970s which was particularly strong in paintings on glass and mirrors. Parts of the collection were sold by Bonhams in Hong Kong in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22319/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commander-in-Chief_Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China_(Beiyang_Government).svg|thumb|Commander-in-Chief Flag of the Republic of China, 1912-1928]]
The '''Twelve Symbols national emblem''' ({{zh|t=十二章國徽|p=Shí'èr zhāng Guóhuī}}) was the state emblem of the [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Chinese Empire]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Chinese Republic]] from 1913 to 1928. It was based on the ancient Chinese symbols of the [[Twelve Ornaments]].

== History ==
The Empire of China during the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] did not have an official state emblem, but the flag featured the [[azure dragon]] on a plain yellow field with a red sun of the [[three-legged crow]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} in the upper left corner. It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the [[Flag of the Qing dynasty|Yellow Dragon Flag]].

Following the end of Manchu rule, new national symbols were deemed necessary by the leaders to represent the changed circumstances. The renowned writers [[Lu Xun]], [[Qian Daosun]], and [[Xu Shoushang]] from the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] were tasked with designing a new national emblem. It was presented on August 28, 1912 and was adopted as national emblem in February 1913. President-Emperor [[Yuan Shikai]] continued its use during his short imperial reign from 1915 to 1916.

Coins issued during this time feature the emblem.&lt;ref&gt;http://coin007.com/bbs/read.php?tid=34187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://home.netvigator.com/~ykleungn/phoenix.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of the emblem was shown on orders and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guokr.com/blog/151573/?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northern Expedition]] led by General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] party led to the overthrow of the fractious but legitimate [[Beiyang government]] in 1928. This ushered in a [[one-party state]] under the Kuomintang known as the [[Nanjing decade]]. The state emblem was therefore replaced with the Kuomintang party symbol [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]].

== Design ==

[[File:Douze emblemes des rites memoires historiques V3c23 204.PNG|thumb|]]
The emblem is based on the ancient symbols of the [[Twelve Ornaments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.douban.com/note/122173887/ Description of proposed national emblem to the state council] - [[Lu Xun]], February 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

These are first mentioned as already ancient in the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' by [[Emperor Shun]], who was one of the legendary [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. Oral tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 and 2184 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A.S |last=Williams|date=2001 |title=Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs |edition=4th |publisher=[[Tuttle Publishing]] |isbn=0-8048-3704-X |pages=386 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book, the emperor wished for the symbols to be used on official robes of the state.

The symbols were considered most auspicious and therefore as a set were reserved only for the emperor to be shown on his ceremonial robes.{{sfnp|Williams|2001|p=387}}

The national emblem arranges these symbols in such a way to reflect the order of [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] in western [[heraldry]].

== Symbols ==
*The [[dexter and sinister|supporter sinister]] is a dragon, which symbolizes strength and adaptability. The [[azure dragon]] already featured on the national flag during the preceding Qing dynasty. 
*On the back of the dragon is fire, which symbolises light and brightness. 
*Behind the head of the dragon is the crescent [[moon]] of the [[moon rabbit]] who is constantly pounding the [[elixir of life]].
*The [[dexter and sinister|supporter dexter]] is a ''[[fenghuang]]'', or pheasant-phoenix, and represents peace and refinement.
*The phoenix holds [[pondweed]] or algae in its right talon, a symbol of purity and brightness.
*Behind its head are three stars, which could be the ''[[Fu Lu Shou]]'' stars, which symbolise happiness, prosperity and longevity. 
*Both creatures hold in one of each claws the ''zongyi'' ({{zh|宗彝}}), which is a sacrificial cup, symbolising devotion and loyalty.

The dragon and phoenix represent the natural world. In [[yin and yang]] terminology, a dragon is male ''yang'' and the phoenix a female ''yin''. Therefore, the emperor was often identified as the dragon, while the empress was the phoenix. The inclusion of the phoenix into the national symbol, opposite but equal to the dragon, can be seen as a symbol of women being equal to men, and a visual and poignant representation of women's rights in the new China.

*Featuring as the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] on top is an abstract symbol of the [[sun]] of the [[three-legged crow]].
*In the middle functioning as the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is the [[axe]] head, which symbolises courage and resolution, but also executive justice. The blade of the axe head is pointing downwards, the head is shaped like a sloping mountain.
*Overlaid on the axe head are grains of rice, which symbolise nourishment and the country's agriculture. It can also be seen as a symbol of the concept of a [[moderately prosperous society]].
*In the center of the axe head framed by a [[pentagon]] is a simplified symbol of a rice [[Ear (botany)|ear]], which again stresses the importance of agriculture as the basis of the country's wealth and prosperity. The shape on the emblem is based on a carved stone dating to the [[Han dynasty]].
*The downward-pointing blade of the axe head features a [[differential heat treatment|hardened edge]] in shape of the four [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred mountains]]. These represent tranquility and steadiness. The fifth Center Great Mountain is represented by the axe head.

The mountains represent earth, the cups metal, the pondweed water, the rice grains wood, and fire, which are all representations of ''[[wu xing]]''.

*The figure 亞 ''fu'' underneath the axe represents two animals with their backside together. This symbolises the capability to make a clear distinction between right and wrong.
*The ''fu'' sign is in the middle of complex interlacing ribbons, which connect the dragon, the phoenix and the axe to each other. The ribbons could symbolise [[Great Unity]] and [[Harmonious Society]].

'''''Twin Mirror''''' is an upcoming episodic [[adventure game]] developed by [[Dontnod Entertainment]] and published by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]], releasing in 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].

==Gameplay==
''Twin Mirror'' is an [[adventure game]] played from a [[third-person view]].&lt;ref name="Oloman-Jun2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siliconera-Jul2018" /&gt; Players control the investigative journalist Sam, who has returned to his hometown of Basswood, [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="BandaiNamcoEntertainment-Jun2018" /&gt; The environment is interactive and its objects are obtainable.&lt;ref name="IGN-Aug2018" /&gt; Whom Sam speaks to is optional and, based on the state of his investigation, there are multiple endings to unlock.&lt;ref name="Siliconera-Jul2018" /&gt; Players navigate between the real world and Sam's "[[Mind Palace]]" to discover clues. Sam's inner voice, the Double, may aid or harm the investigation.&lt;ref name="Romano-Aug2018" /&gt;

==Development==
Partnering with publisher [[Bandai Namco]], [[Dontnod Entertainment]] began developing ''Twin Mirror'' in 2016 with a separate team of senior developers.&lt;ref name="Byrne-Aug2017" /&gt; About forty people were working on it as of September 2018.&lt;ref name="Metro-Sep2018" /&gt; Lead writer Matthew Ritter was influenced by adventure games like ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'' and ''[[Space Quest]]''.&lt;ref name="DONTNOD-Aug2018-B" /&gt; Contrary to previous titles, Dontnod desired to have ''Twin Mirror'' be void of any supernatural elements.&lt;ref name="Metro-Sep2018" /&gt; According to art director Pierre-Etienne Travers, the game's primary concept is [[Mind–body dualism|duality]].&lt;ref name="Smith-Oct2018" /&gt; The decision to set it in a fictional American town, based on southern [[West Virginia]], was to broaden its appeal.&lt;ref name="Byrne-Aug2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Oct2018" /&gt;

==Release==
''Twin Mirror'' was announced with a debut trailer in June 2018, set to be released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] the following year.&lt;ref name="McWhertor-Jun2018" /&gt; It was later revealed that it would be an episodic title, with ''Lost on Arrival'' as the first of three.&lt;ref name="Barker-Aug2018" /&gt;

'''''Vendetta''''' is a 1989 [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] released by [[Studio 3|System 3]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].  

== Plot ==
A group of terrorists have kidnapped a professor working on a bomb as well as his daughter. A few weeks later, they have started to make impossible demands and have threatened to detonate a miniature nuclear weapon if the demands are not met. 

The protagonist, initially armed with only a knife, decides to rescue both individuals.  Along the way, he collects other weapons and evidence to convince other police officers to let him continue his work, as he heads to an army base, a booby-trapped airplane, and finally central park where the terrorists make the last stand.  

== Development ==
''Vendetta'' was based on the same rendering method and display used by ''[[The Last Ninja]]'', but used a rewritten engine. This game engine was then used for the game ''[[Last Ninja 3]]''.&lt;ref name="ln-lemon64"&gt;[http://lastninja.lemon64.com/updates_old.php Last Ninja fan page], "The Vendetta engine was written from scratch and then used as the basis for LN3."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acclaim ==
Vendetta received 93% from ''[[Zzap!64]]''.&lt;ref name="zzap"&gt;[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=058&amp;page=016&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1 ZZap 64 Issue February 1990, page 016]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">In the broadest sense of the word, a '''vocable''' is any meaningful sound uttered by people, such as a word or term, that is fixed by their language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|vocable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Saussure''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, use in the broad sense is archaic.  The term is currently used for utterances which are not considered [[word]]s, such as the English vocables of assent and denial, ''uh-huh'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|h|ʌ}} and ''uh-uh'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʔ|ə}}, or the vocable of error, ''uh-oh'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʔ|oʊ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi (2004) ''A Basic Course in Anthropological Linguistics''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such non-lexical vocables are often [[Non-lexical vocables in music|used in music]], for example ''la la la'' or ''dum dee dum'', or in magical incantations, such as ''abra-cadabra''.  Many [[Native American music|Native American songs]] consist entirely of vocables; this may be due to both phonetic substitution to increase the [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the song, and to the trade of songs between nations speaking different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Golla (2011) ''California Indian Languages'', §4.12.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocables are common as [[pause filler]]s, such as ''um'' and ''er'' in English, where they have little formal meaning and are rarely purposeful.  

[[Pseudoword]]s that mimic the structure of real words are used in experiments in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]], for example the [[nonsense syllable]]s introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]].

The [[Babbling|proto-word]]s of infants, which are meaningful but do not correspond to words of adult speech, are also sometimes called vocables.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (2008) ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welsh art''' refers to the traditions in the [[visual arts]] associated with [[Wales]] and [[Welsh people|its people]]. Most art found in, or connected with, Wales is essentially a regional variant of the forms and styles of the rest of the [[British Isles]], a very different situation from that of [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh literature]]. The term '''Art in Wales''' is often used in the absence of a clear sense of what "Welsh art" is, and to include the very large body of work, especially in [[landscape art]], produced by non-Welsh artists in Wales (or with a Welsh subject) since the later 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Houseley explores the lack of a clear sense of "Welsh art" among contemporary artists and in Wales generally. See also Morgan, 371–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:British Museum gold thing 501594 fh000035.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The gold [[Mold Cape]], [[Bronze Age]], 1900–1600 BC]] 
[[Prehistoric Wales]] has left a number of significant finds: [[Kendrick's Cave]], [[Llandudno]] contained the [[Kendrick's Cave Decorated Horse Jaw]], "a decorated horse jaw which is not only the oldest known work of art from Wales but also unique among finds of [[Ice Age art]] from Europe", and is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick's Cave [https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/touring_exhibitions_and_loans/sharing_the_treasures.aspx BM touring exhibition], [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/d/decorated_horse_jaw.aspx BM Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 "faint scratchings of a speared reindeer" were found on a cave wall on the [[Gower peninsula]] which probably date to 12,000–14,000 BC, placing them among the earliest art found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-14272126 "Carving found in Gower cave could be oldest rock art"], BBC News online, South-West Wales, July 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mold Gold Cape]], also in the British Museum, and [[Banc Ty'nddôl sun-disc]] in the [[National Museum of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]] are likewise some of the most important British works of art from the [[Bronze Age]]. 
  
Many works of [[Iron Age]] [[Celtic art]] have been found in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1938/ | title=Celtic Art in Iron Age Wales| work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=3 May 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the finds from the period shortly before and after the Roman conquest, which reached Wales in AD 74-8, are especially significant. Pieces of metalwork from [[Llyn Cerrig Bach]] on [[Anglesey]] and other sites exemplify the final stages of [[La Tène style]] in the British Isles, and the [[Capel Garmon Firedog]] is a spectacular luxury piece of [[ironwork]], among the finest in Europe from the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1940/ | title=Stunning ironwork firedog uncovered in farmers field | work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=4 May 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abergavenny Leopard Cup]], from the decades after the conquest, was found in 2003, and shows the presence of imported Roman luxury products in Wales, perhaps belonging to a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1951/ | title=Exquisite Roman treasure gives up its secrets | work=National Museum of Wales | author= | date=9 September 2007 | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricemarch Psalter, Psalm 1.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Ricemarch Psalter]], c. 1080, the start of Psalm 1:"Beatus vir..."]]

In the [[Early Medieval]] period, the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Wales participated in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles and a number of [[illuminated manuscript]]s [[:Category:Illuminated manuscripts of Welsh origin|possibly of Welsh origin]] survive, of which the 8th century [[Hereford Gospels]] and [[Lichfield Gospels]] are the most notable.  The 11th century [[Ricemarch Psalter]] (now in [[Dublin]]) is certainly Welsh, made in [[St David's]], and shows a late Insular style with unusual [[Viking]] influence, which is also seen in surviving pieces of metalwork of that period.

There are only fragments of the architecture of the period remaining.  Unlike Irish [[high cross]] and [[Pictish stones]], early Welsh standing stones mainly employ geometric patterns and words, rather than figure representation; however, 10th century stones represent Christ and various saints.  Little metalwork survives from the early period of the 5th–9th centuries in Wales. However, archaeological sites at Dinas Powys have revealed various artifacts such as [[penannular brooch]]es and other pieces of jewellery. Similar brooches have been discovered a site at Penycorddyn-mawr, near [[Abergele]], dating to the 8th century. During this period, the construction of [[Holy well]]s was also particularly commonplace in Wales.

Wales has rarely been very prosperous, and the most striking medieval architecture is military, often built by the Normans and English, especially the famous "[[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]]" and [[Beaumaris Castle]] in [[Anglesey]], recognised as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, [[Caerphilly Castle]] and the castles of the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the Great (such as [[Criccieth Castle]] and [[Dolbadarn Castle]]). There are a number of impressive [[List of abbeys and priories in Wales|monastic ruins]]; Welsh medieval churches are nearly all relatively modest, including the cathedrals.  They very often had wall-paintings, panel altarpieces and much other religious art, but as in the rest of Britain very little has survived.  [[Conwy]], an English garrison town with its medieval walls almost entirely intact, has a notable example of a 13th-century medieval stone town-house.

==The Renaissance in Wales==
[[Peter Lord (art historian)|Peter Lord]] suggests that the Renaissance began in Wales around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Art-historian-Peter-Lord-talks-new-book-Tradition/story-28873873-detail/story.html "Art historian Peter Lord talks The Tradition: A New History of Welsh Art: "It's a book for everyone" ", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 7 March 2016]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the art produced in this period was created in or for the church. [[Strata Florida Abbey]], for example, retains some of its medieval decorated tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/strata-florida-abbey/?lang=en|title=Strata Florida Abbey|website=Cadw|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread destruction that took place during the Reformation and later the Commonwealth, a number of Welsh churches retain fragments of medieval [[stained glass]].  These include [[All Saints' Church, Gresford]], St Michael's Church, [[Caerwys]], St Mary's Church, [[Treuddyn]], St Elidan's Church, [[Llanelidan]], Church of St Mary &amp; St Nicholas, [[Beaumaris]], St Gwyddelan's Church, [[Dolwyddelan]], and [[St David's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stainedglass.llgc.org.uk/main.php?func=nextpage&amp;terms=&amp;page=3|title=Medieval fragments|website=Stained Glass in Wales|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteenth-century wall paintings have been uncovered in several Welsh church buildings, including St Cadoc's Church, [[Llancarfan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25214557 "Welsh church uncovers stunning medieval wall paintings", BBC News, 6 December 2013].

The latter, during its reconstruction at [[St Fagans National History Museum]] during the 1990s, was found to contain wall paintings from several different periods, the earliest estimated as being from the first half of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/medieval-wall-paintings/medieval-wall-paintings.htm Tom Organ, "Reconstructing Medieval Wall Paintings at St Teilo's", www.building.conservation.com].

[[Plas Mawr]], a grand Elizabethan town-house in Conwy, built by [[Robert Wynn (MP)|Robert Wynn]], a local man who had been English ambassador to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], has been extensively restored by [[Cadw]], both inside and out, to reflect its appearance when built in the second half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/plasmawr/?lang=en Cadw: Plas Mawr]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Wales has numerous country houses from all periods after the Elizabethan, many still containing good portraits, but these were mostly painted in London or on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/galleries/faces/ "Faces of Wales" from the National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture==
Within Wales, [[portraiture]] is not common in the medieval and post-medieval periods, and the Welsh nobility and gentry usually went to London or other English centres to have their portraits painted; many of these remain in Welsh collections. [[Katheryn of Berain]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/articles/2011-10-10/Katheryn-of-Berain/ National Museum of Wales: Katheryn of Berain]. Accessed 2 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed Tudor ancestry and earned the nickname "Mam Gymru" ("Mother of Wales") because of her network of relationships and descendants from four marriages, was painted by [[Adriaen van Cronenburgh]], a Dutch painter.  The portrait was commissioned by her husband, Sir [[Richard Clough]], a merchant whose business caused the couple to settle briefly in Antwerp. Clough himself died before he could bring his wife to the new house he had built for her.  Plas Clough, near his home town of Denbigh, includes a Flemish-style crow-stepped gable&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-1064-plas-clough-denbigh#.VwFSNnarSM8 British Listed Buildings: Plas Clough, Denbigh]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms of the Holy Sepulchre (Clough had been made a [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]] earlier in his career) are painted on a plaque, but there are no surviving contemporary portraits of Clough himself.

[[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (died 1570)]], was one of the first Welsh nobles known to have collected paintings on a large scale.  A portrait of him, dating from the 1560s, is held by the [[National Museum of Wales]]; it is attributed to [[Steven van Harwijck]], another Dutch artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=9 National Museum of Wales - William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke]. Accessed 3 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, artisan painters such as [[William Roos]] and [[Hugh Hughes (painter)|Hugh Hughes]] began to seek portrait commissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llgc.org.uk/collections/learn-more/portraits/paintings-and-drawings/ National Library of Wales: Paintings and Drawings].

[[File:Richard Wilson - Snowdon from Llyn Nantlle - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Snowdon]] from [[Llyn Nantlle Uchaf|Llyn Nantlle]]'', [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], c. 1766]]
The best of the few Welsh artists of the 16th to 18th centuries tended to move elsewhere to work, but in the 18th century the dominance of [[landscape art]] in [[English art]] brought them motives to stay at home, and brought an influx of artists from outside to paint Welsh scenery, which was "discovered" by artists rather earlier than later landscape hotspots like the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]].  The Welsh painter [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] (1714–1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist, but rather more notable for Italian scenes than Welsh ones, although he did paint several on visits from London.

Wilson's  pupil [[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]] (1742–1803), has a rather higher status today than in his own time, but mainly for his city scenes painted in Italy, though his ''The Bard'' (1774, Cardiff) is a classic work showing the emerging combination of the [[Celtic Revival]] and [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ac.uk/en/2261/ NMOW, Welsh Artists of the 18th Century].  Though mainly known as a portraitist, [[John Downman]], born and died in Wales, is also noted for unusually realistic Italian townscape studies, and some Welsh landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to live in Wales on inheriting the family estate, but largely stopped painting.  For most visiting artists the main attraction was dramatic mountain scenery, in the new taste for the [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] partly stimulated by [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757), though some earlier works were painted in Wales in this strain.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 52–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Early works tended to see the Welsh mountains through the prism of the 17th century Italianate "wild" landscapes of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Gaspard Dughet]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:A Welsh Sunset River Landscape by Paul Sandby, RA.jpg|thumb|''A Welsh Sunset River Landscape'' by [[Paul Sandby]], showing rather better weather than most "sublime" landscapes]]

By the 1770s a number of guide books had been published, including Joseph Cradock's ''Letters from Snowdon'' (1770) and ''An Account of Some of the Most Romantic Parts of North Wales'' (1777).  [[Thomas Pennant]] wrote ''Tour in Wales'' (1778) and ''Journey to [[Snowdon]]'' (1781/1783); though Welsh himself, Pennant had published a ''Tour in Scotland'' first, in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 61&lt;/ref&gt;  The first of a series of British tours by another leading promoter of the picturesque, [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]], was ''Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the year 1770'', but not published until 1782.  [[Paul Sandby]] made his first recorded visit to [[Wales]] in 1770, later (1773) touring south Wales with Sir [[Joseph Banks]], resulting in the 1775 publication of ''XII Views in South Wales'' and a further 12 views the following year, part of a 48-plate series of [[aquatint]]s of Welsh views commissioned by Banks. This was an early example of many print series and illustrated books on Wales, often as valuable in terms of income to the artists as original works.

What might fifty years earlier have been merely regarded as inconvenience in travel could now been seen as an exciting adventure worth making the subject of a painting, as in [[Julius Caesar Ibbetson]]'s ''[[Phaeton (carriage)|Phaeton]] in a Thunderstorm'' (1798, now [[Temple Newsam]], Leeds) which shows a carriage struggling up a rough mountain road. It has a label on the back by the artist, recording that the incident occurred when he was travelling in Wales with the artist [[John "Warwick" Smith]] and the aristocrat [[Robert Fulke Greville]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, 52 &amp; 54. [http://www.artchive.com/web_gallery/reproductions//235001-235500/235144/size1.jpg Image of ''[[Phaeton (carriage)|Phaeton]] in a Thunderstorm'']&lt;/ref&gt; Ibbetson visited Wales often, and was also one of the first artists to record the Welsh [[Industrial Revolution]], and scenes of Welsh life.

North Wales tended to be more visited; the young [[watercolour]]ist [[John Sell Cotman]] embarked on his "first extended sketching tour" in 1800, starting from Bristol then following "a well-trodden path into the [[Wye Valley]], through [[Brecknockshire]] to [[Llandovery]] and north to [[Aberystwyth]]. In Conway he joined a group of artists gathered around the amateur [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]]" perhaps meeting [[Thomas Girtin]] there, and continuing to [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]] and [[Llangollen]]. A second trip followed in 1802; he continued to use motifs from his sketches throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Holcomb, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists often in Wales in this period included [[Francis Towne]], the brothers [[Cornelius Varley|Cornelius]] and [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] and John's pupils [[Copley Fielding]] and David Cox (for whose lifelong attachment to Wales see below). Even the caricaturist [[Thomas Rowlandson]] visited with [[Henry Wigstead]], a colleague, and they published ''Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales, in the Year 1797'', an illustrated book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/remarksonatourt00wigsgoog|title=Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales: In the Year 1797|first=Henry|last=Wigstead|year=1800|publisher= W. Wigstead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=24221 |title=Rowlandson, Thomas|first=John|last=Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic War]]s made continental travel impossible for long periods, increasing the visitors to Wales and other parts of Britain. The young [[J. M. W. Turner]] made his first extended tour to South and mid-Wales in 1792, followed by North Wales in 1794, and a seven-week tour of Wales in 1798.  He also visited Yorkshire and Scotland in the 1790s, but was unable to visit Europe until after the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, when he reached the [[Alps]]; he did not visit Italy until 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton &amp; Lyles, 326-7&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his key early works drew on his Welsh travels, although they were painted back in London. His "first large classicising watercolour, a [[Claude Lorrain|Claudeian]] view of [[Caernarvon Castle]] at sunset" was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1799, along with an oil of the same subject, and the next year he showed another view of the castle, this time with small foreground figures of "a [[bard]] singing to his followers of the destruction of Welsh civilization by the invading armies of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]", another Claudeian formula that he was to repeat many times in major works for the rest of his career, and was arguably the first large "exhibition watercolour", reaching into the realm of [[history painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilton &amp; Lyles,pp. 176 &amp; 260.

[[File:Cox - A WELSH FUNERAL.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], ''A Welsh Funeral'', c. 1850]]
It remained difficult for artists relying on the Welsh market to support themselves until well into the 20th century. The 1851 census records only 136 people describing their occupation as "artist" out of a population of 945,000, with a further 50 engaged in [[fine arts]]-related occupations such as [[engraving]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, John, ''The art of piety: the visual culture of Welsh Nonconformity'', p.75, University of Wales Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7083-1298-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Act of Parliament]] in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff|Cardiff School of Art]] opened in 1865.  Prior to that the annual report for 1855 of the government [[Science and Art Department]] shows a list of the larger type of Art School in many British cities, but none in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;1855, Table p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Under a recently introduced new system "Local Schools of Art" had been established in 1853 in [[Llanelly]] and [[Merthyr]], but had already closed; those in [[Swansea]] and [[Carmarthen]] continued, and [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] had applied to establish a school. There were "Drawing Schools" in [[Aberdare]] and  [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], but apparently nothing at all in Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;1855, Appendix A, pp. 21–26&lt;/ref&gt; However all these pre-1857 schools, except perhaps Swansea, were mainly teaching school age children, usually in their normal schools, and training in industrial design or teacher-training under the elementary stages of the "[[South Kensington system]]".&lt;ref&gt;1855, pp. xxii–xxx&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Mansel Lewis - Snowdonia.jpg|thumb|Mansel Lewis, ''[[Snowdonia]]'']]

Graduates of the new fine arts Welsh colleges still very often had to leave Wales to work.  Established artists continued to move in the opposite direction, at least for the summer. [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]] was an English 19th century landscapist who spent much time in Wales, for many years spending the summer based in [[Betws-y-Coed]], a popular centre for artists, including the English [[Henry Clarence Whaite]] and the German [[Hubert von Herkomer]], one of whose wives was Welsh.  Landscape continued to be the main focus, although the Welsh artist [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mansel_Lewis Charles William Mansel Lewis] was among those who painted common working people, with varying measures of realism or picturesqueness. The "Betws-y-Coed artist's colony" was one of the groups forming the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]] in 1881; this was always a group for exhibiting rather than a teaching institution, based in Conwy, until 1994 in Plas Mawr (see above).[[File:Walescw.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Deffroad Cymru, the Awakening of Wales'' (1911), by [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1873–1934)]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcaconwy.org/our_history-5.aspx Royal Cambrian Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptors [[John Evan Thomas (Welsh sculptor)|John Evan Thomas]] (1810–1873) and Sir William [[Goscombe John]] (1860–1952) made many works for Welsh commissions, although they had settled in London. Even [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1873–1934), whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was based in London. [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (1886–1966) and [[Andrew Vicari]] (b. 1938) had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France.  Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] was Welsh by origin, but spent little time in Wales.

Perhaps the most famous Welsh-born painters were [[Augustus John]] and his sister [[Gwen John]], though they mostly lived in London and Paris; however the landscapists Sir [[Kyffin Williams]] (1918–2006) and [[Peter Prendergast (artist)|Peter Prendergast]] (1946–2007) remained living in Wales for most of their lives, though well in touch with the wider art world. [[Ceri Richards]] was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff, and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including [[Surrealism]]. Various artists have moved to Wales, usually the countryside, though paintings of [[Cardiff]] of around 1893–97 by the American artist [[Lionel Walden]] are in museums in Cardiff and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1860 National Museum of Wales, Walden]&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Eric Gill]], whose colony included for his most artistically productive period (1924–1927) the London-born Welshman [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], and the sculptor [[Jonah Jones (sculptor)|Jonah Jones]]. [[The Kardomah Gang]] was an intellectual circle centred on the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and poet and artist [[Vernon Watkins]] in Swansea, which also included the painter [[Alfred Janes]]; the eponymous cafe was destroyed by a German bomb in 1941.

The situation gradually improved after World War II, with the appearance of new art groups. ''The South Wales Group'' was established in 1948 (and continues today as [[The Welsh Group]] with membership from across Wales).&lt;ref name="The Welsh Group"&gt;[http://www.thewelshgroup-art.com/#!about-amdanom/ciaa] The Welsh Group website.

In 1956 when the ''South Wales Group'' failed to become a southern Academy, the [[56 Group Wales]] also emerged,&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=50+Years+of+the+Welsh+Group.+Peter+Wakelin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IF8vUcqiBoe50QWNxYDQCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA “50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of promoting modern Welsh art beyond Wales' borders.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Arthur+Giardelli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFpTT5i_EKOA0AXpzLDpCw&amp;ved=0CF8QuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Giardelli&amp;f=false "50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), pp. 39–43, {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in the industrial valleys the [[Dowlais]] Settlement, delivering art classes and activities was established in the 1940s by artists including [[Heinz Koppel]] and [[Arthur Giardelli]] and the [[Rhondda Group]] was formed in the 1950s, a loose group of art students whose most notable member was [[Ernest Zobole]], whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the juxtaposition of the industrialised buildings of the valleys set against the green hills that surround them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ernest-zobole/ | title=Walesart, Ernest Zobole | work=BBC Wales online | author= | date=  | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1970s, Paul Davies formed [[Beca (artist group)|Beca]], a radical Welsh group whose founding was in part a reaction to the drowning of [[Capel Celyn]].&lt;ref name="ArtinWales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artcornwall.org/features/Iwan_Bala_Art_in_Wales.htm | title=Art in Wales: Politics of Engagement or Engagement with Politics? | work=artcornwall.org | author= | date= | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beca used a mixture of artistic expression, including installation, painting, sculpture and performance, engaging with language, environmental and land rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2008) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorative arts==

South Wales had several notable potteries in the late 18th and 19th centuries, beginning with the [[Cambrian Pottery]] (1764–1870, also known as "[[Swansea]] pottery") and including [[Nantgarw Pottery]] near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine [[porcelain]], and then utilitarian pottery until 1920.  [[Portmeirion Pottery]] (from 1961) has never in fact been made in Wales.

Despite the fact that considerable quantities of [[silver]] (in association with [[lead]]), and much smaller amounts of [[gold]], were mined in Wales, there was little silversmithing in Wales in the Early Modern period.  It did not help that the Crown gave itself ownership of mines of [[precious metal]]s, which were largely used for minting currency, some of which was marked with the [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] to show its origin.  The Welsh gentry mostly had their silver made in English cities.

==Contemporary Welsh Art==
Today Welsh and Wales based artists, including members of [[The Welsh Group]], the [[56 Group Wales]], the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy]]  and artists not affiliated with any particular group, provide a varied [[contemporary art|contemporary]] tapestry of art across Wales. From the [[Abstract Art]] of Brendan Stuart Burns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.wales/arts-in-wales/inspire/make/creative-wales/creative-wales-archive/awards-2013-14/brendan-stuart-burns |title=Brendan Stuart Burns |work=Arts Council in Wales |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Martyn Jones (painter)|Martyn Jones]], to the expressive, modern figurative art of [[Shani Rhys James]], [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] or Rhŷn Williams, from the politically charged work of [[Iwan Bala]] or [[Ivor Davies (artist)|Ivor Davies]] to the [[Pop Art]] of [[Ken Elias]]. The contemporary art of Wales is noted perhaps more for its variety, rather than having a single set agenda. However, perhaps due to market forces or the inspirational shapes and changing light, the Welsh landscape is still particularly well represented in commercial galleries throughout Wales and beyond, either through the expressive, almost abstract, techniques used by artists like [[David Tress]] or the more traditional approaches used by others like [[Rob Piercy]].

==Conceptual art in Wales==
[[File:B for Defiance by David Garner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|B for Defiance by David Garner]]
Conceptual art is represented in Wales with a number of successful artists including [[Bedwyr Williams]] and [[David Garner (artist)|David Garner]] together with performance artists like the group TRACE,&lt;ref&gt;http://huwdavidjones.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/trace-displaced-gwaithwork/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.performance-wales.org/events/tracedisplaced.html&lt;/ref&gt; creating and showing work in Wales and beyond. A number of Welsh galleries focus on conceptual art, with the most significant perhaps being ''Mostyn''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mostyn.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in north Wales and ''[[Chapter Arts Centre]]'' and ''g|39''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g39.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in south Wales. The Gold Medal at '[[Y Lle Celf]]' in the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] has seen a notable trend towards more conceptual approaches over the last ten or so years, with [[Installation art|Installation work]] being the usual focal point.&lt;ref&gt;http://huwdavidjones.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/art-at-the-national-eisteddfod-of-wales/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 development of the Artes Mundi prize and Wales's presence at the Venice Biennale has strengthened the country's international reputation for [[Conceptual art|Conceptual]] and [[Installation art]].

===Artes Mundi and Wales at the Venice Biennale===

Since 2003 the [[Artes Mundi]] biennial art prize has been held at the [[National Museum Cardiff]]. The prize is the biggest art prize in the [[United Kingdom]] with £40,000 for each year’s winner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/artes-mundi-5-at-national-museum-cardiff&lt;/ref&gt; Though the prize has included artists who use traditional media, like paint, this is usually only part of their practice, with the focus being very much on conceptual approaches. Though the exhibition takes place in Cardiff, the focus is on international artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artesmundi.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walesartsreview.org/artes-mundi-5-national-museum-cardiff/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/artes%20mundi&lt;/ref&gt; with Tim Davies from Pembrokeshire &lt;ref&gt;http://www.artesmundi.org/en/exhibitions-prizes/artes-mundi-one&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cornwall]] born Sue Williams&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/sue-williams/&lt;/ref&gt; being the only Wales based artists to have featured to date.

Also adding to the international flavour in 2003, Wales took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with its own pavilion&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artscouncilofwales.org.uk/artsinwales/venice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/uk-in-venice&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to do so ever since, showing work by conceptual Welsh artists including [[John Cale]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/john-cale&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Davies in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wai.org.uk/news/2235&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bedwyr Williams]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22736582&lt;/ref&gt;
