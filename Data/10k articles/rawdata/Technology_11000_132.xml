The '''40/4 chair''', designed by David Rowland in 1964, is the first compactly stackable chair invented. Forty chairs can be stacked within a height of 4 feet (120&amp;nbsp;cm), hence its name "40 in 4".  It is an all-purpose chair providing large-capacity movable seating, compact economical storage and comfort in sitting for long periods. It is considered a masterpiece of industrial design, and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as other museums internationally.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emery|first1=Sherman|title=The Story of a Chair|journal=Interior Design Magazine|date=June 1964|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landmarks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hiesinger|first1=Kathryn B.|last2=Marcus|first2=George H.|title=Landmarks of the Twentieth-Century Design, An Illustrated Handbook|date=1993|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|isbn=1-55859279-2|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;You Tube video: min.1:22 “40/4 chair liberates living architecture in St. Barnabas Church”.

==Description==
The frame of the chair is made of 7/16” solid steel rod. The seat and back are formed sheet metal with 3/16” rolled edges and coated in vinyl.&lt;ref name="interiors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J.|first1=W.|title=David Rowland’s 40/4 Chair|journal=Interiors Magazine|date=June 1964|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some models substitute wood veneers, plastic resin and upholstery over wood as components.&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.howe.com/us/products/404#thefamily|title=40/4: The Family |publisher=Howe |access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairs can be stacked on specially designed dollies for easy moving and storage.&lt;ref name="interiors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="classics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadmore|first1=Clement|title=The Modern Chair: Classics in Production|date=1975|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.|location=New York|isbn=0442253052|pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty chairs on a single dolly take up 5.1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; /  0.47 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor space. The chairs can also be linked together horizontally to form movable and stackable rows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interiors" /&gt; Linked chairs in rows of two, three or four can be stacked up to 40 chairs high on special double, triple, or quadruple dollies. One hundred sixty chairs on a quadruple dolly take up less than 21.5&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor space.&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite book|title=Howe Collection|last1=Howe a/s|date=2015|publisher=Howe a/s|location=Denmark|pages=11, 14–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2004 Rowland worked with Howe a/s to introduce an expanded family of the 40/4 chair.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:40 4 quad gang stack.jpg|thumb|250x250px|160 chairs on a quadruple dolly|alt=|none]]

==History==
Rowland developed the 40/4 chair over a period of 8 years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In 1963 he was awarded a patent for the chair's design.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Compactly Stackable Chair | issue-date =  March 5, 1963 | patent-number = 3080194 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Compactly Stackable Chair | issue-date =  September 27, 1966 | patent-number = 3275371 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Compactly Stackable Chairs and Chair-Rows | issue-date =  October 11, 1966 | patent-number = 3278227 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Dolly for Stacking Chairs | issue-date =  April 29, 1967 | patent-number = 3338591 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Compactly Stackable Chair | issue-date =  October 8, 1968 | patent-number = 3404916 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last = Rowland | inventor1-first = David | title = Nested Armchair | issue-date =  May 27, 1969 | patent-number = 3446530 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rowland showed the chair to many companies in an effort to license the design.  In 1961, [[Florence Knoll]] licensed the chair for her company, Knoll Associates, however canceled a license after six months.  Rowland later showed the chair to Davis Allen, head of interior design at the architectural firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] (SOM).  Allen requested 17,000 chairs for the a campus SOM was designing for the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  To fulfill the request, Rowland licensed the design to General Fireproofing Co. (GF) in Youngstown, Ohio.&lt;ref name="perspiration"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von|first1=Robinson|title=99% Perspiration|journal=Metropolis|date=December 2004|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uicarchives.library.uic.edu/40-4Chair|title=40/4 Chair |publisher=University Library, University of Illinois at Chicago|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1965, While the first order for was still being produced, 250 chairs were hand assembled and installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City for the opening of its new wing.&lt;ref name="interiors"/&gt;

The 40/4 was an immediate success.&lt;ref name="landmarks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It won the grand prize at the prestigious 13th Milan Triennale,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=August 25, 2010|title=David Rowland, Maker of a Tidily Stacked Chair, Dies at 86|url=|journal=The New York Times|volume=|pages=B12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been included in museum collections and exhibitions internationally.

In the book ''the Modern Chair,'' Clement Meadmore described the chair as having “beautiful simplicity and total appropriateness.”&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt; Twenty five hundred 40/4s were installed in St. Paul’s Cathedral in London in 1973, site of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s wedding,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and remain in use. In 2001 it was named #1 of The Top 10 Commercial Interiors products of the Past 50 Years by Contract Design Magazine.&lt;ref name="top10"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Contract Design Magazine|date=March 2010|page=22|title=The Top 10 Commercial Interiors Products of the Past 50 Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair has been in continuous production since its introduction and has sold over 8 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9393845|title=Design in America : the Cranbrook vision, 1925-1950|last=|first=|date=1983|publisher=Abrams, in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Metropolitan Museum of Art|others=Clark, Robert Judson., Belloli, Andrea P.

General Fireproofing held the license for the chair from 1963 until 2002 when the company was taken over by OSI Furniture LLC.  In 2013, Howe Europe, (now Howe a/s), of Denmark, which had had a sublicense to the chair in Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (except for Indonesia) acquired the license for the 40/4 in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.interiordesign.net/articles/8131-danish-brand-howe-relaunches-in-the-us-market/|title=Danish Brand Howe Relaunches in the U.S. Market|date=2014-01-28|work=Interior Design|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.howe.com/us/file/728/download?token=-eBm9qcm|title=David Rowland - introduction|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2018|website=Howe a/s|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the incorporation of Spain to the [[European Economic Community]], in 1986 AENOR was constituted. Until that date, standardization work was the responsibility of the Institute for Rationalization and Standardization (IRANOR).

=== First steps in standardization ===

In the first year 24 technical standards committees were created. A year later, AENOR assumed the representation of [[Spain]] before the European organizations ([[CENELEC]], [[ETSI]]) and international ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]).

Nowadays, AENOR has more than 200 technical standards committees involving nearly 6,000 experts in the field.

==Design and manufacture==
[[File:Romarinho Ricardo Silva.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Adidas Telstar 18 being used in the [[2017 FIFA Club World Cup#Semi-finals|2017 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final]] between [[Al Jazira Club|Al-Jazira]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].]]
The original Telstar used in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] was the first football to show a black and white pattern. This was done to ensure that television audiences would know where the ball was while games were in operation, due to many televisions at the time sporting a black and white screen ([[colour television]] was still rare in many parts of the world in this era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soccer-FIFA revives the 1970 World Cup ball|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-ball/soccer-fifa-revives-the-1970-world-cup-ball-idUSL8N1NFA1T|accessdate=December 17, 2017|work=Reuters|date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Telstar had 32 panels, the Telstar 18 has six textured panels. They are not stitched, but seamlessly glued together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Telstar 2018 World Cup Ball Released|url=http://www.footyheadlines.com/2017/08/adidas-telstar-18-world-cup-ball.html|website=Footy Headlines|accessdate=December 17, 2017|date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball has an embedded [[near-field communication]] (NFC) [[Integrated circuit|chip]]. However, it is of no value to players, providing no information about their [[Kick (association football)|kicks]] or [[Header (association football)|headers]] of the ball, although Adidas has provided this in a previous football. Consumers who purchase a Telstar 18 are able to connect to the chip using a [[smart phone]] to access content and information that is unique to that ball, personalized and localized, providing the consumer with [[interactivity]] themed on the upcoming World Cup competition.&lt;ref name="manila"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revealed: The Chip Inside The 2018 World Cup Ball is a Completely Unnecessary Gimmick|url=http://www.footyheadlines.com/2017/11/the-chip-inside-the-2018-world-cup-ball-is-a-completely-unnecessary-gimmick.html|website=Footy Headlines|accessdate=December 17, 2017|date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speed Sports manufactured Adidas Telstar 18

==Criticism of performance==
Although Adidas stated that the Telstar 18 was scientifically designed to be predictable in flight and was "the most perfect piece of equipment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Duncan |title=Boffins reckon they have secret to stopping Ronaldo's free-kicks |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/world-cup-2018/6505673/world-cup-2018-ball-adidas-telstar-cristiano-ronaldo/ |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=The Sun |date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; international [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]s including [[Marc-André ter Stegen]], [[Pepe Reina]] and [[David de Gea]] assessed prior to the tournament that the ball changed direction unpredictably and could be slippery due to the smooth coating and lack of seams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Teather |first1=Jamie |title=World Cup ball: Adidas Telstar 18 'a problem for goalkeepers' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/fifa-world-cup-2018-ball-adidas-telstar-18-football-a-problem-for-goalkeepers-a3864336.html |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |work=Evening Standard |date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Price |first1=Steve |title=Why Nike Contract Could Hurt England's Preparations For Russia 2018 World Cup |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2018/03/28/why-nike-contract-could-hurt-englands-preparations-for-russia-2018-world-cup/ |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=28 March 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dani Alves]], [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], was quoted as believing that "Telstar 18 is an absolute joy for those shooting with it, but a nightmare for those who have to second guess its trajectory and try and stop it".&lt;ref name = "Diario AS"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Telstar 18 World Cup ball; Saúl, Parejo and Asensio|date=26 March 2018|accessdate=14 September 2018|publisher=Diario AS|work=en.as.com|url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/26/opinion/1522040647_948336.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joaquín Maroto of ''[[Diario AS]]'', the ball "encourages players to shoot from distance because if the ball is struck well, it fizzes through the air but loses none of its intensity on impact", citing [[Thomas Müller]]'s goal for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] from range in a March 2018 [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref name="Diario AS" /&gt; Criticism of the Telstar 18's instability continued after several long-distance goals in early rounds of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VAR, free-kick crackers make it 'set-piece World Cup' |url=http://www.china.org.cn/sports/2018-06/20/content_52807671.htm |accessdate=June 24, 2018 |work=China.org.cn |date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to news channel [[Russia 24]], this was part of an intentional shift in the balance of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=goalkeepers are unhappy with the ball: World Cup 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymALhN9i0 |website=YouTube |accessdate=17 June 2018 |language=ru |date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further commentary on the ball's performance arose after two balls burst in a first-round [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group C#France vs Australia|game]] between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Australia national football team|Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Telstar 18 balls burst during France - Australia |url=https://za.as.com/za/2018/06/16/football/1529172481_047497.html |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=AS South Africa |date=16 June 2018 |language=en-za}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another ball failed in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group D#Argentina vs Iceland|match]] between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amako |first1=Uche |title=World Cup: Why do the match balls keep bursting?

==Telstar Mechta==
[[File:Adidas Telstar Mechta Ball On the Handover Ceremony of the 2022 FIFA World Cup host mantle.jpg|thumb|right|Telstar Mechta]]
At the end of the 2018 World Cup group stage, FIFA revealed a new design to be used in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]]: the '''Telstar Mechta''' (Мечта). "Mechta" means ''dream'' or ''ambition'' in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite News |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/adidas-football-reveals-official-match-ball-for-the-knockout-stage-of-the-2018-f |title=adidas Football Reveals Official Match Ball for the Knockout Stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia |publisher=2018 FIFA World Cup |date=2018-06-26 |access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] gifted a Telstar Мечта to U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]. The ball, which included the standard chip and transmission devices, incited a political controversy within the U.S. over fears of spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Silver |first=Vernon |date=July 25, 2018 |title=Putin's soccer ball for Trump had transmitter chip, logo indicates |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/putins-soccer-ball-for-trump-had-transmitter-chip-logo-indicates/ |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |via=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Australasian Journal of Educational Technology''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering research in [[educational technology]], [[instructional design]], online and e-learning, educational design, multimedia, computer assisted learning, and related areas.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About AJET |work=Australasian Journal of Educational Technology |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/about/about.html |accessdate=January 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029164158/http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/about/about.html |archivedate=October 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published in 8 issues per year by the [[Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education]] (ASCILITE) as an [[open access]] online-only journal. All previous issues, dating from 1985, are accessible online without charges.

== History ==
The ''Australasian Journal of Educational Technology'' was established as the ''Australian Journal of Educational Technology'' by the Australian Society for Educational Technology (ASET) in 1985, with two issues per year. From 1997-2005, the journal was published jointly by ASCILITE and ASET, and from 2006 by ASCILITE. Publication frequency increased to three issues in 1999, to four issues in 2005, and to six issues in 2010. From 2004, the journal carried a new title containing ''[[Australasia]]n'' instead of ''[[Australia]]n'', in order to align it with its main sponsor, ASCILITE, and to make it more inclusive to authors from nearby countries.&lt;ref name="name change and pub freq"&gt;{{citation|first1=Roger |last1=Atkinson |first2=Cameron |last2=Richards |title=Editorial |journal=AJET |volume=20 |issue=1 |year=2004 |url=http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet20/editorial20-1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074428/http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet20/editorial20-1.html |archivedate=2007-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the journal merged with the ''International Journal of Educational Technology'' ({{ISSN|1327-7308}}),&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Editorial |first1=Roger |last1=Atkinson |first2=Catherine |last2=McLoughlin |journal=AJET |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet23/editorial23-2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831211207/http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet23/editorial23-2.html |archivedate=2007-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an online-only open access peer-reviewed journal that had been sponsored jointly by the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] and that published five issues from 1999 to 2002.&lt;ref name="name change and pub freq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sova |first=Brian Melville |title=Origins of the International Journal of Educational Technology |year=2007 |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/origins.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113031355/http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/origins.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its back issues are available on the website of the merged journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/ IJET archive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903120832/http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/ |date=September 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and copyright in all papers was restored to their original authors as part of the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/merger.html |first1=Roger |last1=Atkinson |first2=Cameron |last2=Richards |year=2007 |title=The merger of AJET and IJET |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113033420/http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/merger.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the journal merged with the ''Journal of Instructional Science and Technology'', whose archives are also available on the merged journal's website.

'''Bamboo bicycles''' are [[Bicycle pedal|pedal-and-chain-driven]], [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]], [[single-track vehicle]]s that have two wheels attached to a bamboo frame. Because of its light weight, vibration damping, and sustainability, bamboo is slowly starting to be used in bicycle frame production, though the industry is still dominated by aluminium frames.

== History ==
Bamboo bikes were first patented in England by the Bamboo Cycle Company and introduced to the general public on 26 April 1894.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Cycle Company|url = http://www.bikebamboo.com/bamboo_cycle_co.php|website = BikeBamboo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US patent was applied for in 1895, by August Oberg and Andrew Gustafson, and granted in 1896. However, with the development of tougher industrial metals, such as steel and aluminium, large-scale usage of bamboo to build bicycles never happened.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042715-212811/unrestricted/MG_Bamboo_Bike_Final_4.28.pdf|title = Management of the Design and Construction of the WPI Bamboo Bicycle|last = Aleles|first = Nicholas|date = 27 April 2015|journal = Worcester Polytechnic Institute Major Qualifying Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|last2 = Collins|first2 = Hayden|publisher = Worcester Polytechnic Institute|others = John Downey, Brodie Green, Amaia Gritsko, Angela Langford, Mitchell Lewis, Samuel Longwell, Lena Pafumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Railway News ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GwY1AQAAIAAJ|date = 1895-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bicycles are a staple of human transportation, in both rural and urbanised areas, bamboo bicycles are not widely used. However, with the advent of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], bamboo is being used again, primarily for high-end racing and [[Track bicycle|touring bicycles]]. Bamboo bikes are entering the market as low cost alternatives to relatively expensive and unsustainable aluminium and metal bikes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Bikes Initiative in Ghana - UN and Climate Change|url = https://www.un.org/climatechange/blog/2014/08/bamboo-bikes-initiative-ghana/|website = UN and Climate Change|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects ==
Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit "knots" and "turns" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bamboo Solution {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|url = http://discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784|work= Discover Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bambus.rwth-aachen.de/eng/PDF-Files/Mechanical%20properties%20of%20bamboo.pdf|title = Mechanical properties of bamboo|last = Rottke|first = Evelin|date = 27 October 2002|journal = RWTH Aachen University Publications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain.

The bamboo poles can be joined in a number of different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members. For modernised track bicycles, carbon fibre is used for the remainder of the parts that are not made of bamboo due to its light weight - for example, the fork, because it is difficult to find a perfect piece of bamboo that fits into the fork socket of the frame.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Projects ==
Bamboo could be used as an alternative to traditional steel and aluminium bikes in many rural areas because of its potential sustainability. 

A "Bamboo Bike Project", started by engineers at [[Columbia University]], created a small number of bamboo bikes from 2007 to 2011. This was done with the intention of providing low cost bikes for Africans in rural areas, and stimulating local bike building industries, without major assistance from outside sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bamboobike.org/Home.html|title = Bamboo Bike Project|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Bamboo Bike Project|publisher = The Earth Institute at Columbia University|last = Mutter|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations and the United States have invested in the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative, which was created by Bernice Dapaah. This business markets itself as addressing climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, rural-urban migration and by creating jobs for women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As of 2015 over 1000 of these bikes had been sold in Ghana, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghana’s bicycle which is creating jobs while it saves the soil|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/ghana-environment-bamboo-bicycles-seed-award|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Corinne|last = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 few bicycles have also been made in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://youth.newagebd.net/2187/made-in-bangladesh-3/|title=Made in Bangladesh - New Age Youth|date=2016-02-28|work=New Age Youth|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The most expensive bamboo bikes cost thousands of dollars. Conversely, the bikes sold in Ghana for the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative have been said to cost about $120, which is significantly more expensive than conventional bicycles.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo bikes have benefits|url = http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Bamboo-bikes-have-benefits-3278264.php|website = SFGate|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cheapest for adults retail at $350 as of 2018, thus the bikes are retailed specifically for the export market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Products – Ghana Bamboo Bikes |url=http://ghanabamboobikes.org/shop/ |accessdate=30 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This variation in cost has two main reasons: the relative wealth of the consumers to whom the bikes are marketed, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in expensive carbon fibre bikes. Modern machines are used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo pieces. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, source most parts (e.g. bamboo, chains, bolts, etc.) from low-cost sources.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Bicycle riding also necessitated more practical clothing for women and led to significant changes to female attire in society.&lt;ref name="vivanco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herlihy" /&gt; This inspired innovations among Victorian female inventors, who were inspired to create cycling-friendly designs like convertible cycling garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019834755|title=Bikes and bloomers : Victorian women inventors and their extraordinary cycle wear|last=Katrina,|first=Jungnickel,|isbn=9781906897758|location=London|oclc=1019834755}}&lt;/ref&gt; One individual from the time period watching female cyclists remarked, "It is hard to believe, that they were the same women who went out in the afternoon for the formal carriage parade."&lt;ref name="herlihy" /&gt;

Bikes in Space is a series of sci-fi books themed around bicycling and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://takingthelane.com/bikes-in-space/|title=Bikes in Space {{!}} Taking the Lane|website=takingthelane.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] wrote that the bicycle was a tool which motivated women to gain strength and take on increased roles in society.&lt;ref name="vivanco" /&gt; [[Susan B. Anthony]] stated in 1896: "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel."&lt;ref name="vivanco" /&gt;

[[Beatrice Grimshaw]], who went on to a life of travel and adventure, describes a girlhood of Victorian propriety, in which she was: "the Revolting Daughter–as they called them then. I bought a bicycle, with difficulty. I rode it unchaperoned, mile and miles beyond the limits possible to the soberly trotting horses. The world opened before me. And as soon as my twenty-first birthday dawned, I went away from home, to see what the world might to give to daughters who revolted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimshaw|first1=Beatrice|title=How I found adventure|url=http://grimshaworigin.org/prominent-grimshaw-individuals/beatrice-grimshaw-south-pacific/#Autobiography|accessdate=6 August 2016|date=April 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century medicine==

An 1895 article in ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' reviewed literature from the time period which discussed the bicycle face, and noted that ''[[The Springfield Republican]]'' warned against excessive cycling by "women, girls, and middle-aged men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Literary Digest]]|date=7 September 1895|page=8 (548)|volume=11|issue=19|title=The 'Bicycle Face'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eqk5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about bicycle face with regard to female cyclists were detailed by [[medical doctor]] A. Shadwell in an 1897 article for the ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' in [[London]] titled "The hidden dangers of cycling".&lt;ref name="shadwell"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://garethrees.org/2012/01/10/shadwell/|title=The hidden dangers of cycling|journal=[[National Review (London)|National Review]]|date=1 February 1897|first=A.|last=Shadwell|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His article was subsequently discussed and analyzed in ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|location=[[Adelaide]]|title=The Intoxicating Bicycle|date=16 March 1897|page=6|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page2324407}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bicycle enthusiasts disagreed with this medical assessment, and asserted that the physical activity was good to improve one's health and vitality.&lt;ref name="herlihy"&gt;{{cite book|pages=270–273|title=Bicycle: The History|first=David V. |last=Herlihy|isbn=978-0300120479|year=2006|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDlaT0KxJfAC&amp;pg=PA272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clostridium beijerinckii''''' is a [[gram positive]], [[bacterium#Morphology|rod shaped]], [[Motility|motile]] [[bacterium]] of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]''. It has been isolated from feces and soil. Produces oval to subterminal spores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/clobe/clobe.home.html Clostridium beijerinckii information] from JGI&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after [[Martinus Beijerinck]] who is a Dutch bacteriologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacterio.net/clostridium.html bacterio.net, list of prokaryotic names with standing nomenclature].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29437">'''Communication in Distributed Software Development''' is an area of study that considers communication processes and their effects when applied to [[software development]] in a globally [[distributed development]] process. The importance of communication and coordination in software development is widely studied &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraut|first=Robert E.|last2=Streeter|first2=Lynn A.|date=1995-03-01|title=Coordination in software development|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA16764439&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=fulltext&amp;issn=00010782&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1&amp;isAnonymousEntry=true|journal=Communications of the ACM|language=English|volume=38|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Organizational Communication|organizational communication]] studies these implications at an organizational level. This also applies to a setting where teams and team members work in separate physical locations. The imposed distance introduces new challenges in communication, which is no longer a face to face process, and may also be subjected to other constraints such as teams in opposing time zones with a small overlap in working hours.

There are several reasons that force elements from the same project to work in geographically separated areas, ranging from different teams in the same company to [[outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]], to which different constraints and necessities in communication apply. The added communication challenges result in the adoption of a wide range of different communication methods usually used in combination. They can either be in real time as in the case of a video conference, or in an asynchronous way such as [[email]]. While a video conference might allow the developers to be more efficient with regards to their time spent communicating, it is more difficult to accomplish when teams work in different time zones, in which case using an email or a messaging service might be more useful.

== History ==
The history of communication in distributed software development is tied to the historical setting of distributed development itself. Communication tools helped in advancing the distributed development process, since communication was the principal missing component in early attempts for distributed software development {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. One of the main factors in the creation of new tools and making distributed development a viable methodology is the introduction of the [[Internet]] as an accessible platform for developers and researchers, facilitating the exchange of both code and information in a team.

One of the first manifestations of distributed development is the open-source community, where developers are joined together not by an enterprise and its resources but by voluntarily participating in the same project, resulting in diverse teams from different geographical locations. In these projects there is a surging need for communication and collaboration tools. The [[history of free and open-source software]] shows that as time progressed, the complexity of the projects and the number of involved people increased. Better communication and collaboration tools had an important role on this increase. Initially the available methods were mostly asynchronous forms of communication such as the [[email]] and [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] or even relying on periodical written publications to spread information. Synchronous and efficient communication would be mostly limited to [[telephone]] calls {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

In this early stage there aren't many accounts of this kind of distributed development on an enterprise setting {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. However, the developments and tools of previous years pioneered the necessary means for companies to start investigating and adopting these practices when advantages could be obtained. More tools such as [[Audio conferencing]] and [[Instant messaging]] appeared mostly for other purposes but were quickly adopted, and continued to push forward the idea of distributed development. This new movement created an interest in the area of study that is Communication in Distributed Software Development to further improve the effectiveness and quality of the development process.

== Importance ==
Software development, in general, requires a great deal of information exchange &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=D. E.|last2=Staudenmayer|first2=N. A.|last3=Votta|first3=L. G.|date=July 1994|title=People, organizations, and process improvement|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/300082/|journal=IEEE Software|volume=11|issue=4|pages=36–45|doi=10.1109/52.300082|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies show that a great percentage of a developer's time is spent on collaborative/communication activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Pierre N|last2=Robillard|first2=Martin P|date=2000-09-15|title=Types of collaborative work in software engineering|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121200000133|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=53|issue=3|pages=219–224|doi=10.1016/S0164-1212(00)00013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Formal Communication|formal communication]] is used for essential tasks such as updating a project status or determining who has responsibility for any particular work, [[informal communication]] is also crucial for the development process.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbsleb|first=J. D.|last2=Moitra|first2=D.|date=March 2001|title=Global software development|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/914732/|journal=IEEE Software|volume=18|issue=2|pages=16–20|doi=10.1109/52.914732|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Informal Communication|Informal communication]], or "corridor talk”, helps developers stay aware of what is going on around them, what other employees are working on, who has expertise in what area, and many other essential pieces of background information that enables them to work together efficiently and create the "spirit of a team".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Studies also show that the more uncertain a project is, the more important is this kind of communication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a [[Distributed development|Global Software engineering]] (GSE) environment, [[informal communication]] is hard to recreate. The lack of this type of communication can lead to surprises, resulting in misalignment and rework.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For this reason, Communication in Distributed Software Development is important for any company that is applying GSE. This area of study, among other things, tries to recreate [[informal communication]] in a GSE environment, in order to develop software without the loss of development speed that is characteristic to this environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
Communication can be hindered by several barriers, such as socio-cultural, linguistic, knowledge, geographical and temporal barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/709739809|title=ICGSE 2010 : Fifth International Conference on Global Software Engineering : proceedings : 23-26 August 2010, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.|last=Engineers.|first=Institute of Electrical and Electronics|last2=Society.|first2=IEEE Computer|date=2010|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|isbn=9780769541228|oclc=709739809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socio-cultural barriers can manifest themselves as the means of communication. In fact, a study shows that U.S. and Japanese clients have distinct preferences with regards to them. U.S. clients prefer to communicate frequently via informal telephone and email contacts, while Japanese clients prefer verbal communication and less frequent but formal use of electronic media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishna|first=S.|last2=Sahay|first2=Sundeep|last3=Walsham|first3=Geoff|date=April 2004|title=Managing Cross-cultural Issues in Global Software Outsourcing|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/975817.975818|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=47|issue=4|pages=62–66|doi=10.1145/975817.975818|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic barriers typically manifest themselves when at least one of the actors in a conversation is not speaking its native language. Aside from the fact that one should be able to express himself better in his native language, there are other obstacles. [[Idiomatic expression]]s and [[slang]] are an examples of such obstacles that difficult [[Informal Communication|informal communication]].

According to [[Allen curve|Allen's Curve]], the frequency of communication between engineers drops at an exponential rate as the distance between them increases. In case of coworkers in a company, communication is often triggered by random encounters between coworkers. When there is a significant distance between the latter, their communication decreases. In fact, an empirical study was conducted that compared the frequency of communication between coworkers from local and remote sites. Most of the inquired answered that they speak to the majority of their local colleagues at least once a day, while speaking less than once a week with their remote ones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbsleb|first=J. D.|last2=Mockus|first2=A.|date=June 2003|title=An empirical study of speed and communication in globally distributed software development|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1205177/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|volume=29|issue=6|pages=481–494|doi=10.1109/tse.2003.1205177|issn=0098-5589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporal barriers are closely related to geographical barriers. Temporal barriers are typically present on a scenario where two or more coworkers are in different time zones and often times in different geographic locations. Developers mostly communicate during work hours, and while they can use asynchronous communication which doesn't require overlapping work hours, it inherently delays the communication process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Šmite|first=Darja|date=2006-01-01|title=Global software development projects in one of the biggest companies in Latvia: is geographical distribution a problem?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spip.252/abstract|journal=Software Process: Improvement and Practice|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=61–76|doi=10.1002/spip.252|issn=1099-1670}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative they can use synchronous communication if they need to communicate in real time, however it introduces the complication of finding overlapping work hours. [[Follow-the-sun]] is a common approach taken by software companies to mitigate the latter issue.

== Research ==
Research on Communication in Distributed Software Development is conducted in order to improve the understanding of the implications of different communication methods on the success of the development process and the final product.

Communication is an essential process in coordinating a software development project and sharing knowledge between the team members. Previous studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendriks|first=Paul|date=1999-06-01|title=Why share knowledge? The influence of ICT on the motivation for knowledge sharing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1441(199906)6:23.0.CO;2-M/abstract|journal=Knowledge and Process Management|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=91–100|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1441(199906)6:23.0.CO;2-M|issn=1099-1441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Paul S.|last2=Darr|first2=Eric D.|date=1998|title=Computer-Aided Systems and Communities: Mechanisms for Organizational Learning in Distributed Environments|jstor=249550|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=22|issue=4|pages=417–440|doi=10.2307/249550}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that sharing knowledge is important to building trust and even improving the performance of the whole team, which also applies in a distributed software development process.

It can also bring challenges, as referred in the section above, that when improperly dealt with can delay a team project or even cost money to the company. A great deal of studies tries to find ways to mitigate these problems and avoid miscommunication.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The tools used for communication are within the scope of some studies. They show the advantages and disadvantages of some different types of tools, and also which kind of tools the developers like to use for certain situations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The interest of researchers in how a globally distributed development influences the success of the project is noted in publications such as &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockus|first=A.|last2=Herbsleb|first2=J.|date=2001|title=Challenges of global software development|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/915526/?part=1|journal=Proceedings Seventh International Software Metrics Symposium|pages=182–184|doi=10.1109/METRIC.2001.915526}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the author mentions the need for more empirical studies on the subject. Another study &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Liguo|last2=Ramaswamy|first2=Srini|last3=Mishra|first3=Alok|last4=Mishra|first4=Deepti|date=2011-10-17|title=Communications in Global Software Development: An Empirical Study Using GTK+ OSS Repository|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25126-9_32|journal=On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems: OTM 2011 Workshops|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=218–227|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-25126-9_32}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to find more direct relations between time zones and language barriers without significant results, which as suggested by the author, might be due to low sample size. However it was shown &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that there is indeed a relationship between distributed development and longer response times between collaborators. There are also studies that correlate the frequency of communication and the geographical distance, such as [[Allen curve]].

The research done so far points to the need of improving the methodologies and tools used by companies and that communication is a big factor in the success of a company. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Forms of communication ==
[[Communication]] in a collaboration setting can be achieved either synchronously or asynchronously, differing in how agents interact with each other. The different communication forms create analogous communication systems and tools depending on the type of communication supported, which serve different purposes in a distributed development setting. Even inside a company, the tasks and responsibilities of different members reflect in their usage in the tools used in the work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundaravej|first=T.|last2=Mirchandani|first2=D.|last3=Lederer|first3=A.|date=January 2015|title=Synchronous Collaboration Technology Use in Teamwork|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7069683/|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=216–225|doi=10.1109/hicss.2015.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synchronous systems ===
In [[Synchronous conferencing|synchronous systems]], the participants simultaneously receive and send information in "real time", and a message is usually followed by a response in a short time span. This type of communication is used for communication that requires an immediate response when the other participant is promptly available or for more informal communication in a direct setting. It can be used in an enterprise to answer questions quickly, discuss ideas, convey important developments that need attention or any other important message.

=== Asynchronous systems ===
 
[[Asynchronous conferencing|Asynchronous systems]] provide a mechanism for submission and retrieval of messages, where the sender can send information whenever he likes and the recipient will only retrieve it and reply when he is available. This form of communication can be used to have a discussion or convey information about less urgent matters, since no answer is guaranteed promptly. It is useful in a distributed development process specially because most of the times the different teams working on a project don't do so simultaneously, and matters that are not urgent can be discussed asynchronously.

=== Hybrid systems ===

There is also another possible approach in which a system provides both forms of communication in the same environment to allow more flexibility in communication. These systems can be referred to as Hybrid systems where messages exchanged usually have the characteristics of asynchronous messages, but the systems are also conceived in order to use these messages as a form of synchronous communication. They present a middle ground between asynchronous and synchronous communication.

==Tools==
Communication tools for Globally Distributed Software Engineering can be of various types that vary with the communication form used, the interface provided to the user, among others. Also, different categories can use different sensory information to improve the communication. The tools available include [[instant messaging]], [[email]], [[Audio conferencing|audio]] and [[video conference]], [[virtual office]] and [[virtual reality]]. This section provides an overview of different types of tools and some popular examples that are in use currently, however it is not a thorough collection and listing of available tools. More complete listings can be found in other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drennings.github.io/MindTheGap/|title=Mind the Gap|website=drennings.github.io|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asynchronous tools ===
====Email====
[[Email]] is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using digital devices such as computers, mobile phones and other electronics. Unlike the most [[instant messaging]] tools, on email neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously. The cost of using email in company varies, since, for example, the company might have its own email server.

Empirical studies demonstrated that all team members on a software development team used this tool effectively. Unlike [[instant messaging]], email messages are intended to be more stand-alone and less sensitive to the context of communication, and thus producing email messages requires more time than traditional IM messages.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niinimaki|first=T.|date=August 2011|title=Face-to-Face, Email and Instant Messaging in Distributed Agile Software Development Project|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065582/|journal=2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Global Software Engineering Workshop|pages=78–84|doi=10.1109/icgse-w.2011.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some email providers are [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]] and [[ProtonMail]].

=== Synchronous tools ===

====Audio and video conference====
[[Conference call|Audio]] and [[Videotelephony|video conference]] are the technologies for the reception and transmission of [[Audio signal|audio]]-[[video]] signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real-time. These type of tools attempts to replicate the rich interaction present in face-to-face meetings.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niinimaki|first=T.|last2=Piri|first2=A.|last3=Lassenius|first3=C.|date=July 2009|title=Factors Affecting Audio and Text-Based Communication Media Choice in Global Software Development Projects|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5196929/|journal=2009 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Global Software Engineering|pages=153–162|doi=10.1109/icgse.2009.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich synchronous communication technology such as video-conferencing is appropriate for highly interactive discussions where body language and intonation can convey the degree of understanding or agreement among participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoulas|first=G. A.|last2=Swigger|first2=K.|last3=Brazile|first3=R.|last4=Alpaslan|first4=F. N.|last5=Cabrera|first5=V. L.|last6=Serce|first6=F. C.|date=January 2009|title=Global Teams: Futuristic Models of Collaborative Work for Today's Software Development Industry|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4755342/|journal=2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1–10|doi=10.1109/hicss.2009.231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video conference]] is also a good way to develop trust among global software developers, since it allows team members to form personal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhat|first=J. M.|last2=Gupta|first2=M.|last3=Murthy|first3=S. N.|date=September 2006|title=Overcoming Requirements Engineering Challenges: Lessons from Offshore Outsourcing|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1687859/|journal=IEEE Software|volume=23|issue=5|pages=38–44|doi=10.1109/ms.2006.137|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators found out that team members who are not confident with their English language skills prefer to use [[email]] or [[instant messaging]] over [[Conference call|audio]] and [[Videotelephony|video conferencing]], as text-based media provide more time to comprehend and compose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noll|first=John|last2=Beecham|first2=Sarah|last3=Richardson|first3=Ita|date=September 2011|title=Global Software Development and Collaboration: Barriers and Solutions|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1835428.1835445|journal=ACM Inroads|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–78|doi=10.1145/1835428.1835445|issn=2153-2184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This becomes a problem, since text-based media doesn't use neither auditory nor visual features, which can hinder the process of understanding important information and lead to misunderstandings.

[[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]], [[GoToMeeting]] and [[Highfive (company)|Highfive]] are examples of these type of tools.

====Virtual Offices====

Virtual Offices recreate the personal proximity and functionality of a physical office needed by teams in a global distributed software engineering environment. Instead of having "channels" or "messages threads", virtual offices have rooms on a virtual office space.

Professor Thomas J. Allen in the late 1970's discovered that the increase of distance between engineers reduces exponentially the frequency of communication between them.&lt;ref name="Book12"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/managing-flow-technology|title=Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information Within the R&amp;D Organization|last=Allen|first=Thomas J.|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262510271|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|id=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual offices are a way to virtually reduce that distance, in order to increase the communication among them.

Furthermore, other studies &lt;ref name="van Gamerenvan Solingen20132"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=van Solingen|first2=Rini|last3=Dullemond|first3=Kevin|year=2013|title=Auto-erecting Virtual Office Walls: A Controlled Experiment|pages=206–215|doi=10.1109/ICGSE.2013.34|last1=van Gameren|first1=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that virtual offices make work coordination easier and improve the performance in a team.

Some tools that belong to this subset are Sococo, [[8x8]] and [[Skype for Business]].

====Virtual Reality====
[[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] has gained increased interest over the years. It has grew from an industry of 129 million [[United States dollar|USD]] in 2015 to over 1 billion [[United States dollar|USD]] by the end of 2016. It is estimated that the industry will reach 4.6 billion [[United States dollar|USD]] by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefarm51.com/ripress/VR_market_report_2015_The_Farm51.pdf|title=Report on the current state of the VR market|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content exchanged during the act of communication is merely the interpretations of the situations in which the actors are involved. The latter, in turn, depend on the context.  The motivation for using virtual reality as a communication tool is based on the premise that one's perception of context is proportional to the sensorial information available.

In a virtual reality communication setup, each of its participants is under sensorial immersion. This improves the perception of the context in which the actor is in, which in turn improves the communication experience itself.

Even though the concept is not recent, the technology only started to be significantly developed as of 2010.

[[AltspaceVR]] is an example of a virtual reality platform which was recently used as a communication tool. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/virtual-reality-takes-on-the-videoconference-1474250761]

=== Hybrid tools ===

====Instant Messaging====
[[Instant messaging]] (IM) allows the transmission of messages between two parties or more in case of a "chat room". It can be synchronous or asynchronous and it's considered to be the less intrusive communication type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thissen|first=M. Rita|last2=Page|first2=Jean M.|last3=Bharathi|first3=Madhavi C.|last4=Austin|first4=Toyia L.|date=2007|title=Communication Tools for Distributed Software Development Teams|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1235000.1235007|journal=Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMIS CPR Conference on Computer Personnel Research: The Global Information Technology Workforce|series=SIGMIS CPR '07|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=28–35|doi=10.1145/1235000.1235007|isbn=9781595936417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches show that developers like to use this type of tools to ask quick questions to their peers or superiors.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

[[WhatsApp]], [[Facebook Messenger]] and [[HipChat]] are examples for this type of tool.

== Applications in software processes ==

=== Agile ===
Mixing [[Agile software development]] and Distributed Software Development brings a lot of challenges to the team communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramesh|first=Balasubramaniam|last2=Cao|first2=Lan|last3=Mohan|first3=Kannan|last4=Xu|first4=Peng|date=October 2006|title=Can Distributed Software Development Be Agile?|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1164394.1164418|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=49|issue=10|pages=41–46|doi=10.1145/1164394.1164418|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, [[Agile software development]] demands an increase for informal communication and lacks formal communication, like [[documentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Highsmith|first=J.|last2=Cockburn|first2=A.|date=September 2001|title=Agile software development: the business of innovation|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/947100/|journal=Computer|volume=34|issue=9|pages=120–127|doi=10.1109/2.947100|issn=0018-9162}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Distributed Software Development makes it difficult to initiate communication, can lead to misunderstandings and increases the communication cost (time, money, etc) as explained previously [[#Challenges]], which can lead to a decrease on the frequency of communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=C.|last2=Neve|first2=P. De|date=March 2001|title=Surviving global software development|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/914748/|journal=IEEE Software|volume=18|issue=2|pages=62–69|doi=10.1109/52.914748|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the area of study presented of utter importance in Agile Distributed Software Development. One of its core principles emphasizes the relationships between individuals and their interactions, entailing constant communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70867033|title=Agile software development : the cooperative game|last=Alistair.|first=Cockburn,|date=2007|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780321482754|oclc=70867033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extreme Programming ===
[[Extreme programming]] (XP) was designed for a environment where all developers were co-located,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44518151|title=Extreme programming installed|last=1967-|first=Anderson, Ann,|last2=Chet.|first2=Hendrickson,|date=2001|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0201708426|oclc=44518151}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not the case for Distributed Software Development.

[[File:Fernseher.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Console television set]]
A '''console television''' is a type of [[CRT television]] most popular in, but not exclusive to, the United States and Canada. Console CRT televisions are distinguished from standard CRT televisions by their factory-built, non-removable, wooden cabinets and [[Loudspeaker|speakers]], which form an integral part of the television's design.

Best suited to television sizes of under 30 inches, they eventually became obsolete due to the increasing popularity of ever larger televisions in the late 1980s onward. However, they were manufactured and used well into the early 2000s.

==Description==
Console televisions were originally accommodated in approximately rectangular [[Radiogram (furniture)|radiogram]] style cabinets and included [[Receiver (radio)|radio]] and [[record player]] facilities. However, from approximately the mid-1970s onwards, as radiograms decreased and [[Hi-fi]] equipment increased in popularity, console televisions became more cuboid in shape and contained most commonly television, and radio receiving features, and less commonly the addition of an [[8-track tape|eight track]] player.

Some models included a feature whereby the viewer/operator could answer the [[telephone]], by pressing a specific button on the [[remote control]], and could then proceed to engage in a telephone conversation by means of a [[speakerphone]] built into the cabinet of the television, thus eliminating the need to use a traditional telephone receiver.

==Manufacturers==
Companies that made these types of television included [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]], RCA, [[Panasonic]],  [[Sony]], [[Magnavox]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], and [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]].

'''Crown Maple Syrup''' is a certified organic [[maple syrup]] company based in [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains, NY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krasny|first1=Jill|title=On a Mission to Make Maple Syrup Part of Every Meal|url=http://www.inc.com/jill-krasny/crown-maple-sweet-marketing-strategy.html|website=Inc.com|publisher=Inc.|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was established by Robb Turner in 2010. The sap used to produce maple syrup comes from tapped maple trees in areas ranging from the Hudson Valley to Western Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Crown Maple|url = https://www.crownmaple.com/about-crown-maple|website = Crown Maple|accessdate= 15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syrup is processed and bottled at '''Madava Farms''' on an 800-acre site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Rourke|first1=Brian|title=Madava Farms and America's Love Affair With Maple Syrup|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-orourke/madava-farms-and-americas_b_8028366.html|website=HuffingtonPost.com|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="6/Newsday"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasquale|first=Elyse|title=Travel: Head to Madava Farms for maple syrup season|url=http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/travel-head-to-madava-farms-for-maple-syrup-season-1.4835671|publisher=Newsday|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is considered to be the largest maple syrup production facility in North America.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blotcher|first=Jay|title=Artisan: Crown &amp; Country|url=http://ediblehudsonvalley.com/editorial/winter-2012-2013/artisan-crown-country/|publisher=Edible Hudson Valley|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2/NY Times" /&gt;

== History ==
The 800-acre piece of land, located on the town borders of Unionvale, Millbrook, and Dover Plains, was farmland during the Civil War. Afterwards, farming on the property came to a halt, and an unusually high concentration of maples sprung up. Initially purchased for vacation purposes in 2006, Turner was informed by neighbors that the 800 acre property contained approximately 20,000 maple trees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Having no prior knowledge of maple syrup production, Turner consulted the Cornell Cooperative Extension and learned methods for sustainable syrup production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The area was left untouched until 2007, when the property was bought by Robb Turner, a former Wall Street banker, and his wife, Lydia. The couple decided to use the land to found a maple syrup company.&lt;ref name="4/HV Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dumas|first=Bob|title=Dover’s Madava Farms Grows Reputation as Unique Maple Syrup Producer|url=http://hudsonvalleyreporter.com/business/2013/07/dovers-madava-farms-grows-reputation-as-maple-syrup-producer/|publisher=Hudson Valley Reporter|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was called "Crown Maple," and the farm was named Madava Farms, after the Turners' daughters, Ava and Maddie.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2/NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zernike|first=Kate|title=Is it Too Classy for Pancakes?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/tapping-the-sweet-potential-of-maple-syrup.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1381595788-6oG4cLJmNf55BDeUN6DrQg|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turners tapped their first trees in 2011 and opened the farm to the public in 2012.&lt;ref name="2/NY Times" /&gt; The property has at least 40,000 maple trees and a 27,000-square-foot sugarhouse.&lt;ref name=inc.&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krasny|first1=Jill|title=On a Mission to Make Maple Syrup Part of Every Meal|url=http://www.inc.com/jill-krasny/crown-maple-sweet-marketing-strategy.html|website=Inc.|publisher=Inc.com|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Madava Farms received state grant award money for the purpose of creating a "tourist destination" in the Mid-Hudson Valley.&lt;ref name=Cuomo&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor spends $738 Million|url=http://themillbrookindependent.com/news/governor-spends-738-million|publisher=The Millbrook Independent|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln Ristorante chef Jonathan Benno designed a kitchen for Madava Farms' cafe.

==Syrup Production==
The 27,000-square foot [[sugar house]] on Madava Farms houses the equipment for syrup production, a café and special events dining room, and a store selling crown maple products and other goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blotcher|first1=Jay|title=A deluge of maple syrup is in the forecast|url=http://www.ediblehudsonvalley.com/editorial/winter-2012-2013/artisan-crown-country/|website=EdibleHudsonValley.com|publisher=Edible Hudson Valley Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crown Maple is the only syrup producer that uses a [[reverse osmosis]] filtration system, which removes 80% of the water content from the sap and filters out impurities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner Jr.|first1=Ralph|title=Light, Dark—All Maple Syrup Is Delish|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/light-darkall-maple-syrup-is-delish-1426726631|website=wsj.com|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility also contains one of the largest maple syrup evaporators ever built.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In an effort to ensure that the syrup production process has a minimized environmental impact, the equipment is cleaned using steam from the [[evaporation]] process. This reduces the amount of water used, which is both ecologically and financially beneficial The finished syrup rates a 67 on the Brix scale, higher than the standard 66%, but below the legal limit of 68%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/March-2014/10-Facts-About-Hudson-Valley-Maple-Syrup/|title = 10 Facts About Hudson Valley Maple Syrup|date = March 2014|accessdate = 16 October 2015|website = hvmag.com|publisher = Hudson Valley Magazine|last = Levine|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sales and Expansion ==
Crown Maple's current machinery can handle the sap from up to 400,000 tapped trees. With approximately 100,000 trees currently tapped, the planned expansion to tap up to 400,000 trees would make Crown Maple the world's largest single producer of maple syrup.

Crown Maple’s syrup is categorized based on color and flavor:  Golden, Amber, Dark, Very Dark, and Bourbon Barrel-Aged. The flavor of a particular batch of maple syrup is determined entirely by the condition of the sap as it flows from the trees. This is based on a variety of climatic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crownmaple.com/about-crown-maple/understanding-maple-grades|title = Understanding Maple Grades|date = |accessdate = 16 October 2015|website = crownmaple.com|publisher = Crown Maple|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to maple syrup, the company also sells maple sugar.

Its products are now used at restaurants like Le Bernadin, Eleven Madison Park, and Lincoln Ristorante.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/tapping-the-sweet-potential-of-maple-syrup.html?_r=0|title = Is It Too Classy for Pancakes?|date = 2 April 2013|accessdate = 15 October 2015|website = nytimes.com|publisher = The New York Times|last = Zernike|first = Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crown Maple syrup is also an ingredient in a [[Mast Brothers]] chocolate bar, Early Bird granola, Nuts &amp; Bolts Brooklyn Gluten-free Granola, and Steve’s and Blue Marble ice creams.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The syrup is also available at West Elm, Dean &amp; DeLuca, and limited Whole Foods retailers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Equipment ==
Turner received consultation from the [[Cornell University|Cornell]] Cooperative Extension when buying technology and equipment for the operation.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley" /&gt;  The farm prides itself in its technology and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3/Schumer"&gt;{{cite web|last=WBNG News|title=Schumer announces 'Maple Tap Act' has passed the Senate at part of Farm Bill|url=http://www.wbng.com/news/state/Schumer-announces-Maple-Tap-Act-has-passed-the-Senate-at-part-of-Farm-Bill-211048371.html|publisher=A Granite Broadcasting Station|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reduce the likeliness of tree infection, thin polymer plastic tubes are used to carry sap to the collection house. The farm also aims to save fuel by not boiling the syrup initially and instead using osmosis machines.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2/NY Times" /&gt;  As well as eliminating bacteria and cellulose material, the reverse osmosis machines remove up to 75% of the water from the sap. Extracted water is used for watering the property and cleaning the machinery.&lt;ref name="1/Edible Hudson Valley" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">'''Data Stream Mining''' is the process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous, rapid data records. A data stream is an ordered sequence of instances that in many applications of data stream mining can be read only once or a small number of times using limited computing and storage capabilities.

In many data stream mining applications, the goal is to predict the class or value of new instances in the data stream given some knowledge about the class membership or values of previous instances in the data stream.
Machine learning techniques can be used to learn this prediction task from labeled examples in an automated fashion.
Often, concepts from the field of [[incremental learning]] are applied to cope with structural changes, [[online Machine Learning|on-line learning]] and real-time demands. 
In many applications, especially operating within non-stationary environments, the distribution underlying the instances or the rules underlying their labeling may change over time, i.e. the goal of the prediction, the class to be predicted or the target value to be predicted, may change over time. This problem is referred to as [[concept drift]].

Examples of data streams include computer network traffic, phone conversations, ATM transactions, web searches, and sensor data.
Data stream mining can be considered a subfield of [[data mining]], [[machine learning]], and [[knowledge discovery]].

==Software for data stream mining==
* [[MOA (Massive Online Analysis)]]: free open-source software specific for mining data streams with concept drift. It has several machine learning algorithms ([[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[data clustering|clustering]], outlier detection and recommender systems).  Also it contains a prequential evaluation method, the EDDM concept drift methods, a reader of ARFF real datasets, and artificial stream generators as SEA concepts, STAGGER, [[rotating hyperplane]], random tree, and [[random radius based functions]]. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with [[Weka (machine learning)]].
* [[RapidMiner]]: commercial software for knowledge discovery, data mining, and machine learning also featuring data stream mining, learning time-varying concepts, and tracking drifting concept (if used in combination with its data stream mining plugin (formerly: Concept Drift plugin))

{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}}
'''Debit card cashback''' (also known as '''cash out''' in Australia and New Zealand) is a service offered to [[retail]] [[customer]]s whereby an amount  is added to the total purchase price of a transaction paid by [[debit card]] and the customer receives that amount in [[cash]] along with the purchase. Debit card cashback is offered either by various banks only to some card holders or by companies like VISA, Mastercard or American Express. 
For example, a customer purchasing $18.99 worth of goods at a supermarket might ask for twenty dollars cashback. They would pay a total of $38.99 ($18.99 + $20.00) with their debit card and receive $20 in cash along with their goods.

This benefits the store as it reduces the amount of cash banking the store has to do. Many customers find it a useful way to obtain cash as it avoids them having to use a [[automated teller machine|cash machine]], which may incur additional fees.

==History==
The idea was originally that of British retail chain [[Tesco]] in order to reduce the amount of cash banking the stores needed to carry out, the customer service aspect being a side effect of this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Coverage==
The service is offered by both [[bank]]s and [[merchant]]s in countries such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Poland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Australia]] because of the fee structures in use in these countries:

#When accepting payment by debit card, merchants pay a fixed [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] fee (as opposed to a percentage) to their bank or merchant service provider. (This is because the commission paid by the merchant for accepting debit cards, unlike [[credit card]]s, does not need to fund [[Credit card interest|interest free credit]] or other incentives).
#Accepting payments in cash can be costly for merchants, given that many British banks charge around 0.5% for depositing cash into a business bank account, along with the costs of transporting and insuring the cash.

The combination of these two factors means that the retailer can save money by offering the cashback service. It does not cost the retailer more in commission to add cashback to a debit card purchase, but in the process of giving cashback, the retailer can "offload" cash which they would otherwise have to pay to deposit at the bank.

==Fees, operation and advantages==
The services are restricted to debit cards where the merchant pays a fixed fee for the transaction, it is not offered on payments by credit card because they would pay a [[percentage]] commission on the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant service provider.

Some vendors enforce a minimum purchase amount or add a fixed fee when providing cashback to a customer.

In many cases, retailers require customers to initial the cashback entry on the till receipt to confirm they have received the cash. This system is used to prevent [[cashier]]s surreptitiously adding cashback amounts to a transaction and keeping the money for themselves (or accusations of same), but more importantly, to ensure that customers cannot return to the store with allegations that the attendant "forgot" to hand over the requested cash.

Cashback can have benefits for the customer in many scenarios. In locations where there are no cash machines nearby, or the nearby machines are out of order or empty, a local retailer may be able to supply the required cash instead and to offer more flexibility in note denominations. Sometimes it is simply more convenient to combine the transactions at the retailer and ATM into a single cashback transaction with the retailer.

Additionally, although [[ATM usage fees|fees for debit card ATM usage]] are very rare in countries such as the UK, where cashback originated{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--The Danish [[Dankort]] from 1983 has cashback--&gt;, this is not the case in some other countries. In Canada and the United States, fees of $1~2 are typical when using an ATM from a different bank than the one with which the customer has an account. The fees in some other countries are even higher. In Germany, for instance, usual fees are €4~5 when using an ATM of another bank network than the one of his bank. This gives rise to another potential cashback advantage for the consumer: by making use of the cashback procedure, this ATM fee can be avoided for the cardholder.

Poland: For standard payment transactions merchants have to pay interest fees as a percentage of payment value, not as a fixed tax. In opposite, for cashback service the merchant receive the fixed fee from the card issuer (~$0.15-0.30), but the one time cashback withdrawal cannot be higher than 300zł (~$80). The cashback service is available at ~1/6 of POS in Poland (2014).

'''Diazodinitrophenol''' ('''DDNP''') was the first [[diazo]] compound produced; it was subsequently used to make dyes and explosives.  It forms yellow crystals in pure form; however, the color of impure forms may vary from dark yellow to green to dark brown.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Matyáš and Jiří Pachman, ''Primary Explosives'' (Berlin, Germany:  Springer Verlag, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfJHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chapter 6:  Diazodinitrophenol, pp. 157-166] ; see p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; It is soluble in [[acetic acid]], [[acetone]], concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]], most non-polar solvents and is slightly soluble in [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Urbański with Marian Jurecki and Sylvia Laverton, trans., ''Chemistry and Technology of Explosives'' (Oxford, England:  Permagon Press, 1967), vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/ChemistryAndTechnologyOfExplosives-VolumeIii/ChemistryAndTechnologyOfExplosives-VolumeIii-TadeuszUrbanski#page/n211/mode/2up pp. 201-204;] see especially p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A solution of cold [[sodium hydroxide]] may be used to destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;(Urbański, 1967), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; DDNP may be desensitized by immersing it in water, as it does not react in water at normal temperature.  It is less sensitive to impact but more powerful than [[mercury fulminate]] and almost as powerful as [[Lead(II) azide|lead azide]].&lt;ref&gt;(Urbański, 1967), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity of DDNP to friction is much less than that of mercury fulminate and lead azide.

DDNP is used with other materials to form [[Primary explosive|priming mixtures]], particularly where a high sensitivity to flame or heat is desired. DDNP is often used as an [[Explosive materials#Detonation of an explosive charge|initiating explosive]] in [[propellant]] primer devices and is a substitute for [[lead styphnate]] in what are termed "green" or "non-toxic" (lead free) priming explosive compositions. Lead free primers have been judged as inadequate for service use in firearms due to weak and uneven initiation compared to lead based primers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1410.6390|ref=Courtney|last1=Courtney|first1=Elya|title=Performance testing of lead free primers: Blast waves, velocity variations, and environmental testing|last2=Courtney|first2=Amy|author3=Peter David Summer|last4=Courtney|first4=Michael|class=physics.pop-ph|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Diazodinitrophenol was first prepared in 1858 by the German chemist [[Peter Griess]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Griess (1858) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101044011037;view=1up;seq=541 "Vorläufige Notiz über die Einwirkung von salpetriger Säure auf Amidinitro- und Aminitrophenylsäure,"]  (Preliminary notice of the reaction of nitrous acid with picramic acid and aminonitrophenol), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''106''' :  123-125.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was among the first [[diazo]] compounds and for a long time thereafter it was 
used as a starting material for dyes.&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Clark (1933) "Diazodinitrophenol, a detonating explosive," ''Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry'', '''25''' (6) :  663-669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Griess had mentioned in 1859 that diazodinitrophenol exploded upon heating,&lt;ref&gt;P. Griess (1859) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T0JEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA594#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On new nitrogenous derivatives of the phenyl- and benzoyl-series,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''9''' :  594-597 ; see especially p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 1892 that diazodinitrophenol was first used as an explosive – when Wilhelm Will&lt;ref&gt;For biographical information about Wilhelm Will, see [[:de:Wilhelm Will|Wilhelm Will]] in German Wikipedia (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; and Friedrich Lenze, German chemists at the ''Militär-Versuchsamt'' (military research office) in Spandau, Germany, began to investigate azides as potential initiators of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;See:

[[File:Doffers in Aragon Mills. Rock Hill, S.C. - NARA - 523539.jpg|thumb|300px|Doffer boys in Aragon Mills, [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] on 13 May 1912]]
A '''doffer''' is someone who removes ("doffs") [[bobbin]]s, [[pirn]]s or [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s holding spun fiber such as cotton or wool from a [[spinning frame]] and replaces them with empty ones. Historically, spinners, doffers, and sweepers each had separate tasks that were required in the manufacture of [[Spinning (textiles)|spun textiles]]. From the early days of the industrial revolution, this work, which requires speed and dexterity rather than strength, was often done by children.{{sfn|Zonderman|1992|p=27}} After World War I, the practice of employing children declined, ending in the United States in 1933.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=183-185}} In modern textile mills, doffing machines have now replaced humans.{{sfn|Fourné|1999|p=596}}

==The 19th century== 
The [[Industrial Revolution]] created growing demand for child labor in the mills and factories, since children were easier to supervise than adults and good at monotonous, repetitive tasks that often required little physical strength, 
but where small bodies and nimble fingers were an advantage.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=58-59}} 

Children were employed in the mills as spinners, sweepers and doffers, with girls usually starting as spinners and boys as doffers and sweepers. When the bobbins on the spinning frames were full, the machinery stopped. The doffers would swarm into the mill and, as quickly as possible, change all the bobbins, after which the machinery would be restarted and the doffers were free to amuse themselves until the next change-over. On the newer and taller frames, the doffers often had to climb to reach the bobbins.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=474}}

===Great Britain===

In [[Lancashire]] the doffing boys were free to do what they liked once they had completed a doffing, as long as they stayed within earshot of the "throstle jobber," who would whistle when they were next needed.  They were motivated to do the work as fast as possible, since this gave them as long as possible to play. Between ten and twelve boys could handle a factory with about ten thousand [[Throstle frame|throstle]] spindles, depending on the amount of yarn being spun.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=50}}
The doffers were usually the sons of poor people, and were small and skinny. They were sometimes called "The Devil's Own" for the tricks that they would get up to.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=51}} As a rule they would go barefoot except at the coldest times of year.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=52}}

At [[Quarry Bank Mill]] in [[Styal]], England, near Manchester, a doffer earned 1s/6d a day in 1790, and by 1831 was earning from 2s. to 3s. a day. An overlooker's wage in the same period rose from 15s. to 17s.{{sfn|Collier|1965|p=41-42}} In [[Leeds]] in the 1830s a doffer could earn 4s. to 5s.{{sfn|Morris|1990|p=102}} In the textile industry in Britain, wages for children continued to rise steadily compared to those for adults during the period from 1830 to 1860, indicating that demand was outstripping supply.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=58-59}} In Belfast linen factories in 1890 girls were employed as doffers, earning the equivalent of US $1.43 daily (about 6s. at the time.){{efn|In the 1890s the exchange rate varied very little from the "par" rate of $4.8665 to £1.  There were twenty shillings to the pound.  So $1.43 &amp;#61; (1.43/4.8665)*20s. &amp;#61; 5.88 s.  The doffer's daily wage would be worth perhaps $35 or £22 in 2011, although people now buy a very different mix of goods and services, e.g. phone calls but not coal.{{sfn|Nye|2011}}}}{{sfn|US Bureau of Foreign Commerce|1891|p=117}}

===North America===
[[File:Lucy Larcom with signature.jpg|thumb|[[Lucy Larcom]], author of ''A New England Girlhood'', became a bobbin doffer in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] in 1835, aged 11]]

In the United States in the first part of the 19th century, although the day was long the doffers only worked for about four hours each day.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=474}} Memoirs from writers such as [[Lucy Larcom]] and [[Harriet Hanson Robinson]] describe the long hours, but also the leisurely pace of work and the opportunities for social interactions.{{sfn|Zonderman|1992|p=27}} In Massachusetts in 1830 a doffer boy earned 25 cents a day. An overseer of rooms would make $1.25 a day, and the superintendent of a mill earned $2.00 a day, considered an excellent wage at the time.{{sfn|Earl|1877|p=28}} In the southern cotton mills it was customary to employ only whites for most jobs in the mill, although blacks had outside jobs and some inside jobs such as firing the boilers. This persisted well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Rhyne|1930|p=47-48}}

During the later part of the 19th century, working conditions in the U.S. textile industry deteriorated. Immigrant textile workers coming from Yorkshire and Lancashire to [[New England]] found the mills poorly run, with the managers cheating on measurements of cuts of cloth and time worked, and arbitrarily cutting wages without warning. These workers were often skilled, accustomed to being well-treated in their home country, and accustomed to taking industrial action if they were not.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|pp=190–191}} There were a series of strikes from the 1870s onward.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=398}}

An 1889 Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Relations of Capital and Labor in Canada recorded a statement by the assistant superintendent of St. Croix Cotton Mills in [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]]. He said the mill employed some young boys around fifteen years old as doffers, but the average doffer was aged thirty. Wages were from 65 to 80 cents a day. In the summer hours were from 6:30 am to 6 pm, with a half day on Saturday. Winter hours were slightly longer.{{sfn|Armstrong|Freed|1889|p=481}}
An employee who had worked in both countries reported that wages were better than in the United States and working conditions better, although the hours were about the same.{{sfn|Armstrong|Freed|1889|p=486}}

Doffers in 1887 in a large mill in [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina]], both boys and girls, earned 40 cents a day.{{sfn|Vivian|1891|p=394}} In New England in the 1890s, the doffers, piecers and back boys had their own union, and were not admitted to the [[Spinning mule|mule spinners]]' union, even though they often aspired to become mule spinners.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=372}} Many left the industry rather than tolerate the conditions.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=389}} [[William Madison Wood]], the manager at the Washington Mill in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] instituted a system in 1895 where employees gained bonuses for meeting production quotas, as long as they missed no more than one day per month. The effect was that weavers drove spinners to produce, spinners drove doffers and so on, and that workers came in even when sick or injured. Wood then used the increased pay to justify running the looms at ever faster speeds.{{sfn|Watson|2006|p=23}}

===Rags to riches===
A doffer could achieve success if he had enough energy and ability. Stephen Davol, born in November 1807, joined his elder brothers as a doffer in the Troy mill in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] in 1818. After rising through the ranks, in 1833 he became superintendent of the Pocasset Mill at the age of twenty-six. He drew up the plans for building a giant new mill for the Pocasset company, {{convert|219|ft}} by {{convert|75|ft}} and rising to five stories. The mill was unusual for its time in being built as a whole to plans that considered both the structure and the arrangement of the machinery, belts and gearing.
From 1842 to 1860 Davol was agent, or chief executive, of the Troy Mill. By the 1870s he was a member of the board of ten different companies.{{sfn|Earl|1877|p=56-57}}

George Alexander Gray (1851–1912) is another example. Gray started work as a doffer before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when aged eight, earning ten cents a day in a mill at Pinhook, North Carolina. He had little education, but rose to the position of overseer in the mill, and then was given the job of supervising installation of machinery in new plants. He moved to [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], where he built the first mill with his own capital. By the time he died, there were eleven mills in Gastonia, of which Gray had been involved in establishing nine.{{sfn|Mitchell|1921|p=109}} Carl Augustus Rudisill (1884–1979) began work as a doffer boy in [[Cherryville, North Carolina]], at ten cents a day. He was superintendent of the Indian Creek Manufacturing Company by 1907, and later developed the Carlton Yarn Mills into a major operation.  He was a member of the North Carolina legislature from 1937 to 1941.{{sfn|Wehunt-Black|2008|p=105}}

==Early 20th century==

===Netherlands===
Towards the end of the 19th century, doffers in the Netherlands were mostly boys of about 12 years of age, who in 1890 had to go to school for a few hours each day. They were part of a team headed by a "minder", who was responsible for running two mules, and including a "big piecer" and a "little piecer", whose main job was to rejoin broken threads.{{sfn|Groot|1995|p=57}}
Around 1916, self-acting mules were introduced from Germany, which were simpler to operate. The team was reduced to one spinner and one piecer, with the position of doffer eliminated. The pace of modernization and mechanization was faster than in Lancashire, where the unions were more powerful.{{sfn|Groot|1995|p=59}}

===India===
A report on conditions in the [[Bombay]] mills in [[India]] between 1891 and 1917 noted that laws had been passed in response to agitation in England by which no child under nine years old could be employed.
In theory, children under fourteen could not work more than seven hours per day, broken into two work periods with a long rest period in between. In practice, much younger children were working longer hours at jobs such as doffing.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=76}} A man working in the mills would be paid Rs.7 to Rs.9 for the least skilled jobs to as much as Rs18 to Rs22 on a piece-work basis for a mule's minder or spinner. Doffer boys working full-time would earn Rs.4 to Rs.6.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=258}}  As of 1912 about 4,000 boys and girls were employed in the Indian mills, each doffing about 350 ring spindles.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=16-17}}

By 1900 in Crown Mills, [[Whitfield County, Georgia]], the average doffer was fourteen years old.{{sfn|Flamming|1995|p=99}}
A doffer in North Carolina in 1904 would earn $2.40 per week, while a head doffer would earn $3.50. Skilled workers would earn more.  A drawing-in girl could make $6.00, a warper $7.50 and an engineer up to $9.00, while the weave boss made as much as $15.00.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=79}} The working week would be ten hours a day from Monday to Saturday.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=78}} In 1907, a doffer in North Carolina only had to work about half the time, being able to play baseball, swim in the local river or otherwise relax until the whistle of the head doffer called them back to the mill.  If a rural mill depended on a water wheel for power, a drought could provide more free time as the mill would only run a few hours each day.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=88}}

[[File:OUR BABY DOFFER.jpg|thumb|"OUR BABY DOFFER" and some of the other infants all working in Avondale Mills. Location: Birmingham, Alabama. November 1910, by Lewis Hine]]
[[Lewis Hine]] obtained a job with the [[National Child Labor Committee]] in the United States in 1908, and over the next decade took many photographs that documented children at work.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=19}} Many of the children worked barefoot, which made it easier to climb the machinery to reach bobbins or broken threads. Children met with accidents more often than adults.
Hines was told by the overseer of one mill "We don't have any accidents in this mill .... Once in a while a finger is mashed, or a foot, but it don't amount to anything." Conditions were demanding.  There was a constant racket of machinery. The mill windows were kept closed, creating a hot and humid atmosphere in which cotton threads were less likely to break. The air was filled with lint and dust, making breathing difficult, and often leading to diseases such as tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=35}} Some workers suffered from [[Byssinosis]], or brown lung, caused by prolonged exposure to cotton dust.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=81}}

At that time boys might start to work as doffers before the age of seven.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=35}} However, as Hines reported, "In every case, the youngsters told me their age as 12 years, even to the little Hop-o'-My-Thumb, whom the others dubbed 'our baby doffer.'  They would hesitate when I asked them, but always succeeded in remembering that they were twelve."{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=168}}
A photograph by Hine of an evidently very young doffer at the Melville Manufacturing Company in [[Cherryville, North Carolina]] appeared on the cover of a National Child Labor Committee report around 1912.{{sfn|Wehunt-Black|2009|p=20}} Hine's photographs of child workers such as doffers were influential in driving reform of child employment laws in the United States, an early example of the power of photo journalism.{{sfn|Naef|2004|p=84}} New laws were introduced, so that by 1914 very few children under 12 were working in the mills, and most were over 14.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=177-178}}

==Post World War I==
After [[World War I]] ended in 1918, the US textile industry was left with surplus capacity and went into a slump, not recovering until after the 1930s [[Great Depression]]. In response, mill owners cut wages and laid off workers, or put them on short hours, while mechanizing further to improve efficiency. New laws made child labor more expensive, and children could not handle the new machinery. The practice of using child labor in the mills declined, finally ending completely when the NIRA [[Cotton Textile Code]] was adopted in 1933.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=183-185}} Changes to the Factories Act in 1922 reduced formal child labor in the textile factories in India. By the 1940s there were negligible numbers of children in the [[Kanpur]] mills.
Most of the remaining child workers were doffer boys.{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=87}} Elsewhere the change was slower.  In Kenya in 1967 "doffer boy" was still listed as a job position in the [[Kisumu]] Cotton Mills, one of the lowest paid.{{sfn|Kenya Gazette 1967|p=1045}}

Improvements in working conditions were gradually introduced. In 1940 the British recognized byssinosis, or brown lung disease, and started to compensate victims. Due to lack of research and industry resistance, nothing was done about the disease in the United States until the 1970s.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=81}} Activists organized brown lung screening clinics in [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in 1975.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=358}} The Carolina Brown Lung Association had 7,000 members by 1981.
In 1984 the Occupational Health and Safety Administration responded to pressure from this group and implemented a new cotton dust standard.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=360}}

In modern mills the doffing process is relatively automated. with a mechanical doffer fitted to the winder that cuts and aspirates the yarn, removes the packages and places them in a yarn buggy, fits the empty tubes and transfers the yarn so winding can continue.{{sfn|Fourné|1999|p=596}}

==Poems and songs==
The song "The Doffing Mistress" is about flax spinning in Northern Ireland and describes the doffers respect for their mistress. The line "she hangs her coat on the highest pin" is because the doffer's work could lead to deformity of the spine.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Jon (1978) ''Victoria's Inferno''. Tettenhall: Broadside {{ISBN|0-9503722-3-4}}; p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Waugh]] is the author of the dialect poem "The Little Doffer" about a doffer in a Lancashire mill who obtained work despite his unsatisfactory replies to the overlooker (foreman).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Brian, ed. (1977) ''Songs of the People''. Manchester University Press {{ISBN|0-7190-0612-0}}; pp. 18, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Electrically detected magnetic resonance''' ('''EDMR''') is a [[Characterization (materials science)|materials characterisation]] technique that improves upon [[electron spin resonance]]. It involves measuring the change in [[electrical resistance]] of a sample when exposed to certain [[microwave]] frequencies. It can be used to identify very small numbers (down to a few hundred atoms) of impurities in [[semiconductors]].

==Outline of technique==
[[Image:Electrically detected magnetic resonance.svg|frame|right|
A [[band structure]] (energy level) outline of the EDMR mechanism. A donor impurity (P) sits just below the conduction band (C). An acceptor (R) sits between the donor and the [[valence band]] and provides a recombination pathway for the donor electron (small blue circle) to recombine with a [[Electron hole|hole]] in the valence band (V). A [[photon]] (γ) of a specific frequency can flip spins against the magnetic field (B).
]]

To perform a pulsed EDMR experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.68.245105| title = Theory of time-domain measurement of spin-dependent recombination with pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance| year = 2003| last1 = Boehme | first1 = C.| last2 = Lips | first2 = K.| journal = Physical Review B| volume = 68| issue = 24| pages = 245105 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68x5105B }}&lt;/ref&gt; the system is first initialised by placing it in a magnetic field. This orients the [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s of the [[electron]]s occupying the donor and acceptor in the direction of the [[magnetic field]]. To study the donor, we apply a [[microwave]] pulse ("γ" in the diagram) at a resonant frequency of the donor. This flips the spin of the electron on the donor. The donor electron can then decay to the acceptor energy state (it was forbidden from doing that before it was flipped due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]) and from there to the valence band, where it [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombines]] with a hole. With more recombination, there will be fewer conduction electrons in the [[conduction band]] and a corresponding increase in the resistance, which can be directly measured. Above-bandgap light is used throughout the experiment to ensure that there are lots of electrons in the conduction band.

By scanning the frequency of the microwave pulse, we can find which frequencies are resonant, and with knowledge of the strength of the magnetic field, we can identify the donor's energy levels from the resonant frequency and knowledge of the [[Zeeman effect]]. The donor's energy levels act as a 'fingerprint' by which we can identify the donor and its local electronic environment. By changing the frequency slightly, we can study the acceptor instead.

==Recent developments==
EDMR has been demonstrated on a single electron from a [[quantum dot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature02693| pmid = 15269762| year = 2004| last1 = Elzerman | first1 = J.| last2 = Hanson | first2 = R.| last3 = Willems Van Beveren | first3 = L.| last4 = Witkamp | first4 = B.| last5 = Vandersypen | first5 = L.| last6 = Kouwenhoven | first6 = L.| title = Single-shot read-out of an individual electron spin in a quantum dot| volume = 430| issue = 6998| pages = 431–435| journal = Nature |arxiv = cond-mat/0411232 |bibcode = 2004Natur.430..431E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of less than 100 donors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.2358928| title = Electrically detected magnetic resonance in ion-implanted Si:P nanostructures| year = 2006| last1 = McCamey | first1 = D.

'''Foil bearings''', also known as '''foil-air bearings''', are a type of [[fluid bearing#Air bearings|air bearing]]. A shaft is supported by a compliant, spring-loaded [[foil (metal)|foil]] journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working [[fluid]] (usually [[air]]) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that no contact occurs. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure, which is generated by the rotation that pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or [[hydrostatic bearings]], foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.

==Development==

Foil bearings were first developed in the late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett Corporation]] using independent [[R&amp;D]] funds to serve military and space applications.&lt;ref &gt;Some early history is reported in {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of foil bearings is the elimination of the [[oil]] systems required by traditional bearing designs. Other advantages are:
* Higher efficiency, due to a lower heat loss to friction; instead of [[friction|fluid friction]], the main source of heat is [[parasitic drag]]
* Increased reliability
* Higher speed capability
* Quieter operation
* Wider [[operating temperature]] range (40–2,500&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]])
* High vibration and shock load capacity
* No scheduled maintenance
* No external support system
* Truly oil free where contamination is an issue
* Capable of operating above [[critical speed]]

Areas of current research are:
* Higher load capacity
* Improved damping 
* Improved coatings

The main disadvantages are:
* Lower capacity than roller or oil bearings
* Wear during start-up and stopping
* High speed required for operation

'''Gordon Lee (Bill) McClymont''', [[Order of Australia|AO]] (8 May 1920 &amp;ndash; 6 May 2000),  was an Australian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientist]], [[ecologist]], and [[educationist]].  The originator of the term "[[sustainable agriculture]]", McClymont is known for his multidisciplinary approach to farm ecology.  McClymont was the foundation chair of the Faculty of Rural Science at the [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]], the first degree program of its kind to integrate animal husbandry, veterinary science, agronomy, and other disciplines into the field of livestock and agricultural production.  In 1978, in recognition of his work and contributions to his field, he was appointed Officer of the [[Order of Australia]].

Born in Australia, McClymont entered the [[University of Sydney]] under the sponsorship of the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Agriculture]].  After graduating with a bachelor's degree in veterinary science from Sydney and a PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]], he worked as an animal nutrition researcher for the state of New South Wales.  Believing that his education had not adequately prepared him for his work, McClymont designed a broader, multi-disciplinary educational approach to the field of livestock and agricultural production.  Impressed with his ideas, the  [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] hired McClymont in 1955 to chair its new department of rural science.

While at the university, McClymont championed his approach to farm and livestock production and sustainability of agricultural ecosystems.  Under his direction, the University of New England became a leader in [[ruminant]] research.  The Australian poultry industry recognized McClymont's contributions to poultry production with a special award in 1967.  After his retirement in 1980, McClymont continued to work with the agricultural industry in Australia and consulted with the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] on farm issues.  In 1996, he expounded his approach to livestock and farm production in the book ''Rural Science:  Philosophy and Application''.

==Early life and undergraduate education==
McClymont was born on 8 May 1920.  His father was one of seven sons of a Scottish immigrant to Australia.  McClymont's father greeted him as a newborn with, "G'day Bill" and Bill stuck with him as a nickname for the rest of his life.  McClymont's father's brothers resided in rural areas, including in the [[Orange, New South Wales]], region.  Thus, although McClymont grew up in the [[Sydney]] metropolitan area, he spent much holiday time as a youth in a rural environment.  His activities at his relatives' farms included lamb marking, fruit picking, horse breaking, and pig shooting.  McClymont also became familiar with the local animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000); Ryan (1996), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont attended [[Chatswood High School|Chatswood Intermediate High School]], where he became interested in science.  In his fourth year, he transferred to [[North Sydney Boys High School]].  In his [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Leaving Certificate Exam]], taken in 1936, McClymont earned First Class Honours in physics and chemistry, which placed him third and fourth respectively on the New South Wales state honours list.  While in high school, he participated in the [[Australian Army Cadets]] in a horse-drawn [[field artillery]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking funds to attend university, a family friend who worked for the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Agriculture]] suggested that McClymont apply for a department traineeship.  In spite of his lack of formal agricultural training, McClymont passed the exam and interview and was assigned to the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[veterinary science]] program.  Provided with a salary of £110 a year, he entered the university in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000); Ryan (1996), p. 14.  The family friend was A.H.E. McDonald, then Deputy Chief of Plant Industries for the Department of Agriculture.  McClymont's interviewer after the exam was [[Max Henry]], Chief Veterinary Surgeon (later Chief of the Division of Animal Industry) and former commander of the Army Veterinary Service during [[World War I]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War II]] began in 1939, McClymont joined the [[Australian Army Veterinary Corps]] in the [[2nd Cavalry Brigade (Australia)|2nd Cavalry]] Mobile Veterinary Section assigned to his university.  His unit volunteered for overseas duty, but was refused.  McClymont joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as an aircrew reservist, but was again denied an overseas assignment and ordered to complete his education at Sydney while serving the military in a scientific advisory role.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  He joined the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] at the rank of sergeant and served weekend duty during the war years at [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] and [[radar]] installations in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the war, McClymont's final two years of undergraduate study were compressed into 16 months.  He graduated in 1941 with a bachelor of veterinary science, [[Bachelor's degree#Australia|First Class Honours]], and a gold [[university medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 15; Ryan (2007), p. 21; Franklin (1988), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==New South Wales Department of Agriculture==

===Early career===
Immediately after graduation in 1941, McClymont was appointed as a specialist in animal nutrition at the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Agriculture]].  In that position, he was responsible for all extension, advisory work, and policy advice on animal nutrition for the state government.  In one instance during the war, McClymont had to respond to a [[swine influenza]] outbreak caused by pig meat imported by American troops stationed in Australia.  While participating in an operation to kill and burn potentially infected [[suidae]] in a local piggery, he met his future wife, Vivienne Pecover, sister of the farmer whose pigs were being slaughtered.  The two married in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 to 1949, under a [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research|Walter and Eliza Hall Veterinary Research Fellowship]], he attended the [[University of Cambridge]] from which he earned a [[doctor of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  His thesis, called ''Interrelationships between the digestive and mammary physiology of ruminants'', was based on research he had conducted in 1947 in which he discovered that green [[oat]] consumption by dairy cows produced milk with less butterfat.  In the thesis, he explained how the complex interaction between environment, climate, soil, plant, and animal physiology and metabolism had combined to produce the lowered milkfat.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

After completion of his term at Cambridge, McClymont toured agricultural research centres and colleges in the United States.  While in the US, he gave 15 lectures on his doctoral research.  A number of American agricultural scientists told him later that his lectures had caused them to change their fields of research.  McClymont was not impressed by the agricultural education he observed in Britain or the US, saying that the British focused on estate management while the Americans concentrated on descriptive evaluations of livestock quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Australia in 1950, McClymont was reassigned as Officer in Charge of the department's Animal Nutrition Research Laboratory at [[Glenfield, New South Wales|Glenfield]] Veterinary Research Station.  At Glenfield, he developed research programs on drought feeding and [[Pre-eclampsia|pregnancy toxaemia]] in sheep and established a nutritional diagnostic service.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 21; Ryan (1996), p. 17; Franklin (1988), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1945 and 1953, McClymont participated in adult education activities to rural areas around New South Wales for the Sydney University Extension Board and [[University of New England (Australia)|New England University College]].  New England University College was an extension college of the University of Sydney located in [[Armidale, New South Wales]].  The activities included holding seminars on animal husbandry and agriculture for farmers and graziers.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 22; Ryan (1992), p. 51.  During that time, McClymont often worked with New England University College faculty members David Drummond, James Belshaw, Arnold Eberle.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1951 to 1953, McClymont helped New England University College establish facilities and adult classes in animal husbandry and agricultural economics in [[Walcha Shire|Walcha]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], and [[Dubbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 49; Ryan (2008), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideas on education===
McClymont's work experiences caused him to feel disastified with the quality of education he had received in his degree program at Sydney.  He felt the veterinary science specialization was too narrow, especially in the area of animal husbandry and livestock production.  Moreover, he felt the specialization of the discipline did not provide sufficient knowledge in how the overall farm animal production process worked.  For example, as an undergraduate, he received only three lectures on statistics, a skill he had to teach himself during his first few years as an animal nutritionist advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, he took an interest in education and curriculum development.  McClymont later said that he had "seen the educational deficiencies of narrow specialization, whether of veterinary graduates as specialists in animal health and disease or of agricultural science graduates as specialists in aspects of soil and plants.  I had seen the problems created by such specialized knowledge when exercised without overall understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 21, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1952, two lecturers in veterinary science at the University of Sydney, Doug Blood and Jim Steel, wrote a letter to the ''Australian Veterinary Journal'' complaining of their university's placement of animal husbandry as a subordinate topic within veterinary science.  They argued that the field of animal husbandry included "the procurement of maximum production from the available animals, compatible with their continued health and the maintenance of the natural resources of the land on which they live" and was worthy of its own profession.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  McClymont saw the letter and responded with his own missive to the journal in June 1953.  In his letter, McClymont opined that the field in question should instead be called "animal production" and that it should, "be defined as the integration of animal husbandry and agronomy (the science of pasture and crop production), or in more general terms, manipulation of the soil-plant-animal complex, for the purpose of economic production of animal products."  He added that the university-level training in the field should include, "extension work, research, and commercial applications."  McClymont concluded that university graduates in such a field of study would be prepared to blend veterinary (animal) and agricultural (plant) production sciences to optimize farm animal output.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 150; Ryan (2007), p. 21, 39.  Both letters are reprinted in full in Ryan (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;74–78&lt;/ref&gt;

James Belshaw, Deputy Warden of New England University College, saw the letter and brought it to the attention of the school's advisory council's Special Committee on Animal Husbandry.  At that time, the college was preparing to become an independent university and was looking to differentiate itself with a farm-based degree program that was different from what the University of Sydney had to offer, but which would also be applicable and beneficial to the rural New England area.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

With approval from the committee, Belshaw asked McClymont in July 1953 to prepare a paper further explaining his ideas on the topic of educational curricula related to farm animal production.  McClymont's paper, submitted on 8 September 1953, was titled, "Planning Rural Science and Possible Curriculum".  In the paper, McClymont further expounded his views and, as the title indicated, suggested that a better name for the prospective faculty would be "rural science."&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 151; Ryan (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1954, [[Robert Madgwick]], vice-chancellor of the newly independent university, reviewed McClymont's paper.  Convinced by McClymont's reasoning, Madgwick recommended to the university council the establishment of a faculty of rural science.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16 October 1954 the University of New England offered McClymont the position of Chair of the soon-to-be established Department of Rural Science.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22; Ryan (1992), p. 325; Ryan (1996), p. 80.  McClymont was one of three finalists for the position out of 30 applications, the other two being M.C. Franklin from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (then called the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and T.J. Robinson from the [[University of Melbourne]]'s Department of Animal Husbandry.  Madgwick recommended McClymont's selection because he was youngest of the three candidates and, therefore, "had his best years ahead of him."&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of New England==

===Rural science===
[[File:Booloominbah at Night.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Booloominbah]], the original facility of the University of New England, photographed in 2009]]McClymont's appointment to the University of New England Faculty of Rural Science took effect in March 1955, one year after the university's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 9, 22; Ryan (1992), p. 325 says the appointment took effect in December 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon arrival, McClymont was surprised by the school's humble facilities.  He had to borrow a chair since his office did not have one.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 9; Jordan (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;151–152&lt;/ref&gt;  Madgwick had assumed that it would take at least two years to get the new department up and running.  McClymont, however, pointed out to Madgwick that the program could begin accepting enrollments in 1956 because the existing faculty of science could already offer first-year courses in several basic science topics needed for the degree program.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 1955, McClymont gave the degree program's inaugural address in the auditorium of nearby Armidale Teachers' College, titled "All Flesh is Grass" after a passage in the Biblical [[Book of Isaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1996), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the speech, McClymont explained his vision for the goals of the rural science program, saying, "The economic health of this country, and so the standard of civilization which it will support, rests on the fertility of its soils and on the resultant productivity of its pastures, livestock and crops."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 23, 83, 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree program was the first of its kind to implement a multi-disciplinary approach to farm animal production science.  It combined elements of agronomy, biochemistry, physiology, veterinary science, soil and agricultural ecology (agricultural science), biology, economics, social sciences, and animal nutrition and husbandry to teach students how all these elements interacted to create a productive agricultural ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduates from the new program were more generalists than specialists in order to help them find and implement original solutions to varied problems with Australia's livestock production, then still struggling with output and sustainability issues.  The impact of the resulting improvements in Australia's livestock production was seen in Australians becoming among the world's biggest per capita meat consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 25, 39, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes in the degree program began in March 1956 with an initial enrollment of 17 students.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 155; Ryan (2007), p. 15, 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Five hundred students had graduated with bachelors in rural science by the early 1980s.  One hundred sixty graduated with honours.  Seventy had attained [[master's degree]]s in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduates included [[Bridget Ogilvie]], director of the [[Wellcome Trust]], Hugh Beggs, Life Governor of the Australian Sheep Breeders Association and Chair of both the Australian Wool Corporation and the [[International Wool Secretariat]], I Made Nits, Professor of Nutrition and Tropical Forage at [[Udayana University]], and Robert Clements, Director of the [[Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005, approximately 1,700 students had passed through the rural science program.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

As chair of the department, McClymont advocated and helped establish functionally autonomous agricultural education community centres around the New England area.  The centres, supported by both the Departments of Rural Science and Agricultural Economics, were patterned after university external agricultural centres in the United States.  The centres were financially independent and so avoided control by the university's central administration.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), p. 304.  Ryan states that the centers were established around the Tablelands and along the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]].&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont's writings and lectures while at the university emphasized the importance of sustainability in agricultural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered to be the originator of the term "[[sustainable agriculture]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rural Science Graduates Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  McClymont diagrammed the key elements of agricultural ecosystems into a series of flowcharts which were often used by other agricultural instructors.  He alerted the agricultural community to the issues involved with feeding [[grain]] to livestock while the world was experiencing a shortage of grain.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further activities===
During the 1960s and 1970s, the University of New England became a prominent international centre in [[ruminant]] research.  McClymont published a series of articles in academic journals on biochemistry and animal nutrition, including pregnancy toxaemia in sheep, poultry nutrition, and mineral deficiencies in dairy cattle.  He promoted an original approach to researching metabolic diseases in livestock, utilizing radioactive tracer methods to identify "the quantitative importance of various metabolites including glucose, volatile fatty acids, B-hydroxybutyrate and long chain fatty acids in ruminant metabolism, and the metabolic interactions between these materials."&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont and Professor R. B. Cumming established the Poultry Research Fund Group at the [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] Adult Education Centre to facilitate the exchange of ideas between the university's rural science and agricultural economics departments and the poultry industry.  The group first met on 1 July 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967 McClymont was awarded the Australian Poultry Award for his work in poultry nutrition and with the poultry industry, particularly in the [[Namoi River]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, McClymont proposed the establishment of a School of Biological Sciences at the university because of expansion of the topic within the Department of Rural Science.  The school was founded the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont served on the advisory standing committee of eight for the independent but university-affiliated Kellogg Rural Adjustment Unit.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal commencement for the unit was on 1 July 1976, with operations beginning the next year. The name of the organization was later changed to Rural Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), p. 306, 343&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the centre, among other objectives, was to provide education on rural issues and policies, play a role in the development of rural policies, and assist rural communities in adjusting to changes in their cultural and economic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;407–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OrderAustraliaRibbon.png|thumb|right|Ribbon awarded to civilian recipients of the Order of Australia]]While at the university, McClymont consulted to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]].  In 1975 the organization published a booklet he authored, titled ''Formal Education and Rural Development''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 January 1978, citing his "service to veterinary science and to agricultural research," the Commonwealth of Australia designated McClymont an Officer in the [[Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont retired from the university in 1980 and was appointed an [[emeritus professor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 179; Jordan (2004), p. 158.  Ryan (2007), p. 87 states that McClymont was replaced as Dean of the Department of Rural Sciences in 1976 by Richard Bawden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor [[J. S. Ryan]] said, "Fifty years on, he is widely recognized&amp;nbsp;– and acclaimed&amp;nbsp;– as being so far ahead of his time in recognizing the vital interaction between animal and plant production and in the importance of a healthy ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
In retirement, McClymont continued to consult with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in its Department of Agricultural Education, Research, and Rural Matters.  In addition, he consulted on agricultural issues with the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

As an emeritus professor, McClymont observed and commented on issues with the rural science curriculum at New England.  An external review, began in 1979 by the university with help from an independent committee of agricultural specialists from the [[Australian Academy of Science]], recommended curriculum changes, which were implemented in 1982.  The most significant change was increased freedom given to students to choose electives in the fourth year of study, allowing limited specialization in certain subject areas.  McClymont lamented the changes, feeling that they damaged the quality and standing of the rural science degree program.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;31–35, 37-38, 87.  The University of New England Department of Rural Science was eventually absorbed as a sub-department in the larger Faculty of Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, McClymont and New England professor [[J. S. Ryan]] began work on the book ''Rural Science:  Philosophy and Application''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 a special conference was held at the University of New England to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the rural science curriculum.  Although he was in failing health, McClymont attended as a guest of honour.  ''Rural Science'' was formally presented at the conference.  Said Ryan of the book, "This work is less of a respective chronicle, but is one arising from a more reflective, forward-looking, questioning, and nationally and globally focused essays".&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After years of struggling with [[Parkinson's disease]], McClymont died on 6 May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  A building on New England's Armidale campus was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;  He was survived by his wife, Vivienne, and their four children, daughter Vicky and sons Kim, Glen, and Rod.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000); Ryan (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
McClymont believed in challenging dogma, which sometimes earned him enmity from colleagues and associates.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  J. S. Ryan described McClymont as "devastatingly honest," but "always likeable and compassionate."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (2007), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  He reportedly placed emphasis on the welfare of his students.  For example, McClymont criticized the 1963 decision by the University Council to abolish room-visiting between female and male students.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

McClymont's personal interests included acting, singing, and [[Landscape architecture|landscape gardening]].  He sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] in New England's University Choir.&lt;ref&gt;Leng and McClymont (2000); Ryan (1996), p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gulf of Tonkin incident''' ({{lang-vi|Sự kiện Vịnh Bắc Bộ}}), also known as the '''USS ''Maddox'' incident''', was an international confrontation that led to the [[United States]] engaging more directly in the [[Vietnam War]]. It involved either one or two separate confrontations involving [[North Vietnam]] and the [[United States]] in the waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but eventually became very controversial with widespread belief that at least one, and possibly both incidents were false, and possibly deliberately so. On August 2, 1964, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}}, while performing a [[signals intelligence]] patrol as part of [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]] operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.&lt;ref name="Moise, p. 78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moïse|1996|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; ''Maddox'' fired three warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; ''Maddox'' expended over 280 3-inch (76.2&amp;nbsp;mm) and 5-inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) shells in  a [[sea battle]]. One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three [[P 4-class torpedo boat|North Vietnamese torpedo boats]] were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moïse|1996|pp=78, 82, 92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maddox'' "was unscathed except for a single bullet hole from a Vietnamese machine gun round."&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt;

It was originally claimed by the [[National Security Agency]] that a '''Second Gulf of Tonkin incident''' occurred on August 4, 1964, as another sea battle, but instead evidence was found of "Tonkin ghosts"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moïse|1996|pp=106, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; (false radar images) and not actual North Vietnamese torpedo boats. In the 2003 documentary ''[[The Fog of War]]'', the former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert S. McNamara]] admitted that the August 2 USS ''Maddox'' attack happened with no [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] response, but the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HODxnUrFX6k|title=Gulf of Tonkin:  McNamara admits It didn't happen.|date=March 4, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, McNamara met with former [[Vietnam People's Army]] General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] to ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. "Absolutely nothing", Giáp replied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html McNamara asks Giap: What happened in Tonkin Gulf?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306124920/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |date=March 6, 2015 }}, [[Associated Press]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Giáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Hanyok, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160131235457/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/gulf_of_tonkin/articles/rel1_skunks_bogies.pdf Skunks, Bogies, Silent Hounds, and the Flying Fish: The Gulf of Tonkin Mystery]", August 2–4, 1964",  ''[[Cryptologic Quarterly]]'', Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition (Vol. 19, No. 4 / Vol. 20, No. 1), pp. 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by [[United States Congress|Congress]] of the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which granted President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] the authority to assist any [[Southeast Asia]]n country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "[[communism|communist]] aggression". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.

In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that ''Maddox'' had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there were no North Vietnamese naval vessels present during the incident of August 4. The report stated, regarding the first incident on August 2:

&lt;blockquote&gt;at 1500G,&lt;ref group="note" name="note1"&gt;''NSA source:'' "For purposes of clarity, all time references will be marked either Zulu time ("Z," or Greenwich Mean Time) or '''Golf ("G," or Zulu +7)''', which is the time zone for the Gulf of Tonkin. ... All times will be in given in the military twenty four-hour clock. So, '''all "P.M." times after 1200 hours can be determined by subtracting 1200 from the time: e.g., 1700 hours equals 5:00 P.M.'''"&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Herrick ordered Ogier's gun crews to open fire if the boats approached within ten thousand yards (9,150 m). At about 1505G, ''Maddox'' fired three rounds to warn off the communist [North Vietnamese] boats. This initial action was never reported by the Johnson administration, which insisted that the Vietnamese boats fired first.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"&gt;Robert J. Hanyok, [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/gulf_of_tonkin/articles/rel1_skunks_bogies.pdf "Skunks, Bogies, Silent Hounds, and the Flying Fish: The Gulf of Tonkin Mystery, 2–4 August 1964"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131235457/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/gulf_of_tonkin/articles/rel1_skunks_bogies.pdf |date=31 January 2016 }}, ''Cryptologic Quarterly'', Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition, Vol. 19, No. 4 / Vol. 20, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Vietnam War|Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group|Operation 34A}}
[[File:Gen-commons.jpg|thumb|The Geneva Conference]]

Although the United States attended the [[Geneva Conference (1954)]], which was intended to end hostilities between [[France]] and the Vietnamese at the end of the [[First Indochina War]], it refused to sign the [[Geneva Accords (1954)]]. The accords mandated, among other measures, a temporary ceasefire line, intended to separate Vietnamese and French forces, and elections to determine the future political fate of the Vietnamese within two years. It also forbade the political interference of other countries in the area, the creation of new governments without the stipulated elections, and foreign military presence. By 1961, President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] faced significant discontent among some quarters of the southern population, including some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who were opposed to the rule of Diem's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] supporters. After suppressing [[Vietminh]] political [[cadres]] who were legally campaigning between 1955 and 1959 for the promised elections, Diem faced a growing communist-led uprising that intensified by 1961, headed by the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (NLF, or Viet Cong).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doyle|Lipsman|Weiss|1981|pp=145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred during the first year of the Johnson administration. While Kennedy had originally supported the policy of sending military advisers to Diem, he had begun to alter his thinking due to what he perceived to be the ineptitude of the [[Saigon]] government and its inability and unwillingness to make needed reforms (which led to a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|U.S.-supported coup]] which resulted in the death of Diem). Shortly before Kennedy was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in November 1963, he had begun a limited recall of U.S. forces. Johnson's views were likewise complex, but he had supported military escalation as a means of challenging what was perceived to be the [[Soviet Union]]'s expansionist policies. The [[Cold War]] policy of [[containment]] was to be applied to prevent the fall of [[Southeast Asia]] to communism under the precepts of the [[domino theory]]. After Kennedy's assassination, Johnson ordered in more U.S. forces to support the Saigon government, beginning a protracted United States presence in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, A. T. (2009). Crucible Vietnam: Memoir of an Infantry Lieutenant. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland. {{ISBN|978-0786445172}}, Appendix A, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly classified program of [[covert operation|covert actions]] against North Vietnam known as [[Operation 34A|Operation Plan 34-Alpha]], in conjunction with the [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]] operations, had begun under the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1961. In 1964 the program was transferred to the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and conducted by the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]] (MACV-SOG).&lt;ref&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff, ''Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group, Documentation Study (July 1970)'', Annex F, Appendix x.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norwegian MTB Nasty.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian MTB Nasty]]

For the maritime portion of the covert operation, [[United States Nasty-class patrol boat|a set of fast patrol boats]] had been purchased quietly from [[Norway]] and sent to South Vietnam. In 1963 three young Norwegian [[Sea captain#/Skipper|skippers]] traveled on a mission in South Vietnam. They were recruited for the job by the Norwegian intelligence officer Alf Martens Meyer. Martens Meyer, who was head of department at the military intelligence staff, operated on behalf of U.S. intelligence. The three skippers did not know who Meyer really was when they agreed to a job that involved them in sabotage missions against North Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/vi-som-stotter-amerika---norges-rolle-i-vietnamkrigen-1.908491|title=Vi som støtter Amerika – Norges rolle i Vietnamkrigen|author=NRK|work=NRK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the boats were crewed by South Vietnamese naval personnel, approval for each mission conducted under the plan came directly from Admiral [[U.S. Grant Sharp, Jr.]], [[CINCPAC]] in [[Honolulu]], who received his orders from the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;''MACSOG Documentation Study'', Appendix C, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the coastal attacks began, [[Hanoi]] lodged a complaint with the [[International Control Commission]] (ICC), which had been established in 1954 to oversee the terms of the Geneva Accords, but the U.S. denied any involvement. Four years later, Secretary McNamara admitted to Congress that the U.S. ships had in fact been cooperating in the South Vietnamese attacks against North Vietnam. ''Maddox'', although aware of the operations, was not directly involved.

What was generally not considered by U.S. politicians at the time{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} were the other actions taken under Operations Plan 34-Alpha just prior to the incident. The night before the launching of the actions against North Vietnamese facilities on [[Hòn Mê]] and [[Hòn Ngư]] islands, the SOG had launched a covert long-term agent team into North Vietnam, which was promptly captured. That night (for the second evening in a row), two flights of CIA-sponsored Laotian fighter-bombers (piloted by Thai mercenaries) attacked border outposts well within southwestern North Vietnam. The Hanoi government (which, unlike the U.S. government, had to give permission at the highest levels for the conduct of such missions) probably assumed that they were all a coordinated effort to escalate military actions against North Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moïse|1996|pp=60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
[[File:USS Maddox (DD-731).jpg|thumb|[[USS Maddox (DD-731)|USS ''Maddox'']]]]

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], who was on duty in [[the Pentagon]] the night of August 4, receiving messages from the ship, reported that the ship was on a secret [[electronic warfare support measures]] mission (codenamed "[[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]]") near Northern Vietnamese territorial waters.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Polmar, Norman "The U. S. Navy Electronic Warfare (Part 1)" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' October 1979 p.138&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 1964, {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}} had begun her intelligence collection mission in the Gulf of Tonkin. Captain [[George Stephen Morrison]] was in command of local American forces from his [[flagship]] {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CVA-31|6}}. ''Maddox'' was under orders not to approach closer than eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) from the North's coast and four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from Hon Nieu island.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon3/pent4.htm|title=The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 3, Chapter 2, "Military Pressures Against North Vietnam, February 1964 – January 1965," second section|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SOG commando raid was being carried out against Hon Nieu, the ship was {{convert|120|mi|km}} away from the attacked area.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===First attack===
[[File:MaddoxTonkin1.svg|thumb|Chart showing the track of the USS Maddox, 31 July – 2 August 1964]]

In July 1964, "the situation along North Vietnam's territorial waters had reached a near boil," due to South Vietnamese commando raids and airborne operations that inserted intelligence teams into North Vietnam, as well as North Vietnam's military response to these operations.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; On the night of July 30, 1964, South Vietnamese commandos attacked a North Vietnamese radar station on Hòn Mê island.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; According to Hanyok, "it would be attacks on these islands, especially Hòn Mê, by South Vietnamese commandos, along with the proximity of the Maddox, that would set off the confrontation," although the Maddox did not participate in the commando attacks.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; In this context, on July 31, ''Maddox'' began patrols of the North Vietnamese coast to collect intelligence, coming within a few miles of Hòn Mê island.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; A U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Ticonderoga, was also stationed nearby.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt;

By August 1, North Vietnamese patrol boats were tracking ''Maddox'', and several intercepted communications indicated that they were preparing to attack.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; ''Maddox'' retreated, but the next day, August 2, ''Maddox'', which had a top speed of 28 knots, resumed her routine patrol, and three North Vietnamese [[P 4-class torpedo boat|P-4 torpedo boats]] with a top speed of 50 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] began to follow ''Maddox''.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; Intercepted communications indicated that the vessels intended to attack ''Maddox''.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; As the ships approached from the southwest, ''Maddox'' changed course from northeasterly to southeasterly and increased speed to 25 knots.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; On the afternoon of August 2, as the torpedo boats neared, ''Maddox'' fired three warning shots.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; The North Vietnamese boats then attacked&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; and ''Maddox'' radioed she was under attack from the three boats, closing to within {{Convert|10|nmi}}, while located {{convert|28|nmi}} away from the North Vietnamese coast in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name="PentagonPaper P.IVc2b"&gt;[http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-C-2b.pdf Pentagon Papers, Part IV.

Military Pressures Against NVN." July – October 1964, National Archives Identifier no. 5890500&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maddox'' stated she had evaded a torpedo attack and opened fire with its five-inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) guns, forcing the torpedo boats away. Two of the torpedo boats had come as close as {{Convert|5|nmi}} and released one torpedo each, but neither one was effective, coming no closer than about {{Convert|100|yards}} after ''Maddox'' evaded them.&lt;ref name="PentagonPaper P.IVc2b" /&gt; Another P-4 received a direct hit from a five-inch shell from ''Maddox''; its torpedo malfunctioned at launch.&lt;ref name="PentagonPaper P.IVc2b" /&gt; Four USN [[F-8 Crusader]] jets launched from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Ticonderoga|CVA-14|6}} and 15 minutes after ''Maddox'' had fired her initial warning shots, attacked the retiring P-4s,&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; claiming one was sunk and one heavily damaged. ''Maddox'' suffered only minor damage from a single 14.5&amp;nbsp;mm bullet from a P-4's [[KPV heavy machine gun]] into her superstructure. Retiring to South Vietnamese waters, ''Maddox'' was joined by the destroyer {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951|6}}. The North Vietnamese claimed that ''Maddox'' was hit by one torpedo, and one of the American aircraft had been shot down.

The original account from the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' has been revised in light of a 2005 internal NSA historical study,&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; which stated on page 17:

{{quote|At 1500G, Captain Herrick (commander of ''Maddox'') ordered Ogier's gun crews to open fire if the boats approached within ten thousand yards. At about 1505G, ''Maddox'' fired three rounds to warn off the communist [North Vietnamese] boats. This initial action was never reported by the Johnson administration, which insisted that the Vietnamese boats fired first.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt;}}

[[File:North Vietnamese P-4 under fire from USS Maddox (2 August 1964).jpg|thumb|A North Vietnamese P-4 engaging USS ''Maddox'']]

''Maddox'', when confronted, was approaching Hòn Mê Island, three to four [[nautical mile]]s (nmi) (6 to 7&amp;nbsp;km) inside the {{Convert|12|nmi}} limit claimed by North Vietnam. This territorial limit was unrecognized by the United States. After the skirmish, President Johnson ordered ''Maddox'' and ''Turner Joy'' to stage daylight runs into North Vietnamese waters, testing the {{Convert|12|nmi}} limit and North Vietnamese resolve. These runs into North Vietnamese territorial waters coincided with South Vietnamese coastal raids and were interpreted as coordinated operations by the North, which officially acknowledged the engagements of August 2, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;OAH Magazine of History, fall 1992. The Gulf of Tonkin by Erich Martel&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Admiral Sharp, maintained that U.S. actions did not provoke the August 2 incident. He claimed that the North Vietnamese had tracked ''Maddox'' along the coast by radar, and were thus aware that the destroyer had not actually attacked North Vietnam and that Hanoi (or the local commander) had ordered its craft to engage ''Maddox'' anyway.  North Vietnamese general [[Phùng Thế Tài]] later claimed that ''Maddox'' had been tracked since July 31 and that she had attacked fishing boats on August 2 forcing the North Vietnamese Navy to "fight back".&lt;ref&gt;[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:a313af686e03427f396d60fce82ee0d71521f0b4 "Interview with Phung The Tai, 1981"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120529204043/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:a313af686e03427f396d60fce82ee0d71521f0b4 |date=May 29, 2012 }}.

Sharp also noted that orders given to ''Maddox'' to stay {{Convert|8|nmi}} off the North Vietnamese coast put the ship in international waters, as North Vietnam claimed only a {{Convert|5|nmi}} limit as its territory (or off of its off-shore islands). In addition, many nations had previously carried out similar missions all over the world, and the destroyer {{USS|John R. Craig|DD-885|6}} had earlier conducted an intelligence-gathering mission in similar circumstances without incident.&lt;ref&gt;Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, ''Strategy for Defeat — Vietnam in Retrospect'' (San Rafael, CA: Presidio Press, 1978) P. 42&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Note: Source covers this entire paragraph--&gt;

However Sharp's claims include some factually incorrect statements. North Vietnam never claimed an 8-kilometer (5&amp;nbsp;mi) limit for its territorial waters, instead it adhered to a {{Convert|20|km|sp=us|adj=on}} limit claimed by [[French Indochina]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=cookefarrell&gt;{{cite book |last= Farrell|first= Epsey Cooke|date= 1998|title= The Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Law of the Sea|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WAV8S7k400QC&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;ots=Ox0pWkPfbW&amp;dq=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20territorial%20waters&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20territorial%20waters&amp;f=false|location=The Hague |publisher= Martinus Nijhoff|pages=46–47 |isbn= 9041104739|access-date= May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover it officially claimed a 12&amp;nbsp;nm limit, which is practically identical to the old 20&amp;nbsp;km French claim, after the incidents of August, in September 1964.&lt;ref name=cookefarrell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchholz|first= Hanns Jürgen |date= December 1987|title= Law of the Sea Zones in the Pacific Ocean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZEEuaS6RIC&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;ots=DaF6CLkJcP&amp;dq=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20territorial%20waters&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20territorial%20waters&amp;f=false |publisher=  ASEAN Economic Research Unit, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|page= 47|isbn= 9971988739|access-date= May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Vietnamese stance is that they always considered a 12 nautical mile limit, consistently with the positions regarding the law of the sea of both the Soviet Union and China, their main allies.&lt;ref name=cookefarrell /&gt;

===Second attack===

On August 4, another DESOTO patrol off the North Vietnamese coast was launched by ''Maddox'' and ''Turner Joy'', in order to "show the flag" after the first incident. This time their orders indicated that the ships were to close to no less than {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the coast of North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; During an evening and early morning of rough weather and heavy seas, the destroyers received radar, sonar, and radio signals that they believed signaled another attack by the North Vietnamese navy. For some four hours the ships fired on radar targets and maneuvered vigorously amid electronic and visual reports of enemies. Despite the Navy's claim that two attacking torpedo boats had been sunk, there was no wreckage, bodies of dead North Vietnamese sailors, or other physical evidence present at the scene of the alleged engagement.&lt;ref name="Prados"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/essary.htm  |accessdate=October 29, 2009 |df= }}, Prados, John.

Secretary McNamara at the White House told President Johnson that a U.S. Navy vessel had been attacked and urged retaliation. The President agreed.&lt;ref name="therealnews.com"&gt;The Real News Network, July 12, 2009, "McNamara Deceived LBJ on Gulf of Tonkin," http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=3990&lt;/ref&gt;

At 01:27, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] time, Herrick sent a cable in which he acknowledged that the second attack may not have happened and that there may actually have been no Vietnamese craft in the area: "Review of action makes many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by ''Maddox''. Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken".&lt;ref name="Ellsberg9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellsberg|2002|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hour later, Herrick sent another cable, stating, "Entire action leaves many doubts except for apparent ambush at beginning. Suggest thorough reconnaissance in daylight by aircraft."&lt;ref name=Ellsberg10&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellsberg|2002|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to requests for confirmation, at around 16:00 Washington time, Herrick cabled, "Details of action present a confusing picture although certain that the original ambush was bona fide."&lt;ref name=Ellsberg10/&gt; Secretary McNamara decided against informing the president that a new report had been received casting grave doubt on the existence of the incident that was the premise of the president's decision earlier that day to retaliate, and McNamara continued making plans for U.S. military retaliation.&lt;ref name="therealnews.com"/&gt;

At 18:00 Washington time (05:00 in the Gulf of Tonkin), Herrick cabled yet again, this time stating, "the first boat to close the ''Maddox'' probably launched a torpedo at the ''Maddox'' which was heard but not seen. All subsequent ''Maddox'' torpedo reports are doubtful in that it is suspected that sonarman was hearing the ship's own propeller beat"{{sic}}.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg10/&gt;

Within thirty minutes of August 4 incident, President Johnson had decided on [[Operation Pierce Arrow|retaliatory attacks]]. That same day he used the "hot line" to Moscow, and assured the Soviets he had no intent in opening a broader war in Vietnam. Early on August 5, Johnson publicly ordered retaliatory measures stating, "The determination of all Americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of South Vietnam will be redoubled by this outrage." One hour and forty minutes after his speech, aircraft launched from U.S. carriers reached North Vietnamese targets. On August 5, at 10:40, these planes bombed four torpedo boat bases and an oil-storage facility in Vinh.&lt;ref&gt;The World Today, Vol. 26, No. 5 (May 1970), pp. 209–217, Adam Roberts&lt;/ref&gt;

==The United States' response==

===President Johnson's speech to the American people===
[[File:37 Lyndon Johnson 3x4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|President Johnson in 1964]]

Shortly before midnight, on August 4, President Johnson interrupted national television to make an announcement in which he described an attack by North Vietnamese vessels on two U.S. Navy warships, ''Maddox'' and ''Turner Joy'' requested authority to undertake a military response.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball |first=Moya Ann |title=Revisiting the Gulf of Tonkin Crisis: An Analysis of the Private Communication of President Johnson and his Advisers |journal=Discourse &amp; Society |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=281–296 [p. 286] |year=1991 |doi=10.1177/0957926591002003002 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 28, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulf of Tonkin Incident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/speeches/rhetoric/lbjgulf.htm |title=Gulf of Tonkin Incident |date=August 4, 1964 |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's speech repeated the theme that "dramatized [[Hanoi]]/[[Ho Chi Minh]] as the aggressor and which put the United States into a more acceptable defensive posture."&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt; Johnson also referred to the attacks as having taken place "on the high seas," suggesting that they had occurred in [[international waters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/historicspeeches/johnson_lyndon/gulfoftonkin.html Text of Lyndon Johnson's speech, ''Gulf of Tonkin Incident''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He emphasized commitment to both the American people, and the South Vietnamese government. He also reminded Americans that there was no desire for war. "A close scrutiny of Johnson's public statements ... reveals no mention of preparations for overt warfare and no indication of the nature and extent of covert land and air measures that already were operational." Johnson's statements were short to "minimize the U.S. role in the conflict; a clear inconsistency existed between Johnson's actions and his public discourse."&lt;ref name="Cherwitz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherwitz |first=Richard A.  |title=Masking Inconsistency: The Tonkin Gulf Crisis |journal=Communication Quarterly |year=1980 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=27–37 |doi=10.1080/01463378009369364 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 28, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction from Congress===
[[File:Wayne Morse.jpg|thumb|left|Wayne Morse]]

While President Johnson's final resolution was being drafted, Senator [[Wayne Morse]] attempted to hold a fundraiser to raise awareness about possible faulty records of the incident involving ''Maddox''. Morse supposedly received a call from an informant who has remained anonymous urging Morse to investigate official logbooks of ''Maddox''.&lt;ref name="Goulden"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goulden |first=Joseph C. |title=Truth is the First Casualty |location=Chicago |publisher=Rand McNally &amp; Company |year=1969 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These logs were not available before President Johnson's resolution was presented to Congress.&lt;ref name="Goulden" /&gt;

After urging Congress that they should be wary of President Johnson's coming attempt to convince Congress of his resolution, Morse failed to gain enough cooperation and support from his colleagues to mount any sort of movement to stop it.&lt;ref name="Goulden" /&gt; Immediately after the resolution was read and presented to Congress, Morse began to fight it. He contended in speeches to Congress that the actions taken by the United States were actions outside the constitution and were "acts of war rather than acts of defense."&lt;ref name="Goulden" /&gt;

Morse's efforts were not immediately met with support, largely because he revealed no sources and was working with very limited information.&lt;ref name="Goulden" /&gt; It was not until after the United States became more involved in the war that his claim began to gain support throughout the United States government. Morse was defeated when he ran for re-election in 1968.&lt;ref name=69bluebook&gt;[[H. Clay Myers, Jr.|Myers, Clay]]. Oregon Blue Book. Salem, Oregon: Office of the Secretary of State, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distortion of the event==
Evidence was still being sought on the night of August 4 when Johnson gave his address to the American public on the incident. Messages recorded that day indicate that neither President Johnson nor Secretary McNamara was certain of an attack.&lt;ref name="Wise"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wise |first=David |title=The Politics of Lying: government deception, secrecy, and power |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1973  |isbn=0-394-47932-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various news sources, including ''Time'', ''Life'' and ''Newsweek'', ran articles throughout August on the Tonkin Gulf incident.&lt;ref name="Bradlee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emperor's-clothes.com/archive/bradlee.htm |last=Bradlee |first=Ben |title=Deceit and dishonesty – The first James Cameron Memorial Lecture |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=April 29, 1987 }}{{dead link|date=August 2013}} The Emperor's New Clothes. Web. October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' reported: "Through the darkness, from the West and south ... intruders boldly sped ... at least six of them ... they opened fire on the destroyers with automatic weapons, this time from as close as 2,000 yards."&lt;ref name="Action in Tonkin Gulf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,897225,00.html |title=Action in Tonkin Gulf |newspaper=Time |date=August 14, 1964 |accessdate=October 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' stated that there was "no doubt in Sharp's mind that the US would now have to answer this attack", and that there was no debate or confusion within the administration regarding the incident.&lt;ref name="Action in Tonkin Gulf" /&gt;

[[File:Advisors meeting at Camp David - NARA - 192569 crop William Bundy.jpg|thumb|left|William Bundy]]

The use of the set of incidents as a pretext for escalation of U.S. involvement follows the issuance of public threats against North Vietnam, as well as calls from American politicians in favor of escalating the war.&lt;ref name="Moise"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moïse|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 1964, [[William Bundy]] called for the U.S. to "drive the communists out of South Vietnam", even if that meant attacking both North Vietnam and communist China.&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt; Even so, the Johnson administration in the second half of 1964 focused on convincing the American public that there was no chance of war between the United States and North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt;

North Vietnam's [[General Giap]] suggested that the DESOTO patrol had been sent into the gulf to provoke North Vietnam into giving an excuse for escalation of the war.&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt; Various government officials and men aboard ''Maddox'' have suggested similar theories.&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt; American politicians and strategists had been planning provocative actions against North Vietnam for some time. [[George Wildman Ball|George Ball]] told a British journalist after the war that "at that time ... many people ... were looking for any excuse to initiate bombing".&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt;

According to [[Raymond McGovern]], a retired [[CIA]] officer (CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990, and in the 1980s, chairman of the [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s), the CIA, "not to mention President Lyndon Johnson, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy all knew full well that the evidence of any armed attack on the evening of Aug. 4, 1964, the so-called "second" Tonkin Gulf incident, was highly dubious. ...   During the summer of 1964, President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were eager to widen the war in Vietnam. They stepped up sabotage and hit-and-run attacks on the coast of North Vietnam." ''Maddox'', carrying electronic spying gear, was to collect signals intelligence from the North Vietnamese coast, and the coastal attacks were seen as a helpful way to get the North Vietnamese to turn on their coastal radars. For this purpose, it was authorized to approach the coast as close as 13 kilometers (8 mi) and the offshore islands as close as four; the latter had already been subjected to shelling from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2008/011108a.html|title=Consortiumnews.com|author=Robert Parry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''[[Body of Secrets]]'', [[James Bamford]], who spent three years in the United States Navy as an intelligence analyst, writes, that the primary purpose of the ''Maddox'' "was to act as a seagoing provocateur—to poke its sharp gray bow and the American flag as close to the belly of North Vietnam as possible, in effect shoving its five-inch cannons up the nose of the communist navy. ...   The Maddox{{'}} mission was made even more provocative by being timed to coincide with commando raids, creating the impression that the Maddox was directing those missions ..." Thus, the North Vietnamese had every reason to believe that ''Maddox'' was involved in these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, James in Body of Secrets, Anchor, Reprint edition (April 30, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0385499088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provocative action against North Vietnam was considered after the August 1964 incidents. [[John McNaughton]] suggested in September 1964, that the U.S. prepare to take actions to provoke a North Vietnamese military reaction, including plans to use DESOTO patrols North. William Bundy's paper dated September 8, 1964, suggested more DESOTO patrols as well.&lt;ref name="Moise" /&gt;

==Consequences==
{{Main|Gulf of Tonkin Resolution}}
[[File:President Lyndon B. Johnson signs "Gulf of Tonkin" resolution - NARA - 192484.tif|thumb|President Johnson as he signs the resolution on August 10, 1964]]

Secretary McNamara failed to inform President Johnson that the U.S. Naval task group commander in the Tonkin Gulf, Captain [[John J. Herrick]], had changed his mind about the alleged North Vietnamese torpedo attack on U.S. warships he had reported earlier that day.&lt;ref name="therealnews.com"/&gt;

By early afternoon of August 4, Washington time, Herrick had reported to the Commander in Chief Pacific in Honolulu that "freak weather effects" on the ship's radar had made such an attack questionable. In fact, Herrick was now saying, in a message sent at 1:27 pm Washington time, that no North Vietnamese patrol boats had actually been sighted. Herrick now proposed a "complete evaluation before any further action taken."&lt;ref name ="Ellsberg9-10"/&gt;

[[File:Tonkin Gulf Resolution.jpg|thumb|left|Tonkin Gulf Resolution]]

McNamara later testified that he had read the message after his return to the Pentagon that afternoon. But he did not immediately call Johnson to tell him that the whole premise of his decision at lunch to approve McNamara's recommendation for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam was now highly questionable. Had Johnson been accurately informed about the Herrick message, he might have demanded fuller information before proceeding with a broadening of the war. Johnson had fended off proposals from McNamara and other advisers for a policy of bombing the North on four separate occasions since becoming president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacklistednews.com/?news_id=4784 |first=Gareth |last=Porter |title=Robert McNamara deceived LBJ on Gulf of Tonkin, documents show }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Johnson, who was up for election that year, ordered [[Operation Pierce Arrow|retaliatory air strikes]] and went on national television on August 4. Although ''Maddox'' had been involved in providing intelligence support for South Vietnamese attacks at Hòn Mê and Hòn Ngư, Johnson denied, in his testimony before [[United States Congress|Congress]], that the U.S. Navy had supported South Vietnamese military operations in the Gulf. He thus characterized the attack as "unprovoked" since the ship had been in [[international waters]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As a result of his testimony, on August 7, Congress passed a [[joint resolution]] ([[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution|H.J. RES 1145]]), titled the Southeast Asia Resolution, which granted President Johnson the authority to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without the benefit of a declaration of war. The resolution gave President Johnson approval "to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]] requesting assistance in defense of its freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-78/pdf/STATUTE-78-Pg384.pdf|title=United States Congress resolution, Pub.L. 88–408, 78 Stat. 384.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later statements about the incident==

In 1967, former naval officer, John White, wrote a letter to the editor of the ''New Haven (CT) Register''.  He asserted "I maintain that President Johnson, Secretary McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave false information to Congress in their report about US destroyers being attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/August-2014/50-Years-After-the-Golf-of-Tonkin-Vietnam-Vet-John-White-Looks-Back-at-the-Incident-that-Sparked-War/John-Whites-Letter-to-the-New-Haven-Register-1967/ |title=John White's Letter to the New Haven Register, 1967 |date=August 1, 2014 |magazine=Connecticut Magazine |access-date=August 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White continued his whistleblowing activities in the 1968 documentary ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]''.  White soon arrived in Washington to meet with Senator Fulbright to discuss his concerns, particularly the faulty sonar reports.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1981, Captain Herrick and journalist [[Robert Scheer]] re-examined Herrick's ship's log and determined that the first torpedo report from August 4, which Herrick had maintained had occurred—the "apparent ambush"—was in fact unfounded.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg10/&gt;

Although information obtained well after the fact supported Captain Herrick's statements about the inaccuracy of the later torpedo reports as well as the 1981 Herrick and Scheer conclusion about the inaccuracy of the first, indicating that there was no North Vietnamese attack that night, at the time U.S. authorities and all of the ''Maddox''{{'}}s crew stated that they were convinced that an attack had taken place. As a result, planes from the aircraft carriers {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}} and {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|2}} were sent to hit North Vietnamese torpedo boat bases and fuel facilities during [[Operation Pierce Arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weiner, ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' (New York: Doubleday, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zP6ODEoK7BYC&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;ots=7J35QwiWvs&amp;dq=maddox%20tonkin%20%22one%20bullet%20hole%22&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=maddox%20tonkin%20%22one%20bullet%20hole%22&amp;f=false p. 241.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Squadron Commander [[James Stockdale]] was one of the U.S. pilots flying overhead during the second alleged attack. Stockdale wrote in his 1984 book ''Love and War'': "[I] had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets—there were no PT boats there ... There was nothing there but black water and American fire power." Stockdale at one point recounts seeing {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951|2}} pointing her guns at ''Maddox''.&lt;ref name="Jim Stockdale, Sybil Stockdale 1984"&gt;{{Cite book| title=In Love and War: The Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam Years |first=Jim |last=Stockdale |first2=Sybil |last2=Stockdale |isbn=0-06-015318-0 |publisher=Harpercollins |edition=1st |year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockdale said his superiors ordered him to keep quiet about this. After he was captured, this knowledge became a heavy burden.

In the fall of 1999, retired Senior CIA Engineering Executive [[S. Eugene Poteat]] wrote that he was asked in early August 1964 to determine if the radar operator's report showed a real torpedo boat attack or an imagined one. He asked for further details on time, weather and surface conditions. No further details were forthcoming. In the end he concluded that there were no torpedo boats on the night in question, and that the [[White House]] was interested only in confirmation of an attack, not that there was no such attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbp.org/pages/publications/BENTFeatures/F99Poteat.pdf |first=S.

In October 2012 retired Rear Admiral, Lloyd "Joe" Vasey, was interviewed by David Day on Asia Review and gave a detailed account of the August 4 incident. According to Admiral Vasey, who was aboard {{USS|Oklahoma City|CL-91|6}}, a {{sclass-|Galveston|cruiser|0}} [[guided missile cruiser]], in the Gulf of Tonkin and serving as chief of staff to Commander Seventh Fleet, ''Turner Joy'' intercepted an NVA radio transmission ordering a torpedo boat attack on ''Turner Joy'' and ''Maddox''. Shortly thereafter, radar contact of "several high speed contacts closing in on them" was acquired by the USS ''Turner Joy'', which locked on to one of the contacts, fired and struck the torpedo boat. There were 18 witnesses, both enlisted and officers, who reported various aspects of the attack; smoke from the stricken torpedo boat, torpedo wakes (reported by four separate individuals on each destroyer), sightings of the torpedo boats moving through the water and searchlights. All 18 of the witnesses testified at a hearing in Olongapo, Philippines, and their testimony is a matter of public record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYKgqBeLcLs |title=Gulf of Tonkin: The Record Set Straight | date=Fall 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, as the incident's 50th anniversary approached, John White wrote ''The Gulf of Tonkin Events—Fifty Years Later: A Footnote to the History of the Vietnam War''. In the foreword, he notes "Among the many books written on the Vietnamese war, half a dozen note a 1967 letter to the editor of a Connecticut newspaper which was instrumental in pressuring the Johnson administration to tell the truth about how the war started.  The letter was mine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1494719800/ The Gulf of Tonkin Events—Fifty Years Later: A Footnote to the History of the Vietnam War [49&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The story discusses Lt. White reading Admiral Stockdale's ''In Love and War''&lt;ref name="Jim Stockdale, Sybil Stockdale 1984"/&gt; in the mid-80s, then contacting Stockdale who connected White with Joseph Schaperjahn, chief sonarman on ''Turner Joy''. Schaperjahn confirmed White's assertions that ''Maddox''{{'}}s sonar reports were faulty and the Johnson administration knew it prior to going to Congress to request support for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. White's book explains the difference between lies of commission and lies of omission. Johnson was guilty of willful lies of omission. White was featured in the August 2014 issue of ''Connecticut Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/August-2014/50-Years-After-the-Golf-of-Tonkin-Vietnam-Vet-John-White-Looks-Back-at-the-Incident-that-Sparked-War/ the August 2014 issue of ''Connecticut Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140806192440/http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/August-2014/50-Years-After-the-Golf-of-Tonkin-Vietnam-Vet-John-White-Looks-Back-at-the-Incident-that-Sparked-War/ |date=August 6, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==NSA report==
In October 2005 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that [[Robert J. Hanyok]], a historian for the U.S. [[National Security Agency]], concluded that the NSA distorted intelligence reports passed to policy makers regarding the August 4, 1964 incident. The NSA historian agency staff "[[Stovepiping|deliberately skewed]]" the evidence to make it appear that an attack had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shane, Scott|title=Vietnam War Intelligence 'Deliberately Skewed,' Secret Study Says|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 2, 2005|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1202-06.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204024403/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1202-06.htm|archivedate=December 4, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanyok's conclusions were initially published in the Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition of ''Cryptologic Quarterly''&lt;ref name="CQ"&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_quarterly/Skunks.pdf "Skunks, Bogies, Silent Hounds, and the Flying Fish: The Gulf of Tonkin Mystery, 2–4 August 1964"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011150926/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_quarterly/Skunks.pdf |date=October 11, 2013 }}; ''Cryptologic Quarterly'', Vols. 19/20, Nos. 4–1&lt;/ref&gt; about five years before the ''Times'' article. According to intelligence officials, the view of government historians that the report should become public was rebuffed by policy makers concerned that comparisons might be made to intelligence used to justify the [[Iraq War]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom) which commenced in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/17620.html Robert J. Hanyok: His United States National Security Council study on Tonkin Gulf Deception]. (October 31, 2005). ''[[The New York Times]]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824095905/http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/17620.html |date=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the NSA's archives, Hanyok concluded that the incident began at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]], where intelligence analysts mistakenly believed the destroyers would soon be attacked. This would have been communicated back to the NSA along with evidence supporting such a conclusion, but in fact the evidence did not do that. Hanyok attributed this to the deference that the NSA would have likely given to the analysts who were closer to the event. As the evening progressed, further [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) did not support any such ambush, but the NSA personnel were apparently so convinced of an attack that they ignored the 90% of SIGINT that did not support that conclusion, and that was also excluded from any reports they produced for the consumption by the President. There was no political motive to their action.&lt;ref name="CQ"/&gt;{{rp|48–49}}

On November 30, 2005, the NSA released a first installment of previously classified information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident, including a moderately sanitized version of Mr. Hanyok's article.&lt;ref name="NSA2005"/&gt; The Hanyok article stated that intelligence information was presented to the [[Template:LBJohnson cabinet|Johnson administration]] "in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events." Instead, "only information that supported the claim that the communists had attacked the two destroyers was given to Johnson administration officials."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/nsa/spartans/chapter5.pdf Hanyok article (page 177)]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to why this happened, Hanyok wrote:

{{quote|As much as anything else, it was an awareness that President Johnson would brook no uncertainty that could undermine his position. Faced with this attitude, [[Ray Cline]] was quoted as saying "...&amp;nbsp;we knew it was bum dope that we were getting from [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]], but we were told only to give facts with no elaboration on the nature of the evidence. Everyone knew how volatile LBJ was. He did not like to deal with uncertainties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/gulf_of_tonkin/articles/rel1_skunks_bogies.pdf|title=NSA.gov|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131235457/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/gulf_of_tonkin/articles/rel1_skunks_bogies.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hanyok included his study of Tonkin Gulf as one chapter in an overall history of NSA involvement and American SIGINT, in the [[Indochina Wars]]. A moderately [[Sanitization (classified information)|sanitized]] version of the overall history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/nsa/spartans/index.html|title=Spartans in Darkness: American SIGINT and the Indochina War, 1945–1975|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in January 2008 by the National Security Agency and published by the [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j-5IKhFZ-bFe_Nc957JypHhNTMxQ Report reveals Vietnam War hoaxes, faked attacks.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200214/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j-5IKhFZ-bFe_Nc957JypHhNTMxQ |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning''' ('''HVAC'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |chapter-url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hvac |contribution=HVAC |title=Merriam–Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of [[mechanical engineering]], based on the principles of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. "[[Refrigeration]]" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation, as '''HVAC&amp;R''' or '''HVACR''' or "ventilation" is dropped, as in '''HACR''' (as in the designation of HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).

HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals, on ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and [[Sick building syndrome|healthy building]] conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.

Ventilating or [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (the ''V'' in HVAC)  is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.

Ventilation includes both the exchange of air to the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''[[Natural ventilation|natural]]'' types.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The three major functions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance costs. HVAC systems can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as [[room air distribution]].&lt;ref name="Rock and Zhu"&gt;''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', Rock and Zhu, [[ASHRAE]], Inc., [[New York (state)|New York]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual systems ===
In modern buildings, the design, installation, and [[HVAC control system|control system]]s of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or [[Building engineering|building services]] engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building.

=== District networks ===
Although HVAC is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces (like [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD's]] underground headquarters), the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger [[district heating]] (DH) or [[district cooling]] (DC) network, or a combined DHC network. In such cases, the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed, and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system. For example, at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating, or for the overall heating-portion of the DHC network (likely with energy added to boost the temperature).&lt;ref&gt;Rezaie B., Rosen M.A. (2012).

== History ==
{{see also|Air conditioning#History}}
HVAC is based on inventions and discoveries made by [[Nikolay Lvov]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Willis Carrier]], [[Edwin Ruud]], [[Reuben Trane]], [[James Joule]], [[William Rankine]], [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swenson | first=S. Don | title=HVAC: heating, ventilating, and air conditioning | year=1995 | publisher=American Technical Publishers | location=Homewood, Illinois | isbn=978-0-8269-0675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple inventions within this time frame preceded the beginnings of first comfort air conditioning system, which was designed in 1902 by Alfred Wolff (Cooper, 2003) for the New York Stock Exchange, while Willis Carrier equipped the Sacketts-Wilhems Printing Company with the process AC unit the same year. Coyne College was the first school to offer HVAC training in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration|url=https://www.coynecollege.edu/programs/hvac|website=Coyne College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the [[industrial revolution]], and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.

== Heating ==
{{main|Central heating}}
{{Redirect|Heater}}
Heaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via [[central heating]]. Such a system contains a [[boiler]], [[furnace]], or [[heat pump]] to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a [[furnace room]] in a home, or a [[mechanical room]] in a large building. The heat can be transferred by [[convection]], conduction, or [[radiation]].

=== Generation ===
[[File:Panna.jpg|thumb|upright|Central heating unit]]
Heaters exist for various types of fuel, including [[Fuel#Solid fuel|solid fuels]], [[Fuel#Liquid fuel|liquids]], and [[Fuel#Gaseous fuels|gases]]. Another type of heat source is [[Electric heating|electricity]], normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire (see [[Nichrome]]). This principle is also used for baseboard heaters and [[Space heater|portable heaters]]. Electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems.

The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iain_Staffell/publication/255759857_A_review_of_domestic_heat_pumps/links/0c96052a39c98d9227000000.pdf 9291&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps can extract heat from [[Heat pump#Heat sources and sinks|various sources]], such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.

=== Distribution ===

==== Water/steam ====
In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older [[Water heating#Gravity-fed system|gravity-fed systems]]). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using [[radiator (heating)|radiator]]s, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.

The use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as [[hydronics]]. The heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing.

Warm air systems distribute heated air through duct work systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles.

=== Dangers ===
The use of furnaces, space heaters, and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], [[formaldehyde]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, and other combustion byproducts. Incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen; the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts, most dangerously carbon monoxide, which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bearg | first=David W. | title=Indoor Air Quality and HVAC Systems | year=1993 | publisher=Lewis Publishers | location=New York | pages=107–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without proper ventilation, carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm (0.1%). However, at several hundred ppm, carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen. The primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects. Carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) and can also trigger heart attacks. Neurologically, carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination, vigilance, and continuous performance. It can also affect time discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dianat, Nazari | first=I,I | title=Characteristic of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in Northwest Iran- Tabriz | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ | publisher=International Journal of Injury Control and Promotion | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ventilation==
{{Main|Ventilation (architecture)}}
Ventilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control temperature or remove any combination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, or carbon dioxide, and to replenish oxygen. Ventilation includes both the exchange of air with the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''natural'' types.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical or forced ventilation ===
[[File:HVAC Ventilation Exhaust.jpg|thumb|HVAC ventilation exhaust for a 12-story building]]
Mechanical, or forced, ventilation is provided by an [[air handler]] (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess [[humidity]], odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.

Kitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity. Factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate (which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size) and noise level. [[Direct drive mechanism|Direct drive]] fans are available for many applications, and can reduce maintenance needs.

Ceiling [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] and table/floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants. Because hot air rises, ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor.

=== Natural ventilation ===
[[File:N&amp;AMOV - Schoolroom - Impulsion.png|thumb|Ventilation on the [[downdraught]] system, by impulsion, or the [[Plenum space|'plenum' principle]], applied to schoolrooms (1899)]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Chimney]] --&gt;
Natural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems. It can be via operable windows, louvers, or [[trickle vent]]s when spaces are small and the architecture permits. In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside ([[stack effect]]), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. [[Air conditioning]] systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side [[Economizer#HVAC|economizers]] also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.

An important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or [[air changes per hour]]: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a [[wind tunnel]] which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2012-12-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Room pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room. Positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted, and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Geoffrey | title=Room Air Change Rate | url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/roomairchangerates.htm | publisher=A Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Airborne diseases====
Natural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis. Opening doors, windows, and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Escombe |first=A. R. |last2=Oeser |first2=C. C. |last3=Gilman |first3=R. H. |title=Natural ventilation for the prevention of airborne contagion |journal=PLoS Med |year=2007 |volume=4 |issue=68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air conditioning ==
{{Main|Air conditioning}}
An air conditioning system, or a standalone air conditioner, provides cooling and [[Air conditioning#Humidity control|humidity control]] for all or part of a building. Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions. Outside, fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section, creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical fresh air intake is about 10%.

Air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through [[thermal radiation|radiation]], convection, or [[Thermal conduction|conduction]]. Refrigeration conduction media such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as [[refrigerant]]s. A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|compressor]] is used to drive thermodynamic [[refrigeration cycle]], or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).

=== Refrigeration cycle ===
{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]
The refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool.
* The system refrigerant starts its cycle in a gaseous state. The '''compressor''' pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature.
* From there it enters a heat exchanger (sometimes called a '''condensing coil''' or condenser) where it loses energy (heat) to the outside, cools, and condenses into its liquid phase.
* An '''[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]]''' (also called metering device) regulates the refrigerant liquid to flow at the proper rate.
* The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an '''evaporating coil''' or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs energy (heat) from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.

In variable climates, the system may include a [[reversing valve]] that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer. By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means, and with the same hardware.

=== Free cooling ===
{{main|Free cooling}}
Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a [[heat sink]] when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.

Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the [[enthalpy]] of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.

=== Packaged vs. split system===
Central, "all-air" air-conditioning systems (or package systems) with a combined outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in North American residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required. (Minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations.) Outside of North America, packaged systems are only used in limited applications involving large indoor space such as stadiums, theatres or exhibition halls.

An alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in [[Split-system air conditioner|split systems]]. Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in the North America. In the North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings.

With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.

Split systems are more efficient and the footprint is typically smaller than the package systems. On the other hand, package systems tend to have slightly lower indoor noise level compared to split system since the fan motor is located outside.

=== Dehumidification ===
Dehumidification (air drying) in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator. Since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the [[dew point]], moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes. This moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.

A [[dehumidifier]] is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building. It is often employed in basements which have a higher [[relative humidity]] because of their lower temperature (and propensity for damp floors and walls). In food retailing establishments, large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air. Conversely, a humidifier increases the humidity of a building.

=== Maintenance ===
All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauzy material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.

Because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.

==Energy efficiency==
Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Facilities Tool: HVAC System Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/9/hvac/system-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.

===Heating energy===
In the past, water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the United States. Today, [[forced air]] systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular.

Some benefits of forced air systems, which are now widely used in churches, schools and high-end residences, are
* Better air conditioning effects
* Energy savings of up to 15-20%
* Even conditioning{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
A drawback is the installation cost, which can be slightly higher than traditional HVAC systems.

Energy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control [[zone valve]]s, and in forced air systems they control [[zone damper]]s inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature.

[[Forecasting (heating)|Forecasting]] is another method of controlling building heating by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit.

===Ground source heat pump===
{{Main|Geothermal heat pump}}
Ground source, or geothermal, heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps, but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air, they rely on the stable, even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning. Many regions experience seasonal temperature extremes, which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings. For example, a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in Montana's {{convert|-70|°F|°C|lk=on}} low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the US—{{convert|134|°F|°C}} in [[Death Valley]], California, in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures. A few feet below the earth's surface, however, the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. Utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth, a heating or cooling system's capacity can often be significantly reduced. Although ground temperatures vary according to latitude, at {{convert|6|ft|m}} underground, temperatures generally only range from {{convert|45|to|75|°F|°C}}.

An example of a geothermal heat pump that uses a body of water as the heat sink, is the system used by the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago, Illinois. This building is situated on the [[Chicago River]], and uses cold river water by pumping it into a recirculating cooling system, where heat exchangers transfer heat from the building into the water, and then the now-warmed water is pumped back into the Chicago River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Future of the City: Tall Buildings and Urban Design|last = Al-Kodmany|first = Kheir|publisher = WIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-84564-410-9|location = |pages = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they may be more costly to install than regular heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps can produce markedly lower energy bills – 30 to 40 percent lower, according to estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Geothermal heat pumps still provide higher efficiency than air source heat pumps. Some models provide 70% saving compared to electric resistance heaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=geothermal heat pumps and power saving|url=https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/types-of-electric-heat-pumps-and-their-advantages|website=ny-engineers.com|accessdate=30 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation energy recovery===
[[Energy recovery]] systems sometimes utilize [[heat recovery ventilation]] or [[energy recovery ventilation]] systems that employ [[heat exchanger]]s or [[thermal wheel|enthalpy wheel]]s to recover [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat]] from exhausted air. This is done by transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air.

===Air conditioning energy===
The performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/thermodynamics/thermodynamic-cycles/heating-and-air-conditioning/#Vapor-compression_Cycle_8211_Vapor-compression_Refrigeration|title=Heating and Air Conditioning|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is limited by [[Second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. These air conditioning and heat pump devices ''move'' heat rather than convert it from one form to another, so ''[[Thermal efficiency|thermal efficiencies]]'' do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices. The Coefficient-of-Performance (COP) measures performance, but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted. Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (''EER'') has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a {{convert|35|C|F}} outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (''SEER''), or in Europe the [[ESEER]], is used. SEER ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant {{convert|35|°C}} outdoor temperature. The current industry minimum SEER rating is 14 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Does SEER Stand For?|url = http://allclimate.net/2014/11/26/seer-stand/|website = allclimate.net|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers have pointed out some areas where efficiency of the existing hardware could be improved. For example, the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal, an economical method of manufacture, but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient. A well-designed blade could reduce electrical power required to move the air by a third.&lt;ref&gt;Keeping cool and green, ''The Economist'' 17 July 2010, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air filtration and cleaning==
{{Main|Air filter}}
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|[[Air handling unit]], used for heating, cooling, and filtering the air]]
Air cleaning and filtration removes particles, contaminants, vapors and gases from the air. The filtered and cleaned air then is used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Air cleaning and filtration should be taken in account when protecting our building environments.&lt;ref name="Howard 2003 1–63"&gt;{{citation |last=Howard |first=J |title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |year=2003 |id=2003-136 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean air delivery rate and filter performance===
Clean air delivery rate is the amount of clean air an air cleaner provides to a room or space. When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of 50 cfm. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment. Filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate.&lt;ref name="Howard 2003 1–63"/&gt;

== HVAC industry and standards ==
The HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI, [[ASHRAE]], [[SMACNA]], [[Air Conditioning Contractors of America|ACCA]], [[Uniform Mechanical Code]], [[International Building Code|International Mechanical Code]], and [[Air Movement and Controls Association|AMCA]] have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement.

The starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However, before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail, as [[pressurization]] is an important consideration.

=== International ===
[[ISO 16813]]:2006 is one of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] building environment standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ISO|title=Building environment standards|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=54740|publisher=www.iso.org|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It establishes the general principles of building environment design. It takes into account the need to provide a healthy indoor environment for the occupants as well as the need to protect the environment for future generations and promote collaboration among the various parties involved in building environmental design for sustainability. ISO16813 is applicable to new construction and the retrofit of existing buildings.&lt;ref name=iso16813&gt;{{cite web | author=ISO | title=Building environment design—Indoor environment—General principles | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41300 | accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building environmental design standard aims to:&lt;ref name=iso16813 /&gt;

* provide the constraints concerning sustainability issues from the initial stage of the design process, with building and plant life cycle to be considered together with owning and operating costs from the beginning of the design process;
* assess the proposed design with rational criteria for indoor air quality, thermal comfort, acoustical comfort, visual comfort, energy efficiency and HVAC system controls at every stage of the design process;
* iterate decisions and evaluations of the design throughout the design process.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
{{Main|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers}}
In the United States, HVAC engineers generally are members of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers ([[ASHRAE]]), EPA Universal [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] certified (for installation and service of CFC HVAC devices), or locally engineer certified such as a Special to Chief Boilers License issued by the state or, in some jurisdictions, the city. ASHRAE is an international technical society for all individuals and organizations interested in HVAC. The Society, organized into regions, chapters, and student branches, allows exchange of HVAC knowledge and experiences for the benefit of the field's practitioners and the public. ASHRAE provides many opportunities to participate in the development of new knowledge via, for example, research and its many technical committees. These committees typically meet twice per year at the ASHRAE Annual and Winter Meetings. A popular product show, the AHR Expo, is held in conjunction with each winter meeting. The Society has approximately 50,000 members and has headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The most recognized standards for HVAC design are based on ASHRAE data. The most general of four volumes of the ASHRAE Handbook is Fundamentals; it includes heating and cooling calculations. Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The design professional must consult ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include items from [[SMACNA]], [[ACGIH]], and technical trade journals.

American design standards are legislated in the Uniform Mechanical Code or International Mechanical Code. In certain states, counties, or cities, either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes. These codes are updated and published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ([[IAPMO]]) or the International Code Council ([[International Code Council|ICC]]) respectively, on a 3-year code development cycle. Typically, local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties.

HVAC professionals in the US can receive training through formal training institutions, where most earn [[associate degree]]s. Training for HVAC technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks, and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional HVAC technician for a temporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvactraining.net/training/ |title=HVAC Training |publisher=HVACTraining.net |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVAC techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning, heat pumps, gas heating, and commercial refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052206/http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-date=2011-10-06 |title=Certification basics/101 |publisher=NATE |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== United Kingdom ====
The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] is a body that covers the essential [[Service (systems architecture)]] that allow buildings to operate. It includes the electrotechnical, [[heating]], [[ventilating]], air conditioning, refrigeration and [[plumbing]] industries. To [[train]] as a [[Building services engineering|building services engineer]], the [[academic]] requirements are GCSEs (A-C) / Standard Grades (1-3) in Maths and Science, which are important in measurements, planning and theory. Employers will often want a [[academic degree|degree]] in a branch of engineering, such as building environment [[engineering]], electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. To become a full member of CIBSE, and so also to be registered by the [[Engineering Council UK]] as a chartered engineer, engineers must also attain an Honours Degree and a master's degree in a relevant engineering subject.

CIBSE publishes several guides to HVAC design relevant to the UK market, and also the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. These guides include various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations, and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:
* Guide A: Environmental Design
* Guide B: Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration
* Guide C: Reference Data
* Guide D: Transportation systems in Buildings
* Guide E: Fire Safety Engineering
* Guide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings
* Guide G: Public Health Engineering
* Guide H: Building Control Systems
* Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data
* Guide K: Electricity in Buildings
* Guide L: Sustainability
* Guide M: Maintenance Engineering and Management

Within the [[construction]] sector, it is the job of the building services engineer to [[design]] and oversee the installation and maintenance of the essential services such as gas, [[electricity]], water, heating and [[lighting]], as well as many others. These all help to make buildings comfortable and healthy places to live and work in. Building Services is part of a sector that has over 51,000 businesses and employs represents 2%-3% of the [[GDP]].

=== Australia ===
The Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia (AMCA), Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH), Australian Refrigeration Mechanical Association and CIBSE are responsible.

=== Asia ===
Asian architectural temperature-control have different priorities than European methods. For example, Asian heating traditionally focuses on maintaining [[Underfloor heating#History|temperatures of objects such as the floor]] or furnishings such as [[Kotatsu]] tables and directly warming people, as opposed to the Western focus, in modern periods, on designing air systems.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippine Society of Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (PSVARE) along with Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME) govern on the codes and standards for HVAC / MVAC (MVAC means "mechanical ventilation and air conditioning") in the Philippines.

====India====
The Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) was established to promote the HVAC industry in India. ISHRAE is an associate of ASHRAE. ISHRAE was started at [[Delhi]] in 1981 and a chapter was started in Bangalore in 1989. Between 1989 &amp; 1993, ISHRAE chapters were formed in all major cities in India.

'''Janet Iwasa''' is a [[data visualization]] expert and assistant professor of biochemistry at the [[University of Utah]], renowned for her contributions to molecular and cellular visualizations.

== Early life and education ==
Janet Iwasa was born in 1978 in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana. When her father joined the [[National Institutes of Health]], her family moved to Maryland.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{Cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Sharon|title=Meeting Janet Iwasa |url=https://biobeat.nigms.nih.gov/2014/08/meet-janet-iwasa/ |access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleichman"&gt;Fleichman, John (February 2009). "[http://www.ascb.org/files/0902profile.pdf ASCB Profile: Janet Iwasa]" (PDF). ASCB Newsletter: 39–41. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasa was the youngest child in the family, and she grew up determined to be different from her two older brothers. Her father's career in physics inspired her to become a scientist herself. In high school, she participated in a summer internship at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute|Institute for Genomic Research]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;

In 1999, she graduated ''magna cum laude'' from [[Williams College|Williams college]] with bachelor's degrees in Biology and Asian Studies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Janet Iwasa, Ph.D., University of Utah, [https://biochem.web.utah.edu/iwasa/bio.html Curriculum Vita]&lt;/ref&gt; In her junior year at Williams, she joined Professor Robert Savage's lab, studying the formation of segmented patterns in leeches on a cellular level.&lt;ref&gt;''rpsci98 - BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT'', https://science.williams.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/72/files/RS98html/RepSci98Web-BIOLOGY.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she received her PhD in [[cell biology]] from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] for her research on the [[actin]] [[cytoskeleton]].

Iwasa became invested in microscopy during her first year at UCSF. In Dyche Mullins' lab, she studied actin networks in motile cells. During lab meetings with [[Ronald Vale|Ron Vale]]'s group, she gained knowledge about kinesin structure and function. When she viewed a [[kinesin]] animation by [[Graham Johnson (scientist)|Graham Johnson]], she was inspired to pursue 3D animation. With Dyche's approval, Iwasa began taking animation classes at [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Iwasa, Janet H. "Crafting a Career in Molecular Animation." ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', vol. 25, no. 19, 29 Oct. 2014, pp. 2891–2893. ''NCBI'', {{doi|10.1091/mbc.e14-01-0699}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, she studied animation at the Gnomon School for Visual Effects in Hollywood, California. She was the oldest student in her Gnomon animation course, as well as the only woman. She applied her skills in animation to biology, bringing cellular functions and interactions to life.&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;

== Career and research ==
In 2006, Iwasa began working as a [[postdoctoral]] fellow under [[Jack W. Szostak|Jack Szostak]] with [[Harvard University]] and the Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Szostak Lab: [http://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/past.html Former Post-Doctoral Fellows]". Molecular Biology. Harvard Medical School. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Iwasa gained teaching experience at [[Harvard Medical School]] with a course named "Visualizing Molecular Processes with Maya." In this course, she worked as a teaching assistant, writing tutorials and supervising projects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also worked with another software platform at Harvard called Massive, adapting a program designed for video game animation to depict the process of nucleation elongation.&lt;ref name="Fleichman" /&gt;

In 2008, Iwasa created and presented a multimedia exhibit for the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston Museum of Science]] titled ''Exploring Life's Origins''.

In 2008, she became a lecturer in Molecular Visualization for the Department of Cell Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her position at Harvard was modeled around her own research interests and her contributions to the scientists at the university. Her work with Joan Brugge and Michael Overholtzer furthered understanding of a newly discovered cellular process called endosis. Endosis involves the invasion of one cell into another, where the intruder proliferates inside the host cell until it is digested by the host or forcibly pushes its way back out. Iwasa's questions and requirements for the model forced researchers to investigate the endosis mechanism in greater detail to accurately engineer an animation of this process.&lt;ref name="Fleichman" /&gt;

While working with Tomas Kirchausen, she created an animation on [[clathrin-mediated endocytosis]], researching how [[clathrin triskelion]]s operated and assembled on the inner surface of the plasma membrane to invaginate an extracellular particle.&lt;ref name="Fleichman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2010, Iwasa organized and taught a course on visualizing molecular and cellular processes with 3D animation in Porto, Portugal. In 2013, she joined the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]] as a research assistant professor for the Department of Cell Biology. She returned to Portugal in 2014 to teach a 3D animation workshop for scientific animation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014, she also completed a project called Molecular Flipbook&lt;ref&gt;http://molecularflipbook.org/&lt;/ref&gt;, a free, open-source software program designed to animate molecules. In 2016, Iwasa released a life-cycle animation on [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]. Her project used animation to illustrate the molecular mechanisms the virus utilizes to enter into and exit target cells.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasa, Janet. [https://biochem.web.utah.edu/iwasa/projects/HIV.html "Visualizing HIV Entry and Egress."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Publications ===
In addition to her university work, Iwasa's renowned molecular and cellular visualizations have been featured in numerous scientific journals including ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', and ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'', as well as the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Erik (15 November 2010). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16animate.html Molecular Animation: Where Cinema and Biology Meet]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Janet Iwasa". [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/secretlife/technology/janet-iwasa/ Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers]. PBS. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iwasa's knowledge of cellular animation has also led her to publish several different works of scientific literature. Her work with Robert Savage's Lab led to her first publication in 2000 in ''Development Genes and Evolution'', "The leech hunchback protein is expressed in the [[epithelium]] and [[Central nervous system|CNS]] but not in the segmental precursor lineages", with co-authors Suver and Savage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Iwasa, J. H, et al. “The Leech Hunchback Protein Is Expressed in the Epithelium and CNS but Not in the Segmental Precursor Lineages.” ''Development Genes and Evolution'', vol. 210, no. 6, 19 May 2000, pp. 277–288. ''Springer Nature '', {{doi|10.1007/s004270050315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasa's work with Savage focused on identifying regulatory genes engaged in the formation of segment patterns in annelids, investigating a gene in leeches called Leech Zinc Finger II (LZF2), considered to be an [[Sequence homology|orthologue]] of the ''hunchback (hb)'' gene in ''[[Drosophila]]''. Iwasa, Savage, and Suver concluded that LZF2 likely plays an important part in the morphological progressions of [[gastrulation]] and the specification of the central nervous system in leeches but does not contribute to the formation of [[Anatomical terms of location|anteroposterior]] patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007, she published an article on her research at the University of California with Mullins, "Spatial and temporal relationships between actin-filament nucleation, capping, and disassembly."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Iwasa JH, Mullins RD. Spatial and temporal relationships between actin-filament nucleation, capping, and disassembly. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17331727 Curr Biol]. 2007 Mar 6; 17(5):395-406&lt;/ref&gt; Her study with Mullins focused on the [[Lamellipodium|lamellipodial]] network. They concluded that the lamellipodial network incorporates the [[Arp2/3 complex|Arp 2/3]] complex and [[Capping protein (actin filament) muscle Z-line, alpha 1|capping proteins]] during initial assembly, but dismisses these complexes long before the lamellipodial network is actually disassembled. They also reported that the network does not use [[cofilin]], twinfilin, and [[tropomyosin]] in assembly. Instead these factors play a role in the network's size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2010, Iwasa published "Animating the model figure" in ''Trends Cell Biol.''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Iwasa JH (2010). [http://www.cell.com/trends/cell-biology/fulltext/S0962-8924(10)00155-8 Animating the model figure]. ''Trends Cell Biol'', ''20''(12), 699-704.&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, she points out the importance of animations in revealing and teaching scientific concepts, explaining that students are shown to retain more information and show more interest in the material when animations are incorporated into the curriculum. She also pushed the invention of ananimation software engineered exclusively for the scientific research community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2015, she released her textbook, ''Karp's Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments'', with co-authors Gerald Karp and Wallace Marshal.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasa, JH and Marshall, W (December 2015). ''[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP003376.html Karp's Cell Biology]: Concepts and Experiments'' (8). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Iwasa published "The Scientist as Illustrator" in ''Trends Immunol.''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Iwasa JH (2016). "[http://www.cell.com/trends/immunology/fulltext/S1471-4906(16)00022-3 The Scientist as Illustrator]". ''Trends Immunol'', ''37''(4), 247-50.&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, she elaborates on the roles of animation in science. She explains that animations help people to understand and process new ideas, communicate their theories and findings to their colleagues, and present information to the public in an engaging manner. She also explains that it is important for [[biologist]]s to learn how to communicate visually so they can avoid borrowing old models to convey new concepts and ideas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Recognition and honors ==
From 1999 to 2004, Iwasa was honored as a member of the NSF Graduate Fellowship. From 2006 to 2008, she was a member of the NSF Discpery Corps Postgraduate Fellowship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2008, she earned an honorable mention for her entry in the AAAS International Science &amp; Engineering Visualization Challenge. In 2012, she was listed as one of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''{{'}}s "100 Most Creative People."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Patrick (27 April 2012).

'''John Safer''' (born September 6, 1922) is an [[United States|American]] [[sculptor]]. Safer's varied career spans work in [[Stage lighting|theater lighting]], television, [[real estate]], politics and banking.

Safer is best known for his monumental sculptures, but he has also created many smaller works.  These include award sculptures for organizations such as the [[National Air and Space Museum]], the [[PGA (golf)|PGA Tour]], the [[Georgetown University Medical Center|Georgetown University Lombardi Cancer Center]], the World Peace Foundation, and the Shakespeare Guild.

Safer's works stand in museums, galleries and embassies throughout the world. In 1972 and in 1989 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] sent a group of Safer sculptures abroad to be exhibited as examples of America's finest art.

==Sculpture==

Safer's earliest sculptures in the 1950s and 1960s were small works of [[Lucite]].  Over time he also began to work in [[bronze]] and [[stainless steel]].  The pieces became larger and in 1979 his first public commission, ''Judgment'',  a multi-ton [[patinated]] [[bronze]],  was installed at [[Harvard Law School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge,Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3hQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+safer++harvard+judgment&amp;dq=john+safer++harvard+judgment&amp;ei=ydmNSK2wK4HAigHzodnMCA&amp;pgis=1&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first in a long string of public installations.

As the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] grew in number they grew in size as well. ''Interplay'', created in 1987, is {{convert|18|ft|m}} high.  ''Leading Edge'', created in 1989, is {{convert|20|ft|m}} high.   His hallmark work,  ''Ascent'', which stands at the entrance of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] [[Udvar-Hazy Center]] at [[Dulles Airport]] in [[Virginia]],  is {{convert|75|ft|m}} high.

"Through his work, John has tried to capture the essence ... and reduce the subject to the pure line in space that [[Aristotle]] believed to be the basis of sculpture."[http://www.johnsafer.com/library/porsuits.html]

==Early life==

John Safer was born and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]], the only child of John and Rebecca Safer. His father, who operated a moving and storage business, was a [[lawyer]] who graduated from [[Georgetown University Law School]] at the head of his class. His mother Rebecca was a [[social activist]], [[suffragette]] and intellectual. John learned to read and write by the age of four. At this time his mother entered him into first grade at the Maret French School.

Safer continued as a precocious student. Fluent in [[French language|French]], he entered high school at the age of eleven and graduated when he was fourteen.  He was pressured by his mother to enroll at [[Harvard University]].  Safer, uncomfortable at the thought of being a fourteen-year-old college student, deliberately failed the Harvard entrance exam by handing in blank pages. [http://www.johnsafer.com/library/porsuits.html]

Safer instead attended Woodward Prep School.  There he discovered his love for and ability in [[Sport|athletics]].  This theme would greatly influence his art and his life.  Until then, his age and size had prevented him from participating in sports and left him with the sense that he was a misfit.

At the age of sixteen, Safer entered [[George Washington University]] where he majored in [[economics]]. He became an assistant to Professor Edward Acheson –– brother of the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] –– who became a mentor.  At the beginning of [[World War II]], Safer enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] to become a [[flying cadet]].

Safer became a [[first lieutenant]] and served in [[India]], [[Burma]] and [[China]].  When the war ended in 1945 he opted for an additional year in the Air Force hoping to fulfill a dream of seeing [[Europe]]'s great works of art while he was stationed there.  His new assignment allowed him to visit the [[Parthenon]], the [[Tate]], and the [[Louvre]]. While in [[Rome]], he learned that he was suddenly to be transferred to [[Athens]].  Unwilling to leave [[Italy]] without visiting the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia]] in [[Florence]],  Safer "borrowed" a jeep to make the drive to see [[Michelangelo]]'s  ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''.  The Accademia was closed but he convinced the caretaker to let him in. The two hours Safer spent alone with the masterpiece resulted in a seminal experience, but it was Michelangelo's other sculptures in the Gallery, ''The Prisoners'', which gave Safer an insight that was to impact his entire life and transform his artistic career.

''The Prisoners'' are heroic figures rising from rough hewn stone.  The upper portion of the figures are finished while the lower part remains uncarved. As Safer studied ''The Prisoners'' he realized the power of the abstract –– a realization that gave direction to his future work.

==Businessman==
After Safer graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1949 his fascination with the emerging technology and promise of television prompted him to take a job as a [[handyman]] at [[WJW (TV)|WXEL]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  He quickly rose to the position of [[program director]].  During this time his innovations led the new independent station to "beat the ratings of all the network affiliates."[http://www.johnsafer.com/library/dossier.html]

In 1953 Safer's father became terminally ill and he returned to Washington, D.C. to take over his father's affairs.  Although Safer successfully parlayed these into a major [[real estate]] development business he did not find his commercial life a rewarding one.

In 1974 Safer entered the world of banking, becoming Chairman of the Executive Committee of Financial General Bankshares, and in 1981 the Chairman of the Board of DC National Bank which later became part of [[Bank of America]].

In 1999 Safer became Chairman of the Board of Materia, Inc.  Materia specializes in [[Olefin metathesis]], and is noted for its Nobel Prize–winning [[Green chemistry]].

Safer never formally studied art. His first forays into sculpture were experiments with plastic swizzle sticks.  In 1957 he made his first creations, and he continued to experiment, eventually beginning to carve [[Acrylic glass|Lucite]].  In 1969 Safer had his first show in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] at the Michael Berger Gallery. Several shows in private galleries followed with a major exhibition at the Pyramid Gallery in Washington, D.C.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Single Scull.JPG|thumb|150 px|''Single Scull'']] --&gt;

In 1971 the renowned art collector and [[U.S. Ambassador]] to [[Great Britain]], [[Walter Annenberg]], invited Safer to have an exhibition at the [[Embassy of the United States in London|American Embassy in London]].

In 1972 President [[Gerald Ford]] presented Safer's ''Limits of Infinity'' to King [[Juan Carlos of Spain]] as a gift of state. This in turn led to several major events in Safer's sculptural career. As a result of a news report of President Ford's gift, the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Harvard Law School sought to acquire a Safer sculpture for the school.  This culminated in 1979 with the installation of ''Judgment'',  a monumental bronze work which was presented to Harvard Law School as a gift of Safer's class of 1949. This was Safer's first monumental public work.

[[John H. McArthur|John McArthur]], the Dean of [[Harvard Business School]] visited the palace at [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] where King Juan Carlos had installed ''Limits of Infinity''. Moved by the sculpture, Dean McArthur returned to America and commissioned Safer's {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} ''Search'' for Harvard Business School.  The patinated bronze was installed on the Business School grounds in 1984 adjacent to the spot where Safer's daughter, Janine, received her [[MBA]] five days later.

In 1985 Safer was invited to exhibit sculpture in the Pioneers of Flight Hall at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] [[National Air and Space Museum]], in Washington, D.C. He has the distinction of being the only artist to have ever had an exhibition in the central gallery of the most visited museum in the
world.[https://books.google.com/books?id=O3hQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+safer++harvard+judgment&amp;dq=john+safer++harvard+judgment&amp;ei=79qNSOvcM4LKigGxn8DVCA&amp;pgis=1]

In 1989 the [[U.S. Department of State]] again sent Safer sculptures to Europe. As of 2008, the Department has exhibited Safer sculpture in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Beijing]], [[Dublin]], [[Bern]], [[Lisbon]], [[Brussels]], [[Bucharest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], Washington, and New Deli.  Both public and private exhibitions of Safer sculpture can be seen in venues throughout the world.

Safer continues to create sculpture.   He works with his stepdaughter Kathryn Scott, to whom he taught his trade and offered his mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|937nceDukO8|For his contribution to Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer Center, John Safer receives the Margaret Hodges Leadership award at the 2007 Lombardi Gala in Washington DC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they began work on a monumental sculpture, Quest,  for the [[Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute]]. The {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} stainless steel fabricated sculpture and state of the art research center, the [[Robert H. and Clarice Smith Building]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/Johns_Hopkins_Holds_RibbonCutting_Ceremony_for_New_Wilmer_Eye_Institute_Building&lt;/ref&gt;  was dedicated two years later, on October 16, 2009,  80 years to the day after the pioneering institute's  first building made its debut. Safer, a patient, donated the multi-ton sculpture as a gift  of appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-bz.wilmerart17oct17,0,4269188.story Sharing vision his doctors saved.
 Safer donates sculpture for new Hopkins building&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest gifts of art that Johns Hopkins has received. In December 2011, Scott and Safer began work on a model for a monumental sculpture for the Marine Aviation Memorial.

Over the next ten years the Safer-Scott partners continued to collaborate on private and public projects.  The eleven foot-high (3.4 m) mirror finished, ''Interplay'',  was commissioned for the LEED wing of the $340M Kimmel Cancer Center expansion at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC. In 2014 Scott began negotiations with MGM Resorts International for a centerpiece at MGM National Harbor in Maryland. The 60 foot high (18.3 m) stainless steel sculpture, ''Unity'', weighting eighteen thousand pounds and unprecedented in its scale, was installed two years later on November 12, 2016—one month before the opening of the $1.4B resort.

Safer explains the motivation behind his sculpture:

{{quote|At its best, sculpture can give a glimpse of the relationship between that which lies within us and that which does not. I strive to make works that will elevate the human spirit. What I see and try to capture is the movement of beauty. I try to freeze a line of motion that expresses strength, power, or grace. I try to grasp and make permanent something that is ephemeral.

What I aspire to, as an artist, is contained in the [[philosophy]] of the Golden Age of [[Greece]]: Truth is beauty; nothing in excess; know thyself. The essential thought behind the creation of my Sculpture is humanity. My goal is to increase the awareness of the beauty of life for myself and for others.

I read once that [[Wolfgang Mozart|Mozart]] could conceptualize a whole [[symphony]] in an instantaneous flash. Then he would have the laborious task of committing it to paper. This struck a [[chord (music)|chord]], Mozartian I hope, in me. That's the way I create most of my sculpture. I get a kind of instantaneous flash, a look, a total concept, and then I have to give it substance, make it occupy space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsafer.com/library/harvard.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Safer credits his wife, Joy, with giving him "a new perspective on the world ... which lifted my sculpture to a level I had not previously attained."

[[File:JohnSafer Golf2012.jpg#file|thumb|left|150 px|Twenty foot putt seals Shootout win for Safer and Jack Frazee (2012)]]
Safer's interest in sports has provided the inspiration behind many of his sculptures. ''Dancer and the Dance'',  ''Serve'',  ''Before the Wind'', and ''Line of Flight'' are works that capture a line of athletic motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, Walter. Art in Flight. Hudson Hills P, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youngster, Safer was ahead of, and therefore smaller than his classmates in school, so it was later that he discovered his own athletic prowess.&lt;ref&gt;Getlein, Frank. John Safer. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Safer has awards in [[marksman]]ship, [[baseball]] and [[bowling]]. Safer, now ninety, still plays competitive [[golf]].  In November 2012, Safer and his partner Jack Frazee won the Lyford Cay Shootout. Later that week, Safer and his team won the "B" flight in the Lyford Cay Four-Ball Invitational tournament, a tournament they won in 2007, when Safer was 85.

==Honours==
Safer has been awarded two honorary degrees: [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from [[Daniel Webster College]] and Doctor of Literature from [[Lees-McRae College]].  In May 2009, Safer received a third honorary degree– [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] from [[George Washington University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~media/pressrelease.cfm?ann_id=30667&lt;/ref&gt;   Along with [[Rahm Emanuel]] and Jeanne L. Narum,  Safer delivered a commencement speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id37Iko-ma8|John Safer, GW Commencement 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[National Mall]], to the graduating class of 2009.

Safer explains the motivation behind his career:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one other basic principle that guides my work, my business career, and my life in general, and that is balance.  I believe that the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] is as good a guiding [[philosophy]] for life as you can find. In business, I adhere to it continually, trying to balance the necessity for a successful business always to move forward with the caveat that too much motion can be counterproductive or unnecessarily dangerous.  In art, the human spirit is gratified by balance, by a tonic note. And so I try to express a sense of balance and completeness in my work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnsafer.com/library/harvard.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''keyboard computer''' is a computer which contains all of the regular components of a [[personal computer]], except for a screen, in the same housing as the keyboard. The power supply is typically external and connects to the computer via an [[adapter]] cable. The motherboard is specially designed to fit inside, and the device is larger than most standard keyboards. Additional peripheral components such as a [[Computer monitor|monitor]] are connected to the computer via external [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]]. Usually no or only a minimum of storage devices is built in.

Most home computers of the late 1970s and during the 1980s were keyboard computers, the [[Commodore VIC-20]] and the [[Atari ST]] being prime examples. While this form factor went out of style around 1990 in favour for more standard PC setups, some notable [[x86]] keyboard computers have been built, like the [[Olivetti]] [[Prodest PC1]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Olivetti PC1|encyclopedia=Old-Computers.com|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=182&amp;st=1|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schneider EuroPC Series between 1988 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Schneider Euro PC|encyclopedia=Haus der Computerspiele|url=http://www.classiccomputer.de/ams/scheuropc.htm|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cybernet Manufacturing]] is still producing similar devices, using [[Intel]] [[Quad Core]] [[Central processing unit|processors]].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3654">The '''Klerer-May System''' is a [[programming language]] developed in the mid-1960s, oriented to [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] [[Computational science|scientific]] programming, whose most notable feature is its two-dimensional syntax based on traditional [[mathematical notation]].

[[File:Example of a statement in the Klerer-May programming system.png|thumbnail|Example of a statement in the Klerer-May programming language]]

For input and output, the Klerer-May system used a [[Friden Flexowriter]] modified to allow half-line motions for subscripts and superscripts.&lt;ref name="KL65a"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/2/103.abstract | title=A user oriented programming language |author1=Klerer, Melvin |author2=May, Jack | journal=The Computer Journal | year=1965 | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=103–109 | doi=10.1093/comjnl/8.2.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character set included digits, upper-case letters, subsets of 14 lower-case Latin letters and 18 Greek letters, arithmetic operators (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;−&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;×&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) and punctuation (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;), and eight special line-drawing characters (resembling  &lt;code&gt;╲&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;╱&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;⎜&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;⎨&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;⎬&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;˘&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;⁔&lt;/code&gt;) used to construct multi-line brackets and symbols for [[summation]], [[Product sign#Capital Pi notation|products]], [[Square root|roots]], and for multi-line [[Division (mathematics)|division]] or fractions.&lt;ref name="S69"&gt;{{cite book | title=Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals | publisher=Prentice-Hall | author=Sammet, Jean | year=1969 | pages=284–294 | isbn=0-13-729988-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system was intended to be forgiving of input mistakes, and easy to learn; its reference manual was only two pages.&lt;ref name="KL65b"&gt;{{cite book | title=Reference Manual | publisher=Columbia University |author1=Klerer, Melvin |author2=May, Jack | year=1965 | location=Hudson Labs, Dobbs Ferry, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was developed by [[Melvin Klerer]] and [[Jack May (computer scientist)|Jack May]] at [[Columbia University]]'s Hudson Laboratories in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]], for the [[Office of Naval Research]], and ran on [[GE-200 series]] computers.&lt;ref name="S69" /&gt;

'''Metal profile sheet''' systems are used to build efficient, reliable and cost-efficient envelopes of mostly commercial buildings. They have evolved from the single skin [[Cladding (metalworking)|metal cladding]] often associated with agricultural buildings to multi-layer systems for industrial&lt;!--, retrial ??--&gt; and leisure application. &lt;!-- However, as with all construction components, the ability of the cladding to satisfy its functional requirements is dependent on its correct specification and installation. And equally as important, on its interaction with the other elements of the building envelope and structure.  &lt;&lt; ?? --&gt;

== History ==
Trapezoidal profiles and cassettes have been known in [[Europe]] for around 100 years. Today's characteristic profile shape came to Europe from the [[United States|USA]] in the 50s and has gained relevance since about 1960. At present the proportion of load bearing, room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90%. Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training, fast assembly, and the low costs of the trapezoidal profile construction.

== Description ==
Metal profile sheets are metal structural members that due to the fact they can have different profiles, with different heights and different thickness, engineers and architects can use them for a huge variety of buildings, from a simple industrial building to a high demand design building.  
Trapezoidal profiles are large metal structural members, which, thanks to the profiling and its thickness, retain their high load bearing capability. They have been developed from the [[corrugated galvanized iron|corrugated profile]]. The profile programme offered by specific manufacturers covers a total of approx. 60 profile shapes with different heights.
Cassettes are components that are mainly used as the inner shell in dual-shell wall constructions. They are mainly used in walls today, even though they were originally designed for use in roofs.

== Specification of the metal profile ==

=== Weathertightness ===
The primary function of the cladding system is to provide a weathertight building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.
Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding.  For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through fasteners, special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage in order to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.

=== Building appearance ===
Building envelope made from metal sheet provide builders and architects with products, which meet all of the highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design. The [[steel]] from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available pre-coated in a wide range of colors and textures, allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building. Profile shape is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects.

=== Thermal performance ===
Buildings are responsible of the 40% of European energy consumption, consequently, improving the thermal performance of the cladding and associated components is very important. The elemental U-value (thermal transmittance, W/m2K) of a cladding panel, depends on the conductivity and thickness of the insulation which is added, the profile shape and the presence of thermal bridges.  
So, metal profile sheets can achieve thermal performance regulations thanks of insulations and profile shape.
It is very important to analyze and avoid all possible thermal bridges within the roof and wall cladding assembly, to minimize local heat/cold losses.

=== Acoustics ===
Roofs constructed with trapezoidal profiles have excellent sound suppression characteristics. The sound reduction assessments of up to 53&amp;nbsp;dB have been realised.  
The measured sound reduction for wall constructions using cassettes has been assessed at an RW of 57&amp;nbsp;dB. 
The acoustic performance of a particular cladding system will depend on the insulation material, the weather sheet and liner sheet profiles and the method of assembly.
To minimize reverberation architects may take advantage of the sound absorbing properties of the cladding insulation layer by replacing the standard liner sheet with a perforated liner.

=== Durability ===
In order to ensure that the building envelope remains fully functional throughout its design life, it is important that it receives regular maintenance, including inspection, removal of debris, cleaning and repair of damage. Inspection can include man-made or natural wear. Weather exposure, natural movement, installation error and manufacturing defects are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Regular Inspections Are Key to Building  Envelope Integrity|author=Arthur L. Sanders|url=http://www.hoffarch.com/assets/Journal11.pdf|publisher= Hoffmann Architects |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need of maintenance may be greatly reduced using specific coating depending on the weather conditions, this coating guarantee the expected design life of the cladding. The commonly used 302 stainless steel alone is resistant to acetic acid, acetone and boric acid, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metals and Corrosion Resistance|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-corrosion-resistance-d_491.html|publisher=The Engineering Toolbox|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
Metal profiles sheets have a high recycled scrap steel content and all steel is recyclable.  Many steel components can be unbolted and even reused for future applications.  The possibility of reusing building elements makes steel construction even more sustainable than the already significant contribution of today’s simple material recycling.  Steel can be repeatedly recycled because it does not lose any of its inherent physical properties as a result of the recycling process. Stainless steel fasteners have excellent corrosion resistance and durability, as well as being a sustainable material. Custom fasteners in this material make for the utmost of sustainability with high recyclability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Stainless Steel Fasteners, Glaser &amp; Associates, Inc.|author=Kosaku Yoshino|url=http://www.glaserbolt.com/products/stainless-steel-fasteners|publisher= Glaser &amp; Associates Inc. |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural performance ===
Metal cladding systems are required to carry externally applied loads, such as snow and wind loading without deflecting excessively or compromising the other performance requirements. The individual characteristic loads (actions) should be obtained from the appropriate part of EN 1991, taking into account the building geometry and location as applicable. These individual actions should then be combined using the appropriate safety factors from EN 1990 to obtain the load cases used in design. 
*Permanent actions:
For most application of metal cladding technology, the only permanent action which the roof cladding needs to be designed is its own self-weight.
For wall cladding, it is not normally necessary to consider permanent actions, since the self-weight acts in the plan of the cladding.  
*Variable actions:
In addition to its self-weight, the roof cladding must also be designed for the following variable actions as specified in the appropriate parts of EN 1991:
-Access for cleaning and maintenance. 
-A uniformly distributed load due to snow over the complete roof area. The value of this load will depend on the building’s location.
-Asymmetric snow load and loading due to snow drifts.
-Wind loading due to pressure and suction. 
*Deflections:
Care must be taken on site to avoid excessive local deflection.  Typical deflection limits imposed on the cladding are depend on the loading regime considered, the location of the structural component and whether a brittle material is present.  Deflection limits may be specifies by National regulation.

== Main uses ==
Metal profile sheets due to their versatility mechanical and design properties can be used as roof and roof cladding, as external walls and wall cladding and also as floors. They are used in industry and in residential sector, and the two sectors can be used in both new construction and rehabilitation. Some of the applications where metal profile sheets are used are:
*industrial buildings,
*commercial buildings,
*public buildings,
*sport buildings,
*educational buildings,
*offices and administration buildings,
*multi-storey buildings
*power plants,
*residential house,
*high design demand buildings, 
*etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5049">A '''method stub'''{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} or simply '''stub'''&lt;ref name="DaleWeems2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell B. Dale|author2=Chip Weems|title=Programming in C++|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxZBPSjSEYUC&amp;pg=PA308|year=2004|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-3234-9|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[software development]] is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality. A stub may [[simulation|simulate]] the behavior of existing code (such as a [[Subroutine|procedure]] on a remote machine, such methods are often called mocks) or be a temporary substitute for yet-to-be-developed code. Stubs are therefore most useful in [[porting]], [[distributed computing]] as well as general software development and [[Software testing|testing]].

An example of a stub in [[pseudocode]] might be as follows:

    BEGIN
        Temperature = ThermometerRead(Outside)
        IF Temperature &gt; 40 THEN
             PRINT "It's HOT!"
        END IF
    END

    BEGIN ThermometerRead(Source insideOrOutside)
         RETURN 28
    END ThermometerRead

The above pseudocode utilises the function &lt;tt&gt;ThermometerRead&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns a temperature. While &lt;tt&gt;ThermometerRead&lt;/tt&gt; would be intended to read some hardware device, this function currently does not contain the necessary code. So &lt;tt&gt;ThermometerRead&lt;/tt&gt; does not, in essence, [[Simulation|simulate]] any process, yet it ''does'' return a legal value, allowing the main program to be at least partially tested. Also note that although it accepts the [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] of type &lt;tt&gt;Source&lt;/tt&gt;, which determines whether inside or outside temperature is needed, it does not use the actual value passed ([[Argument (computer science)|argument]] &lt;tt&gt;insideOrOutside&lt;/tt&gt;) by the caller in its logic.

A stub &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a routine that doesn't actually do anything other than declaring itself and the parameters it accepts and returning something that is usually the values expected in one of the "happy scenarios" for the caller. Stubs are used commonly as placeholders for implementation of a known interface, where the [[interface (computer science)|interface]] is finalized/known but the implementation is not yet known/finalized. The stub contains just enough code to allow it to be compiled and linked with the rest of the program. In [[Remote Method Invocation|RMI]] nomenclature, a stub communicates on the server-side with a [[Skeleton (computer science)|skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the context of [[DOS]] and [[Windows]], the term ''stub'' is also used in a fashion like [[Shim (computing)|shim]] to describe the small areas of interface code left in [[conventional memory]] by [[self-relocation|self-relocating]] resident drivers which move most of themselves into [[upper memory]], the [[high memory area]], [[expanded memory|expanded]] or [[extended memory]] as well as similar stubs to allow the relocated code to communicate with [[real-mode]] DOS in conjunction with [[DOS extender]]s (like [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]], [[DOS Protected Mode Services|DPMS]], [[CLOAKING (DOS extender)|CLOAKING]] or [[NetWare I/O Subsystem|NIOS]]).

The small pieces of dummy code branched into to allow a graceful exit when invoking a [[fat binary]] in the wrong environment are also called (code) stubs.

[[Image:Handheld Electric Beater.jpg|thumb|A handheld electric mixer.]]

A '''mixer''' is a kitchen device that uses a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of "beaters" in a bowl containing the food or liquids to be prepared by mixing them. 

Mixers help automate the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. 

When the beaters are replaced by a ''dough hook'', a mixer may also be used to knead.

== Description ==
A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a handheld motorized beater, or a '''drill''' mixer. Stand mixers vary in size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by rotating the mixing device vertically (planetary mixers), or by rotating the mixing container (spiral mixers).

Mixers for the kitchen first came into use midway through the nineteenth century; the earliest were mechanical devices. The demand from commercial bakers for large-scale uniform mixing resulted in the development of the electric stand mixer. Smaller counter-top stand mixers for home kitchen use soon followed.

==History==
The mixer with rotating parts was patented in 1856 by Baltimore, Maryland [[Tinsmith|tinner]] Ralph Collier. {{US patent|16267}} This was followed by E.P. Griffith's whisk patented in England in 1857. Another hand-turned rotary egg beater was patented by J.F. and E.P. Monroe in 1859 in the US.  {{US patent|23694}} Their egg beater patent was one of the earliest bought up by the Dover Stamping Company, whose Dover egg beaters became a classic American brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/museum/object_029.html |title=Feeding America - Egg Beaters |publisher=Digital.lib.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homethingspast1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homethingspast.com/antique-egg-beaters/ |title=Early rotary egg beaters |publisher=Homethingspast.com |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monroe design was also manufactured in England.&lt;ref name="homethingspast1" /&gt; In 1870, Turner Williams of [[Providence, R.I.]], invented another Dover egg beater model. {{US patent|103811}} In 1894, Willis Johnson of Cincinnati, Ohio invented new improvements to the egg beater.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00292821&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=42F7687ED364&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=0292821.PN.%2526OS=PN/0292821%2526RS=PN/0292821|title=Patent Images|website=pdfpiw.uspto.gov|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Mixer.jpg|thumb|Whisking egg whites with a handheld electric mixer]]

The first mixer with electric motor is thought to be the one invented by American Rufus Eastman in 1885. {{US patent|330829}} &lt;ref name="google323"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XykOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q |title=Katz and Weaver, Encyclopedia of Food and Culture: Food production to Nuts, Scribner 2003, pages 323-333 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egQAAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq |title=Vegetarian Times, Oct 2002, pages 69-70 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hobart Corporation|Hobart Manufacturing Company]] was an early manufacturer of large commercial mixers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Ament |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/mixers.htm |title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Standing Mixer by Herbert Johnson in 1908 |publisher=Ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they say a new model introduced in 1914 played a key role in the mixer part of their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcorp.com/about-us/ |title=Hobart - Our History |publisher=Hobartcorp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hobart [[KitchenAid]] and [[Sunbeam Products|Sunbeam]] Mixmaster (first produced 1910) were two very early US brands of electric mixer.&lt;ref name="google323" /&gt; Domestic electric mixers were rarely used before the 1920s, when they were adopted more widely for home use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwmH6-q5O5AC&amp;dq |title=Frederik Nebeker, Dawn of the electronic age: electrical technologies in the shaping of the modern world, 1914 to 1945|publisher= Wiley|year= 2009| pages=131 and 238 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Herbert Johnson, an engineer for the Hobart Manufacturing Company, invented an electric standing mixer. His inspiration came from observing a baker mixing bread dough with a metal spoon; soon he was toying with a mechanical counterpart. By 1915, his 20 gallon (80 l) mixer was standard equipment for most large bakeries. In 1919, Hobart introduced the Kitchen Aid Food Preparer (stand mixer) for the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/mixers.htm|title=Mixer History - Invention of the Mixer|author=Phil Ament|date=5 May 2015|work=ideafinder.com|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older models of mixers originally listed each speed by name of operation (ex: Beat-Whip would be high speed if it is a 3-speed mixer); they are now listed by number.

==Variants==
===Eggbeater===
[[File:VintageMixer.jpg|thumb|A vintage hand-cranked egg beater]]
An eggbeater is a handheld device with a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] on the side geared to one or more beaters. The user grips the handle with one hand and operates the crank with the other, creating the rotary action.

A mixer is a kitchen utensil which uses a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of beaters in a bowl containing the food to be prepared. It automates the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used to knead.

A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a handheld motorized beater, or a stand mixer. Stand mixers vary in size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by rotating the mixing device vertically (planetary mixers), or by rotating the mixing container (spiral mixers).

Mixers for the kitchen first came into use midway through the nineteenth century; the earliest were mechanical devices. The demand from commercial bakers for large-scale uniform mixing resulted in the development of the electric stand mixer. Smaller counter-top stand mixers for home kitchen use soon followed.

When selecting a mixer, the purchaser should consider how the mixer will be used. Electric mixers with more speed options give the user more control over the development of the mixture.

===Stand mixer===
[[Image:Výroba chleba (8).JPG|thumb|A large volume stand mixer used in a commercial bakery to mix bread [[dough]] with a double sided dough hook]]
[[Image:KitchenAid Stand Mixer.jpg|right|thumb|A stand mixer in action on a home tabletop, with a wire whisk attachment]]
Stand mixers mount the motor driving the rotary action in a frame or stand which bears the weight of the device. Stand mixers are larger and have more powerful motors than their hand-held counterparts. They generally have a special bowl that is locked in place while the mixer is operating. A typical home stand mixer will include a wire whisk for whipping creams and egg whites; a flat beater for mixing [[Batter (cooking)|batters]]; and a dough hook for [[kneading]].

Stand mixers are generally available in either ''counter top'' (also called bench) or ''floor'' models. Heavy duty commercial models can have bowl capacities well in excess of 25 [[gallons]] (95 [[Litre|l]]) and weigh thousands of pounds (kilograms) but more typical home and light commercial models are equipped with bowls of around 1 gallon (4 l). Whether a mixer is a counter top or floor model depends on its size.  Mixers that are 5 gallons (20 l) in size or smaller tend to be counter top mixers, while larger mixers tend to be floor models due to their size and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kinnek.com/how-to-buy-mixers | title = Complete Guide To Buying Mixers | publisher = Kinnek.com | accessdate = 2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spiral mixers''' are specialist tools for mixing dough. A spiral-shaped agitator remains stationary while the bowl rotates. This method enables spiral mixers to mix the same size dough batch much quicker and with less under-mixed dough than a similarly powered planetary mixer. Spiral mixers can mix dough with less agitator friction than planetary mixers. This allows the dough to be mixed without increasing its temperature, ensuring the dough can rise properly.

'''Planetary mixers''' consist of a bowl and an agitator. The bowl remains static, whilst the agitator is rapidly moved around the bowl to mix its contents. With the ability to mix a wide variety of ingredients, planetary mixers are more versatile than their spiral counterparts. Planetary mixers can be used to whip and blend, whereas spiral mixers cannot. They are normally used in Australia, India and 
Europe too. The mixers are used all over world.

===Hand mixer===
A hand mixer is a hand-held mixing device. A handle is mounted over an enclosure containing the motor. The motor drives the beaters which are immersed in the food to perform the mixing action. The motor must be lightweight as it is supported by the user during use. The user may use any suitable kitchen container to hold the ingredients while mixing.

The electric hand-mixer was invented in 1964 by Dynamic, sited in western France. Its products are essentially the same design it has always produced.

===Dough mixer===
A '''dough mixer''' is  used for household or industrial purposes. It is used for kneading large quantities of [[dough]]. It is electrical, having timers and various controls to suit the user's needs. Some features of dough blenders include high speed, low speed and bowl reverse (these can be combined into a programme) and a [[knead]]ing bar in the centre of the bowl.

[[File:OEL right.JPG|thumb|Prototype OLED lighting panels]]

An '''organic light-emitting diode''' ('''OLED''') is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] that emits light in response to an electric current. This organic layer is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens, [[computer monitor]]s, portable systems such as [[smartphone]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in [[solid-state lighting]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200902148|pmid=20217752|title=Recent Advances in White Organic Light-Emitting Materials and Devices (WOLEDs)|year=2010|last1=Kamtekar|first1=K. T.|last2=Monkman|first2=A. P.|last3=Bryce|first3=M.

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing [[polymer]]s.  Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] (LEC) which has a slightly different mode of operation. An OLED display can be driven with a [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) control scheme. In the PMOLED scheme, each row (and line) in the display is controlled sequentially, one by one,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/pmoled-vs-amoled-whats-difference |title=PMOLED vs AMOLED – what's the difference? {{!}} OLED-Info |website=www.oled-info.com |access-date=2016-12-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220213332/http://www.oled-info.com/pmoled-vs-amoled-whats-difference |archivedate=2016-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas AMOLED control uses a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off, allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]] because it emits visible light. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions (such as a dark room), an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, regardless of whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or an [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED backlight]].

== History ==
[[André Bernanose]] and co-workers at the [[Nancy-Université]] in France made the first observations of [[electroluminescence]] in organic materials in the early 1950s. They applied high alternating voltages in air to materials such as [[acridine orange]], either deposited on or dissolved in cellulose or cellophane thin films.  The proposed mechanism was either direct excitation of the dye molecules or excitation of electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bernanose, A.|author2= Comte, M.|author3 = Vouaux, P. |journal= J. Chim. Phys.|year = 1953|volume= 50|page= 64|title= A new method of light emission by certain organic compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bernanose, A. |author2 = Vouaux, P.|journal= J.

Chim. Phys.|year= 1955|volume= 52|page= 509|title=Relation between organic electroluminescence and concentration of active product}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first practical OLEDs===

American physical chemist [[Ching W.

A typical OLED is composed of a layer of organic materials situated between two electrodes, the [[anode]] and [[cathode]], all deposited on a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]. The organic molecules are electrically conductive as a result of [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] of [[pi electrons]] caused by [[conjugated system|conjugation]] over part or all of the molecule. These materials have conductivity levels ranging from insulators to conductors, and are therefore considered [[organic semiconductor]]s. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ([[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO and LUMO]]) of organic semiconductors are analogous to the [[valence band|valence]] and [[Conduction band|conduction]] bands of inorganic semiconductors.&lt;ref name=kho&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong, Javed, T., Mark, R., Maier, E., and David, C.

Originally, the most basic polymer OLEDs consisted of a single organic layer. One example was the first light-emitting device synthesised by J. H. Burroughes ''et al.'', which involved a single layer of [[poly(p-phenylene vinylene)]]. However multilayer OLEDs can be fabricated with two or more layers in order to improve device efficiency. As well as conductive properties, different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1317547|title=Role of CsF on electron injection into a conjugated polymer|year=2000|last1=Piromreun|first1=Pongpun|last2=Oh|first2=Hwansool|last3=Shen|first3=Yulong|last4=Malliaras|first4=George G.|last5=Scott|first5=J.

The graded heterojunction architecture combines the benefits of both conventional architectures by improving charge injection while simultaneously balancing charge transport within the emissive region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Russell|author2=Erickson, N.|title=Highly efficient, single-layer organic light-emitting devices based on a graded-composition emissive layer|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=27 August 2010|volume=97|issue=1|page=083308|bibcode = 2010ApPhL..97a3308S |doi = 10.1063/1.3460285 |last3=Lüssem|first3=Björn|last4=Leo|first4=Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During operation, a voltage is applied across the OLED such that the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. Anodes are picked based upon the quality of their optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin Ke|first=Peng|author2=Ramadas, K. |author3=Burden, A. |author4=Soo-Jin, C. |title=INdium-Tin-Oxide-Free Organic Light-Emitting Devices|journal=Transactions on Electron Devices|date=June 2006|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1483–1486 |doi=10.1109/ted.2006.874724|bibcode=2006ITED...53.1483K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current of [[electron]]s flows through the device from cathode to anode, as electrons are injected into the LUMO of the organic layer at the cathode and withdrawn from the HOMO at the anode. This latter process may also be described as the injection of [[electron hole]]s into the HOMO. Electrostatic forces bring the electrons and the holes towards each other and they recombine forming an [[exciton]], a bound state of the electron and hole. This happens closer to the emissive layer, because in organic semiconductors holes are generally more [[Semiconductor carrier mobility|mobile]] than electrons. The decay of this excited state results in a relaxation of the energy levels of the electron, accompanied by emission of [[radiation]] whose [[frequency]] is in the [[visible spectrum|visible region]]. The frequency of this radiation depends on the [[band gap]] of the material, in this case the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO.

As electrons and holes are [[fermion]]s with half integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]], an exciton may either be in a [[singlet state]] or a [[triplet state]] depending on how the spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states ([[phosphorescence]]) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. [[Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode]]s make use of [[spin–orbit interaction]]s to facilitate [[intersystem crossing]] between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.

[[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO) is commonly used as the anode material. It is transparent to visible light and has a high [[work function]] which promotes injection of holes into the HOMO level of the organic layer. A typical conductive layer may consist of [[PEDOT:PSS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.118953|year=1997|last1=Carter|first1=S.

Metals such as [[barium]] and [[calcium]] are often used for the cathode as they have low [[work function]]s which promote injection of electrons into the LUMO of the organic layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/16393|year=1999|last1=Friend|first1=R.

Experimental research has proven that the properties of the anode, specifically the anode/hole transport layer (HTL) interface topography plays a major role in the efficiency, performance, and lifetime of organic light-emitting diodes.  Imperfections in the surface of the anode decrease anode-organic film interface adhesion, increase electrical resistance, and allow for more frequent formation of non-emissive dark spots in the OLED material adversely affecting lifetime.  Mechanisms to decrease anode roughness for ITO/glass substrates include the use of thin films and self-assembled monolayers.  Also, alternative substrates and anode materials are being considered to increase OLED performance and lifetime.  Possible examples include single crystal sapphire substrates treated with gold (Au) film anodes yielding lower work functions, operating voltages, electrical resistance values, and increasing lifetime of OLEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spintronic OLEDs could be brighter and more efficient|journal=Engineer (Online Edition)|date=16 July 2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Single carrier devices are typically used to study the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes. As current through the device is composed of only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, recombination does not occur and no light is emitted. For example, electron only devices can be obtained by replacing ITO with a lower work function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection. Similarly, hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium, resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.117530|year=1996|last1=Davids|first1=P.

== Carrier balance ==
Balanced charge injection and transfer are required to get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing the thickness of the charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Yi|last2=Xu|first2=Yanbin|last3=Qiao|first3=Zhi|last4=Peng|first4=Junbiao|last5=Wang|first5=Baozheng|last6=Cao|first6=Derong|title=Enhancement of Electroluminescence Properties of Red Diketopyrrolopyrrole-Doped Copolymers by Oxadiazole and Carbazole Units as Pendants|journal=Polymer|date=2010|volume=51|issue=24|pages=5726–5733|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2010.09.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of small molecule devices and displays usually involves [[Evaporation (deposition)|thermal evaporation]] in a vacuum. This makes the production process more expensive and of limited use for large-area devices, than other processing techniques. However, contrary to polymer-based devices, the [[vacuum deposition]] process enables the formation of well controlled, homogeneous films, and the construction of very complex multi-layer structures. This high flexibility in layer design, enabling distinct charge transport and charge blocking layers to be formed, is the main reason for the high efficiencies of the small molecule OLEDs.

[[File:Polyphenylene vinylene.png|thumb|upright|[[poly(p-phenylene vinylene)|poly(''p''-phenylene vinylene)]], used in the first PLED&lt;ref name=b/&gt;]]

Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED, P-OLED), also light-emitting polymers (LEP), involve an [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] [[conductive polymer]] that emits [[light]] when connected to an external voltage. They are used as a [[thin film]] for [[full-spectrum]] colour displays.  Polymer OLEDs are quite efficient and require a relatively small amount of power for the amount of light produced.

Vacuum deposition is not a suitable method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and [[spin coating]] is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] by a technique derived from commercial [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.120807|title=Ink-jet printing of doped polymers for organic light emitting devices|year=1998|last1=Hebner|first1=T.

The metal cathode may still need to be deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a [[Langmuir-Blodgett film]].

Typically, a polymer such as poly([[N-vinylcarbazole]]) is used as a host material to which an organometallic [[Coordination complex|complex]] is added as a dopant. [[Organoiridium compound|Iridium complexes]]&lt;ref name=baldo2 /&gt; such as Ir(mppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=yang /&gt; are currently the focus of research, although complexes based on other heavy metals such as platinum&lt;ref name=baldo /&gt; have also been used.

The heavy metal atom at the centre of these complexes exhibits strong spin-orbit coupling, facilitating [[intersystem crossing]] between [[Singlet state|singlet]] and [[Triplet state|triplet]] states. By using these phosphorescent materials, both singlet and triplet excitons will be able to decay radiatively, hence improving the internal quantum efficiency of the device compared to a standard OLED where only the singlet states will contribute to emission of light.

Applications of OLEDs in solid state lighting require the achievement of high brightness with good [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE coordinates]] (for white emission). The use of macromolecular species like polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) in conjunction with the use of phosphorescent species such as Ir for printed OLEDs have exhibited brightnesses as high as 10,000&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b903531a|title=Electroluminescence from printed stellate polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes|year=2009|last1=Singh|first1=Madhusudan|last2=Chae|first2=Hyun Sik|last3=Froehlich|first3=Jesse D.|last4=Kondou|first4=Takashi|last5=Li|first5=Sheng|last6=Mochizuki|first6=Amane|last7=Jabbour|first7=Ghassan E.|journal=Soft Matter|volume=5|page=3002|issue=16|bibcode = 2009SMat....5.3002S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Device architectures ==

=== Structure ===
; Bottom or top emission: Bottom or top distinction refers not to orientation of the OLED display, but to the direction that emitted light exits the device.  OLED devices are classified as bottom emission devices if light emitted passes through the transparent or semi-transparent bottom electrode and substrate on which the panel was manufactured.  Top emission devices are classified based on whether or not the light emitted from the OLED device exits through the lid that is added following fabrication of the device.   Top-emitting OLEDs are better suited for active-matrix applications as they can be more easily integrated with a non-transparent transistor backplane.  The TFT array attached to the bottom substrate on which AMOLEDs are manufactured are typically non-transparent, resulting in considerable blockage of transmitted light if the device followed a bottom emitting scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bardsley | first1 = J. N. | doi = 10.1109/JSTQE.2004.824077 | title = International OLED Technology Roadmap | journal = IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–4 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2004IJSTQ..10....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Transparent OLEDs: Transparent OLEDs use transparent or semi-transparent contacts on both sides of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting (transparent). TOLEDs can greatly improve contrast, making it much easier to view displays in bright sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=5986401|title=High contrast transparent organic light emitting device display|inventor=Mark E. Thompson, Stephen R. Forrest, Paul Burrows|pubdate=1999-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology can be used in [[Head-up display]]s, smart windows or [[augmented reality]] applications.
; Graded heterojunction: Graded heterojunction OLEDs gradually decrease the ratio of electron holes to electron transporting chemicals.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;  This results in almost double the quantum efficiency of existing OLEDs.
; Stacked OLEDs: Stacked OLEDs use a pixel architecture that stacks the red, green, and blue subpixels on top of one another instead of next to one another, leading to substantial increase in [[gamut]] and color depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaymate.com/LG_OLED_TV_ShootOut_1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116045725/http://www.displaymate.com/LG_OLED_TV_ShootOut_1.htm |archivedate=2017-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and greatly reducing pixel gap. Currently, other display technologies have the RGB (and RGBW) pixels mapped next to each other decreasing potential resolution.
; Inverted OLED: In contrast to a conventional OLED, in which the anode is placed on the substrate, an Inverted OLED uses a bottom cathode that can be connected to the drain end of an n-channel TFT especially for the low cost [[amorphous silicon]] TFT backplane useful in the manufacturing of [[AMOLED]] displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2268923|title=Highly efficient and stable inverted bottom-emission organic light emitting devices|year=2006|last1=Chu|first1=Ta-Ya|last2=Chen|first2=Jenn-Fang|last3=Chen|first3=Szu-Yi|last4=Chen|first4=Chao-Jung|last5=Chen|first5=Chin H.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=89|page=053503|issue=5|bibcode = 2006ApPhL..89e3503C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color Patterning technologies ==
=== Shadow Mask patterning method===
Most commonly used patterning method for organic light-emitting display is shadow masking during film deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Takatoshi|first1=Tsujimura|title=OLED Display Fundamentals and Applications|date=April 3, 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-119-18731-8|edition=2|url=https://www.wiley.com/en-jp/OLED+Display+Fundamentals+and+Applications,+2nd+Edition-p-9781119187318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called as "RGB side-by-side" method or "RGB pixelation" method. Metal sheet with multiple apertures made of low thermal expansion material, such as nickel alloy, is placed between heated evaporation source and substrate, so that the organic or inorganic material from evaporation source is deposited only to the desired location on the substrate. Almost all small OLED displays for smartphones have been manufactured using this method.

=== White + Color Filter method ===
Although shadow-mask patterning method is mature technology used from the first OLED manufacturing, it causes many issues like [[dark spot]] formation due to mask-substrate contact or misalignment of the pattern due to the deformation of shadow mask. Such defect formation can be regarded as trivial when the display size is small, however it causes serious issues when a large display is manufactured, which brings significant production yield loss. To circumvent such issues, white emission device with 4-sub-pixel color filter (white, red, green and blue) has been used for large television. In spite of the light absorption by color filter, state-of-art OLED television can make high color reproduction, such as 100% [[NTSC]], and low power consumption happen at the same time, using emission spectrum with high human-eye sensitivity, special color filters with low spectrum overlap and performance tuning with color statistic into consideration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=LARGE-SIZE AMOLED TV BY "SCALABLE" TECHNOLOGIES|journal=OLED Symposium 2009|date=October 1, 2009|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.23845.81122|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321758497}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach is also called as "Color-by-white" method.

=== Other color patterning approaches ===
There are other type of emerging patterning technologies to increase the manufacturabiltiy of OLED. 
Patternable organic light-emitting devices use a light or heat activated electroactive layer. A latent material ([[PEDOT-TMA]]) is included in this layer that, upon activation, becomes highly efficient as a hole injection layer. Using this process, light-emitting devices with arbitrary patterns can be prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2746404|title=Photoactivated and patternable charge transport materials and their use in organic light-emitting devices|year=2007|last1=Liu|first1=Jie|last2=Lewis|first2=Larry N.|last3=Duggal|first3=Anil R.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=90|page=233503|issue=23|bibcode = 2007ApPhL..90w3503L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour patterning can be accomplished by means of laser, such as radiation-induced sublimation transfer (RIST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1889/1.2036612|title=16.5L: Late-News-Paper: Non-Contact OLED Color Patterning by Radiation-Induced Sublimation Transfer (RIST)|year=2005|last1=Boroson|first1=Michael|last2=Tutt|first2=Lee|last3=Nguyen|first3=Kelvin|last4=Preuss|first4=Don|last5=Culver|first5=Myron|last6=Phelan|first6=Giana|journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers|volume=36|page=972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic vapour jet printing (OVJP) uses an inert carrier gas, such as [[argon]] or [[nitrogen]], to transport evaporated organic molecules (as in organic vapour phase deposition). The gas is expelled through a [[micrometre]]-sized nozzle or nozzle array close to the substrate as it is being translated. This allows printing arbitrary multilayer patterns without the use of solvents.

Like [[ink jet material deposition]]ing, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise amounts of solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve the substrate material and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED's can be used to increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by [[total internal reflection]] (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly [[Organic compound|organic]] instead of water-based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3455544| title = Inkjet Etching of Polymer Surfaces to Manufacture Microstructures for OLED Applications| journal = V INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TIMES OF POLYMERS (TOP) AND COMPOSITES.

Transfer-printing is an emerging technology to assemble large numbers of parallel OLED and AMOLED devices efficiently.  It takes advantage of standard metal deposition, [[photolithography]], and etching to create alignment marks commonly on glass or other device substrates.  Thin polymer adhesive layers are applied to enhance resistance to particles and surface defects.  Microscale ICs are transfer-printed onto the adhesive surface and then baked to fully cure adhesive layers.  An additional photosensitive polymer layer is applied to the substrate to account for the topography caused by the printed ICs, reintroducing a flat surface.  Photolithography and etching removes some polymer layers to uncover conductive pads on the ICs. Afterwards, the anode layer is applied to the device backplane to form bottom electrode.  OLED layers are applied to the anode layer with conventional [[vapor deposition]], and covered with a conductive metal electrode layer.  {{as of |2011}} transfer-printing was capable to print onto target substrates up to 500mm X 400mm.  This size limit needs to expand for transfer-printing to become a common process for the fabrication of large OLED/AMOLED displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2128324| title = Transfer-Printed Microscale Integrated Circuits for High Performance Display Backplanes| journal = IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology| volume = 1| issue = 12| pages = 1916–1922| year = 2011| last1 = Bower | first1 = C.

== TFT Backplane technologies ==
For a high resolution display like a TV, a [[Thin-film transistor|TFT]] backplane is necessary to drive the pixels correctly. Currently, low temperature [[polycrystalline silicon]] (LTPS)&amp;nbsp;– [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) is used for commercial [[AMOLED]] displays. LTPS-TFT has variation of the performance in a display, so various compensation circuits have been reported.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1889/1.1831876|title=24.4L: Late-News Paper: A 13.0-inch AM-OLED Display with Top Emitting Structure and Adaptive Current Mode Programmed Pixel Circuit (TAC)|year=2001|last1=Sasaoka|first1=Tatsuya|last2=Sekiya|first2=Mitsunobu|last3=Yumoto|first3=Akira|last4=Yamada|first4=Jiro|last5=Hirano|first5=Takashi|last6=Iwase|first6=Yuichi|last7=Yamada|first7=Takao|last8=Ishibashi|first8=Tadashi|last9=Mori|first9=Takao|last10=Asano|first10=Mitsuru|last11=Tamura|first11=Shinichiro|last12=Urabe|first12=Tetsuo|journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers|volume=32|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the size limitation of the [[excimer laser]] used for LTPS, the [[AMOLED]] size was limited. To cope with the hurdle related to the panel size, amorphous-silicon/microcrystalline-silicon backplanes have been reported with large display prototype demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1889/1.1832193| title = 4.1: A 20-inch OLED Display Driven by Super-Amorphous-Silicon Technology| journal = SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers| volume = 34| pages = 6| year = 2003| last1 = Tsujimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Kobayashi | first2 = Y. | last3 = Murayama | first3 = K. | last4 = Tanaka | first4 = A. | last5 = Morooka | first5 = M. | last6 = Fukumoto | first6 = E. | last7 = Fujimoto | first7 = H. | last8 = Sekine | first8 = J. | last9 = Kanoh | first9 = K. | last10 = Takeda | first10 = K. | last11 = Miwa | first11 = K. | last12 = Asano | first12 = M. | last13 = Ikeda | first13 = N. | last14 = Kohara | first14 = S. | last15 = Ono | first15 = S. | last16 = Chung | first16 = C.

The different manufacturing process of OLEDs lends itself to several advantages over [[flat panel display]]s made with LCD technology.

; Lower cost in the future: OLEDs can be printed onto any suitable [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1521-4095(200009)12:17&lt;1249::AID-ADMA1249&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y|title=Application of Screen Printing in the Fabrication of Organic Light-Emitting Devices|year=2000|last1=Pardo|first1=Dino A.|last2=Jabbour|first2=G. E.|last3=Peyghambarian|first3=N.|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=12|pages=1249–1252|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or [[plasma display]]s. However, fabrication of the OLED substrate is currently more costly than that of a TFT LCD. Roll-to-roll vapor-deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost; however, this technique also induces problems: devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of [[Printing registration|registration]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; - lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy.
; Lightweight and flexible plastic substrates: OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates, leading to the possible fabrication of [[flexible organic light-emitting diode]]s for other new applications, such as [[rollable display|roll-up displays]] embedded in fabrics or clothing. If a substrate like [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/357477a0|title=Flexible light-emitting diodes made from soluble conducting polymers|year=1992|last1=Gustafsson|first1=G.|last2=Cao|first2=Y.|last3=Treacy|first3=G. M.|last4=Klavetter|first4=F.|last5=Colaneri|first5=N.|last6=Heeger|first6=A. J.|journal=Nature|volume=357|pages=477–479|issue=6378|bibcode=1992Natur.357..477G}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used, the displays may be produced inexpensively.  Furthermore, plastic substrates are shatter-resistant, unlike the glass displays used in LCD devices.
; Better picture quality: OLEDs enable a greater [[contrast ratio]] and wider viewing angle compared to LCDs, because OLED pixels emit light directly. This also provides a deeper [[black level]], since a black OLED display emits no light. Furthermore, OLED pixel colors appear correct and unshifted, even as the viewing angle approaches 90° from the [[Surface normal|normal]].
; Better power efficiency and thickness: LCDs filter the light emitted from a [[backlight]], allowing a small fraction of light through. Thus, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, allowing true blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-research.com/oleds/oleds-lcd.html |title=Comparison of OLED and LCD |publisher=Fraunhofer IAP: OLED Research |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204030227/http://www.oled-research.com/oleds/oleds-lcd.html |archivedate=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed. When looking at top-emitting OLEDs, thickness also plays a role when talking about index match layers (IMLs). Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is 1.3–2.5&amp;nbsp;nm. The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property, including the device structure parameters, also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Mingxiao|author2=Chen, Z. |author3=Xiao, L. |author4=Qu, B. |author5= Gong, Q. |title=Optical design for improving optical properties of top-emitting organic light emitting diodes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=18 March 2013|volume=113|issue=11|pages=113105–113105–5|doi=10.1063/1.4795584|bibcode = 2013JAP...113k3105Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Response time: OLEDs also have a much faster [[response time (technology)|response time]] than an LCD. Using response time compensation technologies, the fastest modern LCDs can reach response times as low as [[Liquid crystal display#Specifications|1 ms]] for their fastest color transition, and are capable of [[refresh rate|refresh frequencies]] as high as 240&amp;nbsp;Hz. According to LG, OLED response times are up to 1,000 times faster than LCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/lg-55em9700 |date=2013-01-02 |title=LG 55EM9700 |accessdate=2015-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115001508/http://www.oled-info.com/lg-55em9700 |archivedate=2015-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; putting conservative estimates at under 10 μs (0.01 ms), which could theoretically accommodate refresh frequencies approaching 100&amp;nbsp;kHz (100,000&amp;nbsp;Hz). Due to their extremely fast response time, OLED displays can also be easily designed to be strobed, creating an effect similar to CRT flicker in order to avoid the [[sample-and-hold]] behavior seen on both LCDs and some OLED displays, which creates the perception of motion blur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blurbusters.com/faq/oled-motion-blur/ |title=Why Do Some OLEDs Have Motion Blur? |publisher=Blur Busters Blog (based on Microsoft Research work) |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403030530/http://www.blurbusters.com/faq/oled-motion-blur/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifespan===
The biggest technical problem for OLEDs was the limited lifetime of the organic materials. One 2008 technical report on an OLED TV panel found that "After 1,000 hours the blue luminance degraded by 12%, the red by 7% and the green by 8%."&lt;ref&gt;"OLED TV estimated lifespan shorter then expected". HDTV Info Europe. Hdtvinfo.eu (2008-05-08).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, blue OLEDs historically have had a lifetime of around 14,000 hours to half original brightness (five years at 8 hours a day) when used for flat-panel displays. This is lower than the typical lifetime of LCD, LED or [[plasma display|PDP]] technology. Each currently is rated for about 25,000–40,000 hours to half brightness, depending on manufacturer and model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5vzeAMFjZ?url=http://ec1.images-amazon.com/media/i3d/01/A/man-migrate/MANUAL000020267.pdf HP Monitor manual.

Webcitation.org. Retrieved 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Degradation occurs because of the accumulation of nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers in the emissive zone. It is said that the chemical breakdown in the semiconductors occurs in four steps: 1) recombination of charge carriers through the absorption of UV light, 2) homolytic dissociation, 3) subsequent radical addition reactions that form {{pi}} radicals, and 4) disproportionation between two radicals resulting in hydrogen-atom transfer reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kondakov|first=D|author2=Lenhart, W. |author3=Nochols, W. |title=Operational degradation of organic light-emitting diodes: Mechanism and identification of chemical products|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|year=2007|volume=101|issue=2|pages=024512-024512-7|doi=10.1063/1.2430922|bibcode = 2007JAP...101b4512K }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some manufacturers' displays aim to increase the lifespan of OLED displays, pushing their expected life past that of LCD displays by improving light outcoupling, thus achieving the same brightness at a lower drive current.&lt;ref&gt;"OLED lifespan doubled?"

===Color balance===
Additionally, as the OLED material used to produce blue light degrades significantly more rapidly than the materials that produce other colors, blue light output will decrease relative to the other colors of light. This variation in the differential color output will change the color balance of the display and is much more noticeable than a decrease in overall luminance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digidelve.com/tech/ageless-oled/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908033812/http://www.digidelve.com/tech/ageless-oled/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-08 |title=Ageless OLED |accessdate=2009-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be avoided partially by adjusting color balance, but this may require advanced control circuits and interaction with the user, which is unacceptable for users. More commonly, though, manufacturers optimize the size of the R, G and B subpixels to reduce the current density through the subpixel in order to equalize lifetime at full luminance.  For example, a blue subpixel may be 100% larger than the green subpixel. The red subpixel may be 10% smaller than the green.
===Efficiency of blue OLEDs===
Improvements to the efficiency and lifetime of blue OLEDs is vital to the success of OLEDs as replacements for LCD technology. Considerable research has been invested in developing blue OLEDs with high external quantum efficiency as well as a deeper blue color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fallahi |first1=Afsoon |last2=Afshar Taromi |first2=Faramarz |last3=Mohebbi |first3=Alireza |last4=D.

===Water damage===
Water can instantly damage the organic materials of the displays. Therefore, improved sealing processes are important for practical manufacturing. Water damage especially may limit the longevity of more flexible displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/oled-encapsulation.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202810/http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/oled-encapsulation.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-07-08|title=OLED Sealing Process Reduces Water Intrusion and Increases Lifetime|website=Georgia Tech Research News|date=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Outdoor performance===
As an emissive display technology, OLEDs rely completely upon converting electricity to light, unlike most LCDs which are to some extent reflective. [[Electronic paper|E-paper]] leads the way in efficiency with ~ 33% ambient light reflectivity, enabling the display to be used without any internal light source. The metallic cathode in an OLED acts as a mirror, with reflectance approaching 80%, leading to poor readability in bright ambient light such as outdoors. However, with the proper application of a circular polarizer and antireflective coatings, the diffuse reflectance can be reduced to less than 0.1%.  With 10,000 [[foot-candle|fc]] incident illumination (typical test condition for simulating outdoor illumination), that yields an approximate photopic contrast of 5:1. Recent advances in OLED technologies, however, enable OLEDs to become actually better than LCDs in bright sunlight. The Super AMOLED display in the [[Galaxy S5]], for example, was found to outperform all LCD displays on the market in terms of brightness and reflectance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oled-info.com/displaymate-gs5-display-best-mobile-display-ever-outperforming-all-previous-oled-and-lcd-panels DisplayMate: the GS5 display is the best mobile display ever, outperforming all previous OLED and LCD panels | OLED-Info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403052815/http://www.oled-info.com/displaymate-gs5-display-best-mobile-display-ever-outperforming-all-previous-oled-and-lcd-panels |date=2014-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Power consumption===
While an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, for the majority of images it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD. However, an OLED can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Jon.

=== Fashion ===
Textiles incorporating OLEDs are an innovation in the fashion world and pose for a way to integrate lighting to bring inert objects to a whole new level of fashion. The hope is to combine the comfort and low cost properties of textile with the OLEDs properties of illumination and low energy consumption. Although this scenario of illuminated clothing is highly plausible, challenges are still a road block. Some issues include: the lifetime of the OLED, rigidness of flexible foil substrates, and the lack of research in making more fabric like photonic textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherenack|first=Kunigunde|author2=Van Os, K.; Pieterson, L.|title=Smart photonic textiles begin to weave their magic|journal=Laser Focus World|date=April 2012|volume=48|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstpost.com (2012-08-10). Retrieved 2012-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automotive ===
The number of automakers using OLEDs is still rare and limited to the high-end of the market. For example, the 2010 [[Lexus RX]] features an OLED display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

The Aston Martin DB9 incorporated the first automotive application of the OLED display, namely PMOLED, followed by the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Chevrolet Corvette C6.

Japanese manufacturer Pioneer Electronics produced the first car stereos with monochrome OLED displays.

The 2015 [[Hyundai Sonata]] and [[Kia Soul]] EV use a 3.5" white PMOLED display.

BMW plans to use OLEDs in tail lights and interior lights in their future cars; however, OLEDs are currently too dim to be used for brake lights, headlights and indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/10/bmw-organic-light/ BMW wants to put super-efficient OLED tail lights on your next car] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411070700/http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/10/bmw-organic-light/ |date=2014-04-11 }}, ''Engadget'', 10 April 2014, Jon Fingas&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dell ===
On January 6, 2016, Dell announced the Ultrasharp UP3017Q OLED monitor at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3018710/hardware/dell-unveils-stunning-4k-oled-ultrasharp-display-and-declares-war-on-bezels.html|title=Dell unveils stunning 4K OLED UltraSharp display and declares war on bezels|work=PCWorld|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitor was announced to feature a 30" 4K UHD OLED panel with a 120&amp;nbsp;Hz refresh rate, 0.1 millisecond response time, and a contrast ratio of 400,000:1. The monitor was set to sell at a price of $4,999 and release in March, 2016, just a few months later. As the end of March rolled around, the monitor was not released to the market and Dell did not speak on reasons for the delay. Reports suggested that Dell canceled the monitor as the company was unhappy with the image quality of the OLED panel, especially the amount of color drift that it displayed when you viewed the monitor from the sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oled-info.com/oled-monitor|title=OLED monitor: market status and updates {{!}} OLED-Info|website=www.oled-info.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 2017, Dell finally released the UP3017Q OLED monitor to the market at a price of $3,499 ($1,500 less than its original spoken price of $4,999 at CES 2016). In addition to the price drop, the monitor featured a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz refresh rate and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. As of June, 2017, the monitor is no longer available to purchase from Dell's website.

=== Apple ===
[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] began using OLED panels in its watches in 2015 and in its laptops in 2016 with the introduction of an OLED touchbar to the MacBook Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/27/apple-unveils-a-thinner-macbook-pro-with-oled-touch-strip/|title=Apple unveils a thinner MacBook Pro with an OLED 'Touch Bar'|work=Engadget|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Apple announced the introduction of their tenth anniversary [[iPhone X]] with their own optimized OLED display licensed from Universal Display Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3223143/displays/oled-vs-lcd-how-the-iphone-xs-display-changes-everything.html|title=OLED vs LCD: How the iPhone X's display changes everything|work=Macworld|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has continued the use of the technology in the iPhone X's successors, the [[iPhone XS]] and [[iPhone XS Max]].

== Canon Tokki Monopoly ==
The sheer number of OLED manufacturers in the world today seems to guarantee a steady OLED supply. This, however, might not be the case since almost all of the manufacturers rely on a fabrication equipment that is only manufactured by a single company called Canon Tokki. This small company of 343 - a unit of Canon Inc. and located amidst rice fields in a Japanese countryside  -  is reported to have a near monopoly of the giant OLED-manufacturing vacuum machines capable of producing screens with organic light-emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/24/business/tech/ahead-next-iphone-idemitsu-kosan-leads-way-developing-oled-screen/|title=Ahead of next iPhone, Idemitsu Kosan leads way after developing OLED screen|last=Alpeyev|first=Pavel|date=2017-04-24|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-05-31|last2=Taniguchi|first2=Takako|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular technology allows sharp and vibrant displays that use less energy. Apple has solely relied on Canon Tokki in its bid to introduce its own OLED displays for the iPhones released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/apple-s-search-for-better-iphone-screens-leads-to-japan-s-rice-fields|title=Apple's Search for Better iPhone Screens Leads to Japan's Rice Fields|last=Alpeyev|first=Pavel|date=2016-12-21|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-05-31|last2=Amano|first2=Takashi|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology itself is a closely guarded secret and is said to have been developed by the father of Teruhisa Tsugami, the current CEO of Canon Tokki. The word ''tokki'' means "special equipment" or "specialized equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canon-tokki.co.jp/eng/company/message.html|title=Canon Tokki Corporation {{!}} About the Company {{!}} CEO Message|last=Corporation|first=Canon Tokki|website=www.canon-tokki.co.jp|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine is notable for its 100-meter size and it features a uniquely automated process of OLED display production analogous to making a supercar that is custom-crafted rather than produced in an assembly line.

== Research ==
In 2014, [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation]] (MCC), a subsidiary of the [[Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings]] developed an OLED panel with a life of 30,000 hours, twice that of conventional OLED panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/141013/japanese-company-doubles-diode-panels-life-span Japanese company doubles diode panel's life span] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029234321/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/141013/japanese-company-doubles-diode-panels-life-span |date=2014-10-29 }}, Global Post, 13 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for efficient OLED materials has been extensively supported by simulation methods. By now it is possible to calculate important properties completely computationally, independent of experimental input.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/molecules_to_OLED From Molecules to Organic Light Emitting Diodes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415181006/http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/molecules_to_OLED |date=2015-04-15 }}, Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, 7 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adfm.201403004|title=Modeling of Organic Light Emitting Diodes: From Molecular to Device Properties|year=2015|last1=Kordt|first1=Pascal|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=25|pages=1955–1971|issue=13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows cost-efficient pre-screening of materials, prior to expensive synthesis and experimental characterisation.

'''Ottawa''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Ottawa.ogg|ˈ|ɒ|t|ə|w|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|-|w|ɑː}}; {{IPA-fr|ɔtawa}}) is the [[capital city]] of [[Canada]]. It stands on the south bank of the [[Ottawa River]] in the [[Eastern Ontario|eastern portion]] of [[southern Ontario]]. Ottawa borders [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]]; the two form the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau [[census metropolitan area]] (CMA) and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] (NCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/N-4.pdf |title=National Capital Act (R.

Founded in 1826 as [[Bytown]], and [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as Ottawa in 1855, the city has evolved into the political centre of Canada. Its original boundaries were expanded through numerous annexations and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and amalgamation in 2001 which significantly increased its land area. The city name "Ottawa" was chosen in reference to the Ottawa River, the name of which is derived from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] ''Odawa'', meaning "to trade".&lt;ref name="Rayburn2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Rayburn|title=Naming Canada: Stories About Canadian Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&amp;pg=PA231|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First camp by By.jpg|thumb|left|Camp used by soldiers and labourers of the [[Rideau Canal]], on the south side of the [[Ottawa River]] in 1826. The building of the canal attracted many land speculators to the area.]]
[[Étienne Brûlé]], widely regarded as the first European to travel up the Ottawa River, passed by Ottawa in 1610 on his way to the [[Great Lakes]].{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=5}} Three years later, [[Samuel de Champlain]] wrote about the waterfalls in the area and about his encounters with the Algonquins, who had been using the Ottawa River for centuries.{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=7}} Many missionaries would follow the early explorers and traders. The first maps of the area used the word Ottawa, derived from the Algonquin word ''adawe'' ("to trade", used in reference to the area's importance to First Nations traders), to name the river. [[Philemon Wright]], a [[New England]]er, created the first settlement in the area on 7 March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from the present day city of Ottawa in [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]].{{sfn|Wetering|1997|p=123}}{{sfn|Lee|2006|p=16}}  He, with five other families and twenty-five labourers,{{sfn|Taylor|1986|p=11}}  set about to create an agricultural community{{sfn|Lee|2006|p=20}} called Wrightsville. Wright pioneered the [[Ottawa River timber trade|Ottawa Valley timber trade]] (soon to be the area's most significant economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to Quebec City.{{sfn|Wetering|1997|p=11}} [[Bytown]], Ottawa's original name, was founded as a community in 1826 when hundreds of land speculators were attracted to the south side of the river when news spread that British authorities were immediately constructing the northerly end of the [[Rideau Canal]] military project at that location.{{sfn|Taylor|1986|p=14}}{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=60}} The following year, the town was named after British military engineer Colonel [[John By]] who was responsible for the entire Rideau Waterway construction project.

The canal's military purpose was to provide a secure route between Montreal and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] on [[Lake Ontario]], bypassing a particularly vulnerable stretch of the [[St. Lawrence River]] bordering the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] that had left re-supply ships bound for southwestern Ontario easily exposed to enemy fire during the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Legget|1986|pp=22–24}} Colonel By set up military barracks on the site of today's [[Parliament Hill]]. He also laid out the streets of the town and created two distinct neighbourhoods named "Upper Town" west of the canal and "[[Lower Town]]" east of the canal. Similar to its [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] namesakes, historically "Upper Town" was predominantly English speaking and Protestant whereas "Lower Town" was predominantly French, Irish and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Ottawa An illustrated History John H.

Additionally, despite Ottawa's regional isolation it had seasonal water transportation access to Montreal over the Ottawa River and to Kingston via the [[Rideau Waterway]].

Starting in the 1850s, entrepreneurs known as lumber barons began to build large sawmills, which became some of the largest mills in the world.{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=107}} Rail lines built in 1854 connected Ottawa to areas south and to the transcontinental rail network via Hull and [[Lachute]], Quebec in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;

Ottawa is governed by the 24-member [[Ottawa City Council]] consisting of 23 councillors each representing one [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] and the mayor, currently Jim Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.ca/city_hall/mayor_council/mayor/index_en.html |title=City of Ottawa – Mayor |publisher=Ottawa.ca |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; elected in a citywide vote.

Along with being the capital of Canada, Ottawa is politically diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="Hill2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony L. Hill|title=Canadian politics, riding by riding: an in-depth analysis of Canada's 301 federal electoral districts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opvmE2AExc8C&amp;pg=PA184|year= 2002|publisher=Prospect Park Press|isbn=978-0-9723436-0-2|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by [[Francophones]], especially in Vanier and central Gloucester.&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt; Central Ottawa is usually more [[Left-wing politics|left]]-leaning, and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, Orléans.&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt; The southern and western parts of the old city of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt; The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially.&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt; This is especially true in the former Townships of [[West Carleton Township, Ontario|West Carleton]], [[Goulbourn Township, Ontario|Goulbourn]], [[Rideau Township, Ontario|Rideau]] and [[Osgoode Township, Ontario|Osgoode]], which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding [[county|counties]].&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt; However, not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of [[Cumberland Township, Ontario|Cumberland]], with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.&lt;ref name="Hill2002"/&gt;

[[OC Transpo]], a department of the city, operates the public transit system.&lt;ref name=oct&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.octranspo1.com/about-octranspo |title=About OC Transpo |year=2009 |publisher=OC Transpo |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated [[hub-and-spoke]] system of services consists of: regular buses traveling on fixed routes in mixed traffic, typical of most urban transit systems;&lt;ref name=oct/&gt; a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system which is a high-frequency bus service operating on the transitway (a network of mostly grade-separated dedicated bus lanes within their own right of way) and having full stations with Park &amp; Ride facilities, further supported by on-road reserved bus lanes and priority traffic signal controls; a [[light rail]] transit (LRT) system known as the ''O-Train'' operating on one north-south route (the Trillium Line);&lt;ref name=oct/&gt; and a door-to-door bus service for the disabled known as ParaTranspo.&lt;ref name=oct/&gt; Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based ''[[Société de transport de l'Outaouais]] (STO)'' operate bus services between Ottawa and Gatineau.

[[File:Canal Rideau - 007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Capital Pathway]] is a multi-use [[trail]] interlinking many parks, waterways, and sites throughout the [[National Capital Region]]]]
The city is served by two freeway corridors. The primary corridor is east-west and consists of provincial [[Ontario Highway 417|Highway 417]] (designated as The Queensway) and Ottawa-Carleton [[Regional Road 174]] (formerly Provincial Highway 17); a north-south corridor, [[Ontario Highway 416|Highway 416]] (designated as Veterans' Memorial Highway), connects Ottawa to the rest of the [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-Series Highway]] network in Ontario at the 401. Highway 417 is also the Ottawa portion of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. The city also has several scenic parkways (promenades), such as [[Colonel By Drive]], [[Queen Elizabeth Driveway]], the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, [[Rockcliffe Parkway]] and the [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)|Aviation Parkway]] and has a freeway connection to [[Quebec Autoroute 5|Autoroute 5]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 50|Autoroute 50]], in Gatineau. In 2006, the National Capital Commission completed aesthetic enhancements to [[Confederation Boulevard]], a ceremonial route of existing roads linking key attractions on both sides of the Ottawa River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16300-20444-20505&amp;lang=1 | title=Confederation Boulevard, National Capital Commission Web site | accessdate=11 February 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209090858/http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16300-20444-20505&amp;lang=1 | archive-date=9 February 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottawa is known as one of the most educated cities in Canada, with over half the population having graduated from college and/or university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.ca/city_hall/glance/business_en.html|title=Quick Facts About Ottawa |publisher=City of Ottawa |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottawa has the highest per capita concentration of [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and residents with [[PhD]]s in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roman |last=Zakaluzny |title=Where must Ottawa's tech sector go from here? |publisher= |url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/290233008271272.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061307/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/290233008271272.php |archivedate=28 September 2007 |work=Ottawa Business Journal |pages= |accessdate=16 April 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has two main public universities:

*The [[University of Ottawa]] (originally named the "College of Bytown") was the first post-secondary institution established in the city in 1848. The university would eventually expand to become the largest English-French bilingual university in the world.&lt;ref name=Quick&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/services/irp/docs/QF2014-EN-2.pdf|title=University of Ottawa – Quick Facts 2014|publisher=University of Ottawa|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of the [[U15 (universities)|U15]], a group of highly respected research-intensive universities in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rd-review.ca/eic/site/033.nsf/vwapj/sub198.pdf/$file/sub198.pdf|title=U15 Submission to the Expert Review Panel on Research and Development|publisher=Review of Federal Support to R&amp;D|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's campus is located in the [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]] neighbourhood, just adjacent to the city's downtown core.
*[[Carleton University]] was founded in 1942 to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college. Over time, Carleton would make the transition to the public university that it is today. In recent years, Carleton has become ranked highly among comprehensive universities in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 University Rankings: Comprehensive results|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/2014-university-rankings-comprehensive-category-results/|website=Maclean's|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's campus sits between [[Old Ottawa South]] and Dow's Lake.

Ottawa also has two main public colleges – [[Algonquin College]] and [[La Cité collégiale]]. It also has two Catholic universities – [[Dominican University College]] and [[Saint Paul University]]. Other colleges and universities in nearby areas (namely, the neighbouring city of Gatineau) include the [[Université du Québec en Outaouais|University of Quebec en Outaouais]], [[Cégep de l'Outaouais]], and [[Heritage College (Gatineau)|Heritage College]].

Four main public school boards exist in Ottawa: English, English-Catholic, French, and French-Catholic. The English-language [[Ottawa-Carleton District School Board]] (OCDSB) is the largest board with 147 schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocdsb.ca/ab-ocdsb/Pages/default.aspx |title=Ocdsb-About Ocdsb |publisher=Ocdsb.ca |accessdate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412075944/http://www.ocdsb.ca/AB-OCDSB/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the English-Catholic [[Ottawa Catholic School Board]] with 85 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacatholicschools.ca/ |title=Ottawa Catholic School Board |publisher=Ottawacatholicschools.ca |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311053908/http://www.ottawacatholicschools.ca/ |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two French-language boards are the French-Catholic ''[[Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est]]'' with 49 schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolecatholique.ca/fr/53 |title= CECCE: Liste des écoles |publisher=Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est |date=21 May 2004 |accessdate= 13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French ''[[Conseil des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario]]'' with 37 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepeo.on.ca/ |title=Accueil |publisher=Conseil des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottawa also has numerous [[private school]]s which are not part of a board.

The [[Ottawa Public Library]] was created in 1906 as part of the famed [[Carnegie library]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://24369.vws.magma.ca/connect/research/local/carnegie_library_e.html | title= Notes from the Ottawa Room...

==Media==
{{further|Media in Ottawa–Gatineau}}
Three main daily local newspapers are printed in Ottawa: two English newspapers, the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' established as ''the Bytown Packet'' in 1845 and the ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'', with weekly circulation of 900,197 and 274,628, respectively, and one French newspaper, ''[[Le Droit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Circulation Data Report |url= http://www.newspaperscanada.ca/daily-newspaper-paid-circulation- |publisher= Canadian Newspaper Association |accessdate= 7 September 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another free commuter daily paper, ''[[Metro Ottawa]]'', was added in the 2000s. Several weekly and monthly community papers are also published, including the ''Kitchissippi Times''. Multiple Canadian television broadcast networks and systems, and an extensive number of radio stations, broadcast in both English and French.

In addition to the market's local media services, Ottawa is home to several national media operations, including [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]] (Canada's national [[legislature broadcaster]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About CPAC |url=http://www.cpac.ca/en/about-cpac/ |website=[[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]] |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the parliamentary bureau staff of virtually all of Canada's major newsgathering organizations in television, radio and print. The city is also home to the head office of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], although it is not the primary production location of most CBC radio or television programming.

'''Payability''' is an American [[FinTech]] company based in New York City. Payability provides finance solutions to suppliers of digital marketplaces.

Payability's platform integrates with digital marketplaces, most notably [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s. The company offers customers [[invoice factoring]]: It purchases suppliers’ accounts receivable, allowing suppliers to get paid for their sales on an expedited schedule.

==History ==
Scott Lynn and Keith Smith founded Payability in 2014.

According to Smith, the idea for Payability came when he saw a recurring pain point for the suppliers of online marketplaces like Amazon: Marketplaces often withhold payments from sellers for a number of weeks, creating cash flow challenges for suppliers.&lt;ref name="American Banker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wack |first=Kevin |date=January 19, 2016 |title=Why Mobile-App Developers Are Turning to a New Crop of Finance Companies |url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/why-mobile-app-developers-are-turning-to-a-new-crop-of-finance-companies |publisher=[[American Banker]] |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview, Smith pointed out that being unable to access cash from their sales frustrates sellers and limits their ability to replenish inventory or fund marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name="ideamensch"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 5, 2015 |title=Keith Smith – Co-founder and CEO of Payability |url=https://ideamensch.com/keith-smith/ |publisher=[[ideamensch]] |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Payability partnered with Amazon Launchpad to offer financing for startups through Amazon Launchpad Services Hub.&lt;ref name="Amazon Launchpad"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Services Hub from Amazon Launchpad |url=https://www.amazon.com/launchpad/serviceshub/ |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thialf at Perdido.JPG|thumb|right|[[SSCV Thialf]] with gangway on Perdido (left).]]
'''''Perdido''''' is the deepest floating [[oil platform]] in the world at a water depth of about 2450 meters (8000 feet) operated by the [[Shell Oil Company]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/major-projects-2/perdido.html |title= Perdido - Shell Global |publisher= Shell |date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Perdido is located in the Perdido fold belt which is a rich discovery of crude oil and natural gas that lies in water that is nearly 8000 feet deep. The platform's peak production will be 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At 267 meters, the Perdido is nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower.

==Construction and assembly==

The spar and the topsides of the Perdido were constructed separately and then assembled in its final position in the Gulf of Mexico.

The Perdido's hull or spar was constructed by Technip in Pori, Finland. A barge shipped the 22,000 tonne spar 13,200 kilometres (8,200 miles) from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Gulf of Mexico. After floating the spar, it was towed to its final home above the Alaminos canyon 320 kilometres (120 miles) from the shore. The spar was rotated by the ''[[DCV Balder|Balder]]'' from a horizontal to a vertical floating position by pumping water through hoses attached to the spar. It was then anchored by the ''Balder'' to piles in the seafloor.

The platform has three decks or topsides which support the oil and gas processing units, a drilling rig and living quarters for the workers. The temperature difference between Finland and Texas posed a challenge in assembling the pieces as the components built in cold of northern Europe expand in the heat of the Gulf of Mexico. Computer-guided lasers marked out the measurements to ensure precision. After the decks were constructed, in March 2009 the ''[[SSCV Thialf|Thialf]]'' lifted the 9,500 tonne topsides onto four posts on the spar and slotted it into position.

==Technology==

Operated by Shell, with JV partners Chevron (37.5%) and BP (27.5%), the spar acts as a hub for and enables development of three fields  Great White, Tobago, and Silvertip. The oil and gas fields beneath the platform lie in a geological formation holding resources estimated at 3-15 billion barrels of oil equivalent according to a report by the BSEE, formerly known as the MMS.
At peak production, Perdido processes 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, and 200 million cubic feet of gas.
{{Empty section|date=April 2013}}

==Operation==

The twenty-two oil wells that the Perdido extracts oil from are connected to a 44 kilometre (27 mile) network of pipelines on the ocean floor that link it to five flexible pipes called risers. A workforce of 172 people keep it up and running. They work in 12-hour shifts for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, back on land.

==Safety==

The platform has extensive safety equipment to protect workers in this remote location.
It has the largest rescue boat used on any Shell facility, which has room for 24 people. The living quarters are blast-resistant and the number of  fire and gas detectors used is ten times more than any other installations in the Gulf. Perdido's helipad can accommodate two [[Sikorsky S-92]] helicopters that can carry 19 passengers each. This is more than twice the capacity of helicopters usually used in the Gulf. This makes it possible to evacuate the workers faster during an emergency.

'''Public transport''' (also known as '''public transportation''', '''public transit''', or '''mass transit''') is transport of [[passenger]]s by group travel systems available for use by the general public, typically managed on a schedule, operated on established routes, and that charge a posted fee for each trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/public_transport |title=public transport |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2018-01-30 |quote=Buses, trains, and other forms of transport that are available to the public, charge set fares, and run on fixed routes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/public-transport |title=public transport in British |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Collins English Dictionary |publisher=HarperCollins |access-date=2018-01-30 |quote=a system of buses, trains, etc, running on fixed routes, on which the public may travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mass-transit|title=Mass transit |author=Joseph L. Schofer| website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-30 |quote=Mass transit, also called mass transportation, or public transportation,  the movement of people within urban areas using group travel technologies such as buses and trains.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of public transport  include [[Public transport bus service|city buses]], [[trolleybus]]es, [[tram]]s (or [[light rail]]) and [[Passenger rail transport|passenger trains]], [[rapid transit]] (metro/subway/underground, etc.) and [[ferry|ferries]]. Public transport between cities is dominated by [[airline]]s, [[intercity bus service|coaches]], and [[intercity rail]]. [[High-speed rail]] networks are being developed in many parts of the world.

Most public transport systems run along fixed routes with set embarkation/disembarkation points to a prearranged timetable, with the most frequent services running to a [[headway]] (e.g.: "every 15 minutes" as opposed to being scheduled for any specific time of the day). However, most public transport trips include other modes of travel, such as passengers walking or catching bus services to access train stations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLeod|first=Sam|date=2017|title=Urban Public Transport: Planning Principles and Emerging Practice|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0885412217693570|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|volume=32(3)|pages=223-239|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Share taxi]]s offer on-demand services in many parts of the world, which may compete with fixed public transport lines, or compliment them, by bringing passengers to interchanges. [[Paratransit]] is sometimes used in areas of low demand and for people who need a door-to-door service.&lt;ref name="PT.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120314123639/http://www.publictransportation.org/aboutus/default.asp]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban public transit differs distinctly among Asia, North America, and Europe. In Asia, profit-driven, privately-owned and publicly traded mass transit and [[real estate]] conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/280 |title=Rail integrated communities in Tokyo| publisher=JTLU.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr29/f12_sho.html |title=Lessons from Japanese Experiences of Roles of Public and Private Sectors in Urban Transport| publisher=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, municipal [[transit district|transit authorities]] most commonly run mass transit operations. In Europe, both state-owned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems, Public transport services can be profit-driven by use of pay-by-the-distance [[fare]]s or funded by government subsidies in which flat rate fares are charged to each passenger. Services can be fully profitable through high usership numbers and high [[farebox recovery ratio]]s, or can be regulated and possibly [[subsidy|subsidised]] from local or national tax revenue. Fully subsidised, [[Free public transport|free of charge]] services operate in some towns and cities.

For geographical, historical and economic reasons, differences exist internationally regarding use and extent of public transport. While countries in the [[Old World]] tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the [[New World]] have more [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] and much less comprehensive public transport. The [[International Association of Public Transport]] (UITP) is the international network for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. It has 3,400 members from 92 countries from all over the globe.

==History==
[[File:Newtonbostoncar.jpg|thumb|Early trolley car in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]

Conveyances designed for public hire are as old as the first [[ferry|ferries]], and the earliest public transport was [[water transport]]: on land people walked (sometimes in groups and on [[pilgrimage]]s, as noted in sources such as the Bible and ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'') or (at least in [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]) [[Animal-powered transport|rode an animal]].&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]], [[Pack animal|beasts of burden]] were generally not as large, although the [[Inca]]s did use [[llama]]s as pack animals. See [http://www.precolumbianwheels.com/ Pre Columbian Wheels]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferries appear in [[Greek mythology]]&amp;mdash;corpses in ancient Greece were buried with a coin underneath their tongue to pay the ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to take them to [[Hades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfXP_teqPrgC|title=Gods, Goddesses, and Mythology|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historical forms of public transport include the [[stagecoach]], traveling a fixed route between [[coaching inn]]s, and the [[horse-drawn boat]] carrying paying passengers, which was a feature of European [[canal]]s from their 17th-century origins. The canal itself as a form of infrastructure dates back to antiquity – [[ancient Egypt]]ians certainly used a canal for freight transportation to bypass the [[Aswan]] cataract – and the Chinese also built canals for water transportation as far back as the [[Warring States period]]&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-521-07060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the 5th century BCE. Whether or not those canals were used for for-hire public transport remains unknown; the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China (begun in 486 BCE) served primarily for shipping grain.

The [[bus|omnibus]], the first organized public transit system within a city, appears to have originated in [[Paris]], France, in 1662,&lt;ref&gt;web-page (in French) at http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=18260810. Retrieved 13 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although the service in question failed a few months after its founder, [[Blaise Pascal]], died in August 1662; omnibuses are next known to have appeared in [[Nantes]], France, in 1826. The omnibus was introduced to [[London]] in July 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.knowledgeoflondon.com/buses.html |title=The London Omnibus |publisher=Knowledgeoflondon.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first passenger [[Horsecar|horse-drawn railway]] opened in 1806: it ran between [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway|Swansea]] and [[Mumbles]] in [[South West Wales|southwest]] Wales in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1825 [[George Stephenson]] built the ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in [[North East England|northeast]] England, the first public steam railway in the world.

The first successful electric [[streetcar]] was built for 12 miles of track for the Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia in 1888. Electric streetcars could carry heavier passenger loads than predecessors, which reduced fares and stimulated greater transit use.
Two years after the Richmond success, over thirty two thousand electric streetcars were operating in America. Electric streetcars also paved the way for the first [[Rapid transit|subway]] system in America. Before electric streetcars, steam powered subways were considered. However, most people believed that riders would avoid the smoke filled subway tunnels from the steam engines. In 1894, Boston built the first subway in the United States, an electric streetcar line in a 1.5 mile tunnel under Tremont Street’s retail district. Other cities such as New York quickly followed, constructing hundreds of miles of subway in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;

===Comparing modes===

Seven criteria measure the usability of different types of public transport and its overall appeal. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and directness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/12/17/city-transport-in-the-2020s/ |title=City Transport in the 2020s |work=Transport and Travel |first=Pat |last=Humphreys |date=17 December 2016 |access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness is how long they must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the route.

In selecting between competing [[modes of transport]], many individuals are strongly motivated by [[direct cost]] (travel fare/ ticket price to them) and [[convenience]], as well as being informed by [[habit]]. The same individual may accept the lost time and statistically [[Aviation safety#Transport comparisons|higher risk of accident]] in [[private transport]], together with the initial, running and parking costs. [[locus of control|Loss of control]], spatial constriction, [[overcrowding]], high speeds/accelerations, height and other [[phobia]]s may discourage use of public transport.

Actual travel time on public transport becomes a lesser consideration when [[Predictability|predictable]] and when travel itself is reasonably [[comfort]]able (seats, toilets, services), and can thus be scheduled and used pleasurably, productively or for (overnight) rest. Chauffeured movement is enjoyed by many people when it is relaxing, safe but not too monotonous. Waiting, interchanging, stops and holdups, for example due to traffic or for security, are discomforting. [[Jet lag]] is a human constraint discouraging frequent rapid long-distance East-West commuting, favoring modern telecommunications and VR technologies.

===Airline===
{{See also|Airline|Bush airplane}}
An airline provides scheduled service with aircraft between airports. Air travel has high speeds, but incurs large waiting times prior to and after travel, and is therefore often only feasible over longer distances or in areas where a lack of ground infrastructure makes other modes of transport impossible. Bush airlines work more similarly to bus stops; an aircraft waits for passengers and takes off when the aircraft is full.

===Bus and coach===
{{Main article|Public transport bus service}}
{{Main article|Coach (scheduled transport)}}

[[File:Stagecoach Neoplans on Oxford Tube.JPG|thumb|right|Two [[Oxford to London coach route|Oxford Tube]] body on chassis vehicles at the Buckingham Palace Road terminus]]
[[Public transport bus service|Bus services]] use [[bus]]es on conventional roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with low capacity (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses are commonly used in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for [[Share taxi|shuttle]] services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. [[Bus rapid transit]] is an ambiguous term used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much like a light rail. [[Trolleybus]]es are [[electric bus]]es that receive power from [[overhead wire]]s for mobility. [[Online Electric Vehicle]]s are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are [[inductive charging|recharged]] frequently at certain points via underground wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ |title=KAIST Online Electric Vehicle |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intercity bus service|Coach services]] use [[Coach (bus)|coaches]] (long-distance buses) for suburb-to-CBD or longer-distance transportation. The vehicles are normally equipped with more comfortable seating, a separate luggage compartment, video and possibly also a toilet. They have higher standards than city buses, but a limited stopping pattern.

===Train===

{{Main article|Rail transport}}

Passenger rail transport is the conveyance of passengers by means of wheeled vehicles specially designed to run on railways. Trains allow high capacity on short or long distance, but require [[Track (rail transport)|track]], [[Signalling control|signalling]], infrastructure and [[train station|stations]] to be built and maintained. [[Urban rail transit]] consists of [[tram]]s, [[light rail]], [[rapid transit]], [[people mover]]s, [[commuter rail]], [[monorail]], [[suspension railway]]s and [[funicular]]s.
{{clear}}

====Commuter, intercity, and high-speed rail====
[[File:Melrose RR Station 02.JPG|thumb|right|A [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] train in [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham]], [[Pennsylvania]], a form of commuter rail]]
[[Commuter rail]] is part of an urban area's public transport; it provides faster services to outer suburbs and neighboring towns and villages. Trains stop at [[train station|stations]] that are located to serve a smaller suburban or town center. The stations are often combined with shuttle bus or [[park and ride]] systems. Frequency may be up to several times per hour, and commuter rail systems may either be part of the national railway or operated by local transit agencies.

[[Intercity rail]] is long-haul passenger services that connect multiple urban areas. They have few stops, and aim at high average speeds, typically only making one of a few stops per city. These services may also be international.

[[High-speed rail]] is passenger trains operating significantly faster than conventional rail—typically defined as at least {{convert|200|km/h|mph}}. The most predominant systems have been built in Europe and East Asia, and compared with air travel, offer long-distance rail journeys as quick as air services, have lower prices to compete more effectively and use electricity instead of combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Eli |url=http://www.techthefuture.com/mobility/high-speed-train-vs-airplane/ |title=High Speed Train VS Airplane |publisher=Tech the Future |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rapid transit====
[[File:Skytrain Mark II-300.jpg|thumb|The [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] in [[Vancouver]] is the longest rapid transit system in Canada.]]
{{main article|Rapid transit}}

A rapid transit railway system (also called a metro, underground, or subway) operates in an urban area with high capacity and frequency, and [[grade separation]] from other traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapid%20transit| title=Rapid transit| publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]| accessdate=27 February 2008}}; {{cite web| url=http://www.uitp.org/Public-Transport/metro/index.cfm| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hh1WoLa5?url=http://www.uitp.org/Public-Transport/metro/index.cfm| archivedate=27 June 2013| title=Metro| publisher=[[International Association of Public Transport]]| accessdate=27 February 2008| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aptaglossary&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.apta.com/research/info/online/glossary.cfm| title=Glossary of Transit Terminology| publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]]| accessdate=27 February 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220938/http://www.apta.com/research/info/online/glossary.cfm| archivedate=27 September 2007| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems are able to transport large numbers of people quickly over short distances with little land use. Variations of rapid transit include [[people mover]]s, small-scale [[light metro]] and the commuter rail hybrid [[S-Bahn]]. More than 160 cities have rapid transit systems, totalling more than {{convert|8000|km|0|abbr=on}} of track and 7,000 stations. Twenty-five cities have systems under construction.

====Tram====
{{main article|Tram}}
[[File:TTC Bombardier ALRV 4239.jpg|thumb|A [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar in Toronto]], which operates the largest tramway in North America]]

Trams are railborne vehicles that run in city streets or dedicated tracks. They have higher capacity than buses, but must follow dedicated infrastructure with rails and wires either above or below the track, limiting their flexibility.

====Light rail====
{{main article|Light rail}}

Light rail is a modern development (and use) of the tram, with dedicated right-of-way not shared with other traffic, (often) step-free access and increased speed. Light rail lines are, thus, essentially modernized [[interurban]]s.

===Personal rapid transit===
[[File:Morgantown PRT - Beechurst Station.jpg|thumb|People mover vehicle of [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit]]]]
{{main article|Personal rapid transit}}

[[Personal rapid transit]] is an automated cab service that runs on rails or a [[Automated guideway transit|guideway]]. This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding [[elevator]]s) due to the complexity of automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the guideway to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and drop them off to the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor-intensive [[taxicab|taxi]] or [[paratransit]] modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) [[elevator]]s common in many publicly accessible areas.

===Cable-propelled transit===
{{see also|Aerial tramway|Gondola lift|Cable car (railway)}}

Cable-propelled transit (CPT) is a transit technology that moves people in motor-less, engine-less vehicles that are propelled by a steel cable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gondolaproject.com/2009/11/07/basic-lesson-1-what-is-cable-propelled-transit/ – The Gondola Project] Basic Lesson 1: What is Cable Propelled Transit Retrieved on 7 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There are two sub-groups of CPT – [[gondola lift]]s and [[cable car (railway)|cable cars (railway)]]. Gondola lifts are supported and propelled from above by cables, whereas cable cars are supported and propelled from below by cables.
[[File:Gulmarg gondola.JPG|thumb|[[Gulmarg Gondola]] in [[Gulmarg]], India]]
While historically associated with usage in [[ski resort]]s, gondola lifts are now finding increased consumption and utilization in many urban areas – built specifically for the purposes of mass transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/node/44559 – Planetizen] South America Incubates Cable Propelled Transit Retrieved on 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not all, of these systems are implemented and fully integrated within existing public transportation networks. Examples include [[Metrocable (Medellín)]], [[Metrocable (Caracas)]], [[Portland Aerial Tram]], [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]] in New York City, and London's [[Emirates Air Line (gondola lift)|Emirates Air Line]].

===Ferry===
[[File:Accademia-vaporetto-stop-20050525-016.jpg|thumb|Water taxi (''[[vaporetto]]'') of [[Venice]], Italy]]
{{main article|Ferry}}

A ferry is a boat used to carry (or ''ferry'') passengers, and sometimes their vehicles, across a body of water. A [[wikt:foot-passenger|foot-passenger]] ferry with many stops is sometimes called a [[water bus]]. Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels, though at a lower speed. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the [[Mediterranean Sea]]) may also be called ferry services.

===Cycleway network===
A report published by the UK National Infrastructure Commission in 2018 states that 'cycling is mass transit and must be treated as such'. Cycling infrastructure is normally provided without charge to users because it is cheaper to operate than mechanised transit systems that use sophisticated equipment and do not use [[human power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nic.org.uk/publications/running-out-of-road-investing-in-cycling-in-cambridge-milton-keynes-and-oxford/ |title=Running out of road |author=Andrew Gilligan | website=National Infrastructure Commission |publisher=National Infrastructure Commission|access-date=2018-01-30 |quote=cycling is mass transit and must be treated as such.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Cycle superhighway cs6.jpg|thumb|Cycle Superhighway CS6 is part of Central London's Cycle Network mass transit infrastructure]]

==Operation==
[[File:Bus Ride Through Downtown Seattle (Time-lapse).ogv|thumb|Timelapse video of [[Downtown Seattle]] from atop a [[Community Transit]] [[double-decker bus]]]]

===Infrastructure===
All public transport runs on infrastructure, either on roads, rail, airways or seaways. The infrastructure can be shared with other modes, freight and private transport, or it can be dedicated to public transport. The latter is especially valuable in cases where there are capacity problems for private transport. Investments in infrastructure are expensive and make up a substantial part of the total costs in systems that are new or expanding. Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport. Sometimes governments subsidize infrastructure by providing it free of charge, just as is common with roads for automobiles. 

===Interchanges===
{{Main article|Transport hub|Intermodal passenger transport}}
Interchanges are locations where passengers can switch from one public transport route to another. This may be between vehicles of the same mode (like a bus interchange), or e.g. between bus and train. It can be between local and intercity transport (such as at a [[central station]] or airport).
[[File:Kandirpar to Manoharpur by Rickshaw.jpg|thumb|[[Cycle rickshaw]] in [[Kandirpar]], Bangladesh]]

===Timetables===
{{Main article|Public transport timetable}}
[[Public transport timetable|Timetables]] (or 'schedules' in [[North American English]]) are provided by the transport operator to allow users to plan their journeys. They are often supplemented by [[transit map|maps]] and fare schemes to help travelers coordinate their travel. Online [[public transport route planner]]s help make planning easier. [[Mobile app]]s are available for multiple transit systems that provide timetables and other service information and, in some cases, allow ticket purchase, some allowing to plan your journey, with time fares zones eg.

Services are often arranged to operate at regular intervals throughout the day or part of the day (known as [[clock-face scheduling]]). Often, more frequent services or even extra routes are operated during the morning and evening [[rush hour]]s. Coordination between services at interchange points is important to reduce the total travel time for passengers. This can be done by coordinating shuttle services with main routes, or by creating a fixed time (for instance twice per hour) when all bus and rail routes meet at a station and exchange passengers. There is often a potential conflict between this objective and optimising the utilisation of vehicles and drivers.

===Financing===
The main sources of financing are ticket revenue, government subsidies and advertising. The percentage of revenue from passenger charges is known as the [[farebox recovery ratio]]. A limited amount of income may come from [[land development]] and rental income from stores and vendors, parking fees, and leasing tunnels and rights-of-way to carry [[fiber optic]] communication lines.

====Fare and ticketing====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fare]] as Fares and from [[Discounts and allowances]] as Multi-use tickets --&gt;
[[File:Smart card machines in Bus in Moscow 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A contactless ticket validator used in [[Moscow]], Russia]]
[[File:Transperth SmartRider Card.jpg|thumb|The [[Smartrider]] is a [[smart card]] for public transportation tickets in [[Perth]], Western Australia]]
Most—but not all—public transport requires the purchase of a [[ticket (admission)|ticket]] to generate [[revenue]] for the operators. Tickets may be bought either in advance, or at the time of the journey, or the carrier may allow both methods. Passengers may be issued with a paper ticket, a metal or plastic [[token coin|token]], or a magnetic or electronic card ([[smart card]], [[contactless smart card]]). Sometimes a ticket has to be validated, e.g. a paper ticket has to be stamped, or an [[electronic ticket]] has to be checked in.

Tickets may be valid for a single (or return) trip, or valid within a certain area for a period of time (see [[transit pass]]). The [[fare]] is based on the travel class, either depending on the traveled distance, or based on [[zone pricing]].

The tickets may have to be shown or checked automatically at the station platform or when boarding, or during the ride by a [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]]. Operators may choose to control all riders, allowing sale of the ticket at the time of ride. Alternatively, a [[proof-of-payment]] system allows riders to enter the vehicles without showing the ticket, but riders may or may not be controlled by a [[ticket controller]]; if the rider fails to show proof of payment, the operator may fine the rider at the magnitude of the fare.

Multi-use tickets allow travel more than once. In addition to return tickets, this includes period cards allowing travel within a certain area (for instance month cards), or during a given number of days that can be chosen within a longer period of time (for instance eight days within a month). Passes aimed at tourists, allowing free or discounted entry at many tourist attractions, typically include [[zero-fare public transport]] within the city. Period tickets may be for a particular route (in both directions), or for a [[Integrated ticketing|whole network]]. A [[free travel pass]] allowing free and unlimited travel within a system is sometimes granted to particular social sectors, for example students, elderly, children, employees (''[[job ticket]]'') and the physically or mentally [[disabled]].

[[Zero-fare public transport]] services are funded in full by means other than collecting a fare from passengers, normally through heavy [[subsidy]] or commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] by businesses. Several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their entire bus networks to zero-fare. The only European capital with free public transport is [[Tallinn]]. Local zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than city-wide systems. There are also zero-fare airport circulators and university transportation systems.

====Revenue, profit and subsidies====
{{Main article|Subsidy}}Governments frequently opt to subsidize public transport for social, environmental or economic reasons. Common motivations include the desire to provide transport to people who are unable to use an automobile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtpi.org/tranben.pdf|title=Evaluating Transportation Equity: Guidance for Incorporating Distributional Impacts in Transportation Planning|last=Litman|first=Todd|date=June 2014|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to reduce congestion, land use and automobile emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtpi.org/tranben.pdf|title=Evaluating Public Transit Benefits and Costs|last=Litman|first=Todd|date=September 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidies may take the form of direct payments for financially unprofitable services, but support may also include indirect subsidies. For example, the government may allow free or reduced-cost use of state-owned infrastructure such as railways and roads, to stimulate public transport's economic competitiveness over private transport, that normally also has free infrastructure (subsidized through such things as gas taxes). Other subsidies include tax advantages (for instance [[aviation fuel]] is typically not taxed), bailouts if companies that are likely to collapse (often applied to airlines) and reduction of competition through licensing schemes (often applied to taxis and airlines). Private transport is normally subsidized indirectly through free roads and infrastructure,&lt;ref name="pubsindex.trb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubsindex.trb.org/view.aspx?id=186860 |title=Subsidies In Oregon Highway Transportation – Publications Index |publisher=Pubsindex.trb.org |date=31 January 1983 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as incentives to build car factories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3023 |title=Canadian auto subsidies: Money for nothing? &amp;#124; vox – Research-based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists |publisher=Voxeu.org |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on occasion, directly via bailouts of automakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/06/general_motors_bailout_over_vi.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=General Motors bailout details | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418184338/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/06/general_motors_bailout_over_vi.html | archivedate=18 April 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth |first=Alisa |url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/04/auto_bailout_history/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711021253/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/04/auto_bailout_history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 July 2012 |title=Auto bailout talk is history repeating &amp;#124; Marketplace From American Public Media |publisher=Marketplace.publicradio.org |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land development schemes may be initialized, where operators are given the rights to use lands near stations, depots, or tracks for property development. For instance, in Hong Kong, [[MTR Corporation Limited]] and [[KCR Corporation]] generate additional profits from land development to partially cover the cost of the construction of the urban rail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Case%204-%20Land%20Value%20-%20Hong-Kong%20MTR.pdf|title=Land Value Capture Mechanism: The Case of the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway|last=Verougstraete|first=Matheiu|last2=Zeng|first2=Han|date=July 2014|website=www.unescap.org|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of mass transit believe that use of taxpayer capital to fund mass transit will ultimately save taxpayer money in other ways, and therefore, state-funded mass transit is a benefit to the taxpayer. Some research has supported this position,&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_49.pdf and http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the measurement of benefits and costs is a complex and controversial issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05423sp.pdf |title=GAO-05-423SP Highlights of an Expert Panel: The Benefits and Costs of Highway and Transit Investments |format=PDF |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of mass transit results in more traffic, pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/article/424413| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022171529/http://www.thestar.com/article/424413 | archivedate=22 October 2012| location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Transit key in pollution, poverty fights | date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthtopics/airpollution.htm |title=CDC – Healthy Places – Respiratory Health and Air Pollution |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtpi.org/tca/tca0510.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – 5_10-Air |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and road construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/contracts/price.cfm |title=Highway Construction Cost / Inflation Issues – Contract Admin – Construction – FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to accommodate more vehicles, all costly to taxpayers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Transport Public Institute |url=http://www.vtpi.org/tca/ |title=Victoria Transport Institute – Transportation Cost and Benefit Analysis |publisher=Vtpi.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing mass transit will therefore alleviate these costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtpi.org/tca/tca11.pdf |title=Tcall |website=www.vtpi.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Perhaps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm96.htm |title=Online TDM Encyclopedia – Congestion Reduction |publisher=Vtpi.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/movingwashington/ |title=WSDOT – Moving Washington – A program to fight congestion |publisher=Wsdot.wa.gov |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation1.org/tif2report/transit.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310052641/http://www.transportation1.org/tif2report/transit.html|archivedate=2013-03-10 |title=Transportation Invest In Our Future – Surface Transportation Policy Recommendations |publisher=Transportation1.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RAND Corporation |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9385/index1.html |title=Reducing Traffic Congestion in Los Angeles |publisher=RAND |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although right-wing think tanks disagree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/centers/transportation/policynote/04_otoole_railtransit.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313130617/http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/centers/transportation/policynote/04_otoole_railtransit.html|archivedate=2016-03-13|title=Page Not Found » Search » Washington Policy Center|author=|date=13 March 2016|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-ro-20090707.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412183534/http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-ro-20090707.html|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:LASD on MTA train.png|thumb|A [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] deputy and a [[police dog]] patrol a [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|LA Metro]] light rail train]]
In the United States expansion of public transportation systems is often opposed by critics who see them as vehicles for violent criminals and homeless persons to expand into new areas (to which they would otherwise have to walk).&lt;ref&gt;Achs, Nicole.  "Roadblocks to public transit: for reasons ranging from prejudice to pragmatism, many suburbanites are fighting tooth and nail to keep mass transit out of their neighborhoods."  ''American City &amp; County'' 106, no. 1 (January 1991): 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Transportation Research Board]], "[v]iolent crime is perceived as pandemic .... Personal security affects many peoples' [sic] decisions to use public transportation."&lt;ref&gt;Transit Cooperative Research Program, ''TCRP Synthesis 21: Improving Transit Security'' (Washington, D.C.: Transportation Research Board, 1997), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the occasional highly publicized incident, the vast majority of modern public transport systems are well designed and patrolled and generally have low crime rates. Many systems are monitored by CCTV, mirrors, or patrol.&lt;ref name=safety&gt;Needle et al., 1997: 10–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some systems attract vagrants who use the stations or trains as sleeping shelters, though most operators have practices that discourage this.&lt;ref name=safety/&gt;

Though public transit accidents attract far more publicity than car wrecks, public transport has much lower accident rates. Annually, public transit prevents 200,000 deaths, injuries, and accidents had equivalent trips been made by car. The [[National Safety Council]] estimates that riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private car.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120314123647/http://www.publictransportation.org/reports/asp/pub_benefits.asp]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mettis BRT Metz.jpg|thumb|The pink [[Bus Rapid Transit]] of [[Metz]] uses a [[Hybrid vehicle|diesel-electric hybrid]] driving system, developed by Belgian [[Van Hool]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html|title=Van Hool presents the ExquiCity Design Mettis.|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605074801/http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although there is continuing debate as to the true efficiency of different modes of transportation, mass transit is generally regarded as significantly more energy efficient than other forms of travel. A 2002 study by the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] found that public transportation in the U.S uses approximately half the fuel required by cars, SUV's and light trucks. In addition, the study noted that "private vehicles emit about 95 percent more carbon monoxide, 92 percent more volatile organic compounds and about twice as much carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide than public vehicles for every passenger mile traveled".&lt;ref&gt;Lyndsey Layton, "Study Lists Mass Transit Benefits", The Washington Post, 17 July 2002, Page B05&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study from [[Lancaster University]] concluded that there was no environmental benefit to be gained from persuading car or plane travelers to switch to trains. Environmental group [[Friends of the Earth]] were skeptical of the findings, claiming the results are not in line with previous studies.&lt;ref name="dt_20040621"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cars are more fuel-efficient than trains, claims study |date=21 June 2004 |author=Paul Marston |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1465041/Cars-are-more-fuel-efficient-than-trains-claims-study.html |accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study showed that trains had failed to keep up with the advances that the automotive and aviation industries had made in improved fuel efficiency.  Express trains travelling from London to Edinburgh consumed 11.5 litres more fuel per seat than a modern diesel car.

Studies have shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between [[population density|urban population density]] and [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption per capita]], and that public transport could facilitate increased urban population densities, and thus reduce travel distances and fossil fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the [[green movement]] usually advocate public transportation, because it offers decreased airborne [[pollution]] compared to automobiles. A study conducted in Milan, Italy, in 2004 during and after a transportation strike serves to illustrate the impact that mass transportation has on the environment. Air samples were taken between 2 and 9 January, and then tested for methane, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and other gases identified as harmful to the environment.  The figure below is a computer simulation showing the results of the study "with 2 January showing the lowest concentrations as a result of decreased activity in the city during the holiday season. 9 January showed the highest NMHC concentrations because of increased vehicular activity in the city due to a public transportation strike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barletta |first=Barbara |first2=Donald |last2=Dabdub |first3=Donald R. |last3=Blake |first4=F.

Based on the benefits of public transport, the green movement has impacted public policy. For example, the state of New Jersey released ''Getting to Work: Reconnecting Jobs with Transit''.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Future. "[http://njedl.rutgers.edu/njdlib/details.cfm?RECORD_ID=5828&amp;formKeyword=public%20transportation&amp;formTitle=&amp;formOriginator=&amp;formThemekey=&amp;formPlacekey=&amp;formDoctype=&amp;order=PublicationDate%20DESC&amp;quicksearch=yes&amp;results_next=0 Getting to Work: Reconnecting Jobs with Transit.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041526/http://njedl.rutgers.edu/njdlib/details.cfm?RECORD_ID=5828&amp;formKeyword=public%20transportation&amp;formTitle=&amp;formOriginator=&amp;formThemekey=&amp;formPlacekey=&amp;formDoctype=&amp;order=PublicationDate%20DESC&amp;quicksearch=yes&amp;results_next=0 |date=20 July 2011 }}" New Jersey Future.1 November 2008.New Jersey Environmental Digital Library. 7 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative attempts to relocate new jobs into areas with higher public transportation accessibility.  The initiative cites the use of public transportation as being a means of reducing traffic congestion, providing an economic boost to the areas of job relocation, and most importantly, contributing to a green environment by reducing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions.

Using public transportation can result in a reduction of an individual's carbon footprint.  A single person, {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} round trip by car can be replaced using public transportation and result in a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions reduction of {{convert|4,800|lb|kg}} per year.&lt;ref name="publictransportation.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101128105200/http://publictransportation.org/reports/documents/greenhouse_brochure.pdf Public Transportation Reduces Greenhouse Gases and Conserves Energy].&lt;/ref&gt; Using public transportation saves CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in more ways than simply travel as public transportation can help to alleviate traffic congestion as well as promote more efficient land use.  When all three of these are considered, it is estimated that 37 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be saved annually.&lt;ref name="publictransportation.org"/&gt; Another study claims that using public transit instead of private in the U.S. in 2005 would have reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 3.9&amp;nbsp;million metric tons and that the resulting traffic congestion reduction accounts for an additional 3.0&amp;nbsp;million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saved.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Davis; Monica Hale. "Public Transportation's Contribution to U.S. Greenhouse Gas Reduction." Sept. 2007. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is a total savings of about 6.9&amp;nbsp;million metric tons per year given the 2005 values.

In order to compare energy impact of public transportation to private transportation, the amount of energy per passenger mile must be calculated. The reason that comparing the energy expenditure per person is necessary is to normalize the data for easy comparison. Here, the units are in per 100 p-km (read as person kilometer or passenger kilometer). In terms of energy consumption, public transportation is better than individual transport in a personal vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;David JC MacKay. "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." 2009. p. 120 www.withouthotair.com&lt;/ref&gt; In England, bus and rail are popular methods of public transportation, especially in London. Rail provides rapid movement into and out of the city of London while busing helps to provide transport within the city itself. As of 2006–2007, the total energy cost of London's trains was 15 kWh per 100 p-km, about 5 times better than a personal car.&lt;ref name="withouthotair.com"&gt;David JC MacKay. "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." 2009. p. 121 www.withouthotair.com&lt;/ref&gt;  For busing in London, it was 32 kWh per 100 p-km, or about 2.5 times that of a personal car.&lt;ref name="withouthotair.com"/&gt; This includes lighting, depots, inefficiencies due to capacity (i.e., the train or bus may not be operating at full capacity at all times), and other inefficiencies.  Efficiencies of transport in Japan in 1999 were 68 kWh per 100 p-km for a personal car, 19 kWh per 100 p-km for a bus, 6 kWh per 100 p-km for rail, 51 kWh per 100 p-km for air, and 57 kWh per 100 p-km for sea.&lt;ref name="withouthotair.com"/&gt; These numbers from either country can be used in energy comparison calculations or life cycle assessment calculations.

Public transportation also provides an arena to test environmentally friendly fuel alternatives, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles. Swapping out materials to create lighter public transportation vehicles with the same or better performance will increase environmental friendliness of public transportation vehicles while maintaining current standards or improving them. Informing the public about the positive environmental effects of using public transportation in addition to pointing out the potential economic benefit is an important first step towards making a difference.

===Land use===
[[File:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Traffic jam]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
Urban space is a precious commodity and public transport utilises it more efficiently than a car dominant society, allowing cities to be built more compactly than if they were dependent on automobile transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/advocacy/pdf/alleviates_congestion.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sdcElxUx?url=http://www.uitp.org/advocacy/pdf/alleviates_congestion.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2010|title=UITP – Public transport alleviates congestion|format=PDF|accessdate=21 October 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[public transport planning]] is at the core of [[urban planning]], it will also force cities to be built more compactly to create efficient feeds into the stations and stops of transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/advocacy/public_transport.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310084948/http://www.uitp.org/advocacy/public_transport.cfm|archivedate=2012-03-10 |title=UITP Advocacy |publisher=Uitp.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will at the same time allow the creation of centers around the hubs, serving passengers' daily commercial needs and public services. This approach significantly reduces [[urban sprawl]]. Public land planning for public transportation can be difficult but it is the State and Regional organizations that are responsible to planning and improving public transportation roads and routes. With public land prices booming, there must be a plan to using the land most efficiently for public transportation in order to create better transportation systems. Inefficient land use and poor planning leads to a decrease in accessibility to jobs, education, and health care. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulyk|first1=Walter|title=Urban Public Transportation Systems: Ensuring Sustainability Through Mass Transit|date=2002|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|isbn=0-7844-0717-7|pages=408–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important social role played by public transport is to ensure that all members of society are able to travel, not just those with a driving license and access to an automobile—which include groups such as the young, the old, the poor, those with medical conditions, and people banned from driving. [[Automobile dependency]] is a name given by policy makers to places where those without access to a private vehicle do not have access to independent mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Litman, T. |title=The Costs of Automobile Dependency and the Benefits of Balanced Transport |publisher=Victoria Public Policy Institute |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above that, public transportation opens to its users the possibility of meeting other people, as no concentration is diverted from interacting with fellow-travelers due to any steering activities. Adding to the above-said, public transport becomes a location of inter-social encounters across all boundaries of social, ethnic and other types of affiliation.

===Economic===
[[File:Električkový tunel.JPG|right|thumb|Tram [[tunnel]] in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia - a connection of embankment with a city centre]]
In the past, public transport allowed transport at an [[economy of scale]] not available through private transport. Nowadays there is considerable debate on the advantages and disadvantages of mass transit. According to the OECD, the advantages of [[Carsharing|carsharing networks]] could very well obviate the need for traditional public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/15cpb_self-drivingcars.pdf|title=Urban Mobility System  Upgrade|last=OECD|first=|date=|website=International Transport Forum|publisher=OECD|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of public transport claim that investing in mass transit will ultimately reduce the total transport cost for the public. Time saved can also be significant, as fewer cars can translate to less congestion, and faster speeds for remaining motorists.

[[Transit-oriented development]] can both improve the usefulness and efficiency of the public transit system as well as result in increased business for commercial developments.

Because of the increased traffic and access to transit systems, putting in public transit frequently has a positive effect on real estate prices. For example, the [[DC Metro|Washington DC Metro system]] has increased land desirability around its stations, and The Hong Kong metro [[MTR]] generates a profit by redeveloping land around and above its stations. Much public opposition to new transit construction can be based on the concern about the impact on neighborhoods of this new economic development.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Few localities have the ability to [[Eminent domain|seize and reassign development rights]] to a private transit operator, as Hong Kong has done.

Investment in public transport also has secondary positive effects on the local economy, with between $4&lt;ref name="aptaPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/Caseforbusiness.pdf |title=The Business Case for Investment in Public Transportation |format=PDF |publisher=APTA |date=March 2015 | accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $9 of economic activity resulting from every dollar spent.&lt;ref name=PT.org/&gt; Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require large numbers of people going to a same place may not be able to accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as [[Hopstop.com]], that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does a better job of providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/11/~/media/D3589634EEC94C09B895AB17D126DC1F.ashx Brookings Institution, ''Connecting to Opportunity: Access to Jobs via Transit in the Washington, D.C. Region'', November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, public transport projects frequently have very large upfront costs, requiring large investments from either local government or private investors. Initial estimates of project cost and timescale are frequently underestimated, and nearly all public transport requires government subsidies or direct government support in order to remain operational.

The existence of a transit system can lower land values in some cases, either through influence on a region's demographics and crime rate (actual or perceived), or simply through the ambient noise and other discomforts the system creates.

==Regulations==

===Food and drink===
Longer distance public transport sometimes sell food and drinks on board, or have a dedicated [[buffet car]] or [[Bistro car|dining car]]. However, some urban transport systems forbid the consumption of food, drink, or even chewing gum when riding on public transport. Sometimes only certain types of food are forbidden with a higher risk of making a mess, e.g. ice creams and chips, and sometimes crisps.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some systems prohibit carrying open food or beverage containers, even if the food or beverage is not being consumed during the journey.

===Smoking===
In Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Norway, Botswana, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and most of the [[European Union]], [[smoking]] is prohibited in all, or some parts of most public transportation systems due to health and safety issues. Generally smoking is not allowed on buses and trains, while rules concerning stations and waiting platforms differ from system to system. The situation in other countries varies widely, due to varying [[Smoking ban|smoking laws.]]

===Noise===
Many mass transit systems prohibit the use of audio devices, such as radios, [[CD player]]s, and MP3 players unless used with [[earphones]] through which only the user can hear the audio transmitted.

Some mass transit systems have restricted the use of mobile phones. Long distance train services, such as the [[Amtrak]] system in the United States, have "quiet cars" where mobile phone usage is prohibited.

Some systems forbid passengers from engaging in conversation with the operator. Others require that passengers who engage in any conversation must keep the noise level low enough that it not be audible to other passengers.

Some systems have regulations on the use of profanity. In the United States, this has been challenged as a [[free speech]] issue.

===Banned items===
Certain items considered to be problematic are prohibited or regulated on many mass transit systems. These include [[firearm]]s and other weapons (unless licensed to carry), explosives, flammable items, or hazardous chemicals and substances.

Many systems prohibit live animals, but allow those that are in carrying cases or other closed containers. Additionally, guide dogs for the blind or disabled are usually exempt from these rules.

Some systems prohibit items of a large size that may take up a lot of space, such as non-[[Folding Bicycle|folding]] bicycles. But more systems in recent years have been permitting passengers to bring bicycles onboard public transport.

In Sydney, it is illegal to carry spray cans or permanent markers on board public transport, as they can be used to cause vandalism to the vehicles and stations. This rule also applies to sharp instruments that could damage on the train; such as screwdrivers that could be used to make "scratchitti", a form of vandalism where tags are carved into a window.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Other regulations===
Many systems have regulations against behavior deemed to be unruly or otherwise disturbing to other passengers. In such cases, it is usually at the discretion of the operator, police officers, or other transit employees to determine what behaviors fit this description.

Some systems{{which|date=January 2015}} have regulations against photography or [[videography]] of the system's vehicles, stations, or other property. Those seen holding a mobile phone in a manner consistent with photography are considered to be suspicious for breaking this rule. This is another issue that is challenged in the courts in the United States as a "Free Speech" issue.  Almost all riders are equipped with cell phones which can take pictures or record what is happening on the lines. Riders are able to record the actions of transit police and transportation system employees.

===Sleeping===
In the era when long distance trips took several days, [[lodging|sleeping accommodations]] were an essential part of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the [[inn]] or [[ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]], which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include [[sleeping car]]s on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys instead of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep on the way to work is attractive to many commuters using public transport.

Because night trains or coaches can be cheaper than motels, [[homeless]] persons often use these as overnight shelters, as with the famous [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority#Bus routes|Line 22]] ("Hotel 22") in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lii, "Refuge On The Road: Homeless Find Nighttime Haven – The No. 22 Bus From Menlo Park To San Jose", ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', 9 January 2000, 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Newman, "Silicon Valley: Inside the Dream Incubator", ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' 200, no. 6 (December 2001): 52–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a local transit route with a long overnight segment and which accepts inexpensive multi-use passes will acquire a reputation as a "moving hotel" for people with limited funds. Most transportation agencies actively discourage this. For this and other reasons passengers are often required to exit the vehicle at the end of the line; they can board again in the same or another vehicle, after some waiting. Even a low fare in some cases often deters the poorest individuals, including homeless people.

'''Quobject® Designer''' is a [[freeware]] [[computer software]] running on [[MS Windows]]. It enables easy creation of question object files ([[quox]]). Exam questions in the [[quox]] format can easily be shared among teachers and quickly combined for rapid creation of worksheets, exams and online quizzes within [[Quobject Explorer]].

The question object file contains all information for an exam question i.e. question text, pictures, math formulas, number of marks, number of dotted lines for student answer (used when creating a paper version of quiz). The question object file contains also the answer to the question, which is used to create a separate answer sheet when creating a paper version of the quiz/exam. 
Once the [[quox]] file of a question is written the question can easily be configured with other questions to create a written paper containing this question. This configuration occurs by drag and drop within [[Quobject Explorer]]. Worksheets created within [[Quobject Explorer]] can be exported to a "quiz" file which is an ordered zip package of [[quox]] files.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7731">'''Radiolysis''' is the [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of [[molecules]] by ionizing [[radiation]]. It is the cleavage of one or several [[chemical bond]]s resulting from exposure to high-energy flux. The radiation in this context is associated with [[ionizing radiation]]; radiolysis is therefore distinguished from, for example, [[photodissociation|photolysis]] of the [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] molecule into two Cl-[[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], where ([[ultraviolet]] or visible) [[light]] is used.

For example, water dissociates under [[alpha radiation]] into a hydrogen [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] and a [[hydroxyl radical]], unlike ionization of water which produces a [[hydrogen ion]] and a [[hydroxide]] ion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The [[chemistry]] of concentrated solutions under [[ionizing radiation]] is extremely complex. Radiolysis can locally modify [[redox]] conditions, and therefore the [[ion speciation|speciation]] and the [[solubility]] of the compounds.

==Water decomposition==
Of all the radiation-chemical reactions that have been studied, the most important is the decomposition of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marie Curie |title= [[Traité de radioactivité]], pp. v–xii. Published by Gauthier-Villars in Paris, 1910.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exposed to radiation, water undergoes a breakdown sequence into [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[free-radical addition|hydrogen radicals]], and assorted oxygen compounds, such as [[ozone]], which when converted back into oxygen releases great amounts of energy. Some of these are explosive. This decomposition is produced mainly by the alpha particles, which can be entirely absorbed by very thin layers of water.

==Applications==

===Corrosion prediction and prevention in nuclear power plants===
It is believed that the enhanced concentration of hydroxyl present in irradiated water in the inner coolant loops of a [[light-water reactor]] must be taken into account when designing nuclear power plants, to prevent coolant loss resulting from [[corrosion]].

===Hydrogen production===
The current interest in nontraditional methods for the generation of hydrogen has prompted a revisit of radiolytic splitting of water, where the interaction of various types of ionizing radiation (α, β, and γ) with water produces molecular hydrogen. This reevaluation was further prompted by the current availability of large amounts of radiation sources contained in the fuel discharged from [[nuclear reactor]]s. This [[spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] is usually stored in water pools, awaiting permanent disposal or [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]. The yield of hydrogen resulting from the irradiation of water with β and γ radiation is low (G-values = &lt;1 molecule per 100 [[electronvolt]]s of absorbed energy) but this is largely due to the rapid reassociation of the species arising during the initial radiolysis. If impurities are present or if physical conditions are created that prevent the establishment of a chemical equilibrium, the net production of hydrogen can be greatly enhanced.

Another approach uses radioactive waste as an energy source for regeneration of spent fuel by converting [[sodium borate]] into [[sodium borohydride]]. By applying the proper combination of controls, stable borohydride compounds may be produced and used as hydrogen fuel storage medium.

===Spent nuclear fuel===
Gas generation by radiolytic decomposition of hydrogen-containing materials, has been an area of concern for the transport and storage of radioactive materials and waste for a number of years. Potentially combustible and corrosive gases can be generated while at the same time, chemical reactions can remove hydrogen, and these reactions can be enhanced by the presence of radiation. The balance between these competing reactions is not well known at this time.

===Earth's history===
A suggestion has been made&lt;ref&gt;R Bogdanov and Arno-Toomas Pihlak of the [[Saint Petersburg State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; that in the early stages of the Earth's development when its [[radioactivity]] was almost two orders of magnitude higher than at present, radiolysis could have been the principal source of atmospheric oxygen, which ensured the conditions for the origin and development of [[life]]. Molecular hydrogen and oxidants produced by the radiolysis of water may also provide a continuous source of energy to subsurface [[microbiology|microbial]] communities (Pedersen, 1999). Such speculation is supported by a discovery in the [[Mponeng Gold Mine]] in [[South Africa]], where the researchers found a community dominated by a new phylotype of ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'', feeding on primarily radiolytically produced [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li-Hung Lin |author2=Pei-Ling Wang |author3=Douglas Rumble |author4=Johanna Lippmann-Pipke |author5=Erik Boice |author6=Lisa M. Pratt |author7=[[Barbara Sherwood Lollar]] |author8=Eoin L. Brodie |author9=Terry C. Hazen |author10=Gary L. Andersen |author11=Todd Z. DeSantis |author12=Duane P.

==Methods==

===Pulse radiolysis===
Pulse radiolysis is a recent method of initiating fast reactions to study reactions occurring on a timescale faster than approximately one hundred [[microsecond]]s, when simple mixing of [[reagent]]s is too slow and other methods of initiating reactions have to be used.

The technique involves exposing a sample of material to a beam of highly accelerated [[electron]]s, where the beam is generated by a [[linac]]. It has many applications. It was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by John Keene in Manchester and [[Jack W. Boag]] in London.

===Flash photolysis===
[[Flash photolysis]] is an alternative to pulse radiolysis that uses high-power light pulses (e.g. from an [[excimer laser]]) rather than beams of electrons to initiate chemical reactions. Typically ultraviolet light is used which requires less radiation shielding than required for the X-rays emitted in pulse radiolysis.

==Products==

Stanley's products include standard headlights ([[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]]) as well as [[LED]] headlights. Stanley developed the world's first LED high-mount stop lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanley.co.jp/e/product/car.html |title=High mount stop lamps |publisher=Stanley Electric |access-date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley also produces all types of automotive lighting, backlighted LED displays, camera flashes, automotive interior displays, sensors, light fixtures and streetlights, as used in [[Shanghai]] and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanley.co.jp/e/product/index.html |title=Stanley product index |publisher=Stanley Electric |access-date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2013 onward, Stanley will concentrate more on the development of LED headlights and plans to raise the LED share from 1% to 20% by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supplierbusiness.com/news/19729/stanley-electric-shifting-focus-on-led-headlights |title=Stanley Electric shifting focus on LED Headlights |publisher=Supplier Business |date=2013-01-08 |access-date=2013-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research &amp; Development==

Stanley does R&amp;D at 5 research centers in Japan, where new light sources are explored, present light sources are optimized and new products are developed. One of those centers is located in the city of [[Tsukuba]]. Besides that, picoprojectors with [[MEMS]] and [[biotechnology]] are explored. Research results are regularly published in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday_SeptOct_Stanley.pdf |title=Nitrogen/oxygen plasma improves p-type MgZnO for Zinc oxide UV LEDs |publisher=Semiconductor Today |date=2011 |access-date=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515001751/http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday_SeptOct_Stanley.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-18-S2-A192 |title=Modified blackbody radiation spectrum of a selective emitter with application to incandescent light source design |publisher=Optics Express |date=2010-06-07 |access-date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley sells its products under the brand name Raybrig directly to customers and also sponsors [[Kunimitsu Takahashi|Team Kunimitsu]] in the [[Super GT]].

==Social involvement==

Founder Kitano also established the Kitano foundation for lifelong education, which awards scholarships to people who can not afford education. The foundation is active in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], the [[Philippines]], [[India]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lumaxindustries.com/pdf/annual-report-2011-2012.pdf |title=Annual Report |publisher=DK Jain Group (Lumax) |date=2012 |access-date=2013-09-13|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Event sponsorship==

Stanley takes part in illumination events worldwide. At festivities marking 150 years of Japanese-German friendship, the [[Brandenburg gate]] in [[Berlin]] was illuminated with LED floodlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanley.co.jp/e/environment/report/pdf/envi_report_2012/introduction_to_the_stanley_group_business.pdf |title=Introduction to the Stanley Group Business |publisher=Stanley Electric |date=2012 |access-date=2013-09-13|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kabuki-za]] in the [[Ginza]] is illuminated every evening by Stanley's LEDs. Both events were conducted in cooperation with lighting artist Makoto Ishii.

A '''teller system''' is the integrated hardware and software used for retail or wholesale banking transactions, most systems communicate with a [[core banking]] system or [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] over a [[secured network]]. The hardware may include a computer or terminal, Cash Drawers, Receipt and Passbook Validator/Printers, magnetic strip readers, pin keypads, bill counters, and bill/coin dispensers. The software is usually based on client/server where several clients (teller stations) are networked to a server which communicates to the mainframe via a dedicated line or satellite.

[[File:Vacuum cleaner.jpg|thumb|Canister vacuum cleaner for home use]]
[[File:Робот пылесос Roomba 780.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Roomba]], a brand of [[domestic robot]] for sweeping and vacuuming floors]]
A '''vacuum cleaner''', also known as a '''sweeper''' or '''hoover''', is a device that uses an air pump (a [[centrifugal fan]] in all but some of the very oldest models), to create a partial [[vacuum]] to [[suction|suck]] up [[dust]] and dirt, usually from floors, and from other surfaces such as upholstery and draperies.

The dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a [[cyclonic separation|cyclone]] for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which are used in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic [[central vacuum cleaner]]s, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and self-propelled [[vacuum truck]]s for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil. Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both dust and liquids.

== Name ==
Although ''vacuum cleaner'' and the short form ''vacuum'' are neutral names, in some countries (UK, Ireland) {{Anchor|Hoover}}''hoover'' is used instead as a [[genericized trademark]], and as a verb. The name comes from the [[Hoover Company]], one of the first and more influential companies in the development of the device. The device is also sometimes called a ''sweeper'' although the same term also refers to a [[carpet sweeper]], a similar invention.

==History==
[[File:VacuumCleanerIXLMuseum.jpg|upright|left|thumb|An early hand-pumped vacuum cleaner]]
The vacuum cleaner evolved from the [[carpet sweeper]] via [[manual vacuum cleaners]]. The first manual models, using bellows, were developed in the 1860s, and the first motorized designs appeared at the turn of the 20th century, with the first decade being the boom decade.

===Manual vacuums===
{{Main|Manual vacuum cleaner}}
[[File:Hess carpet sweeper patent model.png|right|thumb|Patent model of Daniel Hess's carpet sweeper]]
In 1860 a carpet sweeper was invented by Daniel Hess of [[West Union, Iowa]] that gathered dust with a rotating brush and a bellows for generating suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of vacuum cleaner by Daniel Hess in 1860|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/vacleaner.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Daniel (10 July 1860) "Carpet-Sweeper" {{US Patent|29077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early model (1869) was the "Whirlwind", invented in [[Chicago]] in 1868 by [[Ives W. McGaffey]]. The bulky device worked with a belt driven fan cranked by hand that made it awkward to operate, although it was commercially marketed with mixed success.
&lt;ref&gt;McGaffey, Ives W. (8 June 1869) "Improved-Sweeping Machine" {{US Patent|91145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar model was constructed by [[Melville R. Bissell]] of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] in 1876, who also manufactured [[carpet sweeper]]s.&lt;ref name="bissellsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bissell.com/Our-History/|title=Our History |publisher=Bissell|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later added portable vacuum cleaners to its line of cleaning tools.

===Powered vacuum cleaners===
{{See|Hubert Cecil Booth#Vacuum cleaner|David T. Kenney}}
[[File:Vacuum Cleaner 1906.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Maid|Housemaid]] using "dedusting pump", circa 1906.]]

The end of the 19th century saw the introduction of powered cleaners, although early types used some variation of blowing air to clean instead of suction.&lt;ref name="Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 45"&gt;Gantz, Carroll (Sep 21, 2012). The Vacuum Cleaner: A History. McFarland. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; One appeared in 1898 when John S. Thurman of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] submitted a patent (US No. 634,042) for a "pneumatic carpet renovator" which blew dust into a receptacle.&lt;ref name="americanheritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_4.shtml|title=The Vacuum Cleaner|author=Wohleber, Curt|date=Spring 2006|accessdate=8 December 2010|work=Invention &amp; Technology Magazine|publisher=American Heritage Publishing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313170420/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_4.shtml|archivedate=13 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurman's system, powered by an [[internal combustion engine]], traveled to the customers residence on a horse-drawn wagon as part of a door to door cleaning service. Corrine Dufour of [[Savannah, Georgia]] received two patents in 1899 and 1900 for another blown air system that seems to have featured the first use of an electric motor.&lt;ref name="Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 45"/&gt;

In 1901 powered vacuum cleaners using suction were invented independently by British engineer [[Hubert Cecil Booth]] and American inventor [[David T. Kenney]].&lt;ref name="Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 49"&gt;Gantz, Carroll (Sep 21, 2012). The Vacuum Cleaner: A History. McFarland. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanheritage"/&gt; Booth also may have coined the word "vacuum cleaner".&lt;ref name="Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 49"/&gt; Booth's horse drawn combustion engine powered "Puffing Billy",&lt;ref name="bbc_booth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1515776.stm|title=Sucking up to the vacuum cleaner|date=30 August 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; maybe derived from Thurman's blown air design,"&lt;ref name="BVC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvc.co.uk/history.html|title=THE STORY OF THE VACUUM CLEANER|work=bvc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; relied upon just suction with air pumped through a cloth filter and was offered as part of his cleaning services. Kenney's was a stationary 4,000 lb. steam engine powered system with pipes and hoses reaching into all parts of the building.

===Domestic vacuum cleaner===
[[File:Vacuum cleaner 1910.JPG|thumb|upright|A hand-powered pneumatic vacuum cleaner, circa 1910. An early electric-powered model is also shown]]
The first vacuum-cleaning device to be portable and marketed at the domestic market was built in 1905 by Walter Griffiths, a manufacturer in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/vacuum.html|title=The Changes to Vacuum Cleaners over the last 100 years|work=The People History }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Griffith's Improved Vacuum Apparatus for Removing Dust from Carpets'' resembled modern-day cleaners; – it was portable, easy to store, and powered by "any one person (such as the ordinary [[domestic servant]])", who would have the task of compressing a bellows-like contraption to suck up dust through a removable, flexible pipe, to which a variety of shaped nozzles could be attached.

[[File:NMAH DC - IMG 8859.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Early electric vacuum cleaner by Electric Suction Sweeper Company, circa 1908]]
In 1906 [[Jim Kirby|James B. Kirby]] developed his first of many vacuums called the "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions came to be known as the [[Kirby Company|Kirby]] Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor [[James M. Spangler|James Murray Spangler]] (1848-1915) of [[Canton, Ohio]] invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner,&lt;ref name="VacuumCleaner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Joel|title=Really useful: the origins of everyday things|publisher=Firefly Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyBb_Xh5hqIC&amp;pg=PT147&amp;lpg=PT147|isbn=155297622X|year=2003|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer [[William Henry Hoover]] (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the [[Hoover Company]]. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.

In [[Continental Europe]], the [[Nilfisk-Advance|Fisker and Nielsen company]] in [[Denmark]] was the first to sell vacuum cleaners in 1910. The design weighed just {{cvt|17.5|kg}} and could be operated by a single person. The Swedish company [[Electrolux]] launched their Model V in 1921 with the innovation of being able to lie on the floor on two thin metal runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Vacuum cleaner lasts for 70 years | publisher = BBC News | date = 27 January 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7205825.stm | accessdate = 28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the Germany company [[Vorwerk (company)|Vorwerk]] started marketing vacuum cleaners of their own design which they sold through [[direct sales]].

===Post-Second World War===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] DC07 upright cyclonic vacuum cleaner using [[centrifugal force]] to separate dust and particles from the air flowing through the cylindrical collection vessel]]
For many years after their introduction, vacuum cleaners remained a luxury item, but after the Second World War, they became common among the [[middle class]]es. Vacuums tend to be more common in Western countries because in most other parts of the world, [[Fitted carpet|wall-to-wall carpeting]] is uncommon and homes have [[tile]] or [[hardwood floor]]s, which are easily swept, wiped or mopped manually without power assist.

The last decades of the 20th century saw the more widespread use of technologies developed earlier, including filterless cyclonic dirt separation, central vacuum systems and rechargeable hand-held vacuums. In addition, miniaturized computer technology and improved batteries allowed the development of a new type of machine — the autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. In 1997 Electrolux of Sweden demonstrated the [[Electrolux Trilobite]], the first autonomous cordless robotic vacuum cleaner on the BBC-TV program ''Tomorrow' World'', introducing it to the consumer market in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robot cleaner hits the shops|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3031219.stm|accessdate=12 August 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=16 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In 2004 a British company released [[Airider]], a hovering vacuum cleaner that floats on a cushion of air, similar to a [[hovercraft]]. It has claimed to be light-weight and easier to maneuver (compared to using wheels), although it is not the first vacuum cleaner to do this — the Hoover Constellation predated it by at least 35 years.

A British inventor has developed a new cleaning technology known as Air Recycling Technology, which, instead of using a vacuum, uses an air stream to collect dust from the carpet.&lt;ref&gt;Edginton, B. (2008) [http://www.g0cwt.co.uk/arc/ “The Air Recycling Cleaner”]. g0cwt.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was tested by the Market Transformation Programme (MTP) and shown to be more energy-efficient than the vacuum method.&lt;ref&gt;Market Transformation Programme (2006), [http://www.mtprog.com/spm/download/document/id/613 “BNXS30: Vacuum cleaners – UK market, technologies, energy use, test methods and waste”]. Retrieved 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although working prototypes exist, Air Recycling Technology is not currently used in any production cleaner.

==Modern configurations==
A wide variety of technologies, designs, and configurations are available for both domestic and commercial cleaning jobs.{{Citation needed|reason=This entire section lacks almost any references.|date=August 2017}}

===Upright===
Upright vacuum cleaners are popular in the United States, Britain and numerous Commonwealth countries, but unusual in some [[Continental Europe]]an countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} They take the form of a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or beater bar, which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).

The older of the two designs, direct-fan cleaners have a large impeller (fan) mounted close to the suction opening, through which the dirt passes directly, before being blown into a bag. The motor is often cooled by a separate cooling fan. Because of their large-bladed fans, and comparatively short airpaths, direct-fan cleaners create a very efficient airflow from a low amount of power, and make effective carpet cleaners. Their "above-floor" cleaning power is less efficient, since the airflow is lost when it passes through a long hose, and the fan has been optimized for airflow volume and not suction.

Fan-bypass uprights have their motor mounted after the filter bag. Dust is removed from the airstream by the bag, and usually a filter, before it passes through the fan. The fans are smaller, and are usually a combination of several moving and stationary turbines working in sequence to boost power. The motor is cooled by the airstream passing through it. Fan-bypass vacuums are good for both carpet and above-floor cleaning, since their suction does not significantly diminish over the distance of a hose, as it does in direct-fan cleaners. However, their air-paths are much less efficient, and can require more than twice as much power as direct-fan cleaners to achieve the same results.

The most common upright vacuum cleaners use a drive-belt powered by the suction motor to rotate the brush-roll. However, a more common design of dual motor upright is available. In these cleaners, the suction is provided via a large motor, while the brushroll is powered by a separate, smaller motor, which does not create any suction. The brush-roll motor can sometimes be switched off, so hard floors can be cleaned without the brush-roll scattering the dirt. It may also have an automatic cut-off feature which shuts the motor off if the brush-roll becomes jammed, protecting it from damage.

===Canister===
Canister models (in the UK also often called cylinder models) dominate the European market. They have the motor and dust collector (using a bag or bagless) in a separate unit, usually mounted on wheels, which is connected to the vacuum head by a flexible hose. Their main advantage is flexibility, as the user can attach different heads for different tasks, and maneuverability (the head can reach under furniture and makes it very easy to vacuum stairs and vertical surfaces). Many cylinder models have power heads as standard or add-on equipment containing the same sort of mechanical beaters as in upright units, making them as efficient on carpets as upright models. Such beaters are driven by a separate electric motor or a turbine which uses the [[suction power]] to spin the brushroll via a drive belt.

===Drum===
[[File:Craftsman 16 Gallon Wet-Dry Vac.jpg|upright|thumb|Wet/dry vacuum for home use]]
Drum or shop vac models are essentially heavy-duty industrial versions of cylinder vacuum cleaners, where the canister consists of a large vertically positioned drum which can be stationary or on wheels. Smaller versions, for use in garages or small workshops, are usually electrically powered. Larger models, which can store over {{convert|200|L}}, are often hooked up to compressed air, utilizing the [[Venturi effect]] to produce a partial vacuum. Built-in [[dust collection system]]s are also used in many workshops.

===Wet/dry===
{{redirect|Shop Vac|the Jonathan Coulton song|Thing a Week}}
Wet or wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of the cylinder/drum models that can be used to clean up wet or liquid spills. They are generally designed to be used both indoors and outdoors and to accommodate both wet and dry debris; some are also equipped with an exhaust port or detachable blower for reversing the airflow, a useful function for everything from clearing a clogged hose to blowing dust into a corner for easy collection.

===Pneumatic===
Pneumatic or pneumatic wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of wet/dry models that hook up to compressed air. They commonly can accommodate both wet and dry soilage, a useful feature in industrial plants and manufacturing facilities.

===Backpack===
Backpack vacuum cleaners are commonly used for commercial cleaning: they allow the user to move rapidly about a large area. They are essentially small canister vacuums strapped onto the user's back.

===Hand-held===
[[File:USBVacuumCleaner.jpg|thumb|USB-powered hand-held vacuum cleaner (promotional giveaway).]]
Lightweight hand-held vacuum cleaners, either powered from [[rechargeable batteries]] or mains power, are also popular for cleaning up smaller spills. Frequently seen examples include the [[Black &amp; Decker DustBuster]], which was introduced in 1979, and numerous handheld models by [[Dirt Devil]], which were first introduced in 1984. Some battery-powered handheld vacuums are wet/dry rated; the appliance must be partially disassembled and cleaned after picking up wet materials, to avoid developing unpleasant odors.

===Robotic===
[[File:Robot vacuum cleaner.jpg|thumb|Robotic vacuum cleaner]]
[[File:Electrolux trilobite.jpg|thumb|The [[Electrolux Trilobite]] was the first mass-produced [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gantz|first1=Carroll|title=The Vacuum Cleaner: A History|date=Sep 21, 2012|publisher=McFarland|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Vacuum_Cleaner.html?id=NaVGk3HBUdkC|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}]]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several companies developed [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]s, a form of [[carpet sweeper]] usually equipped with limited suction power. Some prominent brands are [[Roomba]], [[Neato Robotics|Neato]], and [[bObsweep]]. These machines move [[autonomous robot|autonomously]] while collecting surface dust and debris into a [[dustbin]]. They can usually navigate around furniture and come back to a docking station to charge their batteries, and a few are able to empty their dust containers into the dock as well. Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a vacuum motor to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.

In December 2009, Neato Robotics launched the world's first robotic vacuum cleaner which uses a rotating laser-based range-finder (a form of [[lidar]]) to scan and map its surrounding. It uses this map to clean the floor methodically, even if it requires the robot to return to its base multiple times to recharge itself. In many cases it will notice when an area of the floor that was previously inaccessible becomes reachable, such as when a dog wakes up from a nap, and return to vacuum that area. It also has the strongest impeller among robotic vacuum cleaners, pulling in 35 CFM (1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min) of air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605141056/http://www.delta-america.com/Products/FanUploads/Specification/BCB1012UH-F00%28REV01%29.pdf DC Blower Specifications]. Delta Electronics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclonic===
Portable vacuum cleaners working on the [[cyclonic separation]] principle became popular in the 1990s. This dirt separation principle was well known and often used in [[central vacuum]] systems. Cleveland's P.A. Geier Company had obtained a patent on a cyclonic vacuum cleaner as early as 1928, which was later sold to Health-Mor in 1939, introducing the Filter Queen cyclonic canister vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/HMI-Industries-Inc-Company-History.html History of HMI Industries, Inc. – FundingUniverse]. Fundinguniverse.com. Retrieved 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[James Dyson]] introduced a portable unit with cyclonic separation, adapting this design from industrial saw mills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111002084315/http://www.dyson.co.uk/insidedyson/article.asp?aID=newidea A new idea]. dyson.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He launched his cyclone cleaner first in Japan in the 1980s at a cost of about US$1800 and in 1993 released the Dyson [[DC01]] upright in the UK for £200. Critics expected that people would not buy a vacuum cleaner at twice the price of a conventional unit, but the Dyson design later became the most popular cleaner in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0752809814/ Against the Odds: An Autobiography: Amazon.co.uk: James Dyson: Books]. Amazon.com. Retrieved 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=te Duits, Thimo |title=The Origin of Things: Sketches, Models, Prototypes |year=2003 |publisher=NAi Publishers |location=Rotterdam |isbn=9056623184|pages=202–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags. Instead, the dust is separated in a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]]. The dust particles and other debris move to the outside of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to gravity.

In fixed-installation [[#Central|central vacuum cleaners]], the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration. A well-designed cyclonic filtration system loses suction power due to airflow restriction only when the collection vessel is almost full. This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which lose suction when pores in the filter become clogged as dirt and dust are collected.

In portable cyclonic models, the cleaned air from the center of the vortex is expelled from the machine after passing through a number of successively finer filters at the top of the container. The first filter is intended to trap particles which could damage the subsequent filters that remove fine dust particles. The filters must regularly be cleaned or replaced to ensure that the machine continues to perform efficiently.

Since Dyson's success in raising public awareness of cyclonic separation, several other companies have introduced cyclone models. Competing manufacturers include Hoover, Bissell, Shark, Eureka, Electrolux, Filter Queen, etc., and the cheapest models are no more expensive than a conventional cleaner.

===Central===
{{main|Central vacuum cleaner}}
[[File:Central vacuum system.jpg|thumb|upright|The power unit of a typical [[central vacuum cleaner]] for residential use]]
Central vacuum cleaners, also known as built-in or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and cleaning head need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8&amp;nbsp;m (25&amp;nbsp;ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. Plastic or metal piping connects the inlets to the central unit. The vacuum head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven [[turbine]].

The dirt bag or collection bin in a central vacuum system is usually so large that emptying or changing needs to be done less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal hose connector makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.

A central vacuum typically produces greater suction than common portable vacuum cleaners because a larger fan and more powerful motor can be used when they are not required to be portable. A [[Cyclonic separator|cyclonic separation system]], if used, does not lose suction as the collection container fills up, until the container is nearly full. This is in marked contrast to filter-bag designs, which start losing suction immediately as pores in the filter become clogged by accumulated dirt and dust.

A benefit to allergy sufferers is that unlike a standard vacuum cleaner, which must blow some of the dirt collected back into the room being cleaned (no matter how efficient its filtration), a central vacuum removes all the dirt collected to the central unit. Since this central unit is usually located outside the living area, no dust is recirculated back into the room being cleaned. Also it is possible on most newer models to vent the exhaust entirely outside, even with the unit inside the living quarters.

Another benefit of the central vacuum is, because of the remote location of the motor unit, there is much less noise in the room being cleaned than with a standard vacuum cleaner.

====Constellation====
[[File:Hoover 1960 Vacuum cleaner img 1403.jpg|thumb|Hoover Constellation of 1960]]
[[The Hoover Company]] marketed an unusual vacuum cleaner, called the ''Constellation'', in the 1960s. The cylinder type lacked wheels, and instead the vacuum cleaner floated on its exhaust, operating as a [[hovercraft]], although this is not true of the earliest models. They had a rotating hose with the intention being that the user would place the unit in the center of the room, and work around the cleaner. Introduced in 1954, they are collectible, and are easily identified by their spherical shape. But they remain an interesting machine; restored, they work well in homes with lots of hardwood floors.

The Constellations were changed and updated over the years until discontinued in 1975. These Constellations route all of the exhaust under the vacuum using a different airfoil. The updated design is quiet even by modern standards, particularly on carpet as it muffles the sound. These models float on carpet or bare floor—although on hard flooring, the exhaust air tends to scatter any fluff or debris around.

Hoover re-released an updated version of this later model Constellation in the US (model # S3341 in Pearl White and # S3345 in stainless steel). Changes include a [[HEPA]] filtration bag, a 12-amp motor, a turbine-powered brush roll, and a redesigned version of the handle. This same model was marketed in the UK under the Maytag brand as the ''Satellite'' because of licensing restrictions. It was sold from 2006 to 2009.

===Vehicles===
See [[vacuum truck]] for very big vacuum cleaners mounted on vehicles.

===Other===
Some other vacuum cleaners include an electric [[mop]] in the same machine: for a dry and a later wet clean.

The [[iRobot]] company developed the [[Scooba (brand)|Scooba]], a robotic wet vacuum cleaner that carries its own cleaning solution, applies it and scrubs the floor, and vacuums the dirty water into a collection tank.

==Technology==
A vacuum's suction is caused by a difference in air pressure. A fan driven by an electric motor (often a [[universal motor]]) reduces the pressure inside the machine. Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the carpet and into the nozzle, and so the dust is literally pushed into the bag.

Tests have shown that vacuuming can kill 100% of young [[flea]]s and 96% of adult fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071217111010.htm |title=Cat Fleas' Journey Into The Vacuum Is A 'One-way Trip' |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaust filtration===
[[File:Vacuum cleaner bag.jpg|thumb|upright|A full dustbag. The frame around the opening fastens to the interior end of the cleaner's hose inlet.]]
Vacuums by their nature cause dust to become airborne, by exhausting air that is not completely filtered. This can cause health problems since the operator ends up inhaling [[Particulates#Health effects|respirable dust]], which is also redeposited into the area being cleaned. There are several methods manufacturers use to control this problem, some of which may be combined together in a single appliance. Typically a filter is positioned so that the incoming air passes through it before it reaches the motor, and then the filtered air passes through the motor for cooling purposes. Some other designs use a completely separate air intake for cooling.

It is nearly impossible for a practical air filter to completely remove all ultrafine particles from a dirt-laden airstream. An ultra-efficient air filter will immediately clog up and become ineffective during everyday use, and practical filters are a compromise between filtering effectiveness and [[air resistance|restriction of airflow]]. One way to sidestep this problem is to exhaust partially filtered air to the outdoors, which is a design feature of some [[central vacuum system]]s. Specially engineered portable vacuums may also utilize this design, but are more awkward to set up and use, requiring temporary installation of a separate exhaust hose to an exterior window.

* Bag: The most common method to capture the debris vacuumed up involves a paper or fabric bag that allows air to pass through, but attempts to trap most of the dust and debris. The bag may be disposable, or designed to be cleaned and re-used.
* Bagless: In non-cyclonic bagless models, the role of the bag is taken by a removable container and a reusable filter, equivalent to a reusable fabric bag.
* [[Cyclonic separation]]: A vacuum cleaner employing this method is also bagless. It causes intake air to be cycled or spun so fast that most of the dust is forced out of the air and falls into a collection bin. The operation is similar to that of a [[centrifuge]].
* Water filtration: First seen commercially in the 1920s in the form of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the [[Rexair]] Rainbow), a water filtration vacuum cleaner uses a water bath as a filter. It forces the dirt-laden intake air to pass through water before it is exhausted, so that wet dust cannot become airborne. The water trap filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone [[air purifier]] and [[humidifier]] unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of [[bacteria]] and [[mold]], causing unpleasant odors.
* [[Air filter|Ultra fine air filter]]: Also called [[HEPA#Vacuum cleaners|HEPA]] filtered, this method is used as a secondary filter after the air has passed through the rest of the machine. It is meant to remove any remaining dust that could harm the operator. Some vacuum cleaners also use an [[activated charcoal]] filter to remove odors.

Ordinary vacuum cleaners should never be used to clean up [[asbestos]] fibers, even if fitted with a HEPA filter. Specially-designed machines are required to safely clean up asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/em4.pdf |title=Asbestos essentials em4 Using a Class H vacuum cleaner for asbestos |format=PDF|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachments===
Most vacuum cleaners are supplied with numerous specialized attachments, such as tools, brushes and extension wands, which allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible places or to be used for cleaning a variety of surfaces. The most common of these tools are:

* Hard floor brush (for non-upright designs)
* Powered floor nozzle (for canister designs)
* Dusting brush
* Crevice tool
* Upholstery nozzle

===Specifications===
The performance of a vacuum cleaner can be measured by several parameters:

* Airflow, in [[litre]]s per [[second]] [l/s] or [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] per minute (CFM or ft³/min)
* Air speed, in metres per second [m/s] or miles per hour [mph]
* Suction, vacuum, or water lift, in [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] [Pa] or inches of water

Other specifications of a vacuum cleaner are:
* Weight, in kilograms [kg] or pounds [lb]
* Noise, in [[decibel]]s &amp;#91;[[Decibel#Acoustics 2|dB]]&amp;#93;&lt;!-- misnomer dBA !? --&gt;
* Power cord length and hose length (as applicable)

==== Suction ====
The suction is the maximum pressure difference that the pump can create. For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa. The higher the suction rating, the more powerful the cleaner. One inch of water is equivalent to about 249 Pa; hence, the typical suction is {{convert|80|in|mm}} of water.

====Input power====
The power consumption of a vacuum cleaner, in [[watt]]s, is often the only figure stated. Many North American vacuum manufacturers give the current only in [[ampere]]s (e.g. "6 amps"), and the consumer is left to [[Volt-ampere|multiply that by the line voltage of 120 volts]] to get the approximate power ratings in watts. The rated input power does not indicate the effectiveness of the cleaner, only how much electricity it consumes.

After 1 September 2014, due to EU rules, manufacture of vacuum cleaners with a power consumption greater than 1600 watts will be banned, and from 2017 no vacuum cleaner with a wattage greater than 900 watts will be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-2737625/Vacuum-sales-44-EU-ban-sees-scramble-powerful-models.html|title=A run on powerful vacuum cleaners? Sales rocket 44% as households scramble to buy best models before EU ban|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=29 August 2014|first=Rachel|last=Rickard Straus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Output power====
{{Main|Airwatt}}

The amount of input power that is converted into airflow at the end of the cleaning hose is sometimes stated, and is measured in ''airwatts'': the measurement units are simply watts. The word "air" is used to clarify that this is output power, not input electrical power.

The airwatt is derived from [[English unit]]s. [[ASTM International]] defines the airwatt as 0.117354 × F × S, where F is the rate of air flow in ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min and S is the [[pressure]] in [[inches of water]]. This makes one airwatt equal to 0.9983 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictA.html|title= Units: A|accessdate=27 March 2008 |author= Rowlett, Russ |date= 21 March 2001|work= How Many?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4527">{{tone|date=November 2017}}The '''Wadley loop''' circuit was designed by Dr. [[Trevor Wadley]] in the 1940s in [[South Africa]] and was first used for a stable Wavemeter.

== Overview ==

In a traditional [[superheterodyne]] [[radio receiver]], most [[oscillator]] drift and instability occurs in the first [[frequency converter]] stage, because it is tunable and operating at a high frequency.  In theory, if one can eliminate this drift, the receiver will be stable.

Unlike other drift-reducing techniques (such as [[crystal]] control or [[frequency synthesis]]), the Wadley Loop does not attempt to stabilize the oscillator.  Instead, it cancels the drift mathematically.

== Principles of operation ==
The Wadley loop works by:

# combining the first oscillator with the received signal in a [[frequency mixer]] to translate it to an [[intermediate frequency]] that is above the receiver's tuning range,
# mixing the same oscillator with a comb of [[harmonics]] from a [[crystal oscillator]],
# selecting one of the results of (2) with a [[band-pass filter]], and
# mixing this with the IF signal from (1).

Since the high-IF of part 1 drifts in the same direction, and the same amount, as the "synthetic oscillator" of part 3, when they are mixed in part 4 the drift terms cancel out and the result is a crystal-stable signal at a second intermediate frequency.

But the drift makes it impossible to use high-IF [[electronic selectivity|selectivity]] to reject undesired signals.  Instead, the high IF is designed with a bandpass characteristic.  Also, since the first oscillator is cancelled out, it cannot be used to tune a particular signal.  Instead, it selects an entire [[band (radio)|band]] of signals - which one depends on which harmonic was chosen in part 3 above.  The size of the band is equal to the spacing of the crystal harmonics.  A conventionally tuned "back end" selects the desired signal from the band of signals presented at the second IF.

== Example ==
Let say we want to pick up signals from 0 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.  This is divided into 30 1&amp;nbsp;MHz bands, which are then translated to a band at 44-45&amp;nbsp;MHz.  To convert 0-1&amp;nbsp;MHz, the first oscillator must be 45&amp;nbsp;MHz, to convert 1-2&amp;nbsp;MHz it must be 46&amp;nbsp;MHz, and so on.  Meanwhile, the first oscillator is also mixed with harmonics from a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz crystal and put the result through a 42&amp;nbsp;MHz filter.  Only one harmonic gets through.  When the first oscillator is 45&amp;nbsp;MHz, it is the third harmonic, because 45 - 3 = 42.  At 46&amp;nbsp;MHz, it is the fourth harmonic, and so on.  The oscillator does not have to be exactly 45, 46, and so on, only close enough to get through the 42&amp;nbsp;MHz bandpass filter.  Let's say it is 45.1 .  Then we get 42.1 from the filter, and 45.1 - 42.1 is still 3.  When the high IF is mixed with the 42&amp;nbsp;MHz, the result is a band of signals from 3&amp;nbsp;MHz to 2&amp;nbsp;MHz, from which the desired signal is selected, perhaps with a conventional superheterodyne back-end converting 3-2&amp;nbsp;MHz to 455&amp;nbsp;kHz and finally [[demodulation|demodulating]] the signal back to audio.  The overall receiver drift consists of the crystal's drift plus the 3&amp;nbsp;MHz back-end, so when we're listening to a 30&amp;nbsp;MHz signal, this receiver is about ten times as stable as one using a high-frequency tunable [[VFO]].

To a new user, the feel of the first oscillator tuning control is counterintuitive.  Although the knob moves in a continuous, analog fashion, its effect on receiver operation is [[Discrete frequency|discrete]], that is, the tuning advances in 1&amp;nbsp;MHz jumps.

An example is Yaesu's [[FRG-7]] communications receiver,&lt;ref&gt;[http://televideo.ws/wadley.html Wadley Drift Cancelling Loop]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the system to remove local oscillator drift. The Racal RA17 and [[Realistic DX-302]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DX-302 Owner's manual|url=https://swl.net.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dx302_owners_manual.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used the Wadley Loop in their design.

An optical implementation of a Wadley Loop has recently been proposed. This allows a compact relatively unstable laser to be used as a local oscillator, with the system stability being obtained from a master 'comb source' (usually a pulsed laser, such as a mode-locked laser), possibly common to many receivers within an exchange.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-15-19891&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Joseph Étienne Lenoir''' also known as '''Jean J. Lenoir''' (12 January 1822 – 4 August 1900&lt;ref name="Weeks1904"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Lyman Horace|title=Automobile Biographies: An Account of the Lives and the Work of Those who Have Been Identified with the Invention and Development of Self-propelled Vehicles on the Common Roads ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnpAAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=10 January 2018|year=1904|publisher=Monograph Press|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] engineer who developed the [[internal combustion engine]] in 1858. Prior designs for such engines were patented as early as 1807 ([[De Rivaz engine]]), but none were commercially successful. Lenoir's engine was commercialized in sufficient quantities to be considered a success, a first for the internal combustion engine.

He was born in Mussy-la-Ville (then in [[Luxembourg]], part of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Province of Luxembourg]] since 1839). In 1838, he emigrated to France, taking up residence in [[Paris]], where he developed an interest in [[electroplating]]. His interest in the subject led him to make several electrical inventions, including an improved [[electric telegraph]].&lt;ref name="Weeks1904"/&gt;

==Lenoir engine==
[[File:Lenoirmotor.jpg|thumb|left|Lenoir motor]]
[[File:Lenoir gas engine 1860.jpg|thumb|left|Lenoir gas engine 1860.jpg.]]
By 1859, Lenoir's experimentation with electricity led him to develop the first internal combustion engine which burned a mixture of [[coal gas]] and [[air]] ignited by a "jumping sparks" [[ignition system]] by [[Induction coil|Ruhmkorff coil]],{{r|Georgano, p.9}} and which he patented in 1860. The engine was a steam engine converted to burn gaseous fuel and thus pushed in both directions. The fuel mixture was not compressed before ignition (a system invented in 1801 by [[Philippe LeBon]] who developed the use of illuminating gas to light Paris), and the engine was quiet but inefficient,{{r|Wise, p.1181}} with [[double-acting cylinder|a power stroke at each end of the cylinder]].{{r|Wise, p.1182}} In 1863, the [[Hippomobile (car)|Hippomobile]], with a [[hydrogen gas]] fueled, one cylinder, internal combustion engine, made a test drive from [[Paris]] to [[Joinville-le-Pont]]: top speed about 9&amp;nbsp;km in ~3 hours.{{r|Hippo}}

Lenoir was an engineer at Petiene et Cie (Petiene &amp; Company), who supported him in his founding of the companies of ''Corporation Lenoir-Gautier et Cie engines Paris'' and ''Société des Moteurs Lenoir '' in Paris in 1859,&lt;ref name="Lenoir TMM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Joseph Étienne Lenoir|url=http://www.themotormuseuminminiature.co.uk/inv-jeanjoseph-etienne-lenoir.php|website=The Motor Museum in Miniature}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Wise, p.1181}} with a capitalization of two million [[French franc|''franc''s]] and a factory in the ''Rue de la Roquette'',{{r|Wise, p.1181}} to develop the engine, and a three-wheeled carriage constructed to use it. Although it ran reasonably well, the engine was fuel inefficient, extremely noisy, tended to overheat, and, if sufficient cooling water was not applied, seize up. Nevertheless, ''[[Scientific American]]'' reported, in September 1860, that the Parisian newspaper ''Cosmos'' had pronounced the steam age over.{{r|SciAmer}}&lt;ref name="Lenoir TMM" /&gt; By 1865, 143 had been sold in Paris alone, and production of Lenoir Gas Engines, by Reading Gas Works in [[London, England|London]], had begun.{{r|Georgano, p.9}}

Lenoir had completed work on his engine in 1859 and had a grand unveiling on January 23, 1860, for twenty guests. In his speech he said, "If it works, I will add carburetor heating, at a constant level, which will allow the use of petrol, or gasoline, or tar, or any resin". He turned on the  illuminating gas valve, pushed the flywheel, and the engine came to life. In 1860, Lenoir received a patent for "an air motor expanded by gas combustion" from [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers|Conservatoire National Des Arts Et Métiers]], no. N.43624 &lt;ref name="Lenoir TMM" /&gt;

==Lenoir's automobiles==
[[File:Lenoir Hippomobile.jpg|thumb|right|Lenoir's Hippomobile]]
Dates vary from 1860 to 1863 on when Lenoir built his automobiles. It is apparent that he built a small carriage with his engine around 1860. His automobile of 1862 was capable of 3 kilometers per hour.&lt;ref name="Lenoir TMM" /&gt;

In 1861, he put one of his engines in a boat.&lt;ref name="Lenoir TMM" /&gt;
In 1863, Lenoir demonstrated a second three-wheeled carriage, the '''Hippomobile''', little more than a wagon body set atop a tricycle platform.{{r|Wise, p.1181}} It was powered by a 2543 cc (155 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 180×100&amp;nbsp;mm, 7.1×3.9in){{r|Georgano, p.9}} 1.5&amp;nbsp;hp, "liquid hydrocarbon" ([[petroleum]]) engine with a primitive [[carburettor]] which was patented in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 345596| status = patent| title = Gas Engine| gdate = 1886-07-13 | fdate = 1886-01-06  | inventor = Etienne Jean Joseph Lenoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It successfully covered the 11&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;mi) from Paris to [[Joinville-le-Pont]] and back in about ninety minutes each way, an average speed less than that of a walking man (though doubtless there were breakdowns).{{r|Georgano, p.9}} This succeeded in attracting the attention of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], and one was sent to Russia, where it vanished; Lenoir was not pleased. In 1863, he sold his patents to [[:fr:Compagnie parisienne de gaz|Compagnie parisienne de gaz]] and turned to [[motorboat]]s, instead, building a naptha ([[Ligroin]]) fueled four-cycle in 1888.{{r|Wise, p.1181}}{{r|Georgano, p.9}}&lt;ref&gt;Ligroin&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jules Verne]] wrote in his 1863 novel [[Paris in the Twentieth Century]] of boulevards crowded with horseless carriages, "the Lenoir machine applied to locomotion."

==Stationary engines==
Most applications of the Lenoir engine were as a stationary power plant powering printing presses, water pumps, and machine tools. They "proved to be rough and noisy after prolonged use",{{r|Georgano, p.9}} however. Other engineers, especially [[Nikolaus Otto]], began making improvements on internal combustion technology, which soon rendered the Lenoir design obsolete. Less than 500 Lenoir engines of between 6 and 20&amp;nbsp;hp were built, including some under license in Germany.{{r|Wise, p.1181}}

==Electrical engineering==

In 1865, Lenoir returned to electrical engineering. He developed a new type of automatic telegraph device that could send information in written form. This device was of great value during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He also installed an improved version of his engine in a 12 meter long boat for a Mr. Dalloz who used it on the Seine for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/ref&gt;

==French citizenship==

Lenoir was granted French citizenship in 1870 for assistance during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and awarded the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' in 1881 (not for the engine, but for developments in [[telegraph]]y). Lenoir's later years were impoverished despite his engine's success.{{r|Wise, p.1182}}

==Honors==

On July 16, 1900, not long before his death, Lenoir received an award from the '''ACF''' ([[Automobile Club de France]]), which was a vermeil plate with the inscription, ''"In recognition of his great merits as an inventor of the gas engine and builder of the first car in the world."''

Lenoir died in La Varenne-Sainte-Hilaire on 4 August 1900.{{r|Wise, p.1182}}
