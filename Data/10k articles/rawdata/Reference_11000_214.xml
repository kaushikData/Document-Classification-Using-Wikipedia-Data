{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library''}}
'''''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library''''' (cited as '''Bod-inc.'''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Coates, et al., ''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[short-title catalogue]] of more than 5,600 [[Incunable|incunabula]] held in the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Bod-inc. stands out among incunabula catalogues for its detailed listing of the contents of each edition being described. It was published on 7 July 2005 by [[Oxford University Press]] in six [[Volume (bibliography)|volumes]].

==History==
L. A. Sheppard began work on a catalogue of Bodleian incunabula in 1955 but he left Oxford in 1971 before the work could be completed; his slip catalogue was bound into seven volumes and served as a base of information for the Bod-inc. project.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Coates, et al., ''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxx–lxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, Kristian Jensen, as the Bodleian Library's specialist in early printed books, decided that a new catalogue was needed and that its descriptions should follow the standards of detail expected in catalogues of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Coates, et al., ''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the project, Jensen was assisted by Bettina Wagner and Alan Coates beginning in 1992. Work on Bod-inc. was undertaken over the thirteen-year period between January 1992 and January 2005 by a team of cataloguers. From 1992 to 1999, Jensen headed the cataloguing team; he was succeeded by Alan Coates who headed the project from 2000 to its completion, during which time Jensen served as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Coates, et al., ''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Bod-inc. was published in the 400th anniversary year of the publication of the first catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Bodleian Library, ''Catalogus librorum bibliothecae publicae quam vir ornatissimus Thomas Bodleius eques auratus in Academia Oxoniensi nuper instituit'' (Oxford: [[Joseph Barnes (printer)|J. Barnes]], 1605); [[English Short Title Catalogue]] [http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=find-b&amp;local_base=BLL06&amp;request=S107686&amp;find_code=ESTID record].&lt;/ref&gt; of the Bodleian Library in 1605.

==Aims of the catalogue==
The aims of Bod-inc. are summarized in the catalogue's introduction:

{{quote|text=The main aim of the catalogue has been, from the outset, to combine information about the individual copies in the collections of the Bodleian Library (their [[Bookbinding|bindings]], their [[Provenance#Books|provenance]], manuscript notes, and other signs of use) with a detailed analysis of the contents of each edition, locating all texts in each edition, identifying their [[author]]s, and giving references to modern editions of each text where they exist. It is not the aim of the catalogue to replicate [[Typography|typographical]] information which is already available in one of the other detailed incunable catalogues, such as ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke|GW]]'', ''BMC'', or Polain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Coates, et al., ''A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''A Taste of Greece: Recipes, Cuisine &amp; Culture''''' is an illustrated cookbook coordinated by [[Princess Tatiana of Greece and Denmark|Princess Tatiana]] of Greece and edited by the food writer Diana Farr Louis. It is a non-profit publication whose sales benefit the Greek charity [[Boroume]] ("we can!"), supporting food supplies both to refugees in Greece and to Greeks suffering poverty due to the country's economic crisis. The idea of publishing a book of this kind originated with the founder of Boroume, [[Xenia Papastavrou]], according to Maria Karamitsos.&lt;ref&gt;Maria A. Karamitsos, "[http://windycitygreek.com/a-taste-of-greece-supports-boroume/ A Taste of Greece: Cookbook Benefits Boroume]" at ''Windy City Greek'' (13 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daisy Dunn]], reviewing ''A Taste of Greece'' in ''[[The Spectator]]'', commented that "Greece’s food crisis has wrought such feelings of exclusion and isolation as can only exist in a culture that has always placed food at the centre of civilisation. Over 17 per cent of the population of Greece is said to be suffering from food insecurity."&lt;ref&gt;Daisy Dunn, "[https://life.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/can-an-ancient-hellenic-concept-solve-greeces-food-crisis/ Can an ancient Hellenic concept solve Greece’s food crisis?]" in ''[[The Spectator]]'' (4 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of favourite Greek recipes contributed by 41 celebrities, chefs and food writers, all of them connected with Greece in different ways. Contributors are arranged alphabetically, but the list includes celebrities such as [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Jim Gianopulos]] of [[20th Century Fox]], writers [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Victoria Hislop]] and [[Sofka Zinovieff]], conductor [[Zubin Mehta]], broadcasters [[Bob Costas]] and [[Nikos Aliagas]], photographer [[Robert McCabe]], actresses [[Rita Wilson]] and [[Olympia Dukakis]]; design and food entrepreneurs such as [[Carole Bamford]], [[Dan Caten|Dan]] and [[Dean Caten]], [[Tatiana Casiraghi]]; chefs [[Michel Roux]], [[Nobu Matsuhisa]], [[Cat Cora]] and Nikos Ntanos who worked on recipes for several other contributors; food writers Diana Farr Louis (who edited the book), Diane Kochilas, Laurie Constantino, Rachel and [[Andrew Dalby]], Peter Minaki. Among the contributors are several members of the ousted [[Greek Royal Family|Greek royal family]] now once again living in Greece: [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Queen Anne-Marie]], her sister-in-law [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], her son [[Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark|Prince Nikolaos]] and his wife [[Princess Tatiana of Greece and Denmark|Princess Tatiana]] who coordinated the project. When she was still Tatiana Blatnik she had worked for [[Diane von Furstenberg]], who is a contributor to the book alongside other contacts from the fashion world, [[Mary Katrantzou]], Valentino and [[Giancarlo Giammetti]], as noted by Sharon Edelson writing in ''[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Edelson, "[http://wwd.com/eye/people/a-princess-publishes-cookbook-for-love-of-country-10446118/ A Princess Publishes a Cookbook for Love of Country]" in ''[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]]'' (7 June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Taste of Greece'' was published internationally in July 2016 by TeNeues Media, based in Germany, with branches in the United States, United Kingdom and France.

'''Allegiance bias''' (or '''allegiance effect''') in [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral sciences]], denote to the finding or conclusions being crafted in a manner that reconciles best with the investigator's or researcher's perspectives and preferences, instead of retaining its [[Empirical evidence|empirical]], innate or native state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=G.

== Evaluation ==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staines|first=Graham L.|last2=Cleland|first2=Charles M.|title=Bias in meta-analytic estimates of the absolute efficacy of psychotherapy.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.4.329|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=329–347|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.4.329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that researchers find the outcomes of psychological evaluations to be influenced from allegiance from a specific school of thought, the role of allegiance in the research field should be evaluated cautiously. Several meta-analyses have shown contradictory results between experimenter’s allegiance (EA) and assessment effect sizes in favor of the preferred conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dragioti|first=Elena|last2=Dimoliatis|first2=Ioannis|last3=Fountoulakis|first3=Konstantinos N.|last4=Evangelou|first4=Evangelos|date=2015-09-15|year=|title=A systematic appraisal of allegiance effect in randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy|journal=Annals of General Psychiatry|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1186/s12991-015-0063-1|issn=1744-859X|pmc=4570291|pmid=26379758|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falkenström|first=Fredrik|last2=Markowitz|first2=John C.|last3=Jonker|first3=Hanske|last4=Philips|first4=Björn|last5=Holmqvist|first5=Rolf|date=2013-05-01|year=|title=Can psychotherapists function as their own controls?

Also, we should not include meta-analysis that examines a combination of psychotherapy and non-psychotherapy treatments (e.g., [[medication]]) if it was directly compared with another type of psychotherapy or meta-analysis evaluating direct comparisons between different types of psychotherapy.

Most often [[Forensic psychologist|forensic experts]] indulge in having formed a [[bias]]ed opinion of the assessment in favor of the party retaining their services as opposed to having it objective by means of the evidence available.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-41/publications/newsletters/news/2014/10/expert-opinion.aspx|title=Identifying and managing potential bias in forensic evaluations|last=|first=|date=|website=APA Div. 41: American Psychology-Law Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal cases, evaluator attitudes and other attributes may systematically influence from whom evaluators are willing to accept a referral.

=== Disclosures ===

==== Reporting policies ====
Systematic reviews and meta-analysis are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moher|first=David|last2=Tetzlaff|first2=Jennifer|last3=Tricco|first3=Andrea C.|last4=Sampson|first4=Margaret|last5=Altman|first5=Douglas G.|date=2007-03-27|year=|title=Epidemiology and reporting characteristics of systematic reviews|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=4|issue=3|pages=e78|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040078|issn=1549-1676|pmc=1831728|pmid=17388659|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== QUOROM =====
{{Main|QUOROM flow chart}}
Since the development of the [[QUOROM flow chart|QUOROM]] (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moher|first=D.|last2=Cook|first2=D.

===== PRISMA =====
{{Main|PRISMA}}
Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed [[PRISMA]] (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analysis of evaluations of health care interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wen|first=Jin|last2=Ren|first2=Yu|last3=Wang|first3=Li|last4=Li|first4=Youping|last5=Liu|first5=Ya|last6=Zhou|first6=Min|last7=Liu|first7=Ping|last8=Ye|first8=Lu|last9=Li|first9=Yi|date=2008-08-01|title=The reporting quality of meta-analyses improves: a random sampling study|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=61|issue=8|pages=770–775|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.10.008|issn=0895-4356|pmid=18411041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(07)00376-9/abstract|title=The reporting quality of meta-analyses improves: a random sampling study|last=|first=|date=|website=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sdining roomWinter Pal.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Location of the Arabian Room within the Winter Palace]]

The '''Arabian Hall''', sometimes known as the Blackamoor Hall or the Arabian Dining Room, is one of the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private rooms of the Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. In the [[Tsar]]ist era, it was the room from which imperial processions through the [[state room]]s began. The double doors&lt;ref&gt;The doors in the wall on the right in the watercolor, largely hidden by the flanking columns, opened into the enfilade.&lt;/ref&gt; were designed to be on a straight axis through the principal state rooms and ultimately the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]], forming an [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]. Thus it was here the [[House of Romanov|Romanov family]] often assembled, in private, before state receptions and occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas.&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy of the room was not compromised by the small private courtyard (''see plan'') from which windows, which once led to the [[:Image:Hau WinterGarden.jpg|Tsaritsa's winter-garden below]], admitted light.

Designed by [[Alexander Briullov]] following the Winter Palace fire of 1837, the room is decorated in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style fashionable in the early 19th century, known as [[Pompei]]an. A ceiling, with a low segmental [[barrel vault]] with bands of shallow [[coffer]]ing [[stucco]]ed with classical motifs, is seemingly supported by a [[colonnade]] of engaged fluted [[Doric order|Greek Doric]] columns with enriched [[Ovolo|echinus]] molding and no bases.&lt;ref&gt;The State Hermitage Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Meander (art)|Greek key]] fret enriches the [[entablature]] that runs without a break round the room. The only furnishings were the dining chairs of Greek [[klismos]] type, formally ranged round the walls. When the Imperial family were to dine here, dining tables would be brought in, covered and laid, then removed afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dining table]]s on massive central pedestals, left in place in the dining room, were an English innovation of the second quarter of the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various geographically confused names of the Arabian Hall derive, not from any peculiar contents, but from the four official pseudo-bodyguards of the Tsar who travelled from palace to palace with the Imperial family. They were four "massive Negroes" fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever the Tsar was, they guarded the doors between the private and official world. They had no other function other than to open and close doors; their sudden, but silent appearance into a room was the signal that heralded the immediate appearance of the Tsar or [[Tsaritsa]].

Although the guards were referred to as the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] or [[wiktionary:Blackamoor|Blackamoor]]s, from 1896, at least one was an American.  Jim Hercules holidayed in the USA and always returned with jars of [[Guava|guava jelly]] for the Imperial children.&lt;ref&gt;All information concerning the "Ethiopians" is from Massie, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the empty hall is occasionally used for special exhibitions held by the [[State Hermitage Museum]].

The '''Austin History Center''' is the local history collection of the [[Austin Public Library]] and the city's historical archive.

The building opened as the official Austin Public Library in 1933 and served as the main library until 1979,&lt;ref name=marker/&gt; when library functions moved to the [[John Henry Faulk]] Library, a newer facility next door. Its site, which overlooks one of four public squares platted in Austin in 1839, was obtained from the [[Texas Legislature]] in 1913 for construction of a public library. The [[Renaissance Revival]] structure, completed in 1933, was designed by local architect [[J. Roy White]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=J.

The building also contains work by several Austin craftsmen, including ironworker Fortunat Wiegl, wood-carver Peter Mansbendel, and [[fresco]] artist Harold "Bubi" Jessen.&lt;ref name=marker&gt;{{Cite web|title=Details for 1933 Austin Public Library (Atlas Number 5453006425)|website=[[Texas Historical Commission]]|url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/Details/5453006425|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austin History Center celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2005. As of 2008 it houses thousands of documents, photographs, maps, artifacts, and personal histories. It features special exhibits and speakers on a regular basis.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|section|date=August 2017}}
In his new headquarters behind the famous [[Hollywood]] sign, [[Dr. Evil]] plans to travel back in time to 1975 and bring back [[Johan van der Smut]], aka "Goldmember", who developed a [[cold fusion]] unit for a [[tractor beam]] which Dr. Evil names "[[Preparation H]]". He intends to use the tractor beam to pull a meteor into the Earth, striking the polar ice caps and causing a global flood. Moments after this plan is revealed, [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] and the British Secret Service attack the base and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted for his services, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. [[Basil Exposition]] later informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped, and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold.

Austin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil, who tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's [[roller disco]] club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is undercover as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence [[mole (espionage)|mole]] named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo. Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]], who is now a [[sumo wrestling|sumo wrestler]], but still does work for Dr. Evil. Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, [[Nobu Matsuhisa|Mr. Roboto]], is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember.

Austin and Foxxy later meet with Mr. Roboto, who pleads ignorance about Nigel's whereabouts. Unconvinced, Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto hands Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes with the command unit and flees to Dr. Evil's submarine. Unable to settle their differences, Nigel and Austin part ways when they disagree on how to deal with the situation. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's son, [[Scott Evil]], has become increasingly evil in an attempt to prove himself to his father, to the point that he too is going bald. Scott presents his father with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled in [[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery|the first film]]. Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son; the rejected Mini-Me defects and joins Austin.

Austin, Foxxy and Mini-Me (now a miniature version of Austin) infiltrate the submarine, but Austin is captured. Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy has stolen the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are both his sons, telling them that when they were babies, he and their mother took them to Belgium for a family holiday and he stepped out of the car to have a tinkle in the bushes when their car exploded. Dr. Evil tells him that his parents died in that car accident, but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought at first that only Austin survived and didn't know that Dr. Evil survived too until after the two Belgians made him evil. Dr. Evil and Austin embrace, enraging Scott, who flees to pursue his own vengeance, whilst Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his pants to reveal his gold-covered genitals to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. The heroes arrest Goldmember, who turns to the camera to reveal the entire string of events was [[story within a story|adapted into a film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Austin, [[Kevin Spacey]] as Dr. Evil, [[Danny DeVito]] as Mini-Me, and [[John Travolta]] as Goldmember. Austin, Foxxy, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Nigel are in the audience of a Hollywood theater watching the film. Upon exiting the theater they run into Fat Bastard, now thinner but flabby, thanks to the [[Subway diet]]. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott – now completely bald, dressed like and laughing in a manner similar to his father – declares he will get his revenge on Austin and begins dancing like [[Michael Jackson]].

==Production==
===Title concerns===
The title of the film, ''Goldmember'', led to legal action being taken by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the distributors of the [[James Bond (franchise)|''James Bond'' film franchise]], that briefly led to the film's title being removed from promotional material and trailers. The dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming James Bond film, ''[[Die Another Day]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-04-10-bond-powers.htm|title=Spy vs. spy ends amicably|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-04-07 | date=2002-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
[[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] (Myers), having conquered the '90s and the '60s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis [[Dr. Evil]] (also played by Myers) to thwart a new villain, Goldmember (Myers once again). Myers also plays [[Fat Bastard (Austin Powers Character)|Fat Bastard]] for the second time, this time [[parody]]ing the kind of [[Wire fu|"wire fight"]] seen in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''. The film also stars Beyoncé Knowles as [[Foxxy Cleopatra]] (parodying [[blaxploitation]] heroines, primarily [[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]] and [[Cleopatra Jones]], as well as [[Get Christie Love!|Christie Love]] when she says, "You're under arrest, sugah!"), [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], reprising the role of Basil Exposition, and [[Verne Troyer]] in his second appearance as [[Mini-Me]]. The film also introduced a new character named Number 3 (a.k.a. the Mole), who is portrayed by former [[child actor|child star]] [[Fred Savage]]. [[Clint Howard]] plays a radar operator in all three films. [[Michael Caine]] guest stars as Austin's father, Nigel; this role was inspired by ''[[The Ipcress File]]'', a 1965 film starring Caine.&lt;ref name="ipc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/01/05/the_ipcress_file_2006_review.shtml | title=The Ipcress File (1965) | publisher=BBC | date=January 6, 2006 | accessdate=June 17, 2013 | author=Leyland, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in ''Goldmember''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[Rob Lowe]], who played the friend of a dead guard in ''International Man of Mystery'', reprises his role as a younger Number 2 from ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'', while [[Neil Mullarkey]] (quartermaster clerk in ''International Man of Mystery'') and Eric Winzenried (army private soldier in ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'') appear as the Physician and Henchman Sailor in the Sick Bay. [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] (the Virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in "International Man of Mystery" and a NATO soldier in "The Spy Who Shagged Me") appears as the royal guard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Goldmember====
'''[[Johan van der Smut]]''', better known as '''Goldmember''', is a fictional villain played by Myers ([[John Travolta]] plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). The name was inspired by the [[James Bond]] villain [[Auric Goldfinger]]. Goldmember's Dutch origins and character traits were, according to Myers, inspired by an episode of the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Real Sex]]'' featuring a Dutchman who operated a "sex barn" north of [[Rotterdam]]. The man's distinct forms of expression caught Myers' attention while he was writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2002-07-25-goldmember_x.htm |work=USA Today|title=Movie news|date=2002-07-25 | first1=Andy | last1=Seiler | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sequel==
In October 2005, in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. "There is hope!". "We're all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1114708,00.html |title=Mike Myers may return to '&amp;#39;Austin Powers'&amp;#39; |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, in an interview with [[IGN]], "So no more ''Austin Powers''?" was asked, and Myers replied, "No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and I can just say that it's from Dr. Evil's point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it's more about Dr. Evil than Austin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/788/788829p2.html |title=IGN: Interview: Mike Myers and Antonio Banderas |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of ''Goldmember'', Myers revealed that in the fourth film, [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]] would return and regain the weight that he lost in ''Goldmember''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/news/austin-powers-needs-kill-fat-bastard-wbna44147655|title='Austin Powers' needs to kill off Fat Bastard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, at the ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' première, Mike Myers announced that a fourth ''Austin Powers'' film was planned, but that it would focus more on [[Dr. Evil]] rather than [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin]]. He also said that he'd start work on it after he started work on ''[[The Love Guru]]'', which became a [[box office bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Myers Revives Dr. Evil, Plus Kirsten Dunst, 'High School Musical' &amp; More, In Movie File|date=8 May 2007|first=Shawn|last=Adler|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1559113/20070501/story.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, it was announced that [[Jay Roach]] would return as director. In April 2008, it was reported that [[Gisele Bündchen]] had been offered a role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Gisele Bundchen the Next ‘Austin Powers’ Girl?|date=14 April 2008|first=B.

In March 2010, [[Jay Roach]] indicated to [[MTV]] that Myers is working on ideas for a fourth film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/22/fourht-austin-powers-movie-will-go-somewhere-you-havent-though-of-jay-roach-says/ |title=Fourth 'Austin Powers' Movie Will Go 'Somewhere You Haven't Though Of,' Jay Roach Says|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1559113/20070501/story.jhtml|title=Mike Myers Revives Dr. Evil|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Mike Myers revealed he would return, and had begun writing a script for a fourth installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/exclusive-mike-myers-is-signed-sealed-delivered-and-austin-powers-04-is-coming |title=Exclusive: Mike Myers is signed, sealed, delivered for 'Austin Powers 4'|publisher=[[Hitfix]]|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, when asked about the future of ''Austin Powers'', Myers answered "I'm still figuring that out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/toronto-fleming-qas-supermensch-helmer-mike-myers-on-shep-gordon-pic/ |title=Toronto: Fleming Q&amp;A’s Mike Myers On 'Supermensch' Directorial Debut|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, [[Verne Troyer]] expressed his desire to return as [[Mini-Me]] if he was asked to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/verne-troyer-waiting-for-the-call-for-austin-powers-4-697306.html|title=Verne Troyer waiting for the call for Austin Powers 4|date=September 23, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2016, Roach was asked about the fourth ''Austin Powers'' film during an interview with [[Larry King]], and he stated the ideas for the fourth film that he and Myers have are good and interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/film/austin-powers-4-could-still-happen-according-to-di-885106|title=Austin Powers 4 could still happen, according to director Jay Roach - NME|date=May 20, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, in a telephone interview, Mike Myers stated "Everything is being negotiated and worked out and all that stuff" in regards to the fourth installment of the ''Austin Powers'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1391580-mike-myers-talks-waynes-world-the-leafs-austin-powers |title=Mike Myers talks 'Wayne's World,' the Leafs, 'Austin Powers' |author=The Canadian Press |date=25 August 2016 |publisher=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |access-date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, as the twentieth anniversary approached for ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'', Mike Myers claimed he would love to do another ''Austin Powers'' film, but audiences would "just have to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/austin-powers-4-new-film-movie-mike-myers-interview-a7707001.html|title=Austin Powers 4: 'I would love to do another' Mike Meyers says as original turns 20|publisher=independent.co.uk|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Roach stated that a fourth film would only occur if Myers creates a good story for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/jay-roach-on-why-theres-no-austin-powers-4/|title=Jay Roach On Why There's No "Austin Powers 4" - Dark Horizons|website=www.darkhorizons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2017, Troyer stated that Mini-Me will reveal that he can speak in the fourth movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/05/26/verne-troyer-teases-austin-powers-4-mini-me-will-speak/|title=Verne Troyer teases Austin Powers 4: Mini Me will speak!|date=May 26, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Troyer died on April 21, 2018, delaying production of a fourth film and precluding him from reprising his role as Mini-Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/movies/verne-troyer-dies-at-49/|title=Austin Powers Star Verne Troyer Dies at 49|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2018, Myers reiterated his interest in making a fourth ''Austin Powers'', stating that it would be fun, also hinting that some tribute to Troyer might be included.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.sky.com/story/new-austin-powers-film-is-a-very-strong-maybe-says-mike-myers-11364974&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bell v. the State of Georgia''', 227 Ga. 800, 183 S.E.2d 357 (1971) is one of several cases in which the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] set forth the standard by which an extraordinary [[motion (legal)|motion]] for a [[new trial]] is to be judged.

In order for a defendant to succeed when making such a motion after having discovered [[new evidence]], the defendant must show

{{quote|
#that the evidence has come to his knowledge since the trial;
#that it was not owing to the want of due diligence that he did not acquire it sooner;
#that it is so material that it would probably produce a different verdict;
#that it is not cumulative only;
#that the affidavit of the witness himself should be procured or its absence accounted for; and
#that a new trial will not be granted if the only effect of the evidence will be to impeach the credit of a witness.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/13914 |title=Bell v. the State |work=lawskills.com |publisher=EastCore, INC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725032216/http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/13914/ |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These six criteria have appeared in a number of other decisions of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]], including ''[[Timberlake v. the State]]'' and the majority opinion in ''Davis v. the State'' (see [[Troy Anthony Davis]]).

The case stemmed from an appeal for a conviction centered on child [[hearsay]] testimony. This court decision and similar ones in the same and other [[U.S. state]]s are designed to ensure the finality of [[jury]] [[verdict]]s.  It is therefore necessary for [[defense lawyer]]s to present all [[exculpatory]] evidence at trial rather than bringing such evidence before the courts in a piecemeal manner; however, some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=ENGAMR510232007|title="Where is justice for me?"  The case of Troy Davis, facing execution in Georgia|publisher=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized the principle of finality of jury verdicts as increasing the possibility of errors in [[death penalty]] cases.

The '''Charter of Quaregnon''' ({{lang-fr|Charte de Quaregnon}}, {{lang-nl|Charter van Quaregnon}}) was a [[political manifesto]] which formed the doctrinal basis of [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[socialism]] from 1894 until 1979.

In 1894, Belgian elections were for the first time held according to the scheme of the [[Plural voting|plural right to vote]] under the pressure of the violent [[Belgian general strike of 1893]]. This meant for the [[Belgian Labour Party]] (POB-BWP), that for the first time workers could vote and that representatives from the party, ten years after its foundation, could enter the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian parliament]]. With a doctrinarian charter the program of the socialist party was presented to the electorate. Out of several ideas [[Émile Vandervelde]] chose this proposition, which was adopted on the [[Easter]] Congress of the Socialist Party, at [[Quaregnon]] on 25-26 March 1894, and which became known as the ''Charter of Quaregnon''. This charter was strongly influenced by ideas of the [[France|French]] socialist [[Jules Guesde]].

As a doctrinal source of inspiration for the Belgian Socialists, the Charter of Quaregnon remained in place for two [[World War]]s and many years. Only after 1979, when the [[Belgian Socialist Party]] (PSB-BSP) divided into the [[Flanders|Flemish]] ''[[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialistische Partij]]'' (SP) and the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] ''[[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]]'' (PS), newer charters were created.

==Text of the charter==
{{quotation|
{{center|Charter of Quaregnon}}
----

* 1. [[Wealth]] in general, and the [[means of production]] in particular, are [[natural resources]], or the result of manual- or intellectual labour of former generations, as well as of the present generation; consequently they must be considered as the common heritage of all humanity.
* 2. Only for reasons of social benefit and with the goal to provide as much freedom and well-being to every human, it is allowed to provide people or groups with separate rights to that common heritage.
* 3. The realisation of this ideal brings with it of course the disappearance of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] scheme, which divides society into two hostile [[Social class|classes]]: one that [[Bourgeoisie|without working can enjoy property]]; the other which is [[Proletariat|obliged to cede part of its produce to the ruling class]].
* 4. Workers can only expect their liberation from the abolition of classes and a thorough reorganisation of society. This reform will not be exclusively for the benefit of the proletariat, but for the whole of humanity; however because it is opposed to the immediate interests of the ruling classes, the liberation of the workers must be mainly the work of the workers themselves.
* 5. On a material level the goal must be to gain the free use of all results of production. This goal is only possible in a society where collective work replaces more and more individual work, which means the [[Social ownership|collective use of natural resources and means of production]].
* 6.The conversion of the capitalist scheme into a [[collectivistic]] scheme of course must be accompanied by herewith coherent reforms:
** 1. On a moral level, by developing charity and observing [[solidarity]].
** 2. On a political level, by transforming the [[Sovereign state|state]] towards a management of resources.
* 7. Socialism must observe therefore at the same time the material, moral and political liberation of the workers. Nevertheless material liberation must be the main goal, because the concentration of capital in the hands of some classes already determines the basis of the other forms of the predominance.

! Distribution fitting
! Correlation fitting&lt;ref name="Correlation fitting"&gt;Excel has tools for calculating correlation statistics for a data set. This refers to the software's ability to fit correlation structures to a data set and, where more than one correlation structure is available, to compare the levels of fit.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Time series fitting
! Decision trees
! Optimizer included
! Database connectivity
! [[VBA macros|VBA]] calls to functions&lt;ref name="vba"&gt;Some add-ins provide VBA versions of their UDFs, which allow the user to build their own stochastic UDFs in VBA. Some add-ins also provide VBA functions that control a simulation. This allows the user to create VBA macros that will automatically run simulations and generate results.&lt;/ref&gt;
! [[C++]] calls to functions&lt;ref name="cplus"&gt;Some add-ins allow calls to C++ routines. These allow the user to create a stand-alone [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] that represents a part of the model which needs to be as fast as possible by making use of the faster performance of the original code (usually C++)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation Controls ==

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: 100%; table-layout: fixed;"

|-
! style="width: 12em; text-align: left" | Name
! Control of [[Random seed|seed values]]
! Maximum numbers of draws&lt;ref name="draws"&gt;Some add-ins do not have a custom results viewer and export the data directly into the spreadsheet for analysis using the spreadsheet's native charting and statistical tools. The number of draws is then restricted by the ability of the spreadsheet to handle the size of the generated data.&lt;/ref&gt;
! [[Random number generation|Random number generator]]
! Lock / unlock random variables&lt;ref name="lock"&gt;The ability to replace a random variable with a fixed value.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Multiple simulation runs&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Some add-ins allow the user to automatically run a model multiple times replacing decision variables with different values for each simulation run&lt;/ref&gt;
! Run macros before/after simulation&lt;ref name="runmacro"&gt;Some add-ins allow the user to run a VBA macro before a simulation (e.g. to import data from an external source), after a simulation (e.g. to export the results to a database) or before or after a random draw of the model (e.g. to perform an optimization).&lt;/ref&gt;
! Stop run when output generates error&lt;ref name="stoprun"&gt;Stopping a simulation run when an output variable generates an error is a useful feature for debugging a model&lt;/ref&gt;
! Apply specific sample in model&lt;ref name="specsamp"&gt;After a simulation run the user is able to insert a specific generated result back into the spreadsheet. This is useful, for example, if one wants to investigate the generated scenario that created the greatest profit or loss.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Precision control&lt;ref name="preccon"&gt;The ability to specify a required level of precision for output results, usually the accuracy with which the mean or a percentile of the output has been determined. Precision control will stop a simulation run when the required accuracy is achieved&lt;/ref&gt;
! Spreadsheet interpreter&lt;ref name="interpreter"&gt;Some add-ins will create a compiled version of the spreadsheet model before simulation. This has the benefit of a far faster simulation speed, but will not work with many types of models e.g. models that include VBA calls or functions like OFFSET and VLOOKUP.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Sampling method&lt;ref name="sampling"&gt;Only Monte Carlo sampling is compatible with copula correlation structures. Using Latin Hypercube or Sobol sampling removes the possibility of using other correlation structures like [[Copula (probability theory)#Archimedean copulas|Archimedean copulas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|crone}}

The '''crone''' is a [[stock character]] in [[folklore]] and [[fairy tale]], an old woman. In some stories, she is disagreeable, malicious, or sinister in manner, often with magical or supernatural associations that can make her either helpful or obstructing. The Crone is also an archetypal figure, a [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Woman]]. As a character type, the crone shares characteristics with the [[hag]].

The word "crone" is a less common [[synonym]] for "old woman", and is more likely to appear in reference to traditional narratives than in contemporary everyday usage.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a [[Google]] search of "crone" (2,510,000 hits) and "old woman" (about 16,700,000). Additional data from a search of the ''New York Times'' archives since 1981 which yielded 9100 results for "crone" and 10,023 for "old woman"; in the period 1851–1980, 4,137 for "crone" and 12,270 for "old woman." Searches did not sort out the surname "Crone," nor the construction "N-year-old woman." Retrieved 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The word became further specialized as the third aspect of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] popularized by [[Robert Graves]] and subsequently in some forms of [[neopaganism]], particularly [[Wicca]] in which she symbolizes the Dark Goddess, the dark of the moon, the end of a cycle; together with the Mother and the Maiden she represents part of the circle of life. In [[New Age]] and [[feminist]] spiritual circles, a "[[Croning]]" is a [[ritual]] [[rite of passage]] into an era of wisdom, freedom, and personal power.  Some feminist authors have defined the crone archetype in a positive light, as  a powerful and wise old woman.&lt;ref&gt; Barbara G. Walker, The Crone: Woman of Age, Wisdom, and Power   Harper &amp; Row, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Jean Shinoda Bolen, Crones Don't Whine: Concentrated Wisdom for Juicy Women,  ReadHowYouWant.com, May 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
As a noun, ''crone'' entered the English language around the year 1390, deriving from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] word ''carogne'' (an insult), itself deriving from the [[Old North French]] ''charogne'', ''caroigne'', meaning a disagreeable woman (literally meaning "[[carrion]]"). Prior to the entrance of the word into English, the surname [[Hopcrone]] is recorded (around 1323–1324).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnhart|Barnhart, Robert K.]] (1995) ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology''. [[Harper Collins]]. {{ISBN|0-06-270084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In hero-journey==
In [[Joseph Campbell]]'s classic work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', the first encounter of the [[monomyth|hero on his journey]] is with a protective figure who provides him with [[amulet]]s or magic devices against the dangers he will face. The crone is one of the most common of these protective figures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]], ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' (orig. pub. Princeton University Press, 1968; 3rd ed. 2008), p. 57 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1uFuXlvFgMC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=crone+myth+OR+folklore+OR+folktale+-%22Triple+-Goddess%22+-neopagan+-neopaganism+-wicca+-wiccan&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The child of destiny has to face a long period of obscurity. This is a time of extreme danger, impediment, or disgrace. He is thrown inward to his own depths or outward to the unknown; either way, what he touches is a darkness unexplored. And this is a zone of unsuspected presences, benign as well as malignant: an angel appears, a helpful animal, a fisherman, a hunter, crone, or peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Campbell links the "helpful crone" to the [[fairy godmother]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wicked fairy godmother]] sometimes appears in the guise of a crone.

==Examples==
[[File:Babayaga lubok.jpg|thumb|Baba Yaga rides a pig and fights the infernal creature (here, crocodile)]]
In [[Norse myth]], [[Thor]] wrestles the crone [[Elli]] who personifies old age.&lt;ref&gt;Jane  Chance, ''[[Tolkien]] and the Invention of Myth'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2004), pp. 153–154 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LLxZXqgJdwC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=crone+myth+OR+folklore+OR+folktale+-%22Triple+-Goddess%22+-neopagan+-neopaganism+-wicca+-wiccan&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA153,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Slavic folklore|Slavic]] witch [[Baba Yaga]] is a crone and [[liminality|liminal]] guardian to the [[Otherworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Willis, ''World Mythology'' (Macmillan, 1993), p. 209 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojccFpRU8DwC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=crone+myth+OR+folklore+OR+folktale+-%22Triple+-Goddess%22+-neopagan+-neopaganism+-wicca+-wiccan&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the local folklore of [[Somerset]] in southwest England, the Woman of the Mist is said to appear sometimes as a crone gathering sticks; sightings of her were reported as late as the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Mary Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'' (University of Chicago Press, 1967, 1989), p. 41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=crone+myth+OR+folklore+OR+folktale+-%22Triple+-Goddess%22+-neopagan+-neopaganism+-wicca+-wiccan&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Scottish Highlands]] tale "The Poor Brother and the Rich", a crone refuses to stay buried, until her son-in-law provides a generous [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], after which he becomes as wealthy as his more fortunate brother.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Campbell, ''Popular Tales of the West Highlands Orally Collected'' (London, 1890), vol. 1, pp. 237–240 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ufCBAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=crone+myth+OR+folklore+OR+folktale+-%22Triple+-Goddess%22+-neopagan+-neopaganism+-wicca+-wiccan&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA237,M1 online], full text downloadable.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cuba|Cuban]] traditional folklore  old women often appear as helpful characters, as in the tale of the sick man who can't get well until he meets an old woman who advises him to wear the tunic of a man who is truly happy. According to writer [[Alma Flor Ada]], "They tend to be the ones who keep the family together, who pass on the traditions, who know the remedies that would cure the different illnesses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/10/28/450657717/why-are-old-women-often-the-face-of-evil-in-fairy-tales-and-folklore Why Are Old Women Often the Face of Evil in Fairy Tales and Folklore?

'''Cryptanalysis of the Enigma''' ciphering system enabled the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]] to read substantial amounts of [[Morse code|Morse-coded]] radio communications of the [[Axis powers]] that had been enciphered using [[Enigma machine]]s. This yielded [[military intelligence]] which, along with that from other decrypted Axis radio and [[teleprinter]] transmissions, was given the codename ''[[Ultra]]''. This was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to have been "decisive" to the Allied victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Winterbotham|2000|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enigma machines were a family of portable [[cipher]] machines with [[rotor machine|rotor]] [[scrambler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |last2=Simons |first2=Marc |title=Enigma Cipher Machine |year=2010 |url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/index.htm |accessdate=22 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good operating procedures, properly enforced, would have made the plugboard Enigma machine unbreakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}  However, most of the German military forces, secret services and civilian agencies that used Enigma employed poor operating procedures, and it was these poor  procedures that allowed the Enigma machines to be [[reverse engineered|reverse-engineered]] and the ciphers to be read.

The German plugboard-equipped Enigma became [[Nazi Germany]]'s principal [[cryptography|crypto-system]]. It was broken by the [[Polish General Staff|Polish General Staff's]] [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] in December 1932, with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material obtained from a German spy. A month before the outbreak of World War II, at a conference held near [[Warsaw]], the Polish Cipher Bureau shared its Enigma-breaking techniques and technology with the French and British. During the German [[invasion of Poland]], core Polish Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated, via Romania, to France where they established the [[PC Bruno]] signals intelligence station with French facilities support. Successful cooperation among the Poles, the French, and the British at [[Bletchley Park]] continued until June 1940, when [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|France surrendered]] to the Germans.

From this beginning, the British [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] built up an extensive cryptanalytic capability. Initially, the decryption was mainly of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German air force) and a few ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (German army) messages, as the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German navy) employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. [[Alan Turing]], a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to the design of the cryptanalytical [[bombe]] machines that were instrumental in eventually breaking the naval Enigma. However, the ''Kriegsmarine'' introduced an Enigma version with a fourth rotor for its [[U-boats]], resulting in a prolonged period when these messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of relevant cipher keys and the use of much faster [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombes]], regular, rapid reading of U-boat messages resumed.

==General principles==
{{main|Cryptanalysis}}
The Enigma machines produced a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]]. During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher unbreakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of [[rotor cipher machine]]s which alter each character in the [[plaintext]] to produce the [[ciphertext]], by means of a scrambler comprising a set of ''rotors'' that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device and the output device. This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the [[Key (cryptography)|key sequence]] or [[substitution alphabet]]—repeats.

Decrypting enciphered messages involves three stages, defined somewhat differently in that era than in modern cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there is the ''identification'' of the system in use, in this case Enigma; second, ''breaking'' the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and third, ''solving'', which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual message, ''i.e.'' the ''message key''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp=4,5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is often assumed that an attacker knows how the encipherment process works (see [[Kerckhoffs's principle]]) and ''breaking'' is often used for ''solving'' a key. Enigma machines, however, had so many potential internal wiring states that reconstructing the machine, independent of particular settings, was a very difficult task.

The Enigma rotor cipher machine was potentially an excellent system. It generated a polyalphabetic [[substitution cipher]], with a period before repetition of the substitution alphabet that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.

A major weakness of the system, however, was that no letter could be enciphered to itself. This meant that some possible solutions could quickly be eliminated because of the same letter appearing in the same place in both the ciphertext and the putative piece of plaintext. Comparing the possible plaintext ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' (literally, "no special occurrences"—perhaps better translated as "nothing to report"), with a section of ciphertext, might produce the following:

===Structure===
The mechanism of the Enigma consisted of a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] connected to a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and a [[Enigma machine#Entry wheel|current entry plate]] or wheel (German: ''Eintrittswalze''), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a [[plugboard]] in the military versions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander| c. 1945}}  "Background" Para. 2 Alexander (c. 1945) "Background" Para. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different connection points on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the [[Enigma machine#Reflector|reflector]] (German: ''Umkehrwalze''). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellsbury|1998a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever a key on the keyboard was pressed, the [[Enigma machine#Stepping|stepping motion]] was actuated, advancing the rightmost rotor one position. Because it moved with each key pressed it is sometimes called the ''fast rotor''. When a notch on that rotor engaged with a [[Enigma machine#Stepping|pawl]] on the middle rotor, that too moved; and similarly with the leftmost ('slow') rotor.

There are a huge number of ways that the connections within each scrambler rotor—and between the entry plate and the keyboard or plugboard or lampboard—could be arranged. For the reflector plate there are fewer, but still a large number of options to its possible wirings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each scrambler rotor could be set to any one of its 26 starting positions (any letter of the alphabet). For the Enigma machines with only three rotors, their sequence in the scrambler—which was known as the ''wheel order (WO)'' to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cryptanalysts—could be selected from the six that are possible.

[[Image:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumbnail|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. In the above photograph, two pairs of letters have been swapped (A↔J and S↔O). During World War II, ten leads were used, leaving only six letters 'unsteckered'.]]

Later Enigma models included an ''alphabet ring'' like a tyre around the core of each rotor. This could be set in any one of 26 positions in relation to the rotor's core. The ring contained one or more notches that engaged with a pawl that advanced the next rotor to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The components of the Enigma machine | series = Enigma rotors (or wheels) | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma2.htm | accessdate = 1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later still, the three rotors for the scrambler were selected from a set of five or, in the case of the German Navy, eight rotors. The alphabet rings of rotors VI, VII and VIII contained two notches which, despite shortening the period of the substitution alphabet, made decryption more difficult.

Most military Enigmas also featured a [[plugboard]] (German: ''Steckerbrett''). This altered the electrical pathway between the keyboard and the entry wheel of the scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard. It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if ''A'' was plugged to ''G'' then pressing key ''A'' would lead to current entering the scrambler at the ''G'' position, and if ''G'' was pressed the current would enter at ''A''. The same connections applied for the current on the way out to the lamp panel.

To decipher German military Enigma messages, the following information would need to be known.

'''Logical structure of the machine''' (unchanging)
*The wiring between the keyboard (and lampboard) and the entry plate.
*The wiring of each rotor.
*The number and position(s) of turnover notches on the rings of the rotors.
*The wiring of the reflectors.
'''Internal settings''' (usually changed less frequently than external settings)
*The selection of rotors in use and their ordering on the spindle (''Walzenlage'' or "wheel order").
*The positions of the alphabet ring in relation to the core of each rotor in use (''Ringstellung'' or "ring settings").
'''External settings''' (usually changed more frequently than internal settings)
*The plugboard connections (''Steckerverbindungen'' or "stecker values").
*The rotor positions at the start of enciphering the text of the message.

Discovering the logical structure of the machine may be called "breaking" it, a one-off process except when changes or additions were made to the machines. Finding the internal and external settings for one or more messages may be called "solving"{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|p=2}} - although breaking is often used for this process as well.

===Security properties===
The various Enigma models provided different levels of security. The presence of a plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') substantially increased the security of the encipherment. Each pair of letters that were connected together by a plugboard lead, were referred to as ''stecker partners'', and the letters that remained unconnected were said to be ''self-steckered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the unsteckered Enigma was used for commercial and diplomatic traffic and could be broken relatively easily using hand methods, while attacking versions with a plugboard was much more difficult. The British read unsteckered Enigma messages sent during the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also some [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Italian naval Enigma|Italian naval traffic]] enciphered early in World War II.

The strength of the security of the ciphers that were produced by the Enigma machine was a product of the large numbers associated with the scrambling process.
#It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher with a period (16,900) that was many times the length of the longest message.
#The 3-rotor scrambler could be set in 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 ways, and the 4-rotor scrambler in 26 × 17,576 = 456,976 ways.
#With six leads on the plugboard, the number of ways that pairs of letters could be interchanged was 100,391,791,500 (100 billion)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with ten leads, it was 150,738,274,937,250 (151 trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The complexity of the Enigma machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the way that Enigma was used by the Germans meant that, if the settings for one day (or whatever period was represented by each row of the setting sheet) were established, the rest of the messages for that network on that day could quickly be deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to cryptanalysts.
#A letter could never be [[encrypt]]ed to itself, a consequence of the reflector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property was of great help in using ''[[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]''—short sections of plaintext thought to be somewhere in the ciphertext—and could be used to eliminate a crib in a particular position. For a possible location, if any letter in the crib matched a letter in the ciphertext at the same position, the location could be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Mahon 1945 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this feature that the British [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian [[Alan Turing]] exploited in designing the British [[bombe]].
#The plugboard connections were reciprocal, so that if A was plugged to N, then N likewise became A. It was this property that led mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]] at Bletchley Park to propose that a ''diagonal board'' be introduced into the bombe, substantially reducing the number of incorrect rotor settings that the bombes found.&lt;ref name="Welchman97p245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The notches in the ''alphabet rings'' of rotors I to V were in different positions, which helped cryptanalysts to work out the ''wheel order'' by observing when the middle rotor was turned over by the right-hand rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bauer|2002|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There were substantial weaknesses, in both policies and practice, in the way that Enigma was used (see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|'Operating shortcomings']] below).

===Key setting===
Enigma featured the major operational convenience of being [[involution (mathematics)|symmetrical]] (or [[Inverse function|self-inverse]]). This meant that [[decipherment]] worked in the same way as [[encryption|encipherment]], so that when the [[ciphertext]] was typed in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the [[plaintext]].

Identical setting of the machines at the transmitting and receiving ends was achieved by key setting procedures. These varied from time to time and across different [[Telecommunications network|networks]]. They consisted of ''setting sheets'' in a ''[[codebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The Message Key and Setting Sheets | series = Codes and Ciphers in the Second World War: The history, science and engineering of cryptanalysis in World War II  | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 21 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rijmenants | first = Dirk | title = Enigma Message Procedures | work = Cipher Machines and Cryptology | url = http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm | accessdate = 19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were distributed to all users of a network, and were changed regularly. The message key was transmitted in an ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp=33, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the message preamble. The word ''key'' was also used at Bletchley Park to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets. Initially these were recorded using coloured pencils and were given the names ''red'', ''light blue'' etc., and later the names of birds such as ''kestrel''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, F.H.]] and Stripp, Alan (1993) p. xviii and [[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley]] (1992) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II the settings for most networks lasted for 24 hours, although towards the end of the war, some were changed more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;One element of the key, the sequence of rotors in the machine, was at first changed quarterly; but from 1 January 1936 it was changed monthly; from 1 October 1936, daily; and later, during World War II, as often as every eight hours. [[Marian Rejewski]], ''Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...'', Appendix C to [[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma'' (1984) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  The sheets had columns specifying, for each day of the month, the rotors to be used and their positions, the ring positions and the plugboard connections. For security, the dates were in reverse chronological order down the page, so that each row could be cut off and destroyed when it was finished with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|US Army|1945|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 15 September 1938,&lt;ref&gt;The German Navy adopted a more complex and secure indicator procedure on 1 May 1937—see "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]]".&lt;/ref&gt; the transmitting operator indicated to the receiving operator(s) how to set their rotors, by choosing a three letter ''message key'' (the key specific to that message) and enciphering it twice using the specified initial ring positions (the ''Grundstellung''). The resultant 6-letter indicator, was then transmitted before the enciphered text of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gaj | first = Kris | last2 = Orłowski | first2 = Arkadiusz | title = Facts and myths of Enigma: breaking stereotypes | publisher = George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, U.S.A.; Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences Warszawa, Poland | at = Section 3.2 | url = http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE543/viewgraphs_F03/EUROCRYPT_2003.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414141147/http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE543/viewgraphs_F03/EUROCRYPT_2003.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 14 April 2008 | accessdate = 1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose that the specified ''Grundstellung'' was ''RAO'', and the chosen 3-letter message key  was ''IHL'', the operator would set the rotors to ''RAO'' and encipher ''IHL'' twice. The resultant ciphertext, ''DQYQQT'', would be transmitted, followed by the message enciphered using message key ''IHL''. The receiving operator would use the specified ''Grundstellung RAO'' to decipher the first six letters, yielding ''IHLIHL''. The receiving operator, seeing the repeated message key would know that there had been no corruption and use ''IHL'' to decipher the message.

The weakness in this [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator procedure]] came from two factors. First, use of a global ''Grundstellung'' —this was changed in September 1938 so that the operator selected his initial position to encrypt the message key, and sent the initial position [[Plaintext|in clear]] followed by the enciphered message key. The second problem was the repetition of message key within the indicator, which was a serious security flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gaj | first = Kris | last2 = Orłowski | first2 = Arkadiusz | title = Facts and myths of Enigma: breaking stereotypes | publisher = George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, U.S.A.; Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences Warszawa, Poland A | at = Section 7 | url = http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE543/viewgraphs_F03/EUROCRYPT_2003.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414141147/http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE543/viewgraphs_F03/EUROCRYPT_2003.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 14 April 2008 | accessdate = 1 February 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. This security problem enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. On 1 May 1940 the Germans changed the procedures to encipher the message key only once.

==British efforts==
In 1927, the UK openly purchased a commercial Enigma. Its operation was analysed and reported. Although a leading British cryptographer, [[Dilly Knox]] (a veteran of [[World War I]] and the cryptanalytical activities of the Royal Navy's [[Room 40]]), worked on decipherment he had only the messages he generated himself to practice with. After Germany supplied modified commercial machines to the [[Spanish Civil War#Nationalists|Nationalist]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and with the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] (who were also aiding the Nationalists) using a version of the commercial Enigma that did not have a plugboard, Britain could intercept the radio broadcast messages. In April 1937&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Knox made his first decryption of an Enigma encryption using a technique that he called ''buttoning up'' to discover the rotor wirings&lt;ref name=CarterButtoningUp&gt;{{Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = Buttoning Up: A method for recovering the wiring of the rotors used in a non-stecker Enigma | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/buttoningup.pdf | year = 2004 | accessdate = 20 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another that he called ''rodding'' to solve messages.&lt;ref name=CarterRodding&gt;{{Citation |last=Carter |first=Frank |title=Rodding |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/rodding.pdf |year=2004 |accessdate=20 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411064026/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/rodding.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relied heavily on [[Crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]] and on a crossword-solver's expertise in Italian, as it yielded a limited number of spaced-out letters at a time.

Britain had no ability to read the messages broadcast by Germany, which used the military Enigma machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Spanish link in cracking the Enigma code |last=Gordon Corera |publisher=BBC News |date=23 March 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17486464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polish breakthroughs==
{{main|Polish Cipher Bureau}}
[[Image:MR 1932 small.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Marian Rejewski]] c. 1932, when he first broke [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]]]
   
In the 1920s the German military began using a 3-rotor Enigma, whose security was increased in 1930 by the addition of a plugboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilcox|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] sought to break it due to the threat that Poland faced from Germany, but its early attempts did not succeed. Near the beginning of 1929, the Polish Cipher Bureau realized that mathematicians may make good codebreakers&lt;!-- Enigma book has mysterious professor/Polish spy working for Germany; he flees Germany before being caught; --&gt;; the bureau invited math students at Poznań University to take a class on cryptology&lt;!-- class based on F-G book--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;The course began on 15 January 1929. A letter dated "Warsaw, 29 January 1929, To Professor [[Zdzisław Krygowski|Z. Krygowski]], in [[Poznań]], ul. Głogowska 74/75," and signed by the "[[Chief of the General Staff (Poland)|Chief of the General Staff]], ''Piskor'' [i.e., [[Tadeusz Piskor]]], ''[[Generał dywizji|Generał Dywizji]]''," reads:  "I hereby thank ''Pan Profesor'' for his efforts and assistance given to the General Staff in organizing the cipher [i.e., cryptology] course opened in Poznań on 15 January 1929."  The letter is reproduced in Stanisław Jakóbczyk and Janusz Stokłosa, ''Złamanie szyfru Enigma'' (The Breaking of the Enigma Cipher), 2007, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the class, the Bureau recruited some students to work part-time at a Bureau branch set up in Poznań for the students. The branch operated for some time. On 1 September 1932, 27-year-old Polish mathematician [[Marian Rejewski]] and two fellow [[Poznań University]] mathematics graduates, [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]], joined the Bureau full-time and moved to Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first task was to reconstruct a four-letter German naval cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of 1932 Rejewski was asked to work a couple of hours a day on breaking the Enigma.&lt;ref&gt;Rejewski's work on this may have started in late October or early November 1932.{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejewski's characteristics method===
Marian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans' major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting (''Grundstellung'') for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator's chosen ''message key'' in the enciphered 6-letter indicator. Those procedural mistakes allowed Rejewski to decipher the message keys without knowing any of the machine's wirings. In the above example of ''DQYQQT'' being the enciphered indicator, it is known that the first letter ''D'' and the fourth letter ''Q'' represent the same letter, enciphered three positions apart in the scrambler sequence. Similarly with ''Q'' and ''Q'' in the second and fifth positions, and ''Y'' and ''T'' in the third and sixth. Rejewski exploited this fact by collecting a sufficient set of messages enciphered with the same indicator setting, and assembling three tables for the 1,4, the 2,5, and the 3,6 pairings. Each of these tables might look something like the following:
{|class="wikitable" | border=1 | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|-
! First letter
| A||B||C||D||E||F||G||H||I||J||K||L||M||N||O||P||Q||R||S||T||U||V||W||X||Y||Z
|-
! Fourth letter
| N||S||Y||Q||T||I||C||H||A||F||E||X||J||P||U||L||W||R||Z||K||G||O||V||M||D||B
|}
A path from one first letter to the corresponding fourth letter, then from that letter as the first letter to its corresponding fourth letter, and so on until the first letter recurs, traces out a [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle group]].&lt;ref&gt;Also referred to as a ''box shape'' or a ''chain''. See {{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. II Para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table contains six cycle groups.&lt;!-- (ydqwvougc)(ket)(nplxmjfia)(zbs)(r)(h) --&gt;
{| class="wikitable" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|-
! Cycle group starting at A (9 links)
| (A, N, P, L, X, M, J, F, I, A)
|-
! Cycle group starting at B (3 links)
| (B, S, Z, B)
|-
! Cycle group starting at C (9 links)
| (C, Y, D, Q, W, V, O, U, G, C)
|-
! Cycle group starting at E (3 links)
| (E, T, K, E)
|-
! Cycle group starting at H (1 link)
| (H, H)
|-
! Cycle group starting at R (1 link)
| (R, R)
|-
|}

Rejewski recognized that a cycle group must pair with another group of the same length. Even though Rejewski did not know the rotor wirings or the plugboard permutation, the German mistake allowed him to reduce the number of possible substitution ciphers to a small number.  For the 1,4 pairing above, there are only {{math|1=1&amp;times;3&amp;times;9=27}} possibilities for the substitution ciphers at positions 1 and 4.

Rejewski also exploited cipher clerk laziness. Scores of messages would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, but some of those messages would have the same encrypted indicator. That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position. Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as "AAA", "BBB", or "CCC". Those security mistakes allowed Rejewski to solve each of the six permutations used to encipher the indicator.

That solution was an extraordinary feat. Rejewski did it without knowing the plugboard permutation or the rotor wirings. Even after solving for the six permutations, Rejewski did not know how the plugboard was set or the positions of the rotors. Knowing the six permutations also did not allow Rejewski to read any messages.

===The spy and the rotor wiring===

Before Rejewski started work on the Enigma, the French had a spy, [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]], who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin and had access to some Enigma documents. Even with the help of those documents, the French did not make progress on breaking the Enigma. The French decided to share the material with their British and Polish allies. In a December 1931 meeting, the French provided [[Gwido Langer]], head of the Polish Cipher Bureau, with copies of some Enigma material. Langer asked the French for more material, and [[Gustave Bertrand]] of French Military Intelligence quickly obliged; Bertrand provided additional material in May and September 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|1990|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documents included two German manuals and two pages of Enigma daily keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The documents were ''Instructions for Using the Enigma Cipher Machine'' and ''Keying Instructions for the Enigma Cipher Machine'', and the pages of Enigma keys were for September and October 1932 which fortunately had different rotor orders.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1932, the Bureau provided Rejewski with some German manuals and monthly keys.  The material enabled Rejewski to achieve "one of the most important breakthroughs in [[cryptology|cryptologic]] history"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=974}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the [[Permutation group|theory of permutations and groups]] to work out the Enigma scrambler wiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilcox|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejewski could look at a day's cipher traffic and solve for the permutations at the six sequential positions used to encipher the indicator. Since Rejewski had the cipher key for the day, he knew and could factor out the plugboard permutation. He assumed the keyboard permutation was the same as the commercial Enigma, so he factored that out. He knew the rotor order, the ring settings, and the starting position. He developed a set of equations that would allow him to solve for the rightmost rotor wiring assuming the two rotors to the left did not move.&lt;ref&gt;Solve save for an arbitrary rotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attempted to solve the equations, but failed with inconsistent results. After some thought, he realized one of his assumptions must be wrong.

Rejewski found that the connections between the military Enigma's keyboard and the entry ring were not, as in the commercial Enigma, in the order of the keys on a German typewriter. He made an inspired correct guess that it was in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaj|Orlowski|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's [[Dilly Knox]] was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the arrangement was so simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|p=257}} citing {{Citation | last = Fitzgerald | first = Penelope  | author-link = Penelope Fitzgerald | year = 1977 | title = The Knox Brothers | publication-place = London | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 1-58243-095-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new assumption, Rejewski succeeded in solving the wiring of the rightmost rotor. The next month's cipher traffic used a different rotor in the rightmost position, so Rejewski used the same equations to solve for its wiring. With those rotors known, the remaining third rotor and the reflector wiring were determined. Without capturing a single rotor to reverse engineer, Rejewski had determined the logical structure of the machine.

The Polish Cipher Bureau then had some Enigma machine replicas made; the replicas were called [[Polish Enigma doubles|"Enigma doubles"]].

===The grill method===

The Poles now had the machine's wiring secrets, but they still needed to determine the daily keys for the cipher traffic. The Poles would examine the Enigma traffic and use the method of characteristics to determine the six permutations used for the indicator. The Poles would then use the [[Grill (cryptology)|grill method]] to determine the rightmost rotor and its position. That search would be complicated by the plugboard permutation, but that permutation only swapped six pairs of letters &amp;mdash; not enough to disrupt the search. The grill method also determined the plugboard wiring. The grill method could also be used to determine the middle and left rotors and their setting (and those tasks were simpler because there was no plugboard), but the Poles eventually compiled a catalog of the {{math|1=3&amp;times;2&amp;times;26&amp;times;26={{#expr:3*2*26*26}}}} possible {{mvar|Q}} permutations (reflector and 2 leftmost rotor permutations), so they could just look up the answer.

The only remaining secret of the daily key would be the ring settings, and the Poles would attack that problem with brute force. Most messages would start with the three letters "ANX" (''an'' is German for "to" and the "X" character was used as a space). It may take almost {{math|1=26&amp;times;26&amp;times;26={{#expr:26*26*26}}}} trials, but that was doable. Once the ring settings were found, the Poles could read the day's traffic.

The Germans made it easy for the Poles in the beginning. The rotor order only changed every quarter, so the Poles would not have to search for the rotor order. Later the Germans changed it every month, but that would not cause much trouble, either. Eventually, the Germans would change the rotor order every day, and late in the war (after Poland had been overrun) the rotor order might be changed during the day.

The Poles kept improving their techniques as the Germans kept improving their security measures.

===Invariant cycle lengths and the card catalog===
[[File:Cyclometer4.png|thumb|175px|[[Cyclometer]], devised in the mid-1930s by Rejewski to catalog the [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] structure of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[permutation]]s. 1: Rotor lid closed, 2: Rotor lid open, 3: Rheostat, 4: Glowlamps, 5: Switches, 6: Letters.]]

Rejewski realised that, although the letters in the cycle groups were changed by the plugboard, the number and lengths of the cycles were unaffected—in the example above, six cycle groups with lengths of 9, 9, 3, 3, 1 and 1. He described this invariant structure as the ''characteristic'' of the indicator setting.{{dubious|Characteristic|reason=see following dubious. Confuses characteristic with catalog hash code.|date=May 2015}} There were only 105,456 possible rotor settings.&lt;ref&gt;105,456 is the number of possible rotor settings (17,576) multiplied by the six ''wheel orders'' that were possible at this time. {{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The characteristic does not make the rings disappear; the rings can make the card catalog fail because stepped entries won't be there (a factor of 6 if only single steps are considered). The characteristic allows the actual letters (and therefore the plugboard permutation) to be ignored. Furthermore, Rejewski's notion of characteristic may be differerent: it may be the cycles rather than the cycle lengths. See Rejewski July 1981, Annals of Hist Computing, 3, 3, pp 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles therefore set about creating a [[Card catalog (cryptology)|''card catalog'']] of these cycle patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945|loc=Ch. II Para. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cycle-length method would avoid using the grill. The card catalog would index the cycle-length for all starting positions (except for turnovers that occurred while enciphering an indicator). The day's traffic would be examined to discover the cycles in the permutations. The card catalog would be consulted to find the possible starting positions. There are roughly 1 million possible cycle-length combinations and only 105,456 starting positions.&lt;!-- expect 1, but some structures had thousands. A turnover indicator would not be found. --&gt; Having found a starting position, the Poles would use an Enigma double to determine the cycles at that starting position without a plugboard. The Poles would then compare those cycles to the cycles with the (unknown) plugboard and solve for the plugboard permutation (a simple substitution cipher).&lt;!-- No solution implies not the right starting position. --&gt; Then the Poles could find the remaining secret of the ring settings with the ANX method.&lt;!-- Rejewski claims they developed a faster method, but could not remember it. --&gt;

The problem was compiling the large card catalog.

Rejewski, in 1934 or 1935, devised a machine to facilitate making the catalog and called it a ''[[cyclometer]]''. This "comprised two sets of rotors... connected by wires through which electric current could run. Rotor N in the second set was three letters out of phase with respect to rotor N in the first set, whereas rotors L and M in the second set were always set the same way as rotors L and M in the first set".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984e|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation of this catalog, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, "laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes".&lt;ref name=RejewskiAppxC242&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma [[reflector (cipher machine)|reflector]], necessitating the production of a new catalog&amp;mdash;"a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time".&lt;ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/&gt;

This characteristics method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 3-rotor Enigma|German Navy 3-rotor Enigma]] below).&lt;ref name = MahonP13&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, on 15 September 1938 it stopped working for German army and air force messages because operators were then required to choose their own ''Grundstellung'' (initial rotor setting) for each message. Although German army message keys would still be double enciphered, the days keys would not be double enciphered at the same initial setting, so the characteristic could no longer be found or exploited.

===Perforated sheets===
[[File:Płachta Zygalskiego - decrypting Enigma.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Perforated sheets|Zygalski sheet]]]]
{{main|Zygalski sheets}}
Although the characteristics method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called ''samiczki''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=54, 63}} note 2&lt;/ref&gt; (in English, ''females''—a term later used at Bletchley Park).&lt;ref&gt;In {{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=72}} he suggests that this arose from the nomenclature for plugs (male) and sockets (female) because the success of this method depended on a number of overlying sheets having their apertures in register.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2004|p=362}} cites [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox]], who attended the 25 July 1939 Warsaw conference, as having given a more frankly biological etymology, discreetly veiled in French.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a limited number of scrambler settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalog. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were '''''S'''ZV'''S'''IK'', this would be termed a 1-4 female; if ''W'''H'''OE'''H'''S'', a 2-5 female; and if ''AS'''W'''CR'''W''''', a 3-6 female. The method was called ''Netz'' (from ''Netzverfahren'', "net method"), or the [[Zygalski sheets|Zygalski sheet method]] as it used perforated sheets that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalski's name was not used for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Instead they were called [[John R.F. Jeffreys|Jeffreys]] sheets after the head of the Bletchley Park section that produced them.&lt;/ref&gt; About ten females from a day's messages were required for success.

There was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences ''wheel orders''. Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 51×51 matrices on the sheets represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors. The sheets contained about 1000 holes in the positions in which a female could occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of sheets for that day's messages would be appropriately positioned on top of each other in the [[Perforated sheets|perforated sheets apparatus]]. Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated:

{{blockquote|When the sheets were superposed and moved in the proper sequence and the proper manner with respect to each other, in accordance with a strictly defined program, the number of visible apertures gradually decreased. And, if a sufficient quantity of data was available, there finally remained a single aperture, probably corresponding to the right case, that is, to the solution. From the position of the aperture one could calculate the order of the rotors, the setting of their rings, and, by comparing the letters of the cipher keys with the letters in the machine, likewise permutation S; in other words, the entire cipher key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984e|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The holes in the sheets were painstakingly cut with razor blades and in the three months before the next major setback, the sets of sheets for only two of the possible six wheel orders had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish ''bomba''===

{{main|Bomba (cryptography)}}
After [[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski's]] characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the [[bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] or ''cryptologic bomb''.  Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the ''bomba'' relied on the occurrence of ''females'', but required only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. Six ''bomby''&lt;ref&gt;''Bomby'' is the plural of ''bomba''.&lt;/ref&gt; were constructed, one for each of the then possible ''wheel orders''. Each ''bomba'' conducted an exhaustive ([[Brute force attack|brute-force]]) analysis of the 17,576&lt;ref&gt;17,576 = 26&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, since Enigma used 26 letters on each of 3 rotors.&lt;/ref&gt; possible message keys.

Rejewski has written about the device: {{blockquote|The bomb method, invented in the autumn of 1938, consisted largely in the automation and acceleration of the process of reconstructing daily keys. Each cryptologic bomb (six were built in Warsaw for the Biuro Szyfrów Cipher Bureau before September 1939) essentially  constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas. It took the place of about one hundred workers and shortened the time for obtaining a key to about two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984e|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cipher message transmitted the ''Grundstellung'' in the clear, so when a ''bomba'' found a match, it revealed the rotor order, the rotor positions, and the ring settings. The only remaining secret was the plugboard permutation.&lt;!-- apparently easy to solve, but who said so? Alexander? --&gt;

===Major setback===
On 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering by introducing two additional rotors (IV and V). This increased the number of possible ''wheel orders'' from 6 to 60.&lt;ref name=Kozaczuk84p54&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles could then read only the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to commission 54 more bombs or produce 58 sets&lt;!-- They had 2; 58 other sets were needed. --&gt; of Zygalski sheets. Other Enigma users received the two new rotors at the same time. However, until 1 July 1939 the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''  (SD)—the intelligence agency of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the [[Nazi Party]]—continued to use its machines in the old way with the same indicator setting for all messages. This allowed Rejewski to reuse his previous method, and by about the turn of the year he had worked out the wirings of the two new rotors.&lt;ref name=Kozaczuk84p54/&gt; On 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight to between seven and ten, which made other methods of decryption even more difficult.&lt;ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/&gt;

Rejewski wrote, in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War: {{blockquote|we quickly found the [wirings] within the [new rotors], but [their] introduction ... raised the number of possible sequences of [rotors] from 6 to 60 ... and hence also raised tenfold the work of finding the keys. Thus the change was not qualitative but quantitative. We would have had to markedly increase the personnel to operate the bombs, to produce the perforated sheets ... and to manipulate the sheets.&lt;ref name=RejewskiHinsleyP80&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1982|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also quoted in {{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==World War II==

===Italian naval Enigma===
In 1940 Dilly Knox wanted to establish whether the Italian Navy were still using the same system that he had cracked during the Spanish Civil War; he instructed his assistants to use rodding to see whether the crib ''PERX'' (''per'' being Italian for "for" and ''X'' being used to indicate a space between words) worked for the first part of the message. After three months there was no success, but [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]], a 19-year-old student, found that rodding produced ''PERS'' for the first four letters of one message. She then (against orders) tried beyond this and obtained ''PERSONALE'' (Italian for "personal"). This confirmed that the Italians were indeed using the same machines and procedures.&lt;ref name=CarterRodding /&gt;

The subsequent breaking of Italian naval Enigma ciphers led to substantial Allied successes. The cipher-breaking was disguised by sending a [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance aircraft]] to the known location of a warship before attacking it, so that the Italians assumed that this was how they had been discovered. The Royal Navy's  victory at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941 was considerably helped by Ultra intelligence obtained from Italian naval Enigma signals.

===Polish disclosures===

As the likelihood of war increased in 1939, Britain and France pledged support for Poland in the event of action that threatened its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Chamberlain | first = Neville  | author-link = Neville Chamberlain | date = 31 March 1939 | title = European Situation (2.52 p.m.) | periodical = Hansard | publisher = UK Parliament | volume = 345 | url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/mar/31/european-situation-1 | accessdate = 3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Germany withdrew from the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of January 1934. The Polish General Staff, realizing what was likely to happen, decided to share their work on Enigma decryption with their  western allies. Marian Rejewski later wrote:

{{blockquote|[I]t was not [as Harry Hinsley suggested, cryptological] difficulties of ours that prompted us to work with the British and French, but only the deteriorating political situation. If we had had no difficulties at all we would still, or even the more so, have shared our achievements with our allies as our contribution to the struggle against Germany.&lt;ref name=RejewskiHinsleyP80/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

At a conference near Warsaw on 26 and 27 July 1939, the Poles revealed to the French and British that they had broken Enigma and pledged to give each a [[Polish Enigma doubles|Polish-reconstructed Enigma]], along with details of their Enigma-solving techniques and equipment, including Zygalski's perforated sheets and Rejewski's [[bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|2006|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of [[Zygalski sheets]] for all 60 possible wheel orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herivel|2008|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilly Knox was a member of the British delegation. He commented on the fragility of the Polish system's reliance on the repetition in the indicator, because it might "at any moment be cancelled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August two Polish Enigma doubles were sent to Paris, whence [[Gustave Bertrand]] took one to London, handing it to [[Stewart Menzies]] of Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bertrand|1973|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Welchman, who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, wrote:

{{blockquote|Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1984|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Peter Calvocoressi]], who became head of the Luftwaffe section in Hut 3, wrote of the Polish contribution:

{{blockquote|The one moot point is—how valuable? According to the best qualified judges it accelerated the breaking of Enigma by perhaps a year. The British did not adopt Polish techniques but they were enlightened by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Calvocoressi | first = Peter  | author-link = Peter Calvocoressi | title = Credit to the Poles  | newspaper = The Times |publication-place=London | page = 13 | date = 23 March 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

=== PC Bruno ===
{{main|PC Bruno}}
On 17 September 1939, the day [[Soviet invasion of Poland|the Soviet Union began its invasion of Poland]], Cipher Bureau personnel crossed their country's southeastern border into Romania.  They eventually made their way to France, and on 20 October 1939, at ''[[PC Bruno]]'' outside Paris, the Polish cryptanalists resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in collaboration with Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=69–94, 104–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PC Bruno'' and Bletchley Park worked together closely, communicating via a [[telegraph]] line secured by the use of Enigma doubles. In January 1940 Alan Turing spent several days at ''PC Bruno'' conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of Zygalski sheets that had been punched at Bletchley Park by [[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]] using Polish-supplied information, and on 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic—that from 28 October 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=84, 94}} note 8&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, until the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940, 17 percent of the Enigma keys that were found by the allies, were solved at ''PC Bruno''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1982|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive against the Low Countries and France, the Germans made the feared change in the indicator procedure, discontinuing the duplication of the enciphered message key. This meant that the Zygalski sheet method no longer worked.&lt;ref name="Rejewski84P243"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|pp=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the cryptanalysts had to rely on exploiting the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operator weaknesses]] described below, particularly the cillies and the [[Herivel tip]].

After the June Franco-German armistice, the Polish cryptological team resumed work in France's southern ''Free Zone'', although probably not on Enigma.&lt;ref&gt;It is not clear whether, after the June 1940 fall of France, the Cipher Bureau broke Enigma. Rejewski, the principal Polish source, wrote in a posthumously published 1980 paper that at [[Cadix]] "We worked on other ciphers, no longer on Enigma." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=270}}). Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] of Polish Intelligence, however, mentioned the Poles breaking "interesting [machine-enciphered messages] from [Germany's 1941] Balkan campaign coming [in over] the 'Luftwaffe' network..." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=116}}). And French intelligence Gen. Gustave Bertrand wrote of Enigma having been read at Cadix. ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=117}}). Tadeusz Lisicki, Rejewski's and Zygalski's immediate chief later in wartime England but sometimes a dubious source, wrote in 1982 that "Rejewski in [a letter] conceded that Bertrand was doubtless right that at Cadix they had read Enigma, and that the number given by Bertrand, of 673 [Wehrmacht] telegrams, was correct.... The British did not send keys to Cadix; these were found using various tricks such as the sillies [and] Herivel tip described by Welchman, Knox's method, as well as others that Rejewski no longer remembered." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=117}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski, after many travails, perilous journeys and Spanish imprisonment, finally made it to Britain,&lt;ref&gt;The third mathematician, Jerzy Różycki, had perished together with three Polish and one French colleague in the 1942 sinking of the passenger ship ''Lamoricière'' as they were returning to France from a tour of duty in [[Algeria]].&lt;/ref&gt; where they were inducted  into the Polish Army and put to work breaking German ''[[SS]]'' and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]'' hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in [[Boxmoor]]. Due to their having been in occupied France, it was thought too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=148–55, 205–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German occupation of [[Vichy France]], several of those who had worked at ''PC Bruno'' were captured by the Germans. Despite the dire circumstances in which some of them were held, none betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating shortcomings===
Apart from some less-than-ideal inherent characteristics of the Enigma, in practice the system's greatest weakness was the way that it was used. The basic principle of this sort of enciphering machine is that it should deliver a very long stream of transformations that are difficult for a cryptanalyst to predict. Some of the instructions to operators, however, and their sloppy habits, had the opposite effect. Without these operating shortcomings, Enigma would, almost certainly, not have been broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of shortcomings that the Polish cryptanalysts exploited to such great effect included the following:

* The production of an early Enigma training manual containing an example of plaintext and its genuine ciphertext, together with the relevant message key. When Rejewski was given this in December 1932, it "made [his reconstruction of the Enigma machine] somewhat easier".&lt;ref name="Rejewski84P243"/&gt;
* Repetition of the message key as described in [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Rejewski's characteristics method|Rejewski's characteristics method]], above. (This helped in Rejewski's [[Marian Rejewski#Solving Enigma's wiring|solving Enigma's wiring]] in 1932, and was continued until May 1940.)
* Repeatedly using the same stereotypical expressions in messages, an early example of what Bletchley Park would later term [[crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]]. Rejewski wrote that "... we relied on the fact that the greater number of messages began with the letters ''ANX''—German for "to", followed by ''X'' as a spacer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|pp=243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of easily guessed keys such as ''AAA'' or ''BBB'', or sequences that reflected the layout of the Enigma keyboard, such as "three [typing] keys that stand next to each other [o]r diagonally [from each other]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Bletchley Park such occurrences were called ''cillies''.&lt;ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2004|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cillies in the operation of the four-rotor ''Abwehr'' Enigma included four-letter names and German obscenities. Sometimes, with multi-part messages, the operator would not enter a key for a subsequent part of a message, merely leaving the rotors as they were at the end of the previous part, to become the message key for the next part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Having only three different rotors for the three positions in the scrambler. (This continued until December 1938, when it was increased to five and then eight for naval traffic in 1940.)
* Using only six plugboard leads, leaving 14 letters ''unsteckered''. (This continued until January 1939 when the number of leads was increased, leaving only a small number of letters unsteckered.)

Other useful shortcomings that were discovered by the British and later the American cryptanalysts included the following, many of which depended on frequent solving of a particular network:

* The practice of re-transmitting a message in an identical, or near-identical, form on different cipher networks. If a message was transmitted using both a low-level cipher that Bletchley Park broke by hand, and Enigma, the decrypt provided an excellent crib for Enigma decipherment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} "Background" Para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
* For machines where there was a choice of more rotors than there were slots for them, a rule on some networks stipulated that no rotor should be in the same slot in the scrambler as it had been for the immediately preceding configuration. This reduced the number of wheel orders that had to be tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bauer|2007|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not allowing a wheel order to be repeated on a monthly setting sheet. This meant that when the keys were being found on a regular basis, economies in excluding possible wheel orders  could be made.&lt;ref name="Taunt 1993 108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taunt|1993|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The stipulation, for Air Force operators, that no letter should be connected on the plugboard to its neighbour in the alphabet. This reduced the problem of identifying the plugboard connections and was automated in some Bombes with a Consecutive Stecker Knock-Out (CSKO) device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sloppy practice that John Herivel anticipated soon after his arrival at Bletchley Park in January 1940. He thought about the practical actions that an Enigma operator would have to make, and the short cuts he might employ. He thought that, after setting the alphabet rings to the prescribed setting, and closing the lid, the operator might not turn the rotors by more than a few places in selecting the first part of the indicator. Initially this did not seem to be the case, but after the changes of May 1940, what became known as the [[Herivel tip]] proved to be most useful.&lt;ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|pp=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Herivel, cited by {{Harvnb|Smith|2007|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The practice of re-using some of the columns of wheel orders, ring settings or plugboard connections from previous months. The resulting analytical short-cut was christened at Bletchley Park ''Parkerismus'' after Reg Parker, who had, through his meticulous record-keeping, spotted this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|pp=130, 131, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The re-use of a permutation in the German Air Force METEO code as the Enigma ''stecker'' permutation for the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bauer|2007|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mavis Lever, a member of Dilly Knox's team, recalled an occasion when there was an extraordinary message. {{blockquote|The one snag with Enigma of course is the fact that if you press ''A'', you can get every other letter but ''A''. I picked up this message and—one was so used to looking at things and making instant decisions&amp;mdash;I thought: 'Something's gone. What has this chap done? There is not a single ''L'' in this message.'

My chap had been told to send out a dummy message and he had just had a fag [cigarette] and pressed the last key on the keyboard, the ''L''. So that was the only letter that didn't come out. We had got the biggest crib we ever had, the encypherment was ''LLLL'', right through the message and that gave us the new wiring for the wheel [rotor]. That's the sort of thing we were trained to do. Instinctively look for something that had gone wrong or someone who had done something silly and torn up the rule book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2007|pp=59, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Postwar debriefings of [[German code breaking in World War II|German cryptographic specialists]], conducted as part of project [[TICOM]], tend to support the view that the Germans were well aware that the un-steckered Enigma was theoretically solvable, but thought that the steckered Enigma had not been solved.{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}

===Crib-based decryption===
The term ''[[Known-plaintext attack|crib]]'' was used at Bletchley Park to denote any ''[[known plaintext]]'' or ''suspected plaintext'' at some point in an enciphered message.

Britain's Government Code and Cipher School (GC&amp;CS), before its move to Bletchley Park, had realised the value of recruiting mathematicians and logicians to work in codebreaking teams. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician with an interest in cryptology and in machines for implementing logical operations—and who was regarded by many as a genius—had started work for GC&amp;CS on a part-time basis from about the time of the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Welchman, another Cambridge mathematician, had also received initial training in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  they both reported to Bletchley Park on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany.

Most of the Polish success had relied on the repetition within the indicator. But as soon as Turing moved to Bletchley Park—where he initially joined Dilly Knox in the research section—he set about seeking methods that did not rely on this weakness, as they correctly anticipated that the German Army and Air Force might follow the German Navy in improving their indicator system.

The Poles had used an early form of crib-based decryption in the days when only six leads were used on the plugboard.&lt;ref name = MahonP13 /&gt; The technique became known as the ''Forty Weepy Weepy'' method for the following reason. When a message was a continuation of a previous one, the plaintext would start with ''FORT'' (from ''Fortsetzung'', meaning "continuation") followed by the time of the first message given twice bracketed by the letter ''Y''. At this time numerals were represented by the letters on the top row of the Enigma keyboard. So, "continuation of message sent at 2330" was represented as ''FORTYWEEPYYWEEPY''.

''Cribs'' were fundamental to the British approach to solving Enigma keys, but guessing the plaintext for a message was a highly skilled business. So in 1940 [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] set up a special ''Crib Room'' in Hut 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welchman97p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foremost amongst the knowledge needed for identifying cribs was the text of previous decrypts. Bletchley Park maintained detailed indexes&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bletchley Park Archives: Government Code &amp; Cypher School Card Indexes | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/archives/gccscoll.rhtm | accessdate = 8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of message preambles, of every person, of every ship, of every unit, of every weapon, of every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each message the [[traffic analysis]] recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1984|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as [[Derek Taunt]], another Cambridge mathematician-cryptanalyst wrote, the truism that "nothing succeeds like success" is particularly apposite here.&lt;ref name="Taunt 1993 108"/&gt;

Stereotypical messages included ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' (literally, "no special occurrences"—perhaps better translated as "nothing to report"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''An die Gruppe'' ("to the group") &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number that came from weather stations such as ''weub null seqs null null'' ("weather survey 0600"). This was actually rendered as ''WEUBYYNULLSEQSNULLNULL''. The word ''WEUB'' being short for ''Wetterübersicht'', ''YY'' was used as a separator and ''SEQS'' was common abbreviation of ''sechs'' (German for "six").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taunt|1993|pp=104, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel|Erwin Rommel's]] Quartermaster started all of his messages to his commander with the same formal introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as ''crib-dragging''. This, however, was only one aspect of the processes of solving a key. Derek Taunt has written that the three cardinal personal qualities that were in demand for cryptanalysis were (1) a creative imagination, (2) a well-developed critical faculty, and (3) a habit of meticulousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taunt|1993|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skill at solving crossword puzzles was famously tested in recruiting some cryptanalysts. This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined. For example, if the crib was the word ''WETTER'' (German for "weather") and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was ''TEWWER'', it is easy to see that ''T'' with ''W'' are ''stecker partners''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts' tasks.

A fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was called a ''[[Kiss (cryptanalysis)|kiss]]'' and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the ''dockyard cipher'' and repeated ''verbatim'' in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, [[Nathalie Sergueiew]], code named ''Treasure'', who had been ''[[Double Cross System|turned]]'' to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the ''Abwehr'' Enigma network. She was kept going by [[MI5]] because this provided long cribs, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the ''Abwehr''.&lt;ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2007|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to solve German naval Enigma keys, such as when an [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]] was about to depart, mines would be laid by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as ''sechs'' or ''sieben'') for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The warning message about the mines and then the "all clear" message, would be transmitted both using the ''dockyard cipher'' and the [[U-boat]] Enigma network. This process of ''planting'' a crib was called ''[[Gardening (cryptanalysis)|gardening]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''cillies'' were not actually cribs, the ''chit-chat'' in clear that Enigma operators indulged in amongst themselves, often gave a clue as to the cillies that they might generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When captured German Enigma operators revealed that they had been instructed to encipher numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word ''eins'' ("one") appeared in 90% of messages.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Turing automated the crib process, creating the ''Eins Catalogue'', which assumed that ''eins'' was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for ''EINS'' with that day's ''wheel order'' and plugboard connections.&lt;ref&gt;''The 1944 Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary'', http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page34.htm Dictionary entry for EINS CATALOGUE&lt;/ref&gt;

===British ''bombe''===
{{main|Bombe}}
The British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by Alan Turing soon after he arrived at Bletchley Park in September 1939. [[Harold Keen|Harold "Doc" Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] (BTM) in [[Letchworth]] ({{convert|35|km|mi}} from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing's ideas into a working machine—under the codename CANTAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=BTM - British Tabulatuing Machine Company Ltd |contribution-url=http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/btm1.htm |editor-last=Harper |editor-first=John |title=The British Bombe CANTAB |url=http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204202741/http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's specification developed the ideas of the Poles' [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] but was designed for the much more general crib-based decryption.

The bombe helped to identify the ''wheel order'', the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the ''stecker partner'' of a specified letter. This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of ''wheel orders'' on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that [[Contradiction|contradicted]] the Enigma's known characteristics. In the words of Gordon Welchman "the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of ''wheel order'' and scrambler positions that required 'further analysis' to a manageable number."&lt;ref name="Welchman97p120"/&gt;

[[File:RebuiltBombeFrontView.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The working rebuilt bombe now at [[The National Museum  of Computing]] on Bletchley Park. Each of the rotating drums simulates the action of an Enigma rotor. There are 36 Enigma-equivalents and, on the right end of the middle row, three ''indicator'' drums.]]

The demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | contribution = Alan Turing, the Enigma and the Bombe | contribution-url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/tbombe/tbombe.htm | editor-last = Sale | editor-first = Tony | editor-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Enigma cipher machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|in series]] by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes. When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before restarting it.

Although Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic [[Call sign|callsigns]] and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further. This became known as the ''diagonal board'' and was subsequently incorporated to great effect in all the bombes.&lt;ref name="Welchman97p245" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellsbury|1998b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext. This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master. As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible ''wheel orders'' could be omitted had to be made. Turing's [[Banburismus]] was used in making this major economy. The cryptanalyst would then compile a [[Bombe#Bombe menu|''menu'']] which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose ''stecker partner'' was sought. The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext. Some of these formed loops (or ''closures'' as Turing called them) in a similar way to the ''cycles'' that the Poles had exploited.

The reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter. When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being ''stecker partners'' with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on. If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur. In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction. The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on [[Typex]] machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas. All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.&lt;ref name=CarterStopsKeys/&gt;

To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per ''wheel order''. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib.&lt;ref name=CarterStopsKeys&gt;{{citation |last=Carter |first=Frank |title=From Bombe 'stops' to Enigma keys |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf |year=2004 |accessdate=1 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108030414/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that ''turn-over'' of the middle rotor would have occurred.

The production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve. Each bank was used for a different ''wheel order'' by fitting it with the drums that corresponded to the Enigma rotors being tested. The first bombe was named ''Victory'' and was delivered to Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. The next one, which included the diagonal board, was delivered on 8 August 1940. It was referred to as a ''spider bombe'' and was named ''Agnus Dei'' which soon became ''Agnes'' and then ''Aggie''. The production of British bombes was relatively slow at first, with only five bombes being in use in June 1941, 15 by the year end,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|pp=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 by September 1942, 49 by January 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually 210 at the end of the war.

A refinement that was developed for use on messages from those networks that disallowed the plugboard (''Stecker'') connection of adjacent letters, was the ''Consecutive Stecker Knock Out''. This was fitted to 40 bombes and produced a useful reduction in false stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bauer|2002|p=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the bombes were operated by ex-BTM servicemen, but in March 1941 the first detachment of members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (known as ''Wrens'') arrived at Bletchley Park to become bombe operators. By 1945 there were some 2,000 Wrens operating the bombes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the risk of bombing, relatively few of the bombes were located at Bletchley Park. The largest two outstations were at [[Eastcote]] (some 110 bombes and 800 Wrens) and Stanmore (some 50 bombes and 500 Wrens). There were also bombe outstations at Wavendon, Adstock and Gayhurst. Communication with Bletchley Park was by [[teleprinter]] links.

When the German Navy started using 4-rotor Enigmas, about sixty 4-rotor bombes were produced at Letchworth, some with the assistance of the [[General Post Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=Bombe Types |contribution-url=http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/types1.htm |editor-last=Harper |editor-first=John |title=The British Bombe CANTAB |url=http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204202741/http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NCR Corporation|NCR]]-manufactured [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy 4-rotor bombes]] were, however, very fast and the most successful. They were extensively used by Bletchley Park over teleprinter links (using the [[Combined Cipher Machine]]) to [[OP-20-G]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=89}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; for both 3-rotor and 4-rotor jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wenger|Engstrom|Meader|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Luftwaffe'' Enigma===
Although the German army, SS, police, and railway all used Enigma with similar procedures, it was the ''Luftwaffe'' (Air Force) that was the first and most fruitful source of Ultra intelligence during the war. The messages were decrypted in Hut 6 at Bletchley Park and turned into intelligence reports in Hut 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network code-named ‘Red’ at Bletchley Park was broken regularly and quickly from 22 May 1940 until the end of hostilities. Indeed, the Air Force section of Hut 3 expected the new day’s Enigma settings to have been established in Hut 6 by breakfast time. The relative ease of solving this network’s settings was a product of plentiful cribs and frequent German operating mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luftwaffe chief [[Hermann Göring]] was known to use it for trivial communications, including informing squadron commanders to make sure the pilots he was going to decorate had been properly deloused. Such messages became known as "Göring funnies" to the staff at Bletchley Park.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===''Abwehr'' Enigma===
[[Image:Enigma-G.jpg|thumb|Enigma Model G, used by the ''[[Abwehr]]''. It had three ordinary rotors and a rotating reflector, multiple notches on the rotor rings, but no plugboard.]]

Dilly Knox's last great cryptanalytical success before his untimely death in February 1943, was the solving, in 1941, of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' Enigma. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter indicator sequence before the usual 5-letter groups led to the suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Twinn|1993|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice.  The machine itself was similar to a [[Enigma machine#Military Enigma|Model G Enigma]], with three conventional rotors, though it did not have a plug board.  The principal difference to the model G was that it was equipped with a reflector that was advanced by the stepping mechanism once it had been set by hand to its starting position (in all other variants, the reflector was fixed).  Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed ''cycles'' (or ''boxes'' as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the  Poles in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=FCarterAbwehr/&gt;

Knox was able to derive, using his ''buttoning up'' procedure,&lt;ref name=CarterButtoningUp /&gt; some of the wiring of the rotor that had been loaded in the fast position on that day. Progressively he was able to derive the wiring of all three rotors. Once that had been done, he was able to work out the wiring of the reflector.&lt;ref name=FCarterAbwehr&gt;{{Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = The Abwehr Enigma Machine | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/resources/file.rhtm/261894/web+abwehr2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deriving the indicator setting for that day was achieved using Knox's time-consuming ''rodding'' procedure.&lt;ref name=CarterRodding /&gt; This involved a great deal of trial and error, imagination and crossword puzzle-solving skills, but was helped by ''cillies''.

The ''Abwehr'' was the [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] and [[espionage|counter-espionage]] service of the German High Command. The spies that it placed in enemy countries used a lower level cipher (which was broken by [[Oliver Strachey|Oliver Strachey's]] section at Bletchley Park) for their transmissions. However, the messages were often then re-transmitted word-for-word on the ''Abwehr's'' internal Enigma networks, which gave the best possible crib for deciphering that day's indicator setting. Interception and analysis of ''Abwehr'' transmissions led to the remarkable state of affairs that allowed MI5 to give a categorical assurance that all the German spies in Britain were controlled as [[double agents]] working for the Allies under the [[Double Cross System]].&lt;ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129"/&gt;

===German Army Enigma===
In the summer of 1940 following the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Franco-German armistice]], most Army Enigma traffic was travelling by land lines rather than radio and so was not available to Bletchley Park. The air [[Battle of Britain]] was crucial, so it was not surprising that the concentration of scarce resources was on ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Abwehr'' traffic. It was not until early in 1941 that the first breaks were made into German Army Enigma traffic, and it was the spring of 1942 before it was broken reliably, albeit often with some delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the German Army Enigma operators made deciphering more difficult by making fewer operating mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|Weierud|2005|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Naval Enigma===
The German Navy used Enigma in the same way as the German Army and Air Force until 1 May 1937 when they changed to a substantially different system. This used the same sort of setting sheet but, importantly, it included the ground key for a period of two, sometimes three days. The message setting was concealed in the indicator by selecting a trigram from a book (the ''[[Indicator Group Book|Kenngruppenbuch]]'', or K-Book) and performing a bigram substitution on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Supreme Command of the Navy | title =  The Enigma General Procedure (Der Schluessel M Verfahren M Allgemein) | work = The Bletchley Park translated Enigma Instruction Manual, transcribed and formatted by [[Tony Sale]] | place = Berlin | publisher = Supreme Command of the German Navy | year = 1940 | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/egenproc.pdf | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This defeated the Poles, although they suspected some sort of bigram substitution.

The procedure for the naval sending operator was as follows. First they selected a trigram from the K-Book, say YLA. They then looked in the appropriate columns of the K-Book and selected another trigram, say YVT, and wrote it in the boxes at the top of the message form: 
{| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|- 
| align="center" | . ||align="center" |  Y ||align="center" |  V || align="center" | T 
|-
| align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | .
|} 
They then filled in the "dots" with any letters, giving say:
{| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|- 
| align="center" | Q ||align="center" |  Y ||align="center" |  V || align="center" | T 
|-
| align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | G
|}
Finally they looked up the vertical pairs of letters in the Bigram Tables

and wrote down the resultant pairs, UB, LK, RS and PW which were transmitted as two four letter groups at the start and end of the enciphered message. The receiving operator performed the converse procedure to obtain the message key for setting his Enigma rotors.

As well as these ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures being much more secure than those of the German Army and Air Force, the German Navy Enigma introduced three more rotors (VI, VII and VIII), early in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of three rotors from eight meant that there were a total of 336 possible permutations of rotors and their positions.

Alan Turing decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because "no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. II Para. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He established [[Hut 8]] with [[Peter Twinn]] and two "girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing used the indicators and message settings for traffic from 1–8 May 1937 that the Poles had worked out, and some very elegant deductions to diagnose the complete indicator system. After the messages were deciphered they were translated for transmission to the Admiralty in Hut 4.

====German Navy 3-rotor Enigma====
The first break of wartime traffic was in December 1939, into signals that had been intercepted in November 1938, when only three rotors and six plugboard leads had been in use.&lt;ref name = MahonP22&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used "Forty Weepy Weepy" cribs.

A captured German ''Funkmaat'' ("radio operator") named Meyer had revealed that numerals were now spelt out as words. EINS, the German for "one", was present in about 90% of  genuine German Navy messages. An EINS catalogue was compiled consisting of the encipherment of EINS at all 105,456 rotor settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. II Para. 21&lt;/ref&gt; These were compared with the ciphertext, and when matches were found, about a quarter of them yielded the correct plaintext. Later this process was automated in Mr Freeborn's section using [[Unit record equipment|Hollerith equipment]]. When the ground key was known, this EINS-ing procedure could yield three bigrams for the tables that were then gradually assembled.&lt;ref name = MahonP22 /&gt;

Further progress required more information from German Enigma users. This was achieved through a succession of ''pinches'', the capture of Enigma parts and codebooks. The first of these was on 12 February 1940, when rotors VI and VII, whose wiring was at that time unknown, were captured from the {{GS|U-33|1936|6}}, by minesweeper {{HMS|Gleaner|J83|6}}.

On 26 April 1940, the Narvik-bound German patrol boat ''VP2623'', disguised as a Dutch trawler named ''Polares'', was captured by {{HMS|Griffin|H31|6}}. This yielded an instruction manual, codebook sheets and a record of some transmissions, which provided complete cribs. This confirmed that Turing's deductions about the trigram/bigram process were correct and allowed a total of six days' messages to be broken, the last of these using the first of the bombes.&lt;ref name = MahonP22 /&gt; However, the numerous possible rotor sequences, together with a paucity of usable cribs, made the methods used against the Army and Air Force Enigma messages of very limited value with respect to the Navy messages.

At the end of 1939, Turing extended the [[Clock (cryptography)|clock method]] invented by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Jerzy Różycki]]. Turing's method became known as "[[Banburismus]]". Turing said that at that stage "I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banburismus used large cards printed in Banbury (hence the Banburismus name) to discover correlations and a statistical scoring system to determine likely rotor orders (''Walzenlage'') to be tried on the bombes. The practice conserved scarce bombe time and allowed more messages to be attacked. In practice, the 336 possible rotor orders could be reduced to perhaps 18 to be run on the bombes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} "Background" Para. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the bigrams was essential for Banburismus, and building up the tables took a long time. This lack of visible progress led to [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], head of the Naval Section, to write on 21 August 1940 to [[Edward Travis]], Deputy Director of Bletchley Park: {{quote|"I'm worried about Naval Enigma. I've been worried for a long time, but haven't liked to say as much... Turing and Twinn are like people waiting for a miracle, without believing in miracles..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schemes for capturing Enigma material were conceived including, in September 1940, [[Operation Ruthless]] by Lieutenant Commander [[Ian Fleming]] (author of the [[James Bond]] novels). When this was cancelled, Birch told Fleming that "Turing and Twinn came to me like undertakers cheated of a nice corpse..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Batey|2008|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major advance came through [[Operation Claymore]], a [[British Commandos|commando]] raid on the [[Lofoten Islands]] on 4 March 1941. The German [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Krebs'' was captured, including the complete Enigma keys for February, but no bigram tables or K-book. However, the material was sufficient to reconstruct the bigram tables by "EINS-ing", and by late March they were almost complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banburismus then started to become extremely useful. Hut 8 was expanded and moved to 24-hour working, and a crib room was established. The story of Banburismus for the next two years was one of improving methods, of struggling to get sufficient staff, and of a steady growth in the relative and absolute importance of cribbing as the increasing numbers of bombes made the running of cribs ever faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. III Para. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Of value in this period were further "pinches" such as those from the [[German weather ship Lauenburg#The weather ships and Enigma|German weather ships]] ''München'' and ''Lauenburg'' and the submarines {{GS|U-110|1940|2}} and {{GS|U-559||2}}.

Despite the introduction of the 4-rotor Enigma for Atlantic U-boats, the analysis of traffic enciphered with the 3-rotor Enigma proved of immense value to the Allied navies. Banburismus was used until July 1943, when it became more efficient to use the many more bombes that had become available.

====M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)====
[[Image:Bletchley Park Naval Enigma IMG 3604.JPG|thumb|The German Navy 4-rotor Enigma machine (M4) which was introduced for U-boat traffic on 1 February 1942.]]
On 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages to and from Atlantic U-boats, which Bletchley Park called '"Shark," became significantly different from the rest of the traffic, which they called "Dolphin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. III Para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

This was because a new Enigma version had been brought into use. It was a development of the [[3-rotor Enigma]] with the reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a thin reflector. Eventually, there were two fourth-position rotors that were called Beta and Gamma and two thin reflectors, Bruno and Caesar which could be used in any combination. These rotors were not advanced by the rotor to their right, in the way that rotors I to VIII were.

The introduction of the [[fourth rotor]] did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.

This major challenge could not be met by using existing methods and resources for a number of reasons.
# The work on the Shark cipher would have to be independent of the continuing work on messages in the Dolphin cipher.
# Solving Shark keys on 3-rotor bombes would have taken 50 to 100 times as long as an average Air Force or Army job.
# U-boat cribs at this time were extremely poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. III Para. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

It seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. This was an immense problem and it gave a great deal of trouble. Work on a high speed machine had been started by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams|Wynn-Williams]] of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|TRE]] late in 1941 and some nine months later [[Harold Keen]] of BTM started work independently. Early in 1942, Bletchley Park were a long way from possessing a high speed machine of any sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after a long period of being unable to decipher U-boat messages, a source of cribs was found. This was the [[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignale (short signals)]], a code which the German navy used to minimize the duration of transmissions, thereby reducing the risk of being located by [[high-frequency direction finding]] techniques. The messages were only 22 characters long and were used to report sightings of possible Allied targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Breaking of German Naval Enigma: U Boat Contact Signals | series = Codes and Ciphers in the Second World War: The history, science and engineering of cryptanalysis in World War II | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig10.htm | accessdate = 1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the code book had been captured from {{GS|U-110|1940|2}} on 9 May 1941. A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the ''Wetterkurzschlüssel'', (Weather Short Code Book). A copy of this had been captured from {{GS|U-559||2}} on 29 or 30 October 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|pp=341–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; These short signals had been used for deciphering 3-rotor Enigma messages and it was discovered that the new rotor had a neutral position at which it, and its matching reflector, behaved just like a 3-rotor Enigma reflector. This allowed messages enciphered at this neutral position to be deciphered by a 3-rotor machine, and hence deciphered by a standard bombe. Deciphered Short Signals provided good material for bombe menus for Shark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular deciphering of U-boat traffic restarted in December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American ''bombes''===
{{Further2|[[Bombe#|US Navy Bombe]] and [[Bombe#|US Army Bombe]]}}
Unlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain's side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration amongst the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit.

In February 1941, Captain [[Abraham Sinkov]] and Lieutenant [[Leo Rosen]] of the US Army, and Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier of the US Navy, arrived at Bletchley Park, bringing, amongst other things, a replica of the [[Purple (cipher machine)|'Purple' cipher machine]] for Bletchley Park's Japanese section in [[Hut 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio direction finding unit and many documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including a "paper Enigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobsen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main American response to the 4-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain. Colonel [[John Tiltman]], who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office (OP-20-G) in April 1942 and recognised America's vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full [[blueprint]]s and wiring diagrams received by US Navy Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilcox|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for a full, $2 million, Navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.

[[Image:US-bombe.jpg|thumb|US Navy bombe. It contained 16 four-rotor Enigma-equivalents and was much faster than the British bombe.]]
Commander Edward Travis, Deputy Director and [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With [[Carl Frederick Holden]], US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have "a stronger claim than [[1943 BRUSA Agreement|BRUSA]] to being the forerunner of the [[UK–USA Security Agreement|UKUSA Agreement]]," being the first agreement "to establish the special [[Signals intelligence|Sigint]] relationship between the two countries," and "it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|1999|pp=187–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established a relationship of "full collaboration" between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Corporation]] (NCR) in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. This established the [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory]]. Engineering development was led by NCR's [[Joseph Desch]], a brilliant inventor and engineer. He had already been working on electronic counting devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Desch | first = Joseph R. | author-link = Joseph Desch | title = 1942 Research Report | date = 21 January 1942 | url = http://www.daytoncodebreakers.org/wp-content/uploads/42rep.pdf | accessdate = 20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Turing, who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|c. 1941|pp=341–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bletchley Park Text: November 1942: Departure of Alan Turing from BP | url = http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-demo/mobile/sms_categories_xml.py? | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as [[Banburismus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.

The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon, these bombes were more available than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work.&lt;ref Name="Welchman97p135" &gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.&lt;ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /&gt; In Alexander's "Cryptographic History of Work on German Naval Enigma", he wrote as follows.
{{blockquote|When the Americans began to turn out bombes in large numbers there was a constant interchange of signal - cribs, keys, message texts, cryptographic chat and so on. This all went by cable being first encyphered on the combined Anglo-American cypher machine, [[Combined Cipher Machine|C.C.M.]] Most of the cribs being of operational urgency rapid and efficient communication was essential and a high standard was reached on this; an emergency priority signal consisting of a long crib with crib and message text repeated as a safeguard against corruption would take under an hour from the time we began to write the signal out in Hut 8 to the completion of its decyphering in Op. 20 G. As a result of this we were able to use the Op. 20 G bombes almost as conveniently as if they had been at one of our outstations 20 or 30 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|c. 1945}} Ch. VIII para. 11&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The US Army also produced a version of a bombe. It was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with [[Bell Labs]] on 30 September 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2004|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not.&lt;ref Name="Welchman97p135"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /&gt; The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately {{convert|7|ft|m}}  long {{convert|8|ft|m}} high and {{convert|6|in|mm}} wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons.&lt;ref Name=WengerWilcoxP51 &gt;{{Harvnb|Wenger|1945|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.&lt;ref Name=WengerWilcoxP52 &gt;{{Harvnb|Wenger|1945|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German suspicions===
The German navy was concerned that Enigma could be compromised. Key schedules were printed in water-soluble inks so they could not be salvaged.&lt;ref name="Kahn 1991 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The navy policed what its operators did and disciplined them when errors that could compromise the cipher were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The navy minimized its exposure. For example, Enigma machines were not carried by ships that might be captured or run aground.  When ships were lost in circumstances where they might be salvaged, the Germans investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After investigating some losses in 1940, Germany changed some message indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1940, the British [[Battles of Narvik|sank eight German destroyers in Norway]]. The Germans concluded that it was unlikely that the British were reading Enigma.&lt;ref name="Kahn 1991 201"/&gt;

In May 1941, the British deciphered some messages that gave the location of some supply ships for the [[German battleship Bismarck|battleship ''Bismarck'']] and the [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|cruiser ''Prinz Eugen'']]. As part of the ''[[Operation Rheinübung]]'' commerce raid, the Germans had assigned five tankers, two supply ships, and two scouts to support the warships.  After the ''Bismarck'' was sunk, the British directed its forces to sink the supporting ships ''Belchen'', ''Esso Hamburg'', ''Egerland'', and some others.  The Admiralty specifically did not target the tanker ''Gedania'' and the scout ''Gonzenheim'' figuring that sinking so many ships within one week would indicate to Germany that Britain was reading Enigma.  However, by chance, British forces found those two ships and sank them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Germans investigated, but concluded Enigma had not been breached by either seizures or brute force cryptanalysis.  Nevertheless, the Germans took some steps to make Enigma more secure. Grid locations (an encoded latitude and longitude) were further disguised using digraph tables and a numeric offset.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-boats were given their own network, ''Triton'', to minimize the chance of a cryptanalytic attack.

In August 1941, the British captured {{GS|U-570||2}}.  The Germans concluded the crew would have destroyed the important documents, so the cipher was safe.  Even if the British had captured the materials intact and could read Enigma, the British would lose that ability when the keys changed on 1 November.&lt;ref name="Kahn 1991 206"&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Germany realized that convoys were avoiding its wolfpacks, it did not attribute that ability to reading Enigma traffic.  Instead, [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] thought that Britain was using radar and direction finding.&lt;ref name="Kahn 1991 206"/&gt;  The ''Kriegsmarine'' continued to increase the number of networks to avoid superimposition attacks on Enigma. At the beginning of 1943, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had 13 networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kriegsmarine'' also improved the Enigma.  On 1 February 1942, it started using the four-rotor Enigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The improved security meant that convoys no longer had as much information about the whereabouts of wolfpacks, and were therefore less able to avoid areas where they would be attacked. The increased success of wolfpack attacks following the strengthening of the encrypytion might have have given the Germans a clue that the previous Enigma codes had been broken. However, that recognition did not happen because other things changed at the same time, the United States had entered the war and Dönitz had sent U-boats to raid the US East Coast where there were lots of easy targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, Dönitz was worried that the Allies were reading Enigma. Germany's own cryptanalysis of Allied communications showed surprising accuracy in its estimates of wolfpack sizes. It was concluded, however, that Allied direction finding was the source. The Germans also recovered a [[cavity magnetron]] from a downed British bomber. The conclusion was that the Enigma was secure. The Germans were still suspicious, so each submarine got its own key net in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|pp=260–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945, almost all German Enigma traffic (Wehrmacht military; comprising the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]], Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe; and German intelligence and security services like the Abwehr, SD, etc.) could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ferris|2005|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; They openly discussed their plans and movements, handing the Allies huge amounts of information, not all of which was used effectively. For example, Rommel's actions at [[Battle of Kasserine Pass|Kasserine Pass]] were clearly foreshadowed in decrypted Enigma traffic, but the information was not properly appreciated by the Americans.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

After the war, Allied [[TICOM]] project teams found and detained a considerable number of German cryptographic personnel.{{sfn|Rezabek|2017}} Among the things learned was that German cryptographers, at least, understood very well that Enigma messages might be read; they knew Enigma was not unbreakable.{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}} They just found it impossible to imagine anyone going to the immense effort required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bamford|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abwehr personnel who had worked on [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish cryptography]] and Russian traffic were interned at [[Rosenheim]] around May 1945, they were not at all surprised that Enigma had been broken, only that someone had mustered all the resources in time to actually do it. Admiral [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] had been advised that a cryptanalytic attack was the least likely of all security problems.

==Since World War II==
Modern computers can be used to solve Enigma, using a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|Weierud|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also projects to decrypt some remaining messages using [[distributed computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=M4 Message Breaking Project |url=http://www.bytereef.org/m4_project.html |accessdate=16 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefan Krah]] led an effort in Germany to crack three messages intercepted in 1942 by {{HMS|Hurricane|H06|6}}; the messages were published by Ralph Erskine in a 1995 letter to ''Cryptologia''.  Two of these messages were cracked in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Blenford |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4763854.stm |title=Online amateurs crack Nazi codes |date=2006-03-02 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4808882.stm |title=Enigma project cracks second code |date=2006-03-15 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final one was deciphered in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.enigma.hoerenberg.com/index.php?cat=M4%20Project%202006&amp;page=Rasch%20Message |first=Dan |last=Girard |title=Solution of the last of the HMS Hurricane intercepts |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2018, the Enigma@home project is working on Enigma M4 message Nachricht P1030680, which was sent from [[U-534]] on May 1, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://enigma.hoerenberg.com/index.php?cat=Unbroken |title= Rare unbroken Enigma radio messages - P1030680 - Unbroken Enigma message (U534 - 01.

'''Donna J. Kossy''' (born September 8, 1957) is a US writer, [[zine]] publisher, and online used book dealer based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Specializing in the history of "forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas",&lt;ref name=Kossy1998/&gt; which she calls "crackpotology and kookology",&lt;ref name=Kossy1998/&gt; she is better known for her books ''Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief'' (1994, featuring the first biography of Francis E. Dec) and ''Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes'' (2001). Kossy was also the founder and curator of the Kooks Museum (1996–1999, online), and the editor-publisher of the magazine ''Book Happy'' (1997–2002, about "weird and obscure books"&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt;).

Described by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' as "an expert on [[kook (person)|kook]]s [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects",&lt;ref name=VanBakel1995/&gt; Kossy wrote books reviewed in publications ranging from ''[[Fortean Times]]'' to ''[[New Scientist]]''. Journalist [[Jonathan Vankin]] named her "the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks",&lt;ref name=Vankin1996/&gt; and writer [[Bruce Sterling]] noted that she "boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers and philosophers who were or are completely nuts".&lt;ref name=Turnaround-Kooks/&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
Donna J. Kossy was born in 1957.&lt;ref name=Gale2007&gt;Gale 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She started doing [[zine]]s in [[sixth grade]],&lt;ref name=Zines1997&gt;Zines 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; co-editing ''Kid Stuff'' with a friend: "It had gossip, fashions, poetry, jokes and even movie reviews. It sold for 5 cents. My mom typed it up and Xeroxed it at work!"&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt;  After graduating college in 1979, Kossy became involved in punk culture via collage art, color xerox postcards and mail art.

Kossy eventually became a computer programmer,&lt;ref name=VanBakel1995&gt;Van Bakel 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but also published zines because "Publishing is power, pure and simple",&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt; and turned "author and folklorist."&lt;ref name=VanBakel1995/&gt;

===Adult life===
At one time, Kossy was the housemate of fellow zine maker [[Pagan Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Harvey (1996). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/kennedy.html?pg=2 "Zine Queen: Pagan Kennedy on zines in the age of Web" (p. 2)], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Issue 4.01, January 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; She attuned Chicago writer [[Dan Kelly (writer)|Dan Kelly]] to cult "kook" [[Francis E. Dec]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Kelly (writer)|Kelly, Dan]] (2005). [http://www.chicagojournal.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=123&amp;TM=52420.3 "I've grown accustomed to your rants"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144208/http://www.chicagojournal.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=123&amp;TM=52420.3 |date=July 8, 2011 }}, ''[[Chicago Journal]]'', February 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, she was part of the ''[[Processed World (magazine)|Processed World]]'' (PW) magazine, then romantically involved with anti-PW and ex-[[SubGenius]] [[post-left anarchist|anarchist]] [[Bob Black]]&lt;ref name=Black1989&gt;[[Bob Black|Black, Bob]] (1989). [http://www.inspiracy.com/black/bomb.html "Bomb 'Em If They Can't Take a Joke"], 1989, reprinted at www.inspiracy.com/black (from the other side, also [http://www.subgenius.com/subg-digest/v0/0189.html reprinted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422192056/http://www.subgenius.com/subg-digest/v0/0189.html |date=April 22, 2009 }} and [http://www.subgenius.com/subg-digest/v0/0197.html discussed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422192102/http://www.subgenius.com/subg-digest/v0/0197.html |date=April 22, 2009 }} at [[SubGenius.com]])&lt;/ref&gt; until 1987, moving with him to [[Boston]] in 1985.

In 1989, research for her ''Kooks Magazine'' led Kossy to abandon much of her other work.&lt;ref name=Factsheet52/&gt; She is now married to Ken DeVries (''a.k.a.'' Orton Nenslo), also a member of the Church of the SubGenius and contributor to their books, who provided some illustrations for her books and some articles for her website.

==Works==

===''False Positive'' (1984–1988)===
In 1984, Kossy started publishing ''False Positive'' (1984–1988), a Xeroxed [[zine]] which ran for eleven issues. Each issue focused on one topic (such as technology, sex, Japan, cars, crime, kooks, food &amp; drugs) and featured related book excerpts, satire, collages, drawings, etc.&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt;

The zine and Kossy were quoted by [[Discordianism]] co-founder [[Kerry Thornley]] (alias Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst) in his 1991 foreword to the 5th edition of the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Kerry Thornley|Thornley, Kerry]] (1991). [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia/intro5.html "Fifth Edition Introduction"], in ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', January 23, 1991, online copy at www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia&lt;/ref&gt; reprinting the "Manifesto of the Artistic Elite of the Midwest". Kossy said that her "career as a crackpotologist"&lt;ref name=Kossy-Ordering&gt;Kossy, "Ordering Information".&lt;/ref&gt; started there with the "Kooks Pages" within each issue and the two special all-kooks issues.

===''Kooks Magazine'' (1988–1991)===
In 1988&lt;!--1988 not 1989, see Biblio and Sources--&gt;, Kossy started publishing ''Kooks Magazine'' (1988–1991), now using offset printing and running for eight issues. A spinoff of the kooks pages of her zine,&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt; it was in line with the 1988 book ''[[High Weirdness by Mail]]''&lt;ref name=VanBakel1995/&gt; by [[SubGenius]] co-founder Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] (who later praised&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Stang|Stang, Ivan]]. [http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/bulldada/X0030_NT2LATE2.TXT.html "The Best Book on Real KOOKS"], www.subgenius.com&lt;/ref&gt; the collected book) and featured obscure "[[kook (person)|kook]]s" as well as some better-documented "[[crank (person)|crank]]s" such as reclusive [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]]&lt;ref&gt;Ditko Fever. [http://www.ditko-fever.com/magskooks.html "Kooks Magazine #8"], www.ditko-fever.com, consulted in March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in its final issue (#8, November 1991).

In ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', the zine magazine, founder-editor [[Mike Gunderloy]] described it as "A collection of bizarre literature and semi-scholarly research on kooks: those folks who have all the answers that science and the authorities have been trying to suppress. This issue features [...] progress towards a theory of [[kookdom]]."&lt;ref name=Factsheet32&gt;[[Mike Gunderloy|Gunderloy, Mike]] (1989). "The Original Donna Kossy's Kooks Magazine #4" (notice), ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', No. 32, October 1989, {{ISSN|0890-6823}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; then reported one year later that it "keeps getting better; you can spend hours lost in the worldviews here."&lt;ref name=Factsheet38&gt;[[Mike Gunderloy|Gunderloy, Mike]] (1990). "Kooks Magazine #6" (notice), ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', No. 38, October 1990, {{ISSN|0890-6823}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[SubGenius]] and writer [[Richard Kadrey]] described it as "indispensable for anyone interested in the real bleeding edge of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kadrey|Kadrey, Richard]] (1998). [http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/kooks.htm "Kooks" (review)], CyberCulture Zone: Resources: Zines, ''[[Street Tech]]'', www.streettech.com, copyright 1998 – Original date and place of publication unclear: issue #5 is mentioned as if recent, which would be around 1990–1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Research for the topic even led Kossy to attend&lt;!--(Source oddly says "in 1994" but at that time the zine was ended and the book about to be printed.)--&gt; a recruitment meeting of [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] (when it was calling itself Human Individual Metamorphosis),&lt;ref name=Bagato2002/&gt; the group that ended in a 1997 mass suicide.

===''Kooks'' (1994)===
In 1994, [[Feral House]] published Kossy's first book, ''Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief'', an anthology containing updated articles from her zine along with articles written exclusively for the book, with the cover illustration painted by her husband. Organized into seven parts (Religion, Science, Metaphysics, Politics, Conspiracy, Enigmas; plus Outtakes in the 2nd ed.), it documented the rants and ravings of "kooks" such as [[Richard Brothers]] ([[Anglo-Israelism]] alias [[British Israelism]]), Charles E. Buon (God's Envoy to the U.S.A.), Ray Crabtree (The Philosopher King), the first biography of [[Francis E. Dec]] (Your Only Hope against the Gangster Computer God), Professor [[Arnold Ehret]] (Mucusless Diet Healing System), [[Joe Gould (Bohemian)|Joe Gould]] alias Professor Seagull (The Longest Book Ever Written), [[Jim and Lila Green]] ([[Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps]]), Hillman Holcomb (Well Regulated Militia of Christian Technocracy), Les U. Knight ([[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]), [[alien abductee]] artist [[Paul Laffoley]] (Third Generation Lunatic Fringe), [[Alfred Lawson]] ([[Lawsonomy]]: The Base for Absolute Knowledge), David Linton (How Men Can Have Babies), [[Emil Matalik]] (World/U.S. Presidential Candidate Since 1964), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s crank files (The [[Archive of Useless Research]]), [[Rose Mokry]] (Jewish Poisoners Are the Sole Producers of All the Diseases, Sudden Deaths and Birth Defects), Dr. [[Cyrus Teed]] (not Cyrus Tweed) alias Koresh ([[Koreshanity]]: We Actually Live [[Hollow Earth theory|on the Inside of the Earth]]), black supremacist Dwight York alias [[Malachi Z. York]] et al. ([[Ansaaru Allah Community]] of [[Nuwaubianism]]), etc.

The book was praised as "a rich compendium of looniness"&lt;ref name=Feral-Kooks&gt;Feral House, "Kooks", citing [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/59614921.html?dids=59614921:59614921&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+1994&amp;author=Tom+Frick&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=NONFICTION&amp;pqatl=google this September 18, 1994 book review].&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "indispensable for anyone interested in the real cutting edge of thought"&lt;ref&gt;[[Powell's Books]], [http://www.powells.com/biblio/0922915199 "Kooks" (sale page)]&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and a "delight"&lt;ref name=Bennett2001/&gt; by ''[[Fortean Times]]''. In ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', the new editor [[R. Seth Friedman]] recommended it with, "I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. [...] Don't miss out on this book."&lt;ref name=Factsheet52&gt;[[R. Seth Friedman|Friedman, R. Seth]]&lt;!--(Review tagged "RSF" = R. Seth Friedman)--&gt; (1994). "Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief" (review), ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', No. 52, July 1994, {{ISSN|0890-6823}}, p. 44: "I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. I was first introduced to the intriguing phenomena of kooks in her first zine ''False Positive''. &lt;!--Quote used to source Life too:--&gt;In 1989 she abandoned much of her other work in order to produce ''Kooks Magazine'', completely devoted to documenting the ideas of people whose visions of the world don't correlate with the rest of us. It will take most people months to get through this entire 253-page volume just as it took her years to create it. [...] Don't miss out on this book. It's the one chance you'll get to find out how 'men can have babies' and if JFK is still alive."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Kinney]], publisher of ''[[Gnosis (magazine)|Gnosis Magazine]]'', found it "Compulsively readable. The 'kooks' collected in this volume are our true American originals and Donna Kossy chronicles their jaw-dropping messages with a rare mix of objectivity, sympathy, and wit."&lt;ref name=Kossy-Gift&gt;Kossy 1999, "The Kooks Museum Gift Shoppe".&lt;/ref&gt; And a 1995 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' review described Kossy as "an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects."&lt;ref name=VanBakel1995/&gt;

===''Kooks Outtakes'' (1995)===
In 1995, ''Kooks Outtakes'' followed its namesake, being a 36-page supplement of material Kossy had left out for reasons of space; it was later merged with the second edition of the book in 2001, which the editor of ''Ink 19'' praised, noting that "Kossy's style is direct and surprisingly unjudgemental. [...] Kossy is quite systematic in her research, and margin comments abound, along with a lush bibliography. This is serious stuff."&lt;ref&gt;Koss, Ian (2001). [http://www.ink19.com/issues/august2001/streaks/kooks.html "Kooks, by Donna Kossy" (review)], ''[[Ink 19]]'', August 2001, www.ink19.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kooks Museum'' (1996–1999)===
In 1996, Kossy founded and curated on her web site the ''Kooks Museum'' (an online summary and extension of her book ''Kooks'', updated until mid-1999 when it was discontinued&lt;ref name=Kossy-NYAQ/&gt; and kept as an archive), explaining: "As curator and founder of the first Kooks Museum in history I am fulfilling a half-life-long goal of housing kook ideas from all over the world under one crumbling roof. [...] The point of all this excess is neither to debunk nor to proselytize. Rather, my intent is to document and study the vast cornucopia of forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas, with all due consideration to social and cultural context. Nor do I think all ideas are equally valid. Rather, I try to be both open-minded to and skeptical of them."&lt;ref name=Kossy1998&gt;Kossy 1998, "Introduction to the Kooks Museum".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum was listed in the ''[[MetroActive]]'' guide to "the most interesting, unusual, weird or otherwise alternative sites on the World Wide Web"&lt;!--http://www.metroactive.com/cyber/node.html--&gt; by journalist and writer on conspiracies [[Jonathan Vankin]], who named Kossy "the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks."&lt;ref name=Vankin1996&gt;Vankin 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Book Happy'' (1997–2002)===
In 1997, Kossy started editing and publishing ''Book Happy'' (1997–2002), a printed magazine which ran for seven issues. Written by Kossy and others (recurrent contributors includes&lt;!--alphabetically, at least 2 articles--&gt; Greg Bishop, Ken DeVries, Dan Howland, [[Dan Kelly (writer)|Dan Kelly]], John Marr, Chris Mikul, David C. Morrison, Chip Rowe, Brian Tucker, Robert Tucker), it was dedicated to reviewing "weird and obscure books".&lt;ref name=Zines1997/&gt;

The magazine was complemented by her web site (later becoming its domain name) and the formation of Book Happy Booksellers (&lt;ref name=Kossy-NYAQ&gt;Kossy, "Not Yet Asked Questions".&lt;/ref&gt;) an online used book business specializing in unusual and hard-to-find items, with inventory listed on various book listing sites including Abebooks, Biblio, Alibris, Choosebooks and others. ''Book Happy'' was reviewed positively by English artist [[Mark Pawson]] (creator of ''[[Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book]]'') in a 1999 review for the British cultural magazine ''[[Variant (magazine)|Variant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Pawson|Pawson, Mark]] (1999). {{cite web |url=http://www.variant.randomstate.org/9texts/MarkPawson.html |title="Comic and Zine reviews" |accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040121180706/http://www.variant.randomstate.org/9texts/MarkPawson.html |archivedate=January 21, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}, ''[[Variant magazine]]'' (Glasgow, Scotland), {{ISSN|0954-8815}}, vol. 2, no. 9 (Winter 1999/2000), online copy at www.variant.randomstate.org (www.variant.org.uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Strange Creations'' (2001)===
In 2001, Feral House published Kossy's second full-length book, ''Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes'' (right after reprinting ''Kooks'' in an expanded edition). As of August 1998, Kossy had already announced the manuscript for her second book as being finished (with a tentative title balancing between "Aberrant Anthropology" and "Nazis, Saucers and Aquatic Apes")&lt;ref name=Kossy1998/&gt; and its publication at Feral House scheduled for "Fall, 1999";&lt;ref name=Kossy1998/&gt; it would however be two more years before the actual release.

Organized into seven parts (Extraterrestrial Origins, De-evolution, Race, Eugenics, Creationism, The Aquatic Ape Theory, and Urantia/Szukalski/H.I.M.), the book documented the [[fringe science|fringe]] and [[pseudoscientific]] theories of "[[crackpot (person)|crackpot]]s" such as David Barclay (mankind as dinosaurs pets), [[Helena Blavatsky]] (The [[Seven Root Races]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]), Darwin's cousin [[Francis Galton]] (inventor of [[eugenics]] against [[regression toward the mean]]), [[Henry H. Goddard]] (inventor of [[moronism]] with [[The Kallikak Family]]), [[Madison Grant]] ([[Nordicism]] and [[scientific racism]]), Finnvald Hedin (The Thorians), [[Brinsley Le Poer Trench]] ([[UFOs]] from [[Hollow Earth]]), slave trader Edward Long ([[Polygenism]]: Man Comes From God, Negroes Come From Apes&lt;!--Jamaica p.358+365--&gt;), [[Oscar Kiss Maerth]] ([[The Beginning Was the End]]: ape brain cannibalism), [[Alfred W. McCann]] ([[creationism]]), [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]] ([[aquatic ape hypothesis]]), [[Raël]] (creation by extraterrestrials), B. H. Shadduck ([[de-evolution]]), [[Zecharia Sitchin]] ([[ancient astronauts]]), [[Lothrop Stoddard]] ([[Pan-Aryanism]] and [[racial purity]]), [[Stanisław Szukalski]] ([[Zermatism]]: post-deluge Easter Island vs. Yetis), the ''[[Urantia Book]]'' ([[intelligent design]] by Life Carriers), [[George Van Tassel]] ([[Space Brothers (aliens)|Space Brothers]] aliens), [[Erich von Däniken]] ([[Ancient astronaut theory|Ancient Astronauts]] from the [[Chariots of the Gods?]]), etc.

The book was praised from ''[[Fortean Times]]''&lt;ref name=Bennett2001&gt;Bennet 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Booklist]]''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0922915652 "Strange Creations"] at [[Amazon.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; and from the ''[[Washington City Paper]]''&lt;ref name=Bagato2002&gt;Bagato 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Counterpoise]]''.&lt;ref name=Feral-Strange&gt;Feral House, "Strange Creations".&lt;/ref&gt; In a mixed review, the ''[[New Scientist]]'' noted that "Donna Kossy's ''Strange Creatures'' [sic!] is about people who have spent rather more time on these problems than most, visiting some of the weirder reaches of the human imagination".&lt;ref name=Herbert2001&gt;Herbert, Roy (2001). [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17123075.800 "Where did we come from?" (book review)], ''[[New Scientist]]'' 2307:49, September 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; And Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] remarked: "To write entertainingly for 'nonkooks' about so-called kooks, crackpots, and possible visionaries requires walking a tightrope between tolerant understanding of 'outsider' psychology and graceful sarcasm, balancing both a solid grounding in the mainstream scientific paradigm, and a healthy distrust of the status quo."&lt;ref name=Kossy-Gift/&gt;

Science-fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]], who also touched upon online cranks in his essay "Electronic Text"&lt;!--Sourced at [[Bruce Sterling]] = http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.13--&gt;, commented that "Donna Kossy boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers, and philosophers who were or are completely nuts. ''Kooks'' ranks with such sociological classics as Mackay's ''Extraordinary Popular Delusions'' and Dudley's ''Mathematical Cranks''. This, for obvious reasons, is a book which every science fiction writer should possess."&lt;!--Full quote@--&gt;&lt;ref name=Kossy-Gift/&gt;&lt;!--First sentence@--&gt;&lt;ref name=Turnaround-Kooks&gt;Turnaround, "Kooks".&lt;/ref&gt; In her own words, Kossy has stated, "I seek not to debunk strange ideas, but to present them as a necessary segment of the full spectrum of human thought."&lt;ref&gt;Kossy in ''Strange Creations'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kossy is currently focused on her bookselling business and from November 2007 to September 2008 wrote a blog, "The Cutthroat World of Book Scouting" (http://bookhappy.easyjournal.com&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which chronicled her experiences in the book trade.

'''Folkways Records''' was a [[record label]] founded by [[Moses Asch]] that documented folk, world, and children's music. It was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1987 and is now part of [[Smithsonian Folkways]].

==History==
The Folkways Records &amp; Service Co. was founded by [[Moses Asch]] and [[Marian Distler]] in [[1948 in music|1948]] in [[New York City]]. [[Harold Courlander]] was editor of the Folkways Ethnic Library at the time and is credited with coming up with the name "Folkways" for the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Scherman, Tony | title=This Man Captured the True Sounds of a Whole World | work=Smithsonian | pages=118-119 | date=August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asch sought to record and document sounds and music from everywhere in the world. From 1948 until Asch's death in 1986, Folkways Records released 2,168 albums. In 1964, Asch helped [[MGM Records]] start Verve Folkways Records which evolved in 1967 into [[Verve Forecast Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA12&amp;dq=%22verve+folkways%22+%2B+%22Moe+Asch%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfwlTJO9M9e4nAer14ThBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22verve%20folkways%22%20%2B%20%22Moe%20Asch%22&amp;f=false "Verve/Folkways: Marriage of Folk and Pop"], [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] magazine, January 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The Folkways catalog includes traditional and contemporary music from around the world as well as poetry, spoken word, language instruction, and field recordings of people and nature. Folkways was an early supporter of [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Lead Belly]], who formed the center of the [[American folk music revival]].

Folkways influenced a generation of [[folk singers]] by releasing [[old-time music]] from the 1920s and 1930s, such as [[Dock Boggs]], [[Clarence Ashley]], and contemporary performers like the [[New Lost City Ramblers]]. The ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' appeared on Folkways, as did the [[The Country Blues|accompanying album]] to ''[[The Country Blues (book)|The Country Blues]]'' by [[Samuel Charters]]. Folkways was one of the earliest companies to release albums of [[world music]], including the ''Music of the World's Peoples'' collection edited by [[Henry Cowell]]. It also released many spoken word albums, and other unusual repertoire. The albums came with a pull-out leaflet containing extensive [[liner notes]].

==Smithsonian==
[[File:gangland rhythms.jpg|thumb|Gangland Rhythms LP cover]]
The Smithsonian Institution Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage in Washington, D.C. acquired Asch's Folkways recordings and business files after his death in 1986. This acquisition was initiated by [[Ralph Rinzler]] of the Smithsonian before Asch's death and completed by the Asch Family to ensure the sounds and artists would be preserved for future generations. As a result, it was agreed to continue Asch's policy that all of the 2,168 titles would stay in print indefinitely regardless of market sales. The Smithsonian Folkways website uses the internet to make the recordings available as streaming samples, [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free digital downloads in [[MP3]] and lossless [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] format, and on CDs via mail order.

A complete set of the Folkways recordings was also donated to the [[University of Alberta]] where Michael Asch, Moses Asch's son, was an anthropology professor. ''FolkwaysAlive'', a joint initiative between the University and the Smithsonian, is involved in digitization and archiving of the collection as well as maintaining a research center and sponsoring student research scholarships and an annual concert series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fwalive.ualberta.ca FolkwaysAlive website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkways.si.edu/explore_folkways/sounds_to_grow_on.aspx Smithsonian Folkways: Sounds to Grow On]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since acquiring Folkways, the Smithsonian has expanded Asch's collection by adding several other record labels, including [[Cook Records|Cook]], [[Monitor Records (New York)|Monitor]], [[Fast Folk]], [[Richard Dyer-Bennet|Dyer-Bennet]], and [[Paredon Records]]. They have released over 300 new recordings.

Smithsonian Folkways states that their mission "is the legacy of Moses Asch, who founded Folkways Records in 1948 to document 'people's music.'" They "are dedicated to supporting [[cultural diversity]] and increased understanding among peoples through the documentation, preservation, and dissemination of sound", and that "musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world." By making these recordings available, they intend to "strengthen people's engagement with their own cultural heritage and to enhance their awareness and appreciation of the cultural heritage of others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklife.si.edu/center/recordings.html Smithsonian Folkways website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smithsonian Folkways has produced or co-produced a number of radio series based on Folkways collections. "The Folkways Collection" and "Sounds to Grow On" are co-produced with [[CKUA Radio Network|CKUA]] radio; "Tapestry of the Times" was co-produced by [[WYPR]] radio; and "Sound Sessions" was produced by the Smithsonian and broadcast on [[WAMU]] radio. "Sounds to Grow On" is hosted by Michael Asch, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Alberta and the son of Moses Asch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">'''Frederick Thomas Elworthy''' (1830–1907) was an English philologist and antiquary.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Thomas Elworthy, woollen manufacturer, of [[Wellington, Somerset]], and his wife Jane, daughter of William Chorley of Quarm, near Dunster.
He was born at Wellington on 10 January 1830, and was educated at a private school at Denmark Hill. 
Though studious from boyhood, he did not enter on authorship until middle life.{{sfn|Hunt|1912}} 

He became eminent first as a [[philologist]] and later as a writer on folk-lore. 
His two books on the [[evil eye]] and kindred [[superstition]]s contain much curious information gathered during travels in Spain, Italy, and other countries, in the course of which he made perhaps the finest collection of charms, amulets, and such-like trinkets in existence; this collection was in the possession of his widow until her death, and was then bequeathed to the Somersetshire Archæological Society's museum at Taunton. 
He contributed to ''Archæologia,'' was the council of the [[Philological Society]], and in 1891-6 was editorial secretary of the [[Somersetshire Archæological Society]], for whose ''Proceedings,'' as well as for those of the Devonshire Association, he wrote some valuable papers.{{sfn|Hunt|1912}}

He was elected F.S.A. on 14 June 1900. 
He was a good linguist and possessed considerable skill as a draughtsman and as an artist in water-colours. He was a prominent churchman, and the erection of All Saints' Church, Wellington, was largely due to his liberality and exertions. 
He was a magistrate, a churchwarden, an active member of the Wellington school board, and a prominent freemason.{{sfn|Hunt|1912}}

After an illness which began in the summer of 1906 he died at his residence, Foxdown, Wellington, on 13 December 1907, and was buried in the churchyard of the parish church there.{{sfn|Hunt|1912}}

The '''Guggenheim Abu Dhabi''' is a planned [[art museum]], to be located in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. On July 8, 2006, the city of Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, announced it had signed an agreement with the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] in New York City to build a {{convert|30000|m2|ft2|adj=on}} Guggenheim Museum on [[Saadiyat Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/08/ap/entertainment/mainD8IO10580.shtml| title=Guggenheim to Build Museum in Abu Dhabi| last=Krane|first=Jim|date=July 8, 2006|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2008-09-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526015521/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/08/ap/entertainment/mainD8IO10580.shtml  |archivedate = 2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, it is planned to be the largest of the Guggenheim museums.  Architect [[Frank Gehry]] designed the building.  Work on the site began in 2011 but was soon suspended. As of 2018, no completion date is available, and construction is still suspended.  The museum collection is planned to reflect Islamic and middle-eastern culture.

The museum is part of a larger complex of arts and cultural institutions that is being built on Saadiyat Island intended to appeal to international tourists.

== Location ==
The museum is planned to be located on [[Saadiyat Island]], just offshore of the city of [[Abu Dhabi]]. The island's [[Saadiyat Island#Saadiyat Cultural District|Cultural District]] is planned to house the largest cluster of world-class cultural assets in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/143289.html|title=French Culture Minister heads delegation to UAE capital to seal Louvre Abu Dhabi operating framework|date=7 January 2008|publisher=AME Info|accessdate=2008-09-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030030206/http://www.ameinfo.com/143289.html|archivedate=30 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guggenheim building is part of a massive project to "create an exhibition space intended to turn this once-sleepy desert city along the Persian Gulf into an international arts capital and tourist destination."&lt;ref&gt;Fatah, Hassan.

== Contract ==
The Guggenheim stated in 2008 that "Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company ...will own the museum", while "[t]he Guggenheim Foundation will establish and manage" its program.&lt;ref name="GPR"/&gt; William Mack, Chair of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]], said: "It is with a keen sense of historical precedent and with an abiding commitment to cultural exchange as a bridge to international understanding that the foundation enters into this agreement to establish a Guggenheim museum in Abu Dhabi."&lt;ref name="GPR"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi|title=Abu Dhabi to build Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum|date=8 September 2008|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Dhabi's [[crown prince]], [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], indicated that the "signing represents the determination of the Abu Dhabi Government to create a world-class cultural destination for its residents and visitors.&lt;ref name="GPR" /&gt;

== Design and construction ==
The Guggenheim museum's design is by architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;Adam, Georgina.

The largest galleries will offer a grand scale for the display of large contemporary art installations.&lt;ref name=Secciones/&gt;  Parts of the building will be four stories tall with galleries stacked atop each other.&lt;ref name=Arcspace/&gt; The museum is intended to be a centerpiece in the island's plan for contemporary art and culture".&lt;ref&gt;Bharadwaj, Vinita.

As of 2014, Guggenheim curators have been collecting an international representation of art for the past five years.

==Human rights controversy==

Over 130 international artists urged a boycott of the new Guggenheim museum (as well as [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]]), citing reports, since 2009, of abuses of foreign construction workers on Saadiyat Island, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions and failure of companies to pay or reimburse the steep recruitment fees being charged to laborers.&lt;ref name="boycott"&gt;{{cite news| title=Abu Dhabi Guggenheim Faces Protest| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/arts/design/guggenheim-threatened-with-boycott-over-abu-dhabi-project.html| author=Nicolai Ouroussoff| date=16 March 2011| work=The New York Times| publisher= NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/04/20114342518230176.html|title=Artists urge Guggenheim boycott|date=April 3, 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Architectural Record]]'', Abu Dhabi has comprehensive labor laws to protect the workers, but they are not conscientiously implemented or enforced.&lt;ref name=Fixsen&gt;Fixsen, Anna.

He stated that the main issue then remaining was the recruitment fees charged to workers by agents who recruit them. Asked if the Guggenheim would refuse to proceed with the construction unless these issues were solved, he answered, "we have faith that there will be progress."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Lee.

In September 2014, the Guggenheim's architect, Gehry, commented that working with the Abu Dhabi officials to implement the law to improve the labor conditions at the museum's site is "a moral responsibility."&lt;ref name=Fixsen/&gt; He is encouraging the TDIC to build additional worker housing and proposes that the contractor cover the cost of the recruitment fees. In 2012, TDIC engaged [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] as an independent monitor, which issues reports every quarter. TDIC solicited bids by contractors in August 2014 and as of September 2014 was expected to hire a general contractor soon.  Labor lawyer Scott Horton told ''Architectural Record'' that he hopes the Guggenheim project will influence the treatment of workers on other Saadiyat sites and will "serve as a model for doing things right."&lt;ref name=Fixsen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Lee.

'''''Guinness World Records Primetime''''' (aka: ''Guinness Primetime'') is a TV show based on the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', and aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[television]] network from July 27, 1998 to October 4, 2001. It was hosted by [[Cris Collinsworth]] and [[Mark Thompson (TV)|Mark Thompson]] and reported on existing record-holders or on new record attempts.

These new record attempts included many unusual or bizarre categories such as a 300-pound tumor, squirting milk from one's eye, covering one's self with bees, sitting in a tub of snakes, regurgitating, burping, setting one's self on fire, eating metal, worms, and ketchup, kissing cobras, acting as a human speed bump, and entering a coffin full of cockroaches.  Most of these attempts never found their way into the Guinness Book.

'''Henry Clay Frick''' (December 19, 1849 – December 2, 1919) was an American [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialist]], [[financier]], [[Homestead Strike#Plans of Carnegie and Frick|union-buster]], and [[Patronage#Arts|art patron]]. He founded the H. C. Frick &amp; Company [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] manufacturing company, was chairman of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]], and played a major role in the formation of the giant [[U.S. Steel]] manufacturing concern. He also financed the construction of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Reading Company]],{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and had extensive real estate holdings in [[Pittsburgh]] and throughout the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. He later built the historic [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Henry Clay Frick House|Frick Mansion]] (now a landmark building in [[Manhattan]]), and upon his death donated his extensive collection of [[old master]] paintings and fine furniture to create the celebrated [[Frick Collection]] and art museum.  However, as a founding member of the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], he was also in large part responsible for the alterations to the [[South Fork Dam]] that caused its failure, leading to the catastrophic [[Johnstown Flood]].  His vehement opposition to unions also caused violent conflict, most notably in the [[Homestead strike|Homestead Strike]].

==Early life==
Frick was born in [[West Overton, Pennsylvania|West Overton]], [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States, a grandson of Abraham Overholt, the owner of the prosperous Overholt Whiskey distillery (see [[Old Overholt]]).&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Clay Frick Foundation Archives Finding Aid|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;type=simple;q1=Helen%20Clay%20Frick%20Foundation%20Archives;rgn=Entire%20Finding%20Aid;size=25;view=reslist;subview=standard;cc=ascead;sort=occur;start=1;didno=US-PPiU-ais200206;focusrgn=bioghist;byte=26655578|work=Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Frick's father, John W. Frick, was unsuccessful in business pursuits. Henry Clay Frick attended [[Otterbein College]] for one year, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="Founded"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/12/03/118239432.pdf "Founded His Fortune in the Panic of 1873"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, at 21 years old, Frick joined two cousins and a friend in a small partnership, using a [[beehive oven]] to turn [[coal]] into [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for use in steel manufacturing, and vowed to be a millionaire by the age of thirty. The company was called Frick Coke Company.&lt;ref name="emma"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/PublicationsoftheEmmaGoldmanPapers/samplebiographiesfromthedirectoryofindividuals.html|author1=Candace Falk |author2=Barry Pateman |author3=Jessica M. Moran |chapter=Sample short biographies |title=Emma Goldman: A Documentary History of the American Years, 1890–1901|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003 |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to loans from the family of lifelong friend [[Andrew W. Mellon]], by 1880, Frick bought out the partnership. The company was renamed H. C. Frick &amp; Company, employed 1,000 workers and controlled 80 percent of the coal output in Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt; operating coal mines in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] and [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette]] counties, where he also operated banks of beehive coke ovens.  Some of the brick and stone structures are still visible in both Fayette and Westmoreland Counties.

==H. C. Frick and Andrew Carnegie==
Shortly after marrying Adelaide Howard Childs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/about/henry_clay_frick.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235325/http://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/about/henry_clay_frick.php |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1881, Frick met [[Andrew Carnegie]] in [[New York City]] while the Fricks were on their honeymoon. This introduction would lead to an eventual partnership between H. C. Frick &amp; Company and [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and, eventually, to [[United States Steel]]. This partnership ensured that Carnegie's [[steel mill]]s had adequate supplies of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Frick became chairman of the company. Carnegie made multiple attempts to force Frick out of the company they had created by making it appear that the company had nowhere left to go and that it was time for Frick to retire. Despite the contributions Frick had made towards Andrew Carnegie's fortune, Carnegie disregarded him in many executive decisions including finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/peop/people/pa_hcf.htm|title=Henry Clay Frick - People of Pennsylvania|first=NSTATE, LLC,|last=www.n-state.com|date=|website=www.netstate.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Johnstown Flood==
At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Frick helped to found the exclusive [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  The charter members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were Benjamin Ruff; T. H. Sweat, Charles J. Clarke, Thomas Clark, Walter F. Fundenberg, Howard Hartley, Henry C. Yeager, J. B. White, Henry Clay Frick, E. A. Meyers, C. C. Hussey, D. R. Ewer, C. A. Carpenter, W. L. Dunn, W. L. McClintock, and A. V. Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Common Pleas. Charter of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. 1879-11-17. pg 7. Retrieved from the Digital Public Library of America, http://digitalcollections.powerlibrary.org/cdm/ref/collection/acacc-jtf/id/4958. (Accessed September 29, 2018.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania, and included among their number Frick’s best friend, [[Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and [[James Hay Reed]], as well as Frick's occasional business partner [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The club members made inadequate repairs to what was at that time the world's largest earthen [[dam]], behind which formed a private lake called [[Lake Conemaugh]]. Less than {{convert|20|mi|km}} downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown. Cambria Iron Company operated a large iron and steel work in Johnstown and its owner, Daniel J. Morrell, was concerned about the safety of the dam and the thoroughness of repairs made to it.  Morrell had even sent his own engineer to inspect the site but little was done in the long run to satisfy his concerns and the matter was largely dropped after Morrell's death in the mid-1880s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Poor maintenance, unusually high snow melt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889, resulting in the [[Johnstown Flood]]. Other sources blame a screen placed across the spillway by the club to prevent fish from escaping, as a cause, when debris accumulated during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glessnerhouse.org/story-of-a-house/2014/05/the-johnstown-flood-may-31-1889.html |title=The Johnstown Flood, May 31, 1889 |date=May 26, 2014 |website=glessnerhouse.org |publisher=Glessner House Museum |location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to [[Pittsburgh]], Frick and other members of the club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims, as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club’s members. With a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equalled that of the Mississippi River,[2] the flood killed 2,209 people[3] and caused US$17 million of damage (about $450 million in 2015 dollars). Although Cambria Iron's facilities were heavily damaged, they returned to full production within a year and a half.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Old Overholt whiskey==
In 1881, Frick, already wealthy, took control of his grandfather's whiskey company, [[Old Overholt]].&lt;ref name="Wondrich-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of America’s Oldest Whiskey|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/02/the-rise-fall-of-america-s-oldest-whiskey.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frick split ownership with [[Andrew Mellon]] and one Charles W. Mauck; each owned one-third of the company.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-1" /&gt; The family's whiskey company was a sentimental side business for Frick,&lt;ref name="Wondrich-1" /&gt; and was headquartered in Pittsburgh's [[Frick Building]].&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, although they retained ownership in the company.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=How Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey Lost Its Way|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/12/how-pennsylvania-rye-whiskey-lost-its-way.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Frick's death in 1919, he left his share of the company to Mellon.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt;

==Homestead strike==
{{Main article|Homestead Strike}}
[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]
Frick and Carnegie's partnership was strained over actions taken in response to the [[Homestead Steel Strike]], an 1892 [[labor strike]] at the Homestead Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, called by the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]].&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt; At Homestead, striking workers, some of whom were armed, had locked the company staff out of the factory and surrounded it with pickets. Frick was known for his anti-union policy and as negotiations were still taking place, he ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill "Fort Frick."  With the mill ringed by striking workers, [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton detectives&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt; assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) below Pittsburgh at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver with the object of removing the workers by force. Upon their landing, a large mêlée between workers and Pinkerton detectives ensued. Ten men were killed, nine of them workers, and there were seventy injuries.&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuchman"&gt;Tuchman 1996, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; The Pinkerton agents were thrown back, and the riot was ultimately quelled only by the intervention of 8,000 armed state militia under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[George R. Snowden]].&lt;ref name="Tuchman"/&gt; During the confrontation Frick issued an ultimatum to Homestead workers, which restated his refusal to speak with union representatives and threatened to have striking workers evicted from their homes.&lt;ref name="Tuchman"/&gt;

Among working-class Americans, Frick's actions against the strikers were condemned as excessive, and he soon became a target of even more union organizers. Because of this strike, people like Alan Petrucelli had thought that he is depicted as the [[Dives and Lazarus|"rich man"]] in [[Maxo Vanka]]'s murals in [[St. Nicholas Croatian Church]], but the Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka (which works to preserve the artwork) says it depicts [[Andrew Mellon]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrucelli, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
[[File:Berkman with Frick (1892).jpg|thumb|Berkman's attempt to assassinate Frick, as illustrated by W. P. Snyder in 1892, originally published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.]]

[[Alexander Berkman]] plotted to murder Frick. On July 23, 1892 Berkman, armed with a revolver and a sharpened steel file, entered Frick's office in downtown [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt;

Frick, realizing what was happening, attempted to rise from his chair while Berkman pulled a revolver and fired at nearly [[point-blank range]]. The bullet hit Frick in the left earlobe, penetrated his neck near the base of the skull, and lodged in his back. The impact knocked Frick down, and Berkman fired again, striking Frick for a second time in the neck and causing him to bleed extensively. Carnegie Steel vice president (later, president) [[John George Alexander Leishman]], who was with Frick, was then able to grab Berkman’s arm and prevented a third shot, probably saving Frick's life.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Frick was seriously wounded, but rose and (with the assistance of Leishman) tackled his assailant.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, 1992, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; All three men crashed to the floor, where Berkman managed to stab Frick four times in the leg with the pointed steel file before finally being subdued by other employees, who had rushed into the office.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Frick was back at work in a week; Berkman was charged and found guilty of attempted murder.  Berkman's actions in planning the assassination clearly indicated a premeditated intent to kill, and he was sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref name="emma" /&gt; Negative publicity from the attempted assassination resulted in the collapse of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, 1992, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,500 men lost their jobs, and most of the workers who stayed had their wages halved.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, 1992, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frick married Adelaide Howard Childs of Pittsburgh on December 15, 1881. They had four children: [[Childs Frick]] (born March 12, 1883), Martha Howard Frick (born August 9, 1885), [[Helen Clay Frick]] (born September 3, 1888) and Henry Clay Frick, Jr. (born July 8, 1892). In 1882, after the formation of the partnership with Andrew Carnegie, Frick and his wife bought a home they eventually called [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center|Clayton]], an estate in Pittsburgh's East End. They moved into the home in early 1883. The Frick children were born in Pittsburgh and were raised at Clayton. Two of them, Henry, Jr. and Martha, died in infancy or childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1904, he built Eagle Rock, a summer estate at [[Prides Crossing, Beverly, Massachusetts|Prides Crossing]] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] on [[Boston]]'s fashionable [[North Shore (Boston)|North Shore]].  The 104-room mansion designed by Little &amp; Browne was razed in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Patricia|title=Book assesses Frick family houses, both inside and out|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20011218lowry1218fnp2.asp|accessdate=15 December 2014|work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|publisher=PG Publishing Co., Inc.|date= 18 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frick was a fervent art collector whose wealth allowed him to accumulate a large collection. By 1905, Henry Clay Frick's business, social, and artistic interests had shifted from Pittsburgh to [[New York City|New York]]. He took his art collection with him to New York, and served on many corporate boards, which brought him considerable opportunity to continue his lifelong business interests.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

For example, as a board member of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, Frick attempted the removal of [[James Hazen Hyde]] (the founder's only son and heir) from the United States to France by seeking an appointment for him to become [[United States Ambassador to France]]. Frick had engaged a similar stratagem when orchestrating the ouster of the man who had saved his life, [[John George Alexander Leishman]], from the presidency of [[Carnegie Steel]] a decade 
beforehand. In that instance, Leishman had chosen to accept the post as ambassador to Switzerland. Hyde, however, rebuffed Frick's plan. He did, however, move to France, where he served as an ambulance driver during World War I and lived until the outbreak of World War II. (Coincidentally, while in France, Hyde married Leishman's eldest daughter Marthe.){{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Frick Collection is home to one of the finest collections of European paintings in the United States. It contains many works of art dating from the pre-Renaissance up to the post-Impressionist eras, but in no logical or chronological order. It includes several very large paintings by [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]]. In addition to paintings, it also contains an exhibition of carpets, porcelain, sculptures, and period furniture. Frick continued to live at both his New York mansion and at Clayton until his death.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Frick purchased the ''Westmoreland'', a [[private railroad car]], from the [[Pullman Company]] in 1910. The car cost nearly $40,000, and featured a kitchen, pantry, dining room, servant's quarters, two staterooms, and a lavatory. Frick frequently used the car for travel between his residences in [[New York City]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Prides Crossing, Massachusetts]], as well for trips to places such as [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and [[Aiken, South Carolina]]. The car remained in the Frick family until it was scrapped by [[Helen Clay Frick]] in 1965. Photographs of family and friends travelling on the ''Westmoreland'' form part of the Frick archive, as do the original construction plans and upholstery fabric samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Frick and his wife Adelaide had booked tickets to travel back to New York on the inaugural trip of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912, along with [[J.P. Morgan]]. The couple canceled their trip after Adelaide sprained her ankle in Italy and missed the disastrous voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daugherty|first=Greg|title=Seven Famous People who Missed the Titanic|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Seven-Famous-People-Who-Missed-the-Titanic.html?c=y&amp;page=5&amp;navigation=next#IMAGES|accessdate=November 15, 2012|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Henry Clay Frick died of a heart attack on December 2, 1919, weeks before his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/12/03/118239392.pdf "Henry C. Frick Dies]". ''The New York Times'', December 3, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Pittsburgh's [[Homewood Cemetery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Legacy==
[[Image:FrickParkGate.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Frick Park]] gate in the [[Point Breeze (Pittsburgh)|Point Breeze]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA.]]
Frick left a will in which he bequeathed {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park, together with a $2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park. [[Frick Park]] opened in 1927. Between 1919 and 1942, money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park, increasing its size to almost {{convert|600|acre|km2}}. Following the death of Adelaide Howard Childs Frick in 1931, the Frick Collection was opened to the public as a museum in 1935.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Many years after her father's death, Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton in 1981, and lived there until her death in 1984. After extensive restoration, this property was also opened to the public in 1990 as the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Frick was elected an honorary member of the Alpha Chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] music fraternity at the New England Conservatory of Music on October 19, 1917.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Henry Clay Frick Business Records (Archives)==
The Henry Clay Frick archive of business records consisted of the documents regarding the business and financial dealings from 1849-1919. These original documents record the evolution of the period of American steel and coal industrial growth. Documentation includes first business activities, first coal firm, [[H.C. Frick &amp; Company]], to the formation of [[United States Steel Corporation]] on March 2, 1901. Correspondence sent and received from prominent businessmen such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Charles M. Schwab|Charles Schwab]], [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Henry W. Oliver|Henry Oliver]], [[H. H. Rogers]], [[Henry Phipps Jr.|Henry Phipps]], and [[J. P. Morgan]] are part of the collection. Much of the collection is available as digitized and openly accessible. Most of  the collection is from 1881 to 1914, and is relevant to the history of the [[Pittsburgh]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Henry Clay Frick Business Records, Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate = 2016-11-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
In December 1862, President of the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]] sent a brief consoling '''letter to Fanny McCullough''', the daughter of [[lieutenant colonel]] William McCullough, following his death in the [[American Civil War]].

==Background==
Lincoln had met William McCullough years before when Lincoln was a circuit lawyer in Illinois and McCullough was a Circuit Clerk in [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]]. Lincoln would sometimes stay with the McCullough family when he reached the [[Bloomington, Illinois]] area of the circuit. McCullough became an ardent supporter of Lincoln beginning with Lincoln's successful run for Congress in 1846. With the start of the Civil War, McCullough petitioned Lincoln to allow him enlist despite his health problems and age. McCullough's request was granted and he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the [[4th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry|4th Illinois Cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/hist-288pinsker/close-readings/close-reading-letter-to-fanny-mccullough/|title=Close Reading –Letter to Fanny McCullough {{!}} History 288: Civil War &amp; Reconstruction|last=VanGorder|first=Megan|date=2014|website=dickinson.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After McCullough was killed December 5, 1862 in an engagement near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203|title=The Good Old Times in McLean County, Illinois: Containing Two Hundred and Sixty-one Sketches of Old Settlers, a Complete Historical Sketch of the Black Hawk War and Descriptions of All Matters of Interest Relating to McLean County|last=Duis|first=E.|date=|publisher=The Leader Publisher and Printing House|year=1874|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=201-205|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his daughter Mary Frances ("Fanny") was inconsolable and locked herself in her room. At the request of [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a mutual friend of Lincoln and the McCullough family, Lincoln wrote to Fanny on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0B5tAeHpygC|title=Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness|last=Shenk|first=Joshua Wolf|date=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2006|isbn=0618773444|location=New York|pages=187-189|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
Executive Mansion,&lt;br/&gt;
Washington, December 23, 1862.

Dear Fanny&lt;br/&gt;
It is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. You can not now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once. The memory of your dear Father, instead of an agony, will yet be a sad sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer, and holier sort than you have known before.

Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.

Your sincere friend,&lt;br/&gt;
A. Lincoln.

Miss. Fanny McCullough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/mccull.htm|title=Abraham Lincoln's Letter to Fanny McCullough|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Mapa de Cuauhtinchan No. 2''''' (''Cuauhtinchan Map #2'', also known in the literature by the abbreviation '''MC2''') is one of five indigenous maps from the sixteenth century Valley of [[Puebla]], that documents the  history of the [[Chichimeca]] Cucuhtinchantlacas.  This map is a post-conquest document done in [[amate paper]] in a traditional cartographic history style very common in [[Mesoamerica]] (Boone, 2000) and used to recount creation [[myths]], [[human migration|migrations]], battles and allegiances, and to document [[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] and territorial boundaries (Reyes, 1977).

==Mapping==
[[Mapmaking]] is a cultural expression evidenced in different forms in any human community over [[time]] and [[space]]: From fourth century BC (400 BC) [[China]] to nineteenth century [[Europe]], maps have been a medium that materialized or translated man's relationship to the world around it; as [[John Brian Harley|Harley]] puts it “There are few aspects of human action and thought that have not been mapped at one time or another” (Harley, 1991).  [[Maps]] are a representation of place. As part of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] legacy, [[cartography]] stressed the “scientific”, methodical, and measurable aspects of these representations, which the European tradition embraced, dismissing the other more subjective discourses; and referring to these non-European maps as “primitive". (see [[History of Cartography]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ranging from paintings produced by the Aboriginal people of Australia ([[Indigenous Australians]]) to maps of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] (Native Americans), and from the [[Marshall Islands stick chart]]s to the battle plans drawn on the ground by [[Māori people|Māori]] warriors in [[New Zealand]], they were widely regarded as an inchoate stage in the cognitive history of cartography. To the extent that they lacked orientation, regular scales, and the [[Euclidean geometry]] of modern maps, or were drawn on unfamiliar media, little effort was made to crack their codes of representation. They remained on the periphery of Western cartographic achievement. (Harley, 1991)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As cartography encompassed both the [[Western world]] and non-Western world expressions its definition expanded from just being cognitive structures to understand space to be a contextual historical discourse.

==[[Aztec]] Cartographic Histories==
Post-conquest indigenous cartographic expressions were an example of the conscientious combination of the foreign and indigenous styles, an active reflection of the cultural changes taking place at that moment in Mesoamerica. The maps and the mapmaking that came from Europe to the [[New World]] during the conquest were “framed by a scientific rationale, primarily accentuating economic, social, and political boundaries and often ignoring levels of signs and abstractions deeply rooted in the cultural context and social order where a map is produced” (Botero, 2006). 
With this in mind Aztec maps were not just layouts of the empire, but actually cartographic histories. Not only those documented how things were arranged in space but they told stories and were a common method of presenting space and movement through it and Mexican historians made remarkable use of this technique (Boone, 2000). According to [[Elizabeth Hill Boone]] any story is tied to a protagonist (who), a date (when), and a location (where); and maps such as the MC2 allowed the representation of these three elements, therefore they were a suitable discourse for their stories.

==The MC2 and the Tolteca-Chichimeca history==
:''Extracted from the MC2 and [[Paul Kirchhoff]]'s work''
The map, using an undoubtedly Mesoamerican cartographic discourse, though with minor European accents (for example in the detail of the facial expressions), describes a pilgrimage. A ritual (Boone, 2000) and cultural journey from the mythical cave of [[Chicomoztoc]] to the town of Cuauhtinchan in the heart of today's Valley of Puebla in the immediacies of the Amozoc-Tepeaca mountain range (Yoneda, 2005). It tells a story that spans about four hundred years, between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries (Reyes, 1977).  The story told in this manuscript starts while the Olmeca-Xicallanca were attacking the city of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the Tolteca capital.  The Tolteca rulers send two lords/priests, Icxicouatl (“Serpent Foot”) and Quetzalteueyac (“Feather Lip”) (Kirchhoff et al., 1976; Wake, 2007) to find and hire the famous Chichimeca mercenaries, “son valientes hombres, animosos y esforzados soldados (tiyacuah)” (Kirchhoff et al., 1976) that lived in Chicomoztoc to fight for them (Reyes, 1977).
The Chichimeca tribes left the sacred site led by Itzpapalotl, their goddess of war (Yoneda, 2002a), followed their Tolteca guides for thirteen days (Yoneda, 2002b), arrived to the city of Cholula, and defeated the Tolteca enemies, the Olmeca-Xicallanca. As reward for their services the Chichimeca-Cuauhtinchantlacas (the mapmakers' ancestors) were given the title of teuchtli and allowed to settle in the immediacies of the mountain range of Amozoc-Tepeaca, where after surveying the valley they founded Cuauhtinchan (Reyes, 1977; Yoneda, 2005). 
Additionally, the Map tells the story of the tensions between Cuauhtinchantlacas and Popollocas, their claims to the lands of the alteptl of Cuauhtinchan, and their ultimate defeat by the [[Mixteca]] Lord 13, who pursued and killed Teuchtlecozauhqui (Kirchhoff et al., 1976). After this the Cuauhtinchantlaca survivors took refuge in Matlazinco, south of Cuauhtinchan in the bank of the Atoyac River near the current town of San Juan of Tzictlacoya (Kirchhoff et al., 1976).

===Cave, City, and Eagle's Nest===
From 2002 to 2007 research on this manuscript was conducted at [[Harvard University]]. The work was carried through the Moses Mesoamerican Archive in the Department of Anthropology and the [[David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies]] at Harvard University. The Mexican American historian of religions David Carrasco was responsible for organizing the five-year study at Harvard that resulted in [http://unmpress.com/books.php?ID=11369200144480 Cave, City, and Eagle's Nest], edited by Carrasco and his former student and colleague Scott Sessions. For a useful history of this project see the introduction to the book written by the co-editors. Carrasco did a lecture tour about the MC2 Codex in 2008 and 2009.

He currently works with WWE as the head of the road agents/producers.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1977–1982)===
Hayes started wrestling in 1977 in the [[Tennessee]] regional [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]]. In 1978, he wrestled his first tour overseas in Germany for [[Catch Wrestling Association]]. In 1979,wrestling for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South Wrestling]] at the suggestion of [[Bill Watts]] he formed a [[tag team]] with [[Terry Gordy|Terry "Bam Bam" Gordy]] winning the [[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid South Tag Team Championship]] 3 times and became the wrestling faction called [[The Fabulous Freebirds]]. Hayes became Michael "P.S." Hayes, and they strutted their way to many tag team titles along with [[Buddy Roberts|Buddy "Jack" Roberts]]. Hayes also started moonwalking in the ring like [[Michael Jackson]] used to do in concert.&lt;ref name="Birds"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= Top 20: 7 The Fabulous Freebirds | pages= 46–51 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freebirds spent 1980 through 1982 in the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] area, where they won the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] a few times, split and feuded, then mended fences.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1982–1986)===
In 1982, they left for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), where they had one of their most famous [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]]. Hayes was chosen by the fans to be the special guest referee during the [[Ric Flair]]-[[Kerry Von Erich]] [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cage match|steel cage match]] at [[WCCW Star Wars (1982)#Christmas Star Wars|Christmas Star Wars]]. Hayes at one point knocked Flair out so Von Erich could get the pin and the title. Von Erich refused to pin him after the dirty deed which ultimately led to Gordy slamming the cage door on Von Erich's head. As this later cost him the title, it triggered the legendary feud between [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] and [[Von Erich family|The Von Erichs]] and ended a good respectful friendship between both groups. The Freebird-Von Erich feud ended for good in 1993 during a memorial card in tribute to [[Kerry Von Erich]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

Hayes was always the leader of the group with his exceptional mic skills and he recorded the team's new theme song, ''Badstreet USA'', in 1983. The video to the song features all three of The Fabulous Freebirds as well as Jimmy Garvin, who was often considered the fourth Freebird. They had used the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song "[[Free Bird]]" and [[Willie Nelson]]'s version of "[[Georgia on My Mind]]" up to that point and would on occasion in the future.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

In 1984, The Freebirds had a brief stint in the [[WWE|WWF]] but left when management wanted to split them up. The Freebirds then spent a few months in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]] in 1985, feuding with [[The Road Warriors]] over the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]], winning the belts temporarily at the inaugural [[SuperClash]] event before the AWA overturned the decision. The Freebirds interfered in the match where the Warriors lost the belts to [[Jimmy Garvin]] and [[Steve Regal]], and subsequently returned to [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

In 1986, Hayes appeared in the opening credits of ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' alongside [[The Fabulous Freebirds]], working his Purely Sexy gimmick on the turnbuckle while writhing free of his ring robe.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

===Universal Wrestling Federation/Jim Crockett Promotions (1986–1988)===
The Freebirds also spent several months in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] in 1986 and early 1987 with Sunshine as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. There they feuded with The Fantastics ([[Bobby Fulton]] and [[Tommy Rogers (wrestler)|Tommy Rogers]]) and with [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

In 1986, Hayes' partner in the Freebirds, Terry Gordy, became the first holder of the UWF heavyweight title. After losing the title by default to [[One Man Gang]], the Freebirds engaged in a major heel vs heel feud with [[Skandor Akbar]]'s Devastation Inc. group. The feud continued even after Akbar double-crossed Gang and helped [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]] win the title from him, and saw the Freebirds form an alliance with their former enemy Williams against Devastation Inc.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

After the breakup of the Freebirds, Hayes became a full-fledged babyface and remained in the UWF, which was later sold to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) on April 9, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | pages = 93 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the JCP/UWF co-promoted pay-per-view event [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade '87]], Hayes teamed with Jimmy Garvin (also now a babyface after reconciling with [[kayfabe]] brother [[Ron Garvin]]) and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to face the team of [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]], [[Robert Rechsteiner|Rick Steiner]] and [[Larry Zbyszko]] whom they wrestled to a time-limit draw. He later challenged [[NWA World Championship|NWA World Champion]] [[Ric Flair]] and frequently teamed with Jimmy Garvin.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

===Return to WCCW (1988–1989)===
Hayes returned to World Class Championship Wrestling to find that his former Freebird partners Gordy and Roberts, in alliance with [[Iceman Parsons]] and [[The Angel of Death (wrestler)|The Angel of Death]], had resumed their feud with the Von Erichs. After Gordy and Roberts helped Parsons win the World Class heavyweight title from Kerry Von Erich by bashing Kerry with socks loaded with weights while the arena lights were mysteriously turned off, a disgusted Hayes allied himself with the Von Erichs against his former Freebird 'brothers'.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

At the [[Parade of Champions#Parade of Champions 5|1988 Parade of Champions]], Gordy defeated Hayes in a hair vs hair "triple dome of terror" (three vertically stacked cages) match. After the match, however, Gordy refused to cut Hayes' hair and instead turned babyface on Roberts and cut ''his'' hair. Subsequently, Hayes and Gordy reunited as babyfaces and feuded with Roberts and his [[The Headshrinkers|Samoan Swat Team]] as well as old Freebird enemies Devastation Inc, of whom Parsons was now a member.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

While all this was going on, Hayes continued with his music career, often playing concerts with his Badstreet Band at the [[Dallas Sportatorium]], World Class's main arena. Inevitably, the music career overlapped with World Class' storylines when, at one such concert, Roberts appeared onstage and hit Hayes over the head with a guitar. Hayes also formed a new tag team with [[Steve Cox (wrestler)|"Do It To It" Steve Cox]] and together they twice briefly beat the Samoan Swat Team for the World Class tag team titles, on September 12–16, 1988 and October 15–17, 1988.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1989–1994)===
In 1989, Hayes went to [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) (formerly JCP) where he wrestled as a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]. He [[Turned heel|turned]] on [[WWE United States Championship|U.S. Champ]] [[Lex Luger]] during a match with [[Yasuhiro Kojima|Hiro Matsuda]]'s "[[Yamasaki Corporation|Yamazaki Corporation]]" and joined them. The [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] included [[Ric Flair]], [[Barry Windham|Barry]] and [[Kendall Windham]], and [[Butch Reed]]. Hayes feuded with Luger and won the U.S. Title from him after Terry Gordy surprised everybody and interfered in the match. Luger later regained the title from Hayes and The Freebirds entered the tournament to crown new [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA World tag team champions]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

At [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions VII: Guts and Glory|Clash of the Champions 7]], on June 14, 1989, [[Jimmy Garvin]] showed up as the newest Freebird and he and Hayes won the tournament and titles (thus reuniting their old tag team from JCP circa 1987).&lt;ref name="Wrestling-Titles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/midatlantic/nwa/ma-nwa-t.html|title=NWA (Mid-Atlantic) World Tag Team Championship|publisher=Wrestling-Titles.com|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new champions immediately feuded with [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] ([[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Stan Lane]]). Gordy left in late 1989 and Hayes and Garvin feuded with [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] ([[Ricky Morton]] and [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]]).&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

In 1991, The Freebirds feuded with "[[Southern Boys|The Young Pistols]]" ([[Steve Armstrong]] and [[Tracy Smothers]]). They soon added another Freebird, the masked [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Badstreet]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt; He helped them win the U.S. Tag Team Titles and they all won the Six-Man Titles.&lt;ref name=WCWUSTag/&gt;&lt;ref name=WCWSix/&gt; They also had two managers briefly, [[Oliver Humperdink|Big Daddy Dink]] and [[Diamond Dallas Page]]. Once Badstreet departed from the group in late 1991, The Freebirds were left with no real direction. The Freebirds turned face, and Garvin's wife [[Precious (wrestling)|Precious]] became their on-screen manager. Although they won the U.S. Tag Titles again, The Freebirds disbanded by late 1992.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

Hayes then turned heel again and started managing [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Bobby Eaton]], who were still members of the [[Dangerous Alliance]]. He became a member of sorts and even helped [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]] in his feud with [[Debrah Miceli|Madusa]]. In 1993, Hayes became a fan favorite again and feuded with [[Paul Orndorff]] over the TV Title and then briefly teamed (and later feuded) with [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] and also did some commentating before quitting WCW in January 1994, after being offered a $75,000 a year contract (Hayes would make one final appearance in WCW at [[SuperBrawl IV]] in February).

===Return to Dallas (1994–1995)===
He went back to Dallas to the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] and reunited with Garvin and Gordy as The Freebirds, whom he managed them to win their Tag Team Championship, before the company folded that September.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt; After the GWF folded, Hayes remained in Dallas for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s stay in Dallas, which lasted until April 1995.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE===

====Dok Hendrix (1995–1999)====
Michael Hayes received a tryout match with the [[WWE|WWF]] on February 21, 1995 at a ''WWF Superstars'' taping in Augusta, Georgia. Wrestling in a dark match, Hayes competed as a face and defeated Ken Raper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However he retired from active competition due to a serious back injury he suffered while in WCW and after the NWA's Dallas promotion ended, and debuted on April 14 instead as Dok Hendrix, ''[[WWF Action Zone]]'' co-host with [[Todd Pettengill]].&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt; As Dok Hendrix, he interviewed wrestlers before their matches and initially acted more like a heel, though that was later dropped. His most famous interviews include "The birth of Austin 3:16," "The Super Soaker DX" commercials, and hosting most of WWF's products. Hayes also worked as a color commentator in 1995 with Vince McMahon on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]'' and on the [[In Your House 1]] and the [[King of the Ring (1995)|1995 King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events.

====Managing The Hardy Boyz (1999)====
Hayes returned to active competition in 1999 for [[Power Pro Wrestling]], where he won the promotion's title. He soon came back to WWF TV as the manager for [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy]]). The Hardy Boyz lost the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Titles]] to [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]] when Hayes was pinned in a [[handicap match]]; he was fired by them in August.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

====Backstage roles (1999–present)====
He then became a backstage [[Road agent (professional wrestling)|road agent]] and [[color commentator]] for the WWF. Initially appearing for one night on the September 23, 1999 broadcast of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Hayes became a [[color commentator]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' alongside [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] and [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] from 2000 to 2001, although he was mostly used on the international broadcasts of that show. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] on April 1, 2001, he competed in the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] Battle Royal, but was eliminated by the [[One Man Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/17|title=WRESTLEMANIA X-SEVEN|accessdate=2007-12-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes received some attention when it became known that, prior to the November 13, 2003 episode of ''SmackDown'' he had canvassed for [[John Cena]] (then a face) to attack his tag team partner [[Chris Benoit]] (also a face) after they had won their match. Hayes believed that adding an "edge" to Cena's character could recreate the popularity of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. After the live crowd reacted badly to the storyline, it was cut from the ''SmackDown!'' broadcast.

During the December 5, 2005 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'', he became involved in verbal sparring with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in which Hayes attacked Edge's lack of main event experience and the details of his love life (with regard to Matt Hardy and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]]). Hayes was later attacked by Edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12052005/|title=McMahon to Bischoff: "You're fired!"|accessdate=2007-12-13|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, Hayes became the head creative writer for the ''SmackDown'' brand after Alex Greenfield's departure from the company. He can be seen on the second season of [[WWE Classics on Demand]] series ''[[WWE Classics On Demand#Legends of Wrestling|Legends of Wrestling]]''.

Hayes made occasional appearances on WWE programmes: on the December 7, 2007 episode of ''SmackDown'', Hayes was a guest of [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]]'s [[list of WWE SmackDown on-air personalities#Recurring segments|VIP Lounge]]. Hayes promoted the new ''Triumph and Tragedy of [[World Class Championship Wrestling|WCCW]]'' DVD and reinforced its [[drug abuse|anti-drug]] message. However, Hayes ended up being attacked by MVP before being saved by [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/results/|title=December to disrespect|accessdate=2007-12-13|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2010 episode of ''Raw'', Hayes was one of several Legends who accompanied [[Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat]], who was out to promote his new DVD.

In October 2013, Hayes took a leave of absence from WWE for personal reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/80820/official-wwe-statement-on-michael-hayes-status.html?p=1|title=Official WWE Statement on Michael Hayes' Status|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=2013-10-10|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he returned to work on December 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=81954|title=BIG WWE CREATIVE FORCE BACK TO WORK {{!}} PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2014 Hayes appeared in a short segment on the online series ''JBL and Cole Show'' in which he stared at a "Free Birds, call to enquire" flier.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=A9VLm_NXhV0&amp;list=UUJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg&amp;index=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Hayes partook in a WWE.com interview alongside [[Arn Anderson]] with [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] to discuss [[Triple H]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s match at [[WrestleMania 31]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|-eFzqAq2QZ8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2016, Hayes was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] with the Fabulous Freebirds. Hayes accepted the award alongside [[Jimmy Garvin]].

==Music career==
In 1987, on the back of the popularity of the "Badstreet USA" theme, Hayes recorded and released an album, ''Off The Streets''. He also performed live concerts to promote the album with his backing band, the Badstreet Band. The July 1988 issue of [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] (written circa March 1988) contained a (possibly [[kayfabe]]d) column by writer Dave Rosenbaum in which he visited the box office for a Badstreet Band show and surveyed what sort of people would actually go to Hayes' concerts.

In 1992, Hayes performed a duet with music producer Darwin Conort called "Freebird Forever" on the WCW album, ''Slam Jam 1''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYp4nxMLlzI WCW Slam Jam - 05. Fabulous Freebirds - Freebird Forever], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hayes paid tribute to his Freebird brother Terry Gordy, who died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] in 2001, with a song entitled "Freebird Road". His music video was an emotional and stirring trip down memory lane as a Freebird and shows shots of him at Gordy's grave.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd6MCIEkztQ Freebird Road], Michael PS Hayes YouTube Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Northwest Film Center''' (NWFC) is a [[Pacific Northwest|regional]] media arts resource and service organization based in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]] that was founded to encourage the study, appreciation, and utilization of film. The center provides a variety of film and video exhibition, education and information programs primarily directed to the residents of Oregon, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] and [[Alaska]].

==History==
The center was founded as the '''Northwest Film Study Center''' in 1971,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web
 | url = http://asifaseattle.com/community/an-hi-02.html
 | title = The Portland Story 1925-76
 | work = History of Northwest Animation: The Roots of Creative Variance

 | publisher = ASIFA Seattle
 | accessdate = 2009-05-14
}} &lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated into the [[Portland Art Museum]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.pam.org/asp/templates/page.asp?pageID=72 1970s &amp; 1980s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The center was located in Portland's historic [[Guild Theatre (Portland, Oregon)|Guild Theatre]] from 1998 to 2006.&lt;ref name="goodbye to the guild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Shawn|authorlink=Shawn Levy (writer)|title=Before flying off with Superman, a good-bye to the Guild|date=June 25, 2006|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=O2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsors of the center include the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[Oregon Arts Commission]], [[Oregon Cultural Trust]], [[Washington State Arts Commission]], [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]], The Ted R. Gamble Film Endowment, The Rose E. Tucker Charitable Trust, [[Paul Allen|The Paul G. Allen Foundation for the Arts]], [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], and the Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission.

== Education ==
The Center offers college credit in association with [[Portland State University]], [[Marylhurst University]], and the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web
 | url = http://nwfilm.org/education/credit/
 | title = College Credit
 | accessdate = 2009-05-14
}} &lt;/ref&gt;      
&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web
 | url = http://nwfilm.org/education/certificate
 | title = Certificate Programs
 | accessdate = 2009-05-14
}} &lt;/ref&gt;  The core program contains about 20 classes covering fundamentals of video, film, sound, lighting, editing, screenwriting, post production, animation, stop motion and other aspects.  Classes are also available to members of the public who satisfy prerequisites.  Classes begin three times per year. Most classes are one day a week and have sections either in the afternoon or at night, and usually last about 13 weeks.There are also several certificate-based curricula equivalent to a degree in fine arts which take two to four years to complete.

There are three levels of the certificate program. All require the same four core classes: Art of Filmmaking (using 8 mm film), Digital Video Editing (with final cut pro), Shooting Digital Video, and Sound Recording and Post. A final project is required for each level, which is made over a two-term period (in the winter and the summer) in a class called advanced production and advanced editing. The final projects are shown at the Portland Art Museum Whitsell Auditorium in the Fall.

One elective class is required for level 1, and two elective classes are required for levels 2 and 3. Level 2 requires three additional classes -- Narrative Traditions, Documentary Forms &amp; Visions, and Experimental Film &amp; Video. Level 3 adds a requirement for a class on 16 mm. In addition, 10 - 12 hours of workshop time is required for level 1, 15 - 20 hours of workshop time required for level 2, and 20+ hours of workshop time required for level 3. Workshops are short classes lasting an afternoon or an entire day offered periodically throughout the year, often by visiting filmmakers. As all of the classes have sections in the evenings, it is possible to complete the certificate program while working full-time.
The school's 36 instructors are mostly working filmmakers with several hundred years total experience.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

The film center rents a wide range of filmmaking equipment to students, artists, and for commercial use.  Preference is to the school's students.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

 | title = Equipment Access

== Purpose ==
Outlook on the web is available to [[Office 365]] and Exchange Online subscribers, and is included with the on-premises [[Exchange Server]], to enable users to connect to their email accounts via a [[web browser]], without requiring the installation of [[Microsoft Outlook]] or other [[Email client|email clients]]. In case of Exchange Server, it is hosted on a local [[intranet]] and requires a network connection to the Exchange Server for users to work with e-mail, address book, calendars and task.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Sign-in-to-Outlook-Web-App-e08eb8ac-ac27-49f4-a400-a47311e1ee7e|title = Sign in to Outlook Web App|date = |accessdate = |website = Office.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exchange Online version, which can be bought either independently or through Office 365 licensing program, is hosted on Microsoft servers on the [[world wide web]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Outlook Web App 2013 screenshot.png|thumb|Outlook Web App 2013 on [[Internet Explorer 11]]|alt=|left]]

Outlook Web Access was created in 1995 by Microsoft Program Manager Thom McCann on the Exchange Server team. An early working version was demonstrated by Microsoft Vice President Paul Maritz at Microsoft's famous Internet summit in Seattle on December 27, 1995. The first customer version was shipped as part of the Exchange Server 5.0 release in early 1997.

The first component to allow client-side scripts to issue [[HTTP request]]s ([[XMLHttpRequest|XMLHTTP]]) was originally written by the Outlook Web Access team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|last=Le Roy|first=Bertrand |author2=Matt Gibbs|title=ASP.NET AJAX UpdatePanel Control|publisher=O'Reilly Short Cuts|page=2|chapter=Some history: from XmlHttp to UpdatePanel|isbn=978-0-596-52747-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVgttN8YGOcC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623125327/http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm|archivedate=June 23, 2007|title=The story of XMLHTTP|last=Hopmann|first=Alex |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became a part of [[Internet Explorer 5]]. Renamed XMLHttpRequest and standardized by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/|title=The XMLHttpRequest Object|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=W3C|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since become one of the cornerstones of the [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technology used to build advanced web apps.

Outlook Web Access was later renamed Outlook Web App.{{When|date=August 2015}} An update on August 4, 2015 renamed OWA to "Outlook on the web".&lt;ref name="Ootw"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.office.com/2015/08/04/new-features-coming-to-outlook-on-the-web/ |title=New features coming to Outlook on the web |work=Office Blogs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

=== Mail ===
Mail is the webmail component of Outlook on the web. The default view is a three column view with folders and groups on the left, email in the middle, and the selected message on the right. With the 2015  update, Microsoft introduced the ability to pin, sweep and archive messages, and undo the last action, as well as richer image editing features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New features coming to Outlook on the web|url = https://blogs.office.com/2015/08/04/new-features-coming-to-outlook-on-the-web/|website = Office Blogs|accessdate = November 25, 2015|first = Outlook|last = Team}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can connect to other services such as [[GitHub]] and [[Twitter]] through Office 365 Connectors. Actionable Messages in emails allows a user to complete a task from within the email, such as retweeting a Tweet on Twitter or setting a meeting date on a calendar.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.office.com/2016/09/27/new-outlook-partner-integrations-help-you-extend-your-email-capabilities/&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlook on the web supports [[S/MIME]] and includes features for managing calendars, contacts, tasks, documents (used with [[SharePoint]] or [[Office Web Apps]]), and other mailbox content. In the Exchange 2007 release, Outlook on the web (still called Outlook Web App at the time) also offers read-only access to documents stored in SharePoint sites and network [[Uniform Naming Convention|UNC]] shares.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Calendar ===
Calendar is the calendaring component of Outlook on the web. With the update, Microsoft added a weather forecast directly in the Calendar, as well as icons (or "charms") as visual cues for an event. In addition, email reminders came to all events, and a special Birthday and Holiday event calendars are created automatically. Calendars can be shared and there are multiple views such as day, week, month, and today. Another view is work week which includes Mondays through Fridays in the calendar view.

Calendar details can be added with HTML and rich-text editing, and files can be attached to calendar events and appointments.

=== People ===
People is the contact manager component of Outlook on the web. A user can search and edit existing contacts, as well as create new ones. Contacts can be placed into folders and duplicate contacts can be linked from multiple sources such as LinkedIn or Twitter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using contacts (People) in Outlook on the web – Office Support|url = https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Using-contacts-People-in-Outlook-on-the-web-1e3438c7-26b2-420c-87de-3cea9d31b5cb?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-SG&amp;ad=SG|website = support.office.com|accessdate = November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Outlook Mail, a contact can be created by clicking on an email address sender, which pulls down a contact card with an add button to add to Outlook People. Contacts can be imported as well as placed into a list that can be utilized when composing an email in Outlook Mail.

People can also sync with friends and connections lists on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

=== Tasks ===
[[File:Outlook Tasks O365.png|alt=Outlook Tasks in Office 365|thumb|Outlook Tasks in Office 365]]
Tasks was originally launched as ''Tasks for Outlook Web App''. Microsoft was slowly rolling out a preview of Tasks to its consumer-based Outlook.com service that in May 2015, was announced to be moving to the Office 365 infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From the Forums: Outlook on the web preview, first impressions|url = http://www.neowin.net/news/from-the-forums-outlook-on-the-web-preview-first-impressions|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a part of Calendar as a view. Microsoft has separated the services into its own web app in Outlook on the web. In a post on the Office Blogs in 2015, Microsoft announced that Outlook Web App would be renamed Outlook on the web and that Tasks would move under that brand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A user can create tasks, put them into categories, and move them to another folder. A feature added was the ability to set due days and sort and filter the tasks according to those criteria. The app provides the user with fields such as subject, start and end dates, percent complete, priority, and how much work was put into each task. Rich editing features like bold, italic, underline, numbering, and bullet points were also introduced. Tasks can be edited and categorized according to how the user wishes them to be sorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tasks overview|url = https://support.office.com/en-za/article/Tasks-overview-89f8064f-2516-4036-845c-a6953e166fe0|website = support.office.com|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removed features==
Outlook on the web has had two interfaces available: one with a complete feature set (known as Premium) and one with reduced functionality (known as Light or sometimes Lite). Prior to Exchange 2010, the Premium client required [[Internet Explorer]]. Exchange 2000 and 2003 require [[Internet Explorer 5]] and later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750258.aspx|title=Exchange 2000 Outlook Web Access|year=2002|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa996808(EXCHG.65).aspx|title=Improvements in Outlook Web Access 2003|year=2006|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Exchange 2007 requires [[Internet Explorer 6]] and later.&lt;ref name=aa997437&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa997437.aspx|title=Client Features in Outlook Web Access|year=2008|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange 2010 supports a wider range of web browsers: [[Internet Explorer 7]] or later, [[Firefox]] 3.01 or later, [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], or [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 3.1 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/bb899685%28EXCHSRVCS.140%29.aspx|title=Outlook Web App Supported Browsers|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Exchange 2010 restricts its Firefox and Safari support to  [[macOS]] and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb899685.aspx|title=Outlook Web App Supported Browsers|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Exchange 2013, these browser restrictions were lifted.&lt;ref name="microsoft1"&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/supported-browsers-for-outlook-web-app-HA102824601.aspx Supported browsers for Outlook Web App – support]. Office.microsoft.com. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Exchange 2010 and earlier, the Light [[user interface]] is rendered for browsers other than Internet Explorer. The basic interface did not support search on Exchange Server 2003. In Exchange Server 2007, the Light interface supported searching mail items; managing contacts and the calendar was also improved.&lt;ref name=aa997437 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/code/OWA/index.html|title=Microsoft Office Outlook Web Access|year=2007|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 version can connect to an external email account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">'''Peace Love Unity Respect''', commonly shortened to '''PLUR''', is a set of principles that is associated with the [[rave]] culture. Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on [[Usenet]], it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties. It has since expanded to the larger rave dance music culture as well.

It may be interpreted as the essential philosophy of life for ravers and clubbers, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. This universalist philosophy underpinning the tribal dance culture which began circling the globe with the rise of the internet, theoretically takes precedence over any chemical or musical aspects of the rave scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rave Culture and Religion |last=St. John |first=Graham |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=149 |isbn=0-415-31449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raves represent a modern ritualistic experience, promoting a strong communal sense, where PLUR is considered an ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall| first=Douglas| date=2002-11-01| title=Behavior, Belonging, and Belief: A Theory of Ritual Practice| jstor=3108616| journal=Sociological Theory| publisher=American Sociological Association| volume=20| issue=3| pages=360–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
* [[Peace]] – The avoidance of negative emotions and conflict.&lt;ref name=odyessy&gt;{{cite web |title=PLUR Isn't Just a Moment, It's a Lifestyle |author=Cree Bort |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/plur-lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Love]] – Performing acts and sharing feelings of goodwill towards others. The exchange of gestures such as hugging occurs frequently at a rave, and is considered a way of "spreading the love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Frankie Bones Storm Rave Birthed The PLUR Movement|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/how-frankie-bones-storm-rave-birthed-the-plur-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* Unity – Welcoming others into the community, and coming together regardless of personal differences.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* [[Respect]] – Showing sensitivity for the feelings of others, and accepting one another with tolerance and without judgement. Treating each other as one would like to be treated.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;

==Origins==
{{Synthesis|section|date=May 2012}}
PLUR is an aggregation of ideas synonymous with the earlier hippy and hip hop culture, with the peace movement being an essential starting point to any be-in encounter or rave. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Use of the term 'PLUR' dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s rave scene in the UK which incorporated [[House music|house]] and [[acid house]] music that originated in Chicago during the 1980s. The term began as an informal discussion on [[usenet]] lists alt.rave and alt.culture.zippies. SF-raves mailing list archived at hyper-real also noted the use of the term, and there is a flyer archive which might contain evidence of the existence of the term.

One of the earliest{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} uses of the term outside the internet, mostly anecdotal, appears to be [[Frankie Bones|DJ Frankie Bones]] in June 1993. Supposedly in response to a fight that broke out at one of his epic Storm Raves in Brooklyn, New York, Bones is said to have got on the microphone and yelled: "If you don't start showing some peace, love, and unity, I'll break your faces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/features/2015/ballad/index.html|title=The Graffiti Kids Who Became Raver Kings|author=Steve Powers|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Later incarnations and variations of PLUR can be seen in the adoption of [[Pronoia (psychology)|Pronoia]] and also [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], with PLUR and Pronoia often being interchangeable terms, depending upon one's company. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Several other variations on the same four words, but in a different order (e.g. LURP), have been proposed. However, none of these are commonly used.

==Facts==
The school board of [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], [[New Jersey]] needed to eliminate a teaching position from the high school's Business Education department. Under New Jersey state law, [[tenure]]d teachers have to be laid off in reverse order of [[seniority]]. However, the board faced a problem, as the district's least senior tenured teachers, Sharon Taxman (a white teacher) and Debra Williams (an African-American teacher), had started working at the school on the same day, and thus had equal seniority. In the interest of maintaining racial diversity (Williams was the only African-American teacher in the department, and 50% of the students were minorities), the school board voted to lay off Taxman. Taxman complained to the [[EEOC]], saying that the board had violated Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and was given authority to file suit against the board.

==Judgment==
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] ruled in favor of Taxman.

==Significance==
The school board appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] and a hearing was scheduled for January 1998, but civil rights groups, fearing that the case could lead to the prohibition of affirmative action, provided money for the board to settle the case out of court, so the case was never heard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Biskupic|Biskupic, Joan]]. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/supcourt/stories/wp112297.htm "Rights Groups Pay To Settle Bias Case"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 22, 1997, p. A01 . Accessed June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxman was subsequently rehired, and later reassigned to Conackamack Middle School.

Williams retired at the conclusion of the 2009-2010 school year.

The '''Ross Farm Museum''' is an agricultural museum located in [[New Ross, Nova Scotia|New Ross]], [[Nova Scotia]], about an hour's drive from [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]].  

== Museum ==
The exhibits feature working artisans, live animals, historic buildings, and antique implements and furnishings.  The goal of the Ross Farm Museum is to give visitors an understanding of the importance of Nova Scotia's rural heritage.   It includes a country store displaying the types of products available then, a working cooper shop, historic breeds of farm animals, a blacksmith, a working farm, and a village school house.  Costumed guides are on hand to explain life in that time period.  Wagon rides are often available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ross-farm/ "Ross farm"] The Canadian Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Farm is a member of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] network.

== History ==

After the [[War of 1812]], the village of Sherbrook (renamed New Ross) and the Ross Farm were established by William Ross (1783–1822) in 1816.  William Ross was originally from [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], he became part of the British Army [[16th Regiment of Foot]] and stationed in [[Fort Amsterdam (Sint Maarten)|Fort Amsterdam]], [[Surinam]].   His wife Mary accompanied him.  They had their second child while they were there.  During their return to Britain, they survived their ship being wrecked on the [[Tuskar Rock, Ireland|Tuskar Rock]] off the coast of [[Wexford, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  

William and Mary moved to [[Sunderland, England]], where their son Edward Ross  (1813–1894) was born, the author of the diaries on which the museum is based.   During the [[War of 1812]], as a soldier in the 16th Regiment, William Ross and his family moved to British North America and were stationed at Fort [[Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/qc/coteaudulac/index.aspx National Historic Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of the Chateauguay]] happened while he was there.  His role in the battle is unknown.  Lieutenant William Ross chose to transfer to the [[Nova Scotia Fencibles]] Infantry while in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, upon their return to Nova Scotia, the Ross family again survived the sinking of their ship [[Archduke Charles (ship)|Archduke Charles]] off the coast of Green Island ([[Head of Jeddore, Nova Scotia|Jeddore Ledges, Nova Scotia]]).  Capt. Ross arrived in Halifax where he and his family were hosted by John Lawson, Esquire. In gratitude to their host, Capt. Ross named the lake below the settlement Lawson Lake after his Haligonian host.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofprov00browuoft#page/76/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Fencibles were disbanded on 25 July 1816.  Two weeks later,  on  7 August 1816, William Ross led  172 former soldiers who were given land grants along the newly burned road between Chester and [[Kentville, Nova Scotia]].    Six years later on 2 May 1822, William Ross died suddenly at the age of 39 and was buried in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historycountylu00desbgoog#page/n342/mode/2up History of the County of Lunenburg, p. 325]&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months later, his wife Mary gave birth to their fourth child.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; 

William’s son Edward Ross kept a diary for most of his life.  The Ross Farm Museum is based on the diaries Edward wrote when he was a young man age 22-28 (1835–1841).  During this time on the farm, he sold produce from the local community in his store and also made a trip by boat from Chester to Halifax every spring.  He was also a justice of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  
At age 28, Edward left the community and married Marie three years later at [[Cornwallis, Nova Scotia]] (1844).&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;    At age 52, Edward spent time in jail for not being able to pay his debts (1865).&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;    Five years later he went to Boston in search of work.  While there, he heard the famous [[Lucy Stone]] speak at the [[Massachusetts State House]](1872).  They returned to [[Kentville, Nova Scotia]] until Marie died (1882).  Edward lived for twelve more years. He eventually moved back to the Ross Farm.  He lived on the farm for the last three years of his life.  He died at age 81 (1894).&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry Citation Index==
The Chemistry Citation Index was first introduced by Eugene Garfield, a chemist by training. His original "search examples were based on [his] experience as a chemist".&lt;ref name=Garcci/&gt; In 1992 an electronic and print form of the index was derived from a core of 330 chemistry journals, within which all areas were covered. Additional information was provided from articles selected from 4,000 other journals. All chemistry subdisciplines were covered: organic, inorganic, analytical, physical chemistry, polymer, computational, organometallic, materials chemistry, and electrochemistry.&lt;ref name=Garcci&gt;

 |journal=[[Current Contents]]
 |volume=3 |pages=5–9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002 the core journal coverage increased to 500 and related article coverage increased to 8,000 other journals.&lt;ref&gt;

One 1980 study reported the overall citation indexing benefits for chemistry, examining the use of citations as a tool for the study of the sociology of chemistry and illustrating the use of citation data to "observe" chemistry subfields over time.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Segedunum''' was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castra|fort]] at modern-day [[Wallsend]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The fort lay at the eastern end of [[Hadrian's Wall]] (in [[Wallsend]]) near the banks of the [[River Tyne]], forming the easternmost portion of the wall. It was in use as a [[garrison]] for approximately 300 years, from around 122 AD, almost up to 400AD.

Today, Segedunum is the most thoroughly excavated fort along Hadrian's Wall, and is operated as '''Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths and Museum'''.

==Etymology==
Five places named Segedunum are known to have existed in the Roman empire, one each in Britain and Germany and three in Gaul.

The name ''Segedunum'' is known from the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' of the 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadrians-wall.info/hadrianswall/segedunum/history.htm "Segedunum: History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213025718/http://hadrians-wall.info/hadrianswall/segedunum/history.htm |date=2007-02-13 }}, ''Hadrian's Wall'' website&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no consensus on its meaning. The various conjectures include "derived from the Celtic for 'powerful' or 'victorious'",&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, R., "Hadrian’s Wallsend", ''History Today'', Volume: 50 Issue: 8, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; "derived from the [Celtic] words ''sego'' ('strength') and ''dunum'' ('fortified place')",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-britain.org/places/segedunum.htm "Segedunum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623224005/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/segedunum.htm |date=2009-06-23 }}, roman-britain.org&lt;/ref&gt; "Romano-British ''Segedunum'' 'Strong-fort'",&lt;ref&gt;Koch, J.T., ''Celtic Culture'', 2006, {{ISBN|1-85109-440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Celtic ''sechdun'' or 'dry hill'".&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright M., "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/13/martinwainwright Togas and hot tubs on the Roman way]", ''The Guardian'', 13 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first element of the name is attested widely in Gaul, Spain, Germany and Italy, and derives from the [[Indo-European root]] ''segh-'', which is reflected in various later European languages with similar meanings: [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] ''seg-'', ''segh-'' 'strength, vigour', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''hy'' 'daring, bold', [[German language|German]] ''Sieg'' 'victory', and so on. As applied to place names, it appears to have had the meaning of "place of strength" or "place of victory". The second element, ''-dunum'', is a Celtic term widely attested across Britain and Gaul and typically meant a fort. Thus ''Segedunum'' probably had the meaning of "strong fort" or "victory fort".&lt;ref&gt;The Place-Names of Roman Britain, pp. 452-3. A.L.F. Rivet &amp; Colin Smith (1979). Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-03953-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Roman wall originally terminated at [[Pons Aelius]] ([[Newcastle upon Tyne]]). Work began at Pons Aelius in 122AD and proceeded towards the west. Subsequently, in about 127AD, the wall was extended further east, possibly to protect the river crossing at Pons Aelius.  A four-mile section of the wall east from the fort of Pons Aelius, passing through present-day [[Byker]] and ending at the new fort of Segedunum was built. The new section of wall was narrower than the sections previously built, being {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m}} on a foundation of {{convert|8|ft|m}}. Unlike the rest of the wall, the extension had no [[vallum]].&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;Frank Graham, Roman Wall, Comprehensive History and Guide (1979), Frank Graham, {{ISBN|0-85983-177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort measured {{convert|453|ft|m}} from north to south and {{convert|393|ft|m}} from east to west, covering an area of {{convert|4.1|acre|m2}}. A wide ditch and an earth embankment surrounded the fort on all sides. It had four double gates with the east, west and north gates opening outside the wall and only the south gate opening within the wall. The wall joined to the west wall of the fort just south of the west gate. From the southeast angle of the fort, a {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m}} wide wall ran down to the riverbank and extended at least as far as the low water level.&lt;ref name="graham" /&gt;

There is evidence that there was an extensive [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]], or village surrounding the fort, including the area to the north of the wall.&lt;ref name="graham" /&gt;

==Garrison==
[[File:BLW Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Fragments of armour found at Segedunum]]
The original garrison of Segedunum is unknown, but in the 2nd century [[Cohors II Nerviorum]] was stationed there. In the 3rd and 4th centuries the part-mounted Fourth Cohort of the Lingones occupied the fort, as recorded in the ''Notitia Dignitatum''. Both units were 600 strong, consisting of 120 cavalry and 480 infantry.

==Subsequent history==
Sometime round about 400AD the fort was abandoned. For centuries the area remained as open farmland, but in the 18th century, collieries were sunk near the fort and the area gradually became a populous [[pit village]]. Eventually, in 1884, the whole fort disappeared under terraced housing.&lt;ref name="bruce"&gt;* J. Collingwood Bruce, Handbook to the Roman Wall (1863), Harold Hill &amp; Son, {{ISBN|0-85983-140-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 some excavations were carried out which recorded the outline of the fort. The local authority marked out this outline in white paving stones. In the 1970s the terraced houses covering the site were demolished.&lt;ref name="bruce" /&gt;

A section of Hadrian's Wall was excavated and a reconstruction built in the early 1990s. The Segedunum project began in January 1997 with a series of excavations in and around the Fort, as well as the construction of the bath house and the conversion of former Swan Hunter shipyard buildings to house the new museum. Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths &amp; Museum opened to the public in June 2000.&lt;ref name="segedunum2007"&gt;[http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/segedunum/ Segedunum official site (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Viewing Platform, Segedunum Roman Fort and Baths - geograph.org.uk - 52977.jpg|thumb|right|The viewing platform at the Segedunum Visitor Centre]]

The site of the fort now contains the excavated remains of the buildings' [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] of the original fort, as well as a reconstructed [[Roman bath|Roman military bathhouse]] based on excavated examples at [[Vindolanda]] and [[Chesters]] forts. A museum contains items of interest that were found when the site was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], and a large observation tower overlooks the site. A portion of the original [[Hadrian's Wall|wall]] is visible across the street from the museum, and a reconstruction of what the whole wall might have looked like. The central section of Hadrian's Wall was erected atop the [[Whin Sill]], a geological formation that offers a natural topographic defence against invaders or immigrants from the north. However at the eastern end of the wall, the main topographic defence was the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]] itself, and the very final stretch of the wall ran down from Segedunum fort to the river's edge. There may have been a statue or monument to mark the very end of the wall, but if there ever was, it no longer exists.&lt;ref name="hogan2007"&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18177 "Hadrian's Wall"], ed. A. Burnham, ''The Megalithic Portal''&lt;/ref&gt;

North Tyneside Council provided accommodation in the newly built Battle Hill Estate for the owners of all the houses demolished when the site was cleared. The name [[Wallsend]] comes from Segedunum being at the easternmost end of Hadrian's Wall; the westernmost end is at [[Bowness-on-Solway]].

'''Susning.nu''' (literally meaning ''[[wikt:clue|clue]].now'') was a [[Swedish language]] [[wiki]] website created by [[Lars Aronsson]] (also the founder of [[Project Runeberg]]) in 2001 and active until 2009. In its first three years, Susning.nu ran as an open wiki that anyone could edit. Susning did not have a pronounced ambition and could be compared in scope to [[Everything2]]; Aronsson's stated original aim for Susning was "to make it into whatever the users want it to be".{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} As such, Susning was an [[encyclopedia]], a [[dictionary]], and a [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] about any concept of interest to its users. Because of this, Susning grew and became [[Sweden]]'s biggest and the world's next biggest wiki.

At its peak in April 2004, Susning had over 60,000 articles on various topics, which was more than any other Swedish wiki at that time. During its first few years, it was in direct competition with the [[Swedish Wikipedia]]. However, because of the website's popularity, Susning was highly affected by [[Vandalism|vandals]]. In attempt at preventing vandalism, many efforts were made by Susning's founder Lars Aronsson, which were mostly unsuccessful. Users who regularly edited at Susning were called ''susare''.

== History ==
Susning.nu was started on August 31, 2001, by [[Lars Aronsson]] and functioned as part of his personal website. It changed to Susning.nu on September 29, and was released on October 1. During October that year, Susning.nu was indexed by the bigger [[web search engine]]s, and the article collection firmly increased. In one year, Susning.nu grew with 10,000 articles, and more features were added. Among them were link [[statistics]] for all pages, and date searching which automatically generated dates and search [[Hyperlink|links]] in several languages. The first [[edit war]] broke out on July 31, 2002.

Susning used a heavily modified version of [[UseModWiki]] as its [[wiki software|wiki engine]]. Its domain name &lt;tt&gt;[[.nu]]&lt;/tt&gt;, which belongs to the island of [[Niue]] in Oceania but which is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen as a [[domain hack]], because ''nu'' means "[[wikt:now|now]]" in Swedish (as well as [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). "''Skaffa dig en susning.nu''" was the [[slogan]] of Susning and translates to "''Get a clue.now''". (The standard [[top level domain]] for [[Sweden]] is &lt;tt&gt;[[.se]]&lt;/tt&gt;.)

=== Issues with vandalism ===
A significant difference from the [[Swedish Wikipedia]] was that Susning did not have any voluntary [[Wikipedia administrators|administrators]] who could assist in blocking other users; the only person who could do that on Susning was Lars Aronsson. As Susning grew, the issue with [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandalism]] became bigger. In December 2003, Susning was affected by a vandal who had automatized their activity through a [[scripting language|script]]. In just a few minutes, thousands of articles were deleted. Several users were forced to spend hours restoring them. The issues increased even further with vandals who added [[pornography|pornographic]] images and made the site inaccessible. The issues with vandalism were practically going on daily. To aid removal and discovery of vandalism, a "[[karma]] system" was added on February 22, 2004. The system derailed fairly soon, as the karma only could decrease. Because of this, even the most established "susare" were affected by bad karma. The karma system was shut down on March 25, 2004.

As a last attempt at preventing vandalism, the ability to see images was shut down entirely on April 5, 2004. However, a couple of days later it was possible to add images from certain chosen [[domain name]]s. Due to a [[software bug|bug]] in the system, there were ways to evade this, which the vandals utilised. The bug was fixed on April 15, 2004, but a few minutes later that day, all editing on Susning.nu was shut down. Aronsson announced that the editing abilities would be shut down until a solution to the vandalism issues had been found, and that a [[password]] system would be imposed. No details were given for the time being. A couple dozen of logged in "susare" had edited a fairly huge amount of articles since the password lock was imposed.

=== Demise and closure ===
After the imposing of the password lock, Susning became a more inactive project, and a dozen users made almost all edits. In March 2004, before the password system was imposed, articles were saved approximately 36,000 times; by May, this had been reduced to 1,600 times. On May 11, 2004, editing on Susning.nu was temporarily opened for non-logged in users, but after just 18 hours, vandalism once again became such a big problem that non-logged in editing was once again shut down. In March 2006, editing by non-logged in users was opened on Sunday afternoons between 12:00–16:00. A year later, editing between 06:00–07:00 each day was enabled as well. Overall, this worked well but with a bit of vandalism.

In mid-2008, the website was affected by a persistent [[spam (electronic)|spammer]] who used [[proxy server]]s to spam different articles with English advertisement links. In April 2009, this forced Aronsson to remove the daily editing abilities between 06:00–07:00. The editing abilities during Sunday afternoons, however, continued to be open despite recurring spam attacks. By this time, very few users were still creating and editing articles on the website, which was shut down entirely in mid-August 2009; no reason for this was ever announced.

== Criticism ==

=== Opinions ===
An aired opinion was that Susning's status as a one-man project on the technical side was a big aberration. Some meant that divided responsibility of the site probably would've meant increased innovation tact, bigger predictability and better communication between technicians and "susare". Lars Aronsson clarified that he saw Susning.nu as his own project and that he was not interested in letting others control it. After imposing editing on Sunday afternoons only, Aronsson himself used Susning mostly as a [[logbook]] where he saved links regarding, for example, [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]].

=== Advertisement ===
Unlike its main competitor, the Swedish Wikipedia, Susning.nu placed [[Advertising|advertisements]] on some of its articles. It also had no [[license agreement]], which meant that the contributions remained [[copyright]]ed by their submitters (the right to modify was said to be implicit in the site's function). This in turn meant that third parties, such as [[Wikipedia community|Wikipedia editors]], could not legally use Susning.nu materials contributed by others without permission. It also meant that Susning.nu depended solely on Lars Aronsson's willingness to continue the project.

== History ==

From the founding of the University Library into the twentieth century, rare materials were housed within the main stacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/geninfo/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Significant early acquisitions, now housed in the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, include the Richard Aron collection on German pedagogy (20,000 items),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=1155&lt;/ref&gt; acquired in 1913; the H. A. Rattermann collection of German-American literature (7,000 items),&lt;ref&gt;Donna-Christine Sell and Dennis Francis Walle, "Guide to the Heinrich A. Rattermann Collection of German-American Manuscripts", Urbana, University of Illinois, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; acquired in 1915; the James Collins collection of [[Irish literature]] (over 7.000 items),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=1209&lt;/ref&gt; acquired in 1917; the Julius Doerner collection on theology, history, and literature (50,000 items), acquired in 1918; and the Antonio Cavagna collection of Italian books and manuscripts (45,000 items),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=1149&lt;/ref&gt; acquired in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. SEXTON (comp.), Manuscripts and Printed Documents of the Archivio Cavagna Sangiuliani,  Urbana, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Harris Fletcher|Harris F. Fletcher]], a member of the English faculty from 1926 to 1962, advised the library on the purchase of books by and about [[John Milton]], often assisting during his own visits to England. In 1937, the Library decided to designate a small space on the fourth floor ("The Seventeenth Century Room") to house Fletcher's collection of approximately 5,700 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;The John Milton collections at Illinois are now among the best in the world, with hundreds of different editions of his works, including first editions of each, as well as books from Milton's library, manuscript materials, and translations. Harris Fletcher described his part in creating the collection in H. F. FLETCHER, Collection of First Editions of Milton’s Works: An Exhibition, Urbana, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript library acquired the large personal collection of Professor and [[Shakespeare]] scholar Thomas W. Baldwin, with strong holdings in [[Renaissance]] pedagogy, literature, drama, history, and politics in an attempt to collect books that Shakespeare and his contemporaries might have read in their lifetimes. As a result of these and other acquisitions, the library is a significant repository of English imprints from the 16th to 19th centuries&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the collection, see P. N.CRONENWETT, K. OSBORN, S.A.  STREIT  (eds.), Celebrating Research: Rare and Special Collections from the Membership of the Association of Research Libraries, Washington, DC, 2007, pp. 118-19.&lt;/ref&gt; and incunabula, including numerous items from the New Haven firm of C. A. Stonehill.&lt;ref&gt;These and other monuments of English printing from the Illinois collections are featured in V. HOTCHKISS AND F. C. ROBINSON. English in Print from Caxton to Shakespeare to Milton, Urbana and Chicago, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The library also began collecting incunabula; by 1950, its collection of pre-1501 imprints numbered nearly 400.

The library developed some of its specialties following specific major acquisitions. An elephant [[folio]] of [[James Audubon|Audubon]]’s ''[[The Birds of America]]'' (1826–38) is the centerpiece of substantial ornithological holdings. The library acquired 82 cubic feet of [[H. G. Wells]] manuscripts in 1954 and has since added numerous related items and small collections to its Wells holdings. The RBML also holds a large collection of [[Marcel Proust]] correspondence, comprised in part of materials collected by professor-collector Philip Kolb; the current Proust collection includes over 1,100 holographic items, as well as additional resources for research on Proust and his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Under the leadership of [[Robert B. Downs]] (1958-1974), the University Library began identifying rare titles throughout the general stacks and subject libraries, bringing them together in a new, larger space designated the Rare Book Room. Downs actively sought to enlarge the library's holdings in its areas of strength and to develop new areas of interest. During his tenure, the library acquired numerous major collections, including the Lloyd Francis Nickell collection of eighteenth-century English literature (2,000 volumes),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=1181&lt;/ref&gt; the Ewin Cannon Baskette collection on freedom of expression (10,000 items);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=33&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Civil War]] collection;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=1412&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=62614&lt;/ref&gt; the Marvin T. Herrick collection of Italian plays from 1500 to 1700 (500 items),&lt;ref&gt;M. T. Herrick, Italian Plays, 1500-1700, in the University of Illinois Library, Urbana and Chicago, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jacob Hollander]] collection of economic history (4,470 items);&lt;ref&gt;J. H. HOLLANDER AND E. MARSH, The Economic Library of Jacob H. Hollander. Baltimore, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; the Franklin J.

In 2017, [[Lynne M. Thomas]] was named the Juanita J. and Robert E. Simpson Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Professor of The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign).&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Heckel, [https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/535069 "University of Illinois alumna to head Rare Book and Manuscript Library"] ''Illinois News Bureau'' (July 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==

=== Pre&amp;ndash;1500 books ===

The collection of over twelve hundred [[Incunable|Incunabula]] from the fifteenth century is one of the largest university collections in the United States and is especially strong in classical texts, theology, pedagogy, and science.

=== Early modern books (1500&amp;ndash;1800) ===

The library's strengths include materials from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The library holds significant collections of books by and about writers such as [[Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton]], as well as various important editions of [[the Bible]] and pedagogical materials.

=== Modern books (1800&amp;ndash;present) ===

Literature, history, and science are well represented, with strong holdings in first editions of nineteenth- and twentieth-century English authors, books related to travel and exploration, and social history. Also noteworthy are collections in radical literature and Anarchist newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/archon/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=5&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=10278&lt;/ref&gt; natural history, fine press and typography, and the history of publishing. The library also holds 162 cubic feet of unpublished film and television scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Allen and Robert L. Carringer, "An Annotated Catalog of Unpublished Film and Television Scripts at the University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign", Urbana, University of Illinois, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscripts ===
The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library's manuscript collections contain materials dated from approximately 3000 BCE to the present day, including clay tablets, medieval illuminated manuscripts, early modern codices and documents, and modern records. Manuscript holdings are subdivided internally by size and date. The bulk of the RBML's early manuscripts are codices covering subjects such as religion, music, and history, but it also holds a [[cuneiform]] tablet, [[papyrus]] fragments, and individual and groups of manuscripts. Many of these early materials are written in [[Latin]].

The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library also has an extensive collection of manuscripts created after 1650, including codices, single-item and small collections, and large collections. The library owns the world's largest collection of [[Marcel Proust]] correspondence, as well as the personal papers of [[H. G. Wells]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[William S. Merwin|W.S Merwin]], and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-03/site/chi-gwendolyn-brooks-archive-university-illinois-20140103_1_illinois-poet-laureate-poems-nora-brooks-blakely&lt;/ref&gt; Several collections pertain to the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the library has a collection of materials created by the [[Combat Paper Project]]. The library's later manuscripts complement its other holdings in subjects such as literature, history, natural history, and music. Most of the manuscripts are in English, but languages such as [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] are well represented. The library also owns items in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and a [[Batak languages|Batak language]].

Collection of Count Antonio Cavagna Sangiuliani di Gualdana (1843-1913), Italian nobleman, writer and bibliophile consists of 90 cu. ft. of manuscripts and pamphlets on [[Italian history]] from 1116 to 1913 with special emphasis on the [[Italian Unification]] period around 1871. It is one of the largest collections of Italian language materials in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/collections_manuscript_collections.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iSchool at Illinois ===

The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Illinois is deeply involved in the training of new generations of curators and special collections librarians. Jointly with the [[UIUC School of Information Sciences]] (iSchool at Illinois), the library offers a Certificate in Special Collections Librarianship with courses on a wide range of topics, including special collections librarianship, exhibition preparation, bookbinding, medieval manuscripts, the history of paper, bibliographic description, and rare book cataloging.  The program emphasizes an apprenticeship model, and two to ten iSchool students work in the library every semester.

[[Gore Vidal]]'s 1998 novel '''''The Smithsonian Institution''''' is a fictional account of the adventures of "T." as he helps a group of scientists in the basement of the [[Smithsonian]] create the [[neutron bomb]], and encounters historical figures such as President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and Mrs. [[Grover Cleveland]].

Vidal supposedly claimed that this was the inspiration for the 2006 film ''[[Night at the Museum]]''{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.  The film was in fact based on the 1993 children's book ''[[The Night at the Museum]]''{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.  The original version of that children's book had the night watchmen seeing dinosaurs come to life—not historical figures—and not inside the Smithsonian, as they do in Vidal's novel.

'''Thomas Messinger Drown''' (March 19, 1842 – November 17, 1904) was the fourth [[University President]] of [[Lehigh University]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], United States. He was also an [[analytical chemist]] and [[metallurgist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed007p2875 | title=Thomas Messinger Drown | author=Billinger, R. D. | journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |date=December 1930 | volume=7 | issue=12 | page=2875 | doi=10.1021/ed007p2875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
He was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania in 1842. He graduated from [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in Philadelphia in 1859,&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Drown, Thomas Messinger|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then went on to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and graduated in 1862. He went abroad to Germany to study [[chemistry]] in [[Freiberg, Saxony]], and [[mining]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. From 1869 to 1870 he was an instructor of [[metallurgy]] at [[Harvard University]]. In 1870, he started a consulting business in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Drown, Thomas Messinger|year=1930|author=Henry P. Talbot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, he hired a former student, [[John Townsend Baker]], as an assistant. From 1874 to 1881, he was professor of [[Analytical Chemistry]] at [[Lafayette College]].&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; Baker followed him to Lafayette and later would found the [[J. T. Baker Chemical Co.]], which merged with [[Mallinckrodt]] and was absorbed and spun off of [[Tyco International]] as a component company of [[Covidien]].&lt;ref name="Moynihan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Joan|title=Purity by the ounce: J. T. Baker’s dissatisfaction with flawed research material refined the chemical industry|journal=Today's Chemist at Work|date=March 2002|volume=11|issue=3|pages=53–55|url=http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/11/i03/html/03chemchron.html|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His professional career was interrupted in 1881, when, after the death of his father, he devoted himself to family matters.  He restarted his professional work in 1885 by accepting a professorship at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Massachusetts activity==
He helped start MIT's [[chemical engineering]] curriculum in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doherty|first1=Bill|title=Lehigh inaugurations bridge past, future|website=Lehigh University news|date=January 24, 2007|url=http://www1.lehigh.edu/news/lehigh-inaugurations-bridge-past-future}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, he was appointed by the newly formed Massachusetts Board of Health to a landmark study of sanitary quality of the state's inland waters. As consulting chemist to the Massachusetts State Board of Health, he was in charge of the famous [[Lawrence Experiment Station]] laboratory conducting the water sampling, testing, and analysis. There he put to work the environmental chemist and first female graduate of MIT, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]. This research created the famous "normal chlorine" map of Massachusetts that was the first of its kind and was the template for others. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tributes to Ellen Swallow Richards|journal=Technology Review|date=1911|volume=13|pages=365–373|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-tributes.html|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a professor, Drown published a number of papers on metallurgy, mostly in ''Transactions'' of the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining Engineers]]. He was a founding member of the Institute,&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; and served as its secretary, and editor of its ''Transactions'' from 1871 till 1884. He was elected its president in 1897.

==Lehigh presidency==
In 1895 he left MIT to become the fourth President of [[Lehigh University]]. Lehigh's endowment was predominantly in the stock of the major company of its founder, [[Asa Packer]]'s [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]. The [[Panic of 1893]] crashed the market, brought the country into depression that lasted years, and nearly brought the university to financial insolvency. Many prominent railroads such as the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and the [[Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad]] went into bankruptcy, and over 15,000 companies and 500 banks failed. In order to gain new sources of funding, President Drown broke the university's ties with the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in 1897, qualifying the university for aid from the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]].  During his term, which started during a major financial crisis, he was able to save Lehigh from bankruptcy, grow enrollment, which had dipped seriously, grow academics, and even have one major building erected.

A broad intellectual with interests in various fields, he nonetheless thought the key to Lehigh's success would be the school of technology.  There he sought to broaden and deepen the offerings, increase the quality and quantity of laboratory space, equipment and apparatus, as funding permitted.  Additionally, and in consultation with the faculty and the Board of Trustees, he created many new tiers of teaching, including the associate and assistant professorships.  His idea was that this would create resources for top Professors to be invited to Lehigh, and so help enlarge the curricula.  During his tenure, the University's first emeritus Professorship was granted (Harding of Physics), and first Doctorate awarded (Joseph W. Richards).  Many new degrees in the technical school were now being offered, such as Metallurgy (1891), Electrometallurgy, and Chemical Engineering (1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yates |first=W.Ross |title=[[Lehigh University]] |date=1992 |pages=90–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The curriculum leading to a degree in arts and engineering was established, as was the department of [[zoology]] and [[biology]].  New courses (majors, that is, or degree offerings, as it is ''now'' known) were also adopted in geology, and physics.

Dr. Drown eventually gained in popularity on campus, with his forward ideas, success, idiosyncratic pince-nez glasses and mustache.  Faculty members eventually came to refer to Dr. Drown as "chief".  Unfortunately, T. M. Drown would not live long enough to see all his ideas to fruition, as he passed in office, following abdominal surgery, Nov. 16, 1904, effectively ending his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yates |first=W.Ross |title=[[Lehigh University]] |date=1992 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sermon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yates|first1=W. Ross|title=Sermon in Stone: Packer Memorial Church, An Historical Essay|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/eb/supp/2732/index.pdf|website=Lehigh University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams Hall (1903), a Beaux Arts inspired Brick structure, was erected to house the growing departments of Biology and Geology, among other functions.

In 1908, Lehigh University opened up [[Lehigh University Buildings|Drown Hall]] which now houses Lehigh's English Department.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7735">[[Image:mandalay kuthodaw.jpg|thumb|Some of the 729 [[stupa]]s at Kuthodaw Temple]]
'''Stone tablets inscribed with the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''''' (and other [[Buddhist texts]]) stand upright in the grounds of the [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] (''kuthodaw'' means "royal merit") at the foot of [[Mandalay Hill]] in [[Mandalay]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma). The work was commissioned by King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]] as part of his transformation of Mandalay into a royal capital. It was completed in 1868. The text contains the Buddhist canon in the [[Burmese language]].

There are 730 tablets and 1,460 pages. Each page is {{convert|1.07|m|ft|frac=2}} wide, {{convert|1.53|m|ft|0}} tall and {{convert|13|cm|frac=64}} thick. Each stone tablet has its own roof and precious gem on top in a small cave-like structure of [[Sri Lanka|Sinhalese]] relic casket type called ''kyauksa gu'' (stone inscription cave in Burmese), and they are arranged around a central golden pagoda.&lt;ref name="lda"&gt;{{cite book|title=The World's Biggest Book|author=[[Ludu Daw Amar]] - English translation by Prof. [[Than Tun]]|year=1974|publisher=Kyipwayay Press|location=Mandalay|pages=22, 9, 14, 50–52, 22, appendix,53–55, 24–35, 33, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal merit==
[[Image:Kuthodaw alt view.JPG|thumb|left|Kuthodaw pagoda, view from the middle enclosure (south)]]
[[Image:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|One of the stone inscriptions, originally in gold letters and borders, at Kuthodaw]]
The pagoda itself was built as part of the traditional foundations of the new royal city which also included a ''pitakat taik'' or library for religious scriptures, but [[Mindon Min|King Mindon]] wanted to leave a great work of merit for posterity meant to last five millennia after the [[Gautama Buddha]] who lived around 500 BC. When the [[Great Britain|British]] invaded southern Burma in the mid-19th century, Mindon Min was concerned that [[Buddhist]] [[dhamma]] (teachings) would also be detrimentally affected in the North where he reigned. As well as organizing the [[Fifth Buddhist council]] in 1871, he was responsible for the construction in Mandalay of the world's largest book, consisting of 729 large marble tablets with the [[Tipitaka]] [[Pali canon]] of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] inscribed on them in gold. One more was added to record how it all came about, making it 730 stone inscriptions in total.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;

The marble was quarried from Sagyin Hill {{convert|32|miles}} north of Mandalay, and transported by river to the city. Work began on 14 October 1860 in a large shed near [[Mandalay Palace]]. The text had been meticulously edited by tiers of senior monks and lay officials consulting the ''Tipitaka'' (meaning "three baskets", namely [[Vinaya Pitaka]], [[Sutta Pitaka]] and [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]) kept in royal libraries in the form of ''peisa'' or palm leaf manuscripts. Scribes carefully copied the text on marble for stonemasons. Each stone has 80 to 100 lines of inscription on each side in round [[Burmese script]], chiseled out and originally filled in with gold ink. It took a scribe three days to copy both the obverse and the reverse sides, and a stonemason could finish up to 16 lines a day. All the stones were completed and opened to the public on 4 May 1868.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;

==Assembly and contents==
The stones are arranged in neat rows within three enclosures, 42 in the innermost, 168 in the middle and 519 in the outermost enclosure. The caves are numbered  starting from the west going clockwise (''let ya yit'') forming  complete rings as follows:&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;

Thirty years later in 1900, a print copy of the text came out in a set of 38 volumes in Royal [[Octavo]] size of about 400 pages each in Great Primer type. The publisher, Philip H. Ripley of Hanthawaddy Press, claimed that his books were "true copies of the ''Pitaka'' inscribed on stones by King Mindon". Ripley was a Burmese-born Briton brought up in the royal court of Mandalay by the king and went to school with the royal princes including [[Thibaw Min]], the last king of Burma. At the age of 17 he fled to [[Yangon|Rangoon]] when palace intrigues and a royal massacre broke out after the death of King Mindon, and he had the [[galley proofs]] checked against the stones.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;

==Annexation, desecration and restoration==

The British later invaded the North, the gems and other valuables were looted, and the buildings and images vandalised by the troops billeted in the temples and pagodas near the walled city and Mandalay Hill. When the troops withdrew from religious sites after a successful petition to [[Queen Victoria]], restoration work began in earnest in 1892 organised by a committee formed by senior monks, members of the royal family and former officers of the king including Atumashi Sayadaw (Abbot of [[Atumashi Monastery]]), [[Kinwon Min Gyi]] U Kaung (chancellor), Hleithin Atwinwun (minister of the royal fleet), [[Yaunghwe]] [[Saopha]] Sir Saw Maung (a [[Shan state|Shan prince]]), and Mobyè Sitkè (a general in the royal army). In the tradition of the time, when something needed repair, it was first offered to the relatives of those who had originally made the ''[[Dāna]]'' (donation) and they came forward and assisted in making repairs. The public was then asked for help, but the full original glory was not achieved.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;

The gold writing had disappeared from all 729 marble tablets, along with the bells from the ''hti'' (umbrella or crown) of each of the small [[stupa]]s, and they were now marked in black ink, made from [[shellac]], soot from paraffin lamps and straw ash, rather than in gold, and few of the gems still exist.  Mobyè Sitkè also asked permission from senior monks to plant star flower trees (''[[Mimusops elengi]]'') between the rows of ''kyauksa gu''s.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt;  The inscriptions have been re-inked several times since [[Thibaw Min|King Thibaw]] had it done for the second time in gold. The undergrowth amongst the caves was cleared and paved through public donations appealed for in the ''[[Ludu U Hla|Ludu Daily]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name="lda"/&gt; The words of the Buddha are still preserved in this place which is therefore a popular destination for devout Buddhists as well as scholars and tourists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">'''Variable data printing''' ('''VDP''') (also known as '''variable information printing''' ('''VIP''') or '''variable imaging''' ('''VI''')) is a form of digital printing,  including [[on-demand printing]], in which elements such as [[Writing|text]], [[graphics]] and [[image]]s may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing process and using information from a [[database]] or external file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC’s of VDP – A Variable Data Printing Basics Guide|url=http://www.efi.com/documents/promo/abc/ABCs_VDP_Letter.pdf|publisher=Electronics for Imaging, Inc.|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a set of personalized letters, each with the same basic layout, can be printed with a different name and address  on each letter. Variable data printing is mainly used for [[direct marketing]], [[customer relationship management]], [[advertising]], invoicing and  applying addressing&lt;ref name="Mailing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saving Mailing Costs with Variable Data Printing|url=http://www.ondemandexpo.com/on-demand-newsletter/saving-mailing-costs-with-variable-data-printing|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=On Demand Expo eNewletter|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on selfmailers, brochures or postcard campaigns.

==Variable data printing==

VDP is a direct outgrowth of [[digital printing]], which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional [[offset printing]]. Variable data printing enables the [[mass customization]] of documents via digital print technology, as opposed to the '[[mass-production]]' of a single document using [[offset lithography]]. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.

The returns for variable printing vary from double the normal return at the basic level to 10–15 times the return for fully variable jobs.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This naturally depends on content and the relevancy of that content, but the technique presents an effective tool for increasing [[return on investment|ROI]] on marketing campaigns.

There are several levels of variable printing. The most basic level involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like [[mail merge]]. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated by a set of application and style rules and the information contained in the database.

There are three main operational methodologies for variable data printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variable-Data Printing: Personalized Delivery of Information for the 21st Century|url=http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|publisher=Rockport Custom Publishing, LLC|accessdate=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001035330/http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|archive-date=1 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one methodology, a static document is loaded into printer memory.  The printer is instructed, through the [[print driver]] or [[raster image processor]] (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page out to the printer driver or RIP.  Variable data can then be printed on top of the static document.  This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical mail merge.

A second methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) print file&lt;ref name="Tongues"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking In Tongues: Sorting Out Variable Data Printing Languages|url=http://www.fujixerox.com.au/products/image/media/TSR-0906-Speak-Tongues-reprint.pdf|work=Volume 7, Number 17|publisher=The Seybold Report|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with every image being merged into every page.  A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large print files can overwhelm the RIP's processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job of more than a few hundred pages.

A third methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized print files, such as [[PDF/VT]], PostScript or [[PPML]],&lt;ref name="Tongues" /&gt; that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hohensee|first=Reinhard|title=Managing Variable Data Full-Color Printing at High Speeds|url=http://www.infoprintsolutionscompany.com/internet/comnelit.nsf/Files/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint/$File/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint.pdf|publisher=InfoPrint Solutions|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and services==

There are many software packages available to merge text and images into VDP print files. Some are stand-alone software packages, however most of the advanced VDP software packages are actually plug-in modules for one or more publishing software packages such as [[Adobe Creative Suite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Generation of Variable Data Publishing Solutions|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated|accessdate=5 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002170743/http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides VDP software, other software packages may be necessary for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States ([[United States Postal Service]]) and Canada to take advantage of reduced postage for [[bulk mailing]].&lt;ref name="Mailing" /&gt; Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, [[Canada Post]] now offers a 'Machineable'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/default-e.asp&lt;/ref&gt; personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates. 

Software to manage data quality (e.g. for duplicate removal or handling of bad records) and uniformity may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Franziska|title=Upstream Database and Digital Asset Management in Variable Data Printing|url=http://print.rit.edu/pubs/picrm200801.pdf|publisher=Printing Industry Center at RIT|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of purchasing software, various companies provide an assortment of VDP-related print file, mailing and data services.

==Benefits==

The difference between variable data printing and traditional printing is the personalization that is involved. Personalization allows a company to connect to its customers. Variable data printing is more than a variable name or address in a printed piece; in the past, a variable name would have been effective, because it was a new concept at the time. In today’s world, personalization has to reflect what the customer values. In order for VDP to be successful, the company must know something about the customer. For example, a customer who loves baseball receives a VDP postcard with an image of their favorite baseball player. The postcard is effective, because the customer is more likely to read what is on it. An example of an ineffective VDP piece would be to mail a postcard to the same customer with an image of a soccer player. If the customer has no interest in soccer, then he or she may or may not pay attention to the postcard. The idea is to add value to the customer through the ability to relate to them. Personalization allows a company to relate, communicate, and possibly start a relationship with a prospective customer and to maintain a relationship with their current customers. A prospect that is converted to a customer can then be converted to a loyal customer. Companies want to create loyal customers, and variable data printing can help gain these types of customers, along with quality work and service.&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney|first=Jim|title=Variable data printing update|url=http://multichannelmerchant.com/printchannel/0301-variable-data-printing-update/index.html|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another benefit is the increase in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the mailed piece has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A mailed piece that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Integration==

Variable data printing can be combined with other platforms – such as [[Persistent uniform resource locator|PURLS]], email blasts, and QR codes; all three platforms are considered marketing tools. Many people have found the benefit of combining all of these platforms in order to have a successful campaign. Email blasts and PURLS allow a company to find out information about their consumer. An email blasts usually doesn’t contain much personalization, but it can. The bulk of the personalization would be seen in a PURL. A PURL is a personalized uniform resource locator (URL). In short, it is a landing page. It is also where most of the knowledge about the consumer will be gained. The email blasts will contain a PURL, which will lead the consumer to a personalized page. The PURL is where a company can gain information about the consumer through the requested information. The QR code can be added to a mailed piece. It works like an email blasts. It directs the consumer to a website. The integration of these three platforms can help a campaign.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Origin of the concept==

The origin of the term variable data printing is widely credited to Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Mr. Romano does not explicitly take credit for coining the term &lt;ref name="Romano"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Frank Romano on VDP
| publisher = Digital Formatting Services
 | date = 17 January 2013
 | url = http://www.ez-vdp.com/content.cfm?id=2063&amp;le=1
 | format = web page
| accessdate = 18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but points to his use of it as early as 1969 and its appearance in the 1999 book, “Personalized and Database Printing”, that he authored with David Broudy.&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;

The concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in recent years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

The '''Wiltshire Record Society''' is a [[text publication society]] in Wiltshire, England, which edits and publishes historic documents concerned with the [[history of Wiltshire]].

==History==
In 1937 [[Ralph Pugh]] was the chief mover in a proposal to found the records branch of the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R. J. Currie, 'Pugh, Ralph Bernard (1910–1982)', in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/73257 online edition] (subscription required), May 2010, accessed 7 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Records Branch was established in 1939, and in 1967 it became the Wiltshire Record Society, an independent organisation in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;'About Us' [http://www.wiltshirerecordsociety.org.uk/us/ Wiltshire Record Society]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the numbering of the volumes published has remained continuous, the last volume published by the Records Branch being number 21 and the first volume under the new regime being number 22.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rolls of Highworth Hundred, 1275–1287'' Part 2 (1968), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The books published by both have all been bound in pale blue cloth and have the same size and format.

The work of the Society is funded by the subscribing members, some of them being academic bodies and libraries, but most are private individuals. An [[annual general meeting]] is held in Wiltshire once a year, usually in June.

== Details ==
The ''Zhonghua Zihai'' consists of two parts; the first section consists of characters covered in earlier dictionaries, such as the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', ''[[Yupian]]'', ''[[Guangyun]]'', ''[[Jiyun]]'', ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Zhonghua Da Zidian]]'', which covers just under 50,000 individual characters.&lt;ref name=hao&gt;[http://www.zzgwu.com/wiki/index.php?doc-view-653359 《中华字海》-甲骨文---泽泽百科] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222195729/http://www.zzgwu.com/wiki/index.php?doc-view-653359 |date=February 22, 2012 }} "'Zhonghua Zihai' consists of two parts: part of land from the existing Chinese dictionaries, such as the "Shuo Wen Jie Zi", "Part-yu", "Guangyun", "Chinese Melodies", "Kangxi", "Chinese dictionary "All the book characters, etc.; the other part is the calendar tool failure who should be included in the word, including Tibetan Buddhist difficult difficult word word Road, Dunhuang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, dialect words, science and technology, new characters, as well as the names of today's still and names with the word."&lt;/ref&gt; The second portion of the ''Zhonghua Zihai'' contains characters missed by previous dictionaries, as a result of manual error or due to lack of knowledge of such characters. Among these include complex characters hidden in old Buddhist texts, rare characters found within the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], characters used during the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties that fell from use, dialectal characters, newly created characters as a result of advancement in science and technology (such as the Chinese character for the element [[Darmstadtium]], 鐽, which is not present in prior dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;Note: The [[Traditional Chinese]] character used in [[Taiwan]] is "[[wikt:鐽|鐽]]", while the [[Simplified Chinese]] character used in [[Mainland China]] is 𫟼 ([[File:943D simplified.svg|20px|𫟼]], a simplified 金 radical (钅) next to a 达 (According to [[Xinhua Zidian]], 10th Edition)). Both characters are pronounced "dá". Darmstadtium was first synthesized on November 9, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as rare characters used today in personal and location names.&lt;ref name=hao/&gt; Additionally, regional characters and variant characters from [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Singapore]], as well as non-native characters from Japanese [[Kanji]] and Korean [[Hanja]], are also listed in the ''Zhonghua Zihai''. All characters listed are in the [[Regular script|Kaishu]] script.

One of the authors, Hu Mingyang, wrote in the preface of the ''Zhonghua Zihai'' stating that the problem regarding Chinese characters is that there is an exceedingly large number of them,&lt;ref name=taipei/&gt; which makes compilation very difficult, and a complete dictionary practically impossible due to the large number of variant characters and those that are unknown.

== Development ==
The foundation in which the compilation of characters was undertaken are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.wangchao.net.cn/detail_%25E4%25B8%25AD%25E5%258D%258E%25E5%25AD%2597%25E6%25B5%25B7.html Wangchao (Dynasty) Encyclopedia : Zhonghua Zihai]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The copying of characters found in dictionaries from past dynasties, for the collection of those characters already listed in some published volume.
#The analysis of documents and literature from past dynasties for previously unlisted characters.
#The inclusion of all [[Simplified Chinese]] characters introduced by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], already listed in the "Complete List of Simplified Characters" ({{zh|c=简化字总表|p=jiǎn huà zì zǒng biǎo}}) announced in 1986.
#The analysis of [[Oracle bone script]] and [[Bronze script]] texts, as well as historic silk writings, for comparative purposes in the decision process for accepting characters.
#The comparison of [[Variant Chinese character]]s from past dynasties found in stone engravings (where characters with minimal variation are generally not accepted in the final listing).
#The analysis of local documents and that of [[List of Chinese dialects|regional dialects]], such as dialectal dictionaries.
#The inclusion of newly created characters associated with modern concepts, such as those arising from new scientific and technological developments.
#The analysis of characters used in [[proper nouns]], such as the names of locations and characters used in [[personal name]]s.
#The analysis of modern publications which may include unofficial or informal character simplifications, in which they may not be present in the PRC government "Complete List of Simplified Characters" (a similar example of this would be [[Ryakuji]]).
#The inclusion of characters from the failed simplified character reform in 1977 to introduce the [[Second-round simplified Chinese character]]s, taken from the draft of the proposed bill.
#The inclusion of rare variants and popular regional characters from areas such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]], plus the unique characters in use in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] but not within China.

== Other dictionaries ==
The previous character dictionary published in China was the ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', introduced in 1989, which contained 54,678 characters. In [[Japan]], the 2003 edition of the ''[[Dai Kan-Wa jiten]]'' has some 50,000 characters, while the ''[[Han-Han Dae Sajeon]]'' completed in [[South Korea]] in 2008 contains 53,667 Chinese characters (the project having lasted 30 years, at a cost of 31,000,000,000 [[South Korean Won|KRW]] or US$25 million&lt;ref name=log/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2008012509544767 University World News – SOUTH KOREA: After 30 years: world’s largest Chinese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200810/200810020006.html World’s Biggest Chinese Dictionary Completed – Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205035634/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200810/200810020006.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

''The Dictionary of Chinese Variant Form'' ({{zh|c=異體字字典|p=yìtǐzì zìdiǎn}}) compiled by the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Taiwan (ROC) Ministry of Education]] in 2004 contains 106,230 individual characters,&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;Kuang-Hui Chiu, Chi-Ching Hsu, [http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc Chinese Dilemma: How Many Ideographs are needed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015011/http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc |date=July 17, 2011 }}, National Taipei University, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.variants.moe.edu.tw/start.htm 《異體字字典》網路版說明] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317074327/http://dict.variants.moe.edu.tw/start.htm |date=March 17, 2009 }} Official website for "The Dictionary of Chinese Variant Form", Introductory page&lt;/ref&gt; many being [[Variant Chinese character|variants]].
