'''Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver''' (born July 20, 1965) is an American activist for people with [[Mental retardation|intellectual disabilities]]. In 1989, he founded [[Best Buddies International]], an international organization that helps people with intellectual disabilities to find employment and social opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestbuddies.org/best-buddies/anthony-shriver Official biography, Best Buddies International]&lt;/ref&gt; Through his mother, he is a nephew of World War II casualty [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], President [[John F. Kennedy]], Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].

==Early life and education==
Shriver was born July 20, 1965 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Eunice Mary Kennedy|Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] and [[Robert Sargent Shriver|Sargent Shriver]], Jr. His mother is the founder of Special Olympics and his father is a founding director of the Peace Corps. Through his mother, he is a nephew of World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish, and Senator Ted Kennedy. Anthony Shriver is the youngest of five children.

He graduated from the [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gprep.org/about/alumni/notable-alumni |title=Notable Alumni |publisher=Georgetown Preparatory School |accessdate=October 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Brown University]] before transferring to [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], from which he graduated in 1988 with a double major in theology and history.

==Career==
Shriver is the founder and chairman of [[Best Buddies International]] a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization which he created in 1989. Best Buddies is a nonprofit organization that provides adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities social inclusion and job opportunities. He has been able to get the organization to spread throughout the world and it has over 1500 chapters today.&lt;ref&gt;"Best Buddies International." Best Buddies International. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Sept. 2013.&lt;http://www.bestbuddies.org/best-buddies&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Shriver spoke in 2008 about the all-inclusive nature of the program:
"The great thing about Best Buddies is there’s something for everybody. You can be a volunteer in some shape, form or fashion, whether you’re volunteering to get your kids involved, whether your son or daughter is involved in their school program, whether you want to be a mentor yourself as an adult, whether you want to get an online Buddy, whether you’re an employer and want to hire someone with a disability to work in your office—if you’ve got any sense of motivation and determination and want to give back, there’s a role for you at Best Buddies, which I think is pretty unique. Even in Special Olympics, for most people, you can be a coach or a spectator, but you’re not going to run the 50-yard dash. In Best Buddies, you’re running the 50-yard dash with your Buddy. People get a different level of experience by participating, as opposed to writing a check, though that’s important, too. But beyond writing checks, we need people to get involved and give their time."&lt;ref&gt;"Kennedy's - Best Buddies and ICons." Kennedy's - Best Buddies and ICons. N.p., Oct.-Nov. 2008. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. &lt;http://abilitymagazine.com/Kennedy.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Best Buddies has grown into a leading nonprofit entity with increasing international reach across six continents; establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

In addition, Anthony and his brother Timothy (the chairman of the Special Olympics) have recently aligned Best Buddies and the Special Olympics to create the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Challenge event, aimed to encourage greater acceptance and inclusion for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Shriver has also been a director of UniCapital Corp. since March 1998. UniCapital Corp. is an investment house.&lt;ref&gt;"Anthony K. Shriver." Businessweek.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. &lt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=760218&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently on the [[board of directors]] of [[Level Brands]].&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Level Brands|url=https://levelbrands.com/about/|accessdate=25 January 2018|website=levelbrands.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Shriver - along with most members of the extended Kennedy family - is a part of the Democratic Party. In 2005, he considered running for Governor of Florida in the 2006 election. He was said to have considered a run for Governor of Florida in the 2010 election.&lt;ref&gt;Sokol, Brett. "The Camelot Legacy." - Page 1. N.p., 20 Jan. 2005. Web. 13 Oct. 2013.&lt;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2005-01-20/news/the-camelot-legacy/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shriver married Alina Mojica (born January 5, 1965, in Pinar Del Rio, Cuba) on July 2, 1993, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He resides in Miami Beach, together with Alina and their five children: Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver, Jr. (born September 4, 1988), Eunice Julia Shriver (born January 4, 1994), Francesca Maria Shriver (born December 12, 1994), Carolina Fitzgerald Kennedy Shriver (born June 28, 2001), and John Joseph Sargent Shriver (born July 1, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;6."Shriver, Anthony."

After graduating in 1992, Forbes worked as an actress for several years, performing [[Off-Broadway]] in New York City. She then became a musician, forming a band and recording a solo album. She sang the song "Ordinary Girl" for the television series ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]]'' and "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera Sera]]" over the credits for the movie ''[[In the Cut]]''.&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt; While living in Portland, Oregon, Lauderdale asked her to sing with [[Pink Martini]], a band he had assembled to play at political fundraisers. After three years commuting from New York, she moved to Portland in 1998 to work full-time with the band.&lt;ref name="uk"/&gt; Forbes and Lauderdale co-wrote the band's hit "Sympathique (Je ne Veux Pas Travailler)" among many other band originals.

Apart from her work with Pink Martini, she has released solo albums, including ''Love Handle'' (November 1995) and ''{{'}}78'' ([[Heinz Records|Heinz]]2008) which includes her song "Hey Eugene" in its original version.  She is featured on [[Michael Feinstein]]'s album ''[[The Sinatra Project]]'', singing a duet of "How Long Will It Last?"&lt;ref name="feinstein"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Holden|date=August 31, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/arts/music/01fein.html|title=Feinstein Comes Full Swing to Capitol-Era Sinatra|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded two songs in French with [[Georges Moustaki]] for his album ''Solitaire''.

On June 21, 2011, Pink Martini announced that Forbes was taking an extended leave of absence for at least one year for surgery on her vocal cords.  She made a full recovery and was back on stage with the band within 5 months. Forbes is thanked in the liner notes to ''[[1969 (Pink Martini album)|1969]]'', the band's album with Japanese vocalist [[Saori Yuki]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The '''Citigroup Center''' (formerly '''Citicorp Center''' and now known by its address, '''601 Lexington Avenue''') is an office tower in [[New York City]], located at [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] between [[Lexington Avenue]] and [[Third Avenue]] in midtown [[Manhattan]]. It was built in 1977 to house the headquarters of [[Citibank]]. It is 915 feet (279 m) tall, and has 59 floors with 1.3 million square feet (120,000 m²) of office space.

The building is one of the most distinctive and imposing in New York's skyline, thanks to a 45° angled top and a unique [[Stilts (architecture)|stilt]]-style base. It was designed by architect [[Hugh Stubbins]] and structural engineer [[William LeMessurier]]. The building is currently owned by [[Boston Properties]], and in 2009, was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue.

The northwest corner of the site was originally occupied by St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church which was founded in 1862 (as the Deutsche Evangelische Lutherische Sanct Petri-Kirche, the original church building was sold and demolished to construct the Grand Central Terminal in 1903). In 1905, the church moved to the location of 54th Street and Lexington Avenue, where it remained until the building was purchased by First National City Bank (later known as Citibank) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/StPeterLuth.html |title=St. Peter Lutheran Church|website=NYC Ago |access-date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the Citigroup Center was an engineering challenge. When planning for the skyscraper began in the early 1970s, the northwest corner of the proposed building site was occupied by St. Peter's Lutheran Church. The church allowed Citicorp to demolish the old church and build the skyscraper under one condition: a new church would have to be built on the same corner, with no connection to the Citicorp building and no columns passing through it, because the church wanted to remain on the site of the new development, near one of the intersections. Architects wondered at the time if this demand was too much and would make the proposal unfeasible.

Structural engineer William LeMessurier set the 59-story tower on four massive columns, 114 feet (35 meters) high, positioned at the center of each side, rather than at the corners. This design allowed the corners of the building to [[cantilever]] 72 feet (22 meters), providing space at the northwest corner for the new church. To help accomplish this, LeMessurier employed a system of stacked load-bearing braces, in the form of inverted [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]]. Each chevron is designed to distribute tension loads (due to wind) to their center, then downward into the ground through the uniquely positioned columns.

The church, at 619 Lexington Avenue with its entrance from [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], has a theatre in its basement which is mainly used by the [[York Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorktheatre.org/our-venue.html Our Venue], [[York Theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering crisis of 1978===
[[File:CitigroupCenterNight.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Night view of Citigroup Center from [[GE Building]].]]
Due to a design oversight and changes during construction, the building as initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated wind load on the building when wind blew perpendicularly against the side of the building—wind from due north, east, south, or west—all that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented "quartering winds" (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at [[Princeton University]], Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building, this time including quartering winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineethics.org/cms/24528.aspx |title=OEC – Addendum: The Diane Hartley Case |publisher=Onlineethics.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recalculation revealed that with a quartering wind, there was a 40% increase in wind loads, resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints.

LeMessurier's original design for the chevron load braces used welded joints. However, during construction, builder Bethlehem Steel was approved to use bolted joints to save labor and material costs. LeMessurier's firm approved the change, although this was not known to LeMessurier himself. The original welded-joint design had ample strength to withstand the load from straight-on wind, with enough safety margin to withstand the higher loads from quartering wind; however, the load from a {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} hurricane force quartering wind would exceed the strength of the bolted-joint chevrons. The bolts could shear and the building could collapse. [[Wind tunnel]] tests with models of Citigroup Center revealed that the wind speed required to bring down the building occurred on average once in 55 years.

For occupant comfort, the building has a [[tuned mass damper]], which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a [[hurricane]], the damper might not turn on&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Structural Motion Control|last=Connor|first=Jerome J.|publisher=Prentice Hall Pearson Education|year=2003|isbn=9780130091383|location=|pages=223|chapter=Chapter 4: Tuned Mass Damper Systems|chapter-url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ce573/Documents/Intro%20to%20Structural%20Motion%20Control_Chapter4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, and had to be corrected quickly.&lt;ref name="slate 2014"/&gt;

LeMessurier reportedly agonized over how to deal with the problem. If the issues were made known to the public, he risked ruining his professional reputation. He approached the architect (Hugh Stubbins) first, and then Citicorp. He advised them to take swift remedial action. Ultimately, he persuaded Citicorp to repair the building without informing the public, a task made easier by a press strike, then going on.&lt;ref name="slate 2014"/&gt;

For the next three months, construction crews working at night welded 2" steel plates over each of the skyscraper's 200 bolted joints. They worked during the night, after each work day, almost unknown to the general public. Six weeks into the work, a major storm ([[Hurricane Ella (1978)|Hurricane Ella]]) was off [[Cape Hatteras]] and heading for New York. With New York City hours away from emergency evacuation, the reinforcement was only half-finished. Ella eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea, buying enough time for workers to permanently correct the problem. As a precaution, Citicorp did work out emergency evacuation plans with local officials for the immediate neighborhood.&lt;ref name="slate 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Werner|first=Joel|title=The Design Flaw That Almost Wiped Out an NYC Skyscraper|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2014/04/17/the_citicorp_tower_design_flaw_that_could_have_wiped_out_the_skyscraper.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because nothing happened as a result of the engineering gaffe, the danger was kept hidden from the public for almost 20 years. It was publicized in a lengthy article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Morgenstern (1995), [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/05/29/1995_05_29_045_TNY_CARDS_000370292 "The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis"], ''The New Yorker'', May 29, 1995. Pages 45–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical questions ===
Architect Eugene Kremer has discussed the ethical questions raised in this case.&lt;ref name="Kremer"&gt;Eugene Kremer (2002). [http://www.crosscurrents.org/kremer2002.htm "(Re)Examining the Citicorp Case: Ethical Paragon or Chimera"], ''[[Cross Currents (journal)|Cross Currents]]'', Fall 2002, Vol. 52, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

LeMessurier was criticized for insufficient oversight leading to bolted rather than welded joints, for not informing the endangered neighbors, for actively misleading the public about the extent of the danger during the reinforcement process, and for not informing other architects about the problem and solution for two decades.&lt;ref name="Kremer"/&gt; However, his act of alerting Citicorp to the problem in his design is now used as an example of ethical behavior in several engineering textbooks.

Kremer discusses six key points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsDr8ArgtvEC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340 |title=Norbert J. Delatte, '&amp;#39;Beyond Failure: Forensic Case Studies for Civil Engineers'&amp;#39;, p 340 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Analysis of wind loads. Check all calculations and not rely just on building codes; these set minimum requirements and not the state of the art.
# Design changes. In this case change from welded to bolted connections. Changes are considered in the overall design context and by everyone involved and not a spur of the moment decision.
# Professional responsibility. To follow the codes of conduct for every chartered institution. LeMessurier did not consider the public safety first.
# Public statements. In this case the public statements issued by LeMessurier and Citigroup set out to mislead the public deliberately.
# Public safety. The public statement denied the public the right to ensure their own safety and to make their own critical decisions.
# Advancement of professional knowledge. Concealing this problem for almost 20 years prevented ethical and engineering learning that could have taken place.

=== Sale and name/address changes ===

Former Citicorp Chairman [[Walter B. Wriston]] was reportedly behind the decision to acquire several low- and mid-rise buildings in the area, supposedly to buy out [[massage parlor]]s and [[mom-and-pop store]]s in Midtown.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A.M. Stern, David Fishman and Jacob Tilove. ''New York 2000: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Bicentennial and the Millennium''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Citigroup sold two-thirds of its interest in the building, along with one-third of its interest in [[399 Park Avenue]], to [[Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company]] for $670 million (total cost of building adjusted for inflation: ${{inflation|US|195000000|1977|1987|fmt=c}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Berg | first = Eric N. | title = Citicorp Selling Part Offers Headquarter | work = The New York Times | date = 1987-10-03 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/03/business/citicorp-selling-part-offers-headquarter.html | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Citicorp sold its controlling stake in the building for $755 million (cost of building adjusted for inflation: ${{inflation|US|195000000|1977|2001|fmt=c}}) to Boston Properties.

=== Renovation plans ===

In March 2017, [[Gensler]] revealed designs for a major renovation around the base of the tower. The renovation will include a redesigned entry plaza and a new atrium space.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archdaily.com/868042/gensler-to-complete-200000-square-foot-renovation-of-new-yorks-citicorp-center&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==

*To help stabilize the building, a [[tuned mass damper]] was placed in the mechanical space at its top. This substantial piece of stabilizing equipment weighs 400 tons (350 metric tons). The damper is designed to counteract swaying motions due to the effect of wind on the building and reduces the building's movement due to wind by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greer |first=William R. |title=Rx for Swaying Skyscrapers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 24, 1982 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/realestate/rx-for-swaying-skyscrapers.html |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citigroup Center was the first skyscraper in the [[United States]] to feature a tuned mass damper. 
*The building features [[double-deck elevator]]s, which are separated to serve only odd or even floors.
*In 2002, one of the columns was reinforced with blast-resistant shields of steel and copper as well as steel bracing to protect the building due to the possibility of a terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Driscoll |first=Patrick |title=High-rises remain vulnerable after 9/11 |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 25, 2002 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-09-25-high-rises-1acov_x.htm |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From 1987 to 2009, the bank presented an annual toy train exhibition in the lower lobby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=ayCPUkBRr4Q4&amp;pid=newsarchive Citi Derails Holiday Toy-Train Show in Credit Crunch] Bloomberg News, Dec 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The building is visible in numerous television shows and movies (often as part of a wider panoramic shot of New York City), notably during the opening credits of the long-running [[NBC]] police procedural and legal drama ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', and it can also be seen in the background of the opening titles of the 1980s sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.

A season one episode of the TV show ''[[NUMB3RS]]'', "Structural Corruption", involves a fictional building with faults almost exactly paralleling the crisis of the Citigroup Center. Like the Citigroup Center, a college student studying the fictional Cole Center finds the building to have inadequate strength when subjected to quartering winds. However, the insufficient welds in the Cole Center lie in the foundation, and a tuned mass-damper (not present in the original construction) is added to make the building safe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The building's architectural design and history were the feature of episode 110, "Structural Integrity", of the podcast ''[[99% Invisible]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity/ |title=Structural Integrity |last=Mars |first=Roman |date= 15 April 2014 |website=99% Invisible |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silhouette of the sloped top of the building appears on the label of Chock-full-of-Nuts coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/19/nyregion/lost-towers-reflected-in-a-can.html|title=Lost Towers, Reflected in a Can|last=Barron|first=James|date=2004-06-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sloped top of the building is referenced in the Manhattan Mini Storage logo, as the top of the first letter "t" is similarly sloped&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.manhattanministorage.com/Public/Assets/Images/logos/logo-mms.svg Manhattan Mini Storage Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;. In an older version of the logo, the top left corner of the letter M was sloped like the Citigroup Center &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.storedge.com/images/blog/posts/brilliant-advertising/dunder.jpg Original Manhattan Mini Storage Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Citibank/Citicorp employees nicknamed the building "Walter's Whistle" after Citicorp Chairman Walter B. Wriston.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

According to [[Business Insider]], the [[New York Mets]] have at times used a logo since 2014 that has included the Citigroup Center, as Citigroup is the sponsor of their home stadium, [[Citi Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/mets-new-logo-citicorp-building-2014-9 New York Mets CitiCorp Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The CCAA within the Canadian insolvency regime==

In 1990, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] discussed the background behind the introduction of the CCAA in one of its rulings:

{{quote|The ''CCAA'' was enacted by Parliament in 1933 when the nation and the world were in the grip of an economic depression. When a company became insolvent liquidation followed because that was the consequence of the only insolvency legislation which then existed - the ''Bankruptcy Act'' and the ''Winding-Up Act''. Almost inevitably liquidation destroyed the shareholders' investment, yielded little by way of recovery to the creditors, and exacerbated the social evil of devastating levels of unemployment.  The government of the day sought, through the ''CCAA'', to create a regime whereby the principals of the company and the creditors could be brought together under the supervision of the court to attempt a reorganization or compromise or arrangement under which the company could continue in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Chef Ready Foods Ltd. v.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] did not have a chance to explain the nature of the CCAA until the groundbreaking case of ''[[Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' in 2010. In it, a detailed analysis was given in explaining the nature of insolvency law in Canada.

The ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' (BIA) provides a more rules-based approach for resolving a corporate debtor's insolvency, which must be observed strictly. The CCAA, on the other hand, provides a more discretionary approach that is remedial in nature, which therefore must be broadly construed.

Although the CCAA was originally enacted in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;''Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933'', S.C. 1932‑33, c. 36&lt;/ref&gt; extensive use of it only began in the economic downturn of the early 1980s. Recent legislative amendments of the BIA and CCAA have served to harmonize key aspects, such as the use of single proceedings, a common priority of claims structure, and encouraging reorganization over liquidation.

===Discretionary power of the court in a CCAA reorganization===

{{quote|The legislation is remedial in the purest sense in that it provides a means whereby the devastating social and economic effects of bankruptcy or creditor initiated termination of ongoing business operations can be avoided while a court-supervised attempt to reorganize the financial affairs of the debtor company is made.|- {{cite CanLII|litigants=Elan Corp. v. Comiskey|link=|year=1990|court=onca|num=6979|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=1 OR (3d) 289|date=1990-11-02|courtname=auto|juris=}}, per Doherty J.A., dissenting}}

This is noted together with s. 11 of the CCAA, which states that a court may, "subject to the restrictions set out in this Act, . . . make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances".&lt;ref name ="ccaas11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision notes the interrelated nature of proceedings under the CCAA and BIA:

{{quote|[77] The CCAA creates conditions for preserving the ''[[status quo]]'' while attempts are made to find common ground amongst stakeholders for a reorganization that is fair to all.  Because the alternative to reorganization is often bankruptcy, participants will measure the impact of a reorganization against the position they would enjoy in liquidation. In the case at bar, the order fostered a harmonious transition between reorganization and liquidation while meeting the objective of a single collective proceeding that is common to both statutes.}}

==Application of the Act==
{{See also|Commercial insolvency in Canada}}

===Eligibility===
The scope of the CCAA is quite broad. It applies to any [[debtor]] company (or group of affiliated companies) that owes more than $5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than:
:*banks
:*insurance companies
:*trust and loan companies
:*railway and telegraph companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and:
:* is either [[bankrupt]] or [[insolvent]]
:* has committed an act of bankruptcy under the  ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' ("BIA") or is deemed insolvent under the ''[[Winding-Up and Restructuring Act]]'' ("WRA"), whether or not proceedings have been initiated under either of those Acts
:* has made an assignment, or has been made subject to a bankruptcy [[Court order|order]], under the BIA, or
:* is being [[winding up|wound up]] under the WRA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "debtor company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debtor protection===
No person may terminate or amend — or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under — any agreement, including a security agreement, with any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCAA or that the company is insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 34(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreements can be assigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or disclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 32 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the debtor company as a result of the proceeding, by following prescribed procedures. These provisions extend beyond being used only within restructuring plans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Timminco Limited|link=|year=2012|source=onsc|num=4471|pinpoint=par. 51|parallelcite=|date=2012-08-03|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the courts have held that there is "no reason…why the same analysis cannot apply during a sale process that requires the business to be carried as a going concern",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sproule v. Nortel Networks Corporation|link=|year=2009|source=onca|num=833|pinpoint=par. 46|parallelcite=|date=2009-11-26|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1 = Aubrey E.

:* there is no requirement that a plan of compromise or arrangement be imminent
:* the court will take into account whether refusing a disclaimer would have the effect of enhancing the position of the counter-party
:* whether a counter-party would suffer significant financial hardship if the disclaimer is allowed is a subjective test

===Approval of the compromise or arrangement===

Negotiated compromises and arrangements may deal with any matter, including claims against directors and amendments to the [[articles of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]] incorporating the company. When they have been approved by each participating class of creditors (by a two-thirds vote by value of the claims involved) the court may then approve it, and it will be binding on all persons, including trustees in bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 6 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They cannot be approved by the court if provision is not made for settling "super priority" claims (as they are known under the BIA) relating to:
:* compensation and reimbursement claims by employees other than officers and directors&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* pension plan contributions (except where agreement has been reached with the relevant pension regulator)&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(6)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* source deductions due on employee withholdings&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, no amounts relating to "equity claims"&lt;ref&gt;defined under CCAA, S. 22.1&lt;/ref&gt; may be authorized by the court under a compromise or arrangement until all other claims are first paid in full.&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(8)&lt;/ref&gt; "Equity claims" have been held to include any claims shareholders may have against third parties in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Sino-Forest'' {{emdash}} Subordination of equity interests and collateral damage| url = http://www.blg.com/en/home/publications/Documents/Publication_3126.pdf|publisher = [[Borden Ladner Gervais]]|date = August 2012|accessdate = 2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Sino-Forest'': Ontario Court of Appeal Agrees that Indemnity Claims of Auditors and Underwriters are Equity Claims| url = http://www.dwpv.com/en/Resources/Publications/2012/Sino-%20orest%20Ontario%20Court%20of%20Appeal%20Agrees%20that%20Indemnity%20Claims%20of%20Auditors%20and%20Underwriters%20are%20Equity%20Claims|publisher = [[Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg]]|date = 2012-11-29|accessdate = 2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sino-Forest Corporation (Re)|link=|year=2012|source=onca|num=816|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-11-23|courtname=|juris=}}, affirming {{cite CanLII|litigants=Sino-Forest Corporation (Re)|link=|year=2012|source=onsc|num=4377|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-07-27|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of the court==
Any interested person may apply to the court for an order under the Act.&lt;ref name ="ccaas11" /&gt; This is normally the debtor company, but a [[creditor]] can also do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Stephanie A.F. Grace |title = Creditor Initiated CCAA Proceedings | url = http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Articles/ArticleEdit.aspx?ArticleID=596&amp;page=14 | publisher = Aird &amp; Berlis | date = 2009-12-02 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court having jurisdiction is the superior court for the province in which the company's head office or chief place of business in Canada, or, in the absence of that, where any of its assets are situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 9 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-4.html#h-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the application is made, the court is required to appoint a monitor with respect to the business and financial affairs of the company, who must be a [[trustee in bankruptcy]] under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.7 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitor is required to investigate and report back to the court on the company, advise the court with respect to any actions that need to be taken, and to carry out any other functions in relation to the company that the court may direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 23 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-23.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a compromise or arrangement has already been negotiated with the [[Secured creditor|secured]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Unsecured creditor|unsecured]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; creditors {{emdash}} essentially creating a [[pre-packaged insolvency]] {{emdash}} the court may summarily order that it proceed to be voted on by each class of creditors concerned, and, where necessary, by the shareholders as well.

However, the court is not bound to accept an application under the Act, and it can terminate previously granted orders (and even declare them to have been void ''[[ab initio]]'') where an applicant has not made full and fair disclosure of all material facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Pamela Huff|author2 = Matthew Kanter|title = CanaSea Group: Full and Fair Disclosure Required in ''ex parte CCAA'' Applications|url = http://www.blakes.com/English/Resources/Bulletins/Pages/Details.aspx?BulletinID=2055|date = 22 January 2015|publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re CanaSea PetroGas Group Holdings Limited|link=|year=2014|court=onsc|num=824|date=2014-11-20|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a petition for CCAA relief appears to be more like a defensive tactic than a ''[[bona fide]]'' attempt to restructure, it may prefer to order receivership instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Steven Golick|author2 = Andrea Lockhart|title = To Restructure or Liquidate? – That is the Question: Dueling CCAA and Receivership Applications|url = http://business-finance-restructuring.weil.com/north-of-the-border-update/to-restructure-or-liquidate-that-is-the-question-dueling-ccaa-and-receivership-applications/|date = 27 February 2012|publisher = Bankruptcy Blog}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Callidus Capital Corp v Carcap Inc|link=|year=2012|court=onsc|num=163|date=2012-01-05|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stay of proceedings===

Where no such compromise or arrangement has been negotiated, the court, on application, may issue an order, lasting for 30 days,
:* staying,
:* restraining from continuing, or
:* prohibiting from commencing,
any proceedings against the debtor company, while negotiations are held to secure a compromise or arrangement with creditors and shareholders. The court may extend the protection for any period it sees fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.02 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stay may be lifted upon application to the court, but only in very restricted circumstances:

:* it will be difficult for a secured party to obtain relief where the effect of doing so would be to prevent the debtor from continuing to carry on business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lifting the stay – is the "doomed to fail" argument doomed to fail?|author1 = Adam Maerov|author2 = Jennifer Cockbill|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/lifting-the-stay--is-the-doomed-to-fail-argument-doomed-to-fail|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|date = September 2012|accessdate = 2012-09-21}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Azure Dynamics Corp.|link=|year=2012|court=bcsc|num=781|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-04-13|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* however, lifting a stay may be more possible in a liquidating CCAA proceeding, having regard for the need to balance stakeholder interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lift Stay Motion More Likely to Succeed in a Liquidating CCAA|author1 = Jeffrey Levine|author2 = Stephen Brown-Okruhlik|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/Lift-Stay-Motion-More-Likely-to-Succeed-in-a-Liquidating-CCAA|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|date = November 2013|accessdate = 2013-11-29}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Puratone et al|link=|year=2013|court=mbqb|num=171|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-07-08|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provision is made for such stays not affecting investigations undertaken by any regulatory body (other than with respect to any payment that may be ordered), but the court can order the cancellation of such exemption where:

:* a viable compromise or arrangement could not otherwise be made in respect of the company, and
:* it is not contrary to the public interest that the regulatory body be affected by such order&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as noted in ''[[Newfoundland and Labrador v. AbitibiBowater Inc.]]'', not all payments required under regulatory orders constitute claims under the ''CCAA'' and are thus subject to stay. Subsequent jurisprudence suggests that determining the status of such orders will be case-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Court of Appeal weighs conflicting MOE and CCAA orders|url = |publisher = [[Borden Ladner Gervais]]|date = 2013-10-10}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Nortel Networks Corporation|link=|year=2013|court=onca|num=599|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-10-03|courtname=|juris=}} and {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Northstar Aerospace Inc.|link=|year=2013|court=onca|num=600|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-10-03|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===

In addition, the court has broad discretion in administering any other issues that may arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Sandrelli | title = Jurisdiction of the court in CCAA proceedings: Inherent jurisdiction vs statutory discretion | url = http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/2634262_Jursidiction_of_the_Court_in_CCA.pdf | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = 2005-09-15/16 | accessdate = 2011-09-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329040843/http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/2634262_Jursidiction_of_the_Court_in_CCA.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Act says,

===Stability during proceedings===

In order to assure that the company's operations will continue during the proceedings, the court has power to declare that the assets of the company are subject to a security or charge with respect to certain matters, and may further order that such charges rank ahead of those of secured creditors. They include:

:* arrangements similar to [[debtor-in-possession financing]] for sustaining the company's operations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.2 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Carole Hunter |author2=Jonathan Levin |author3=Edmund F.B.

:* payments to specified suppliers for continuing to provide goods or services that are critical to the company's operation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* indemnification for directors and officers for actions done after the commencement of proceedings, where appropriate insurance coverage is not in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.51 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "super priority" status is construed broadly, and has been held to even defeat statutory deemed trusts (such as those concerning pension plan deficiencies and vacation pay that exist in Ontario),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v.

===Other powers===

The court may also order:

:* the removal of directors if they are unreasonably impairing (or likely to unreasonably impair) the possibility of a viable compromise or arrangement being made in respect of the company, or are acting (or likely to act) inappropriately as a director in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* recovery of amounts arising from [[fraudulent preference]]s and [[undervalue transaction]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 36.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-36.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the coordination of its proceedings with corresponding foreign proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, Part IV | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/FullText.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of CCAA with other bankruptcy protection proceedings==

The CCAA has been described as being similar in nature to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] proceedings in the United States and to [[Administration (law)|administration proceedings]] and [[Insolvency Act 1986|company voluntary arrangements]] ("CVAs") in the United Kingdom. Differences between the various proceedings include the following highlights:

'''Daniel M. Harkness''' (1822-1896) was an American merchant and businessman in Ohio. He played a role in the formation of [[Standard Oil]] in Ohio. 

His older step-brother [[Stephen V. Harkness]] and younger half-brother [[Henry M. Flagler]] became two of the original five founding partners of [[Standard Oil]], along with [[John D. Rockefeller]].  Daniel Harkness had persuaded Henry Flagler to move to Ohio when young and join him in his uncle's business. There Flagler met [[Stephen V. Harkness]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Daniel Harkness became a major stockholder in [[Standard Oil]] and one of the wealthiest individuals of his day.

==Family==
Daniel M. Harkness was the son of Dr. David M. Harkness and his second wife, Elizabeth Morrison (Caldwell). His father had been widowed, and had a son [[Stephen V. Harkness]] from his first marriage. David died when Daniel was young. Later the widowed Elizabeth Harkness took her two sons and returned to upstate New York. There she married Isaac Flagler, a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in Hopewell, New York. They had a son, Henry Flagler, Daniel's half brother. 

== Early days &amp; Standard Oil ==

In 1837, Dan Harkness moved to [[Bellevue, Ohio]] from Hopewell, New York to live with his paternal uncle Lamon G. (LG) Harkness. He later moved to [[Republic, Ohio]] to work in the Harkness store there.  Dan encouraged his younger half-brother, [[Henry Flagler]], to leave Hopewell and join him in Republic, which Henry did in 1844. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Sidney Walter (1949). '' Florida's Flagler'' pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The two worked for a while in Republic and then moved to [[Bellevue, Ohio]] to become more involved in the grain and distillery business. 

Dan married his Uncle L.G.'s daughter Isabella and Henry married her sister Mary. The two young men both did very well in Bellevue. Henry decided to venture into the salt business in Michigan, but found he did not have sufficient technical knowledge to weather changes in the markets during the Civil War. When Flagler returned from Michigan having lost a substantial salt mine investment, Daniel helped bail him out by lending him money.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Sidney Walter (1949). '' Florida's Flagler''&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagler moved to Cleveland in 1866, thinking he would have better opportunity in a larger city, and had an office in the same building as [[John D. Rockefeller]].

Harkness and his family remained primarily in Bellevue, taking over the home that Henry Flagler had built there, known as "The Gingerbread House". [[File:Harknesshome.jpg|thumb|right|DM Harkness home in Bellevue, OH, originally built by Henry Flagler and later became the Bellevue YMCA]]

== Personal life ==

Harkness married Isabella, and they had children together. She died in 1864. Later he donated the funds to build Harkness Memorial First Congregational Church next door to his home in her honor; it was completed in 1887. He stipulated that the church must not have a bell because he did not want to be disturbed by one. The church is still standing in Bellevue to this day. 

Harkness was appointed as a trustee of [[Standard Oil]]. When he died in 1896 his estate, estimated to be $35 million and mostly in Standard Oil stock, was left to his only surviving child, [[William L. Harkness]]. This $35 million would equate to approximately $1 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;von Halle, Ernst (1899). ''Trusts or industrial combinations and coalitions in the United States''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' Archives (Sept 21, 1907), "Standard Oil Tells who has its Stock"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''deferral''', in ''[[accrual accounting]]'', is any [[Account (accountancy)|account]] where the [[asset]] or [[liability (accounting)|liability]] is not realized until a future date ([[accounting period]]), e.g. [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuities]], [[fee|charges]], [[tax]]es, [[income]], etc. The deferred item may be carried, dependent on type of deferral, as either an asset or liability. See also [[accrual]].

Deferrals are the consequence of the [[Revenue recognition|revenue recognition principle]] which dictates that revenues be recognized in the period in which they occur, and the [[matching principle]] which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of [[cash flows]] occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under [[accrual accounting]]. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] or [[assets]]. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.

* Deferred expense: cash has left the company, but the event has not actually occurred yet. Prepaid expenses are the most common type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).
* Deferred revenue: Revenue has come into the company, but the event has still not occurred – it is unearned revenue. A magazine company, for instance, may receive money for a one-year subscription. However, the company has not spent the resources in producing and delivering those magazines and thus accountants record this revenue as a liability equal to the amount of cash received. The magazine company, while now having more cash on hand, also now owes a year of magazines. The amount of each magazine that gets delivered is then taken out of liabilities and recorded as revenue during the economic period in which it actually happens, not just when the company gets paid for it.

==Deferral (deferred charge)==
'''Deferred charge '''(or '''deferral''') is [[cost]] that is accounted-for in latter [[accounting period]] for its anticipated future benefit, or to comply with the requirement of [[matching principle|matching]] costs with [[revenues]]. ''Deferred charges'' include costs of [[Startup company|starting up]], obtaining long-term [[debt]], [[advertising]] campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]] pending [[amortization]]. 
''Deferred charges'' often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike '''prepaid expenses''', e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial [[ratios]] are based on the total assets excluding ''deferred charges'' since they have no physical substance ([[cash]] realization) and cannot be used in reducing total [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Deferred expense==
A '''Deferred expense''' or '''prepayment''', '''prepaid expense''', plural often '''prepaids''', is an [[asset]] representing cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later [[accounting period]].  For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, at the end of the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense.  In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment.&lt;ref name="NortonDiamond2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curtis L. Norton|author2=Michael A. Diamond|author3=Donald P. Pagach|title=Intermediate accounting: financial reporting and analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvxs17T5-D8C&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=2 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-72185-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deferred expense shares characteristics with [[Accrued Revenue|accrued revenue]] (or ''accrued assets'') with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from ''accrued revenues''.

For example, when the accounting periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid [[insurance]] cost is added to ''prepaid expenses'', which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an [[expense]], rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as ''prepayments'' (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.

Similarly, cash paid out for (the cost of) goods and services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to the ''prepayments'' to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the [[income statement]] (''profit and loss'' or P&amp;L) as the [[expense]] incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in [[P&amp;L]] and deducted from prepayments (assets) on [[balance sheets]].

==Deferred revenue==
'''Deferred revenue''' (or '''[[deferred income]]''') is a [[liability (accounting)|liability]], such as cash received from a counterpart for goods or services that are to be delivered in a later [[accounting period]]. When such income item is earned, the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, and the ''deferred revenue'' is reduced. It shares characteristics with ''accrued expense'' with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from ''accrued expenses''.

For example, a company receives an annual [[software license]] fee paid out by a customer upfront on the January 1. However, the company's [[fiscal year]] ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months' worth (5/12) of the fee to its [[revenues]] in [[profit and loss]] for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to ''[[deferred income]]'' (liability) on the [[balance sheet]] for that year.

'''Eddie Hertzberger''' (17 October 1904 &amp;ndash; 2 May 1993) was a wealthy [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[industrialist]] and [[racecar]] driver. He won the [[1936 Grand Prix season|1936]] [[Grand Prix des Frontières|Frontières]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] for [[sports cars]] at [[Chimay]], [[Belgium]], and the [[1937 Grand Prix season|1937]] [[Voiturette]] race at the same event. He also competed in the [[1935 24 Hours of Le Mans|1935]] and [[1937 24 Hours of Le Mans|1937]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] races. In the twenties Hertzberger also did some [[boxing]], while he did a lot of [[sailing]] and [[skiing]] throughout his life.

Hertzberger owned cars like a [[Bugatti]] Type 57 Stelvio 4-seater, with which he participated in the 12-hour night drive organised by the KNAC (Royal Dutch Automobile Club) in September 1926, the [[MG Magnette|MG Magnette K3]], a 4.5 litre [[Bentley]] and an [[Aston Martin]]. He restricted his racing to [[England]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]], with [[motor racing]] in [[the Netherlands]] virtually non-existent, and [[Jew]]s not allowed to participate in motor racing in [[Nazi Germany]].

At [[Monthléry]], Hertzberger managed to break some speed records in his K3. He also started in the [[Mille Miglia]] and at [[Le Mans]]. He quit racing in 1938 after getting married, although he made a surprise appearance at [[Zandvoort]] in 1953.

Hertzberger was the first of only two Dutch racing drivers to win races titled '[[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]]', the other being [[Carel Godin de Beaufort]], until [[Max Verstappen]] won the [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|2016 Spanish]] [[Formula One]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]]

== Personal life ==

Hertzberger owned a successful clothing factory in Rotterdam. The factory, including his Bugatti Stelvio #57519 which was parked inside, was completely destroyed at the outbreak of [[World War II]] during the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombardment of Rotterdam]] that prompted the surrender of Holland to the Nazis. Hertzberger escaped the Netherlands through Belgium and France to [[Switzerland]], where he stayed for more than a year. Later he travelled through [[Vichy France]] to reach [[Spain]]. In [[Madrid]] Hertzberger became a member of the intelligence service of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, which was based in [[London]] during World War II.

After the war, Hertzberger rebuilt his factory and lived both in the Netherlands and [[New York City]]. Later he moved to Switzerland, where he died in 1993.

His wife, [[Eleonore Hertzberger-Katz]] (born 1917), wrote a book about their hazardous journeys, which was reprinted in Dutch in June 2003.

Eddie Hertzberger's [[granddaughter]] [[Gwendolyn Hertzberger|Gwendolyn]] also races. She currently competes in [[Formula Renault]].

[[File:EmmaCoe1850-1913.jpg|thumb|Emma Coe in her youth]]
'''Emma Eliza Coe''' (26 September 1850, in [[Apia]] &amp;ndash; 1913, in [[Monte Carlo]]), known also as '''"Queen Emma of New Guinea"''', '''Emma Forsayth''', '''Emma Farrell''' and '''Emma Kolbe''' was a business woman and plantation owner of mixed American/[[Samoan people|Samoan]] descent.

==Biography==
{{tone|date = February 2012}}
Emma Coe was born to Jonas Myndersse Coe, a US Commercial Representative to [[American Samoa]] and Joana Talelatale, a Samoan belonging to the [[Malietoa]] dynasty. Her mother’s bloodline was related to the Moli tribe and Emma was recognized by the Malietoa as a princess. In 1869, she married James Forsayth, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] seaman and they set up a shipping and trading business in American Samoa. Emma was involved in island politics with her father and lost favor with the local people after he was deported in 1876. Around this time, her husband was said to be lost at sea, however there was no confirmation that her husband was dead.

In 1878, she left American Samoa with an [[Australian]] lover, James Farrell, who was known as a [[blackbirding|blackbirder]], captain and trader for the [[Duke of York Islands]] in between [[New Britain]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. There they traded mainly [[copra]] with the local population for beads, tobacco, knives and mirrors. The area was largely unsettled by Europeans up until that point due to resistance from the local inhabitants.

Emma and Farrell were to assist people that were involved in the [[de Rays Expedition|Marquis De Rays incident]] where over 500 people were swindled out of their life’s savings to form a new colony at the South Eastern tip of New Ireland. Four ships sailed from [[France]] between Jan 1880 – Aug 1881, the ''Chandernagore'', ''Genil'', ''India'' and ''Neu Bretagne''. This practically marooned the colonists whilst the founder reported the progress of the colony in an extremely positive light in his newspaper ''[[La Nouvelle France]]'' in Paris. Emma and Farrell assisted the marooned colonists back to [[Australia]]. De Rays was later tried and found guilty of [[fraud]] in France.

In 1881, Emma became interested in land around the [[Gazelle Peninsula]] of New Britain and differed with Farrell who continued trading. Emma bought the land from the local chiefs and with the assistance of her brother-in-law, the [[Danish people|Dane]], [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]], set up a large coconut and cocoa plantations around [[Kokopo]], East New Britain. During this period, she became highly successful and well respected. She was known as a heady woman, known to affect her charm on others and for throwing outlandish extravagant parties aided by her nieces. She was the envy of the German colonists who started to move into Kokopo around 1890 and passing trades ships. It was during this period she became affectionately known as the “Queen of New Guinea”.  Commercially from 1880–1900 years, her enterprises in Kokopo surpassed most in the region and the Pacific and she was most certainly the commerce queen of New Guinea.

In 1893 Emma married Paul Kolbe, a German colonial official and former army captain who was nearly fifteen years her junior.{{sfn|Salesa|2014|p=160}} Her commercial empire was still in full swing when towards the end of 1907 she learnt of increasing tensions between Germany and Britain in the colonies and Europe. Emma sold off most of her assets in c. 1910 to [[Heinrich Rudolph Walen]] of Hamburgische Südsee AG.&lt;ref name="pim-jun-1958"/&gt;{{sfn|Salesa|2014|p=161}} She later lived in [[Sydney]] and died in 1913 in Monte Carlo{{hsp}}{{sfn|Salesa|2014|p=161}} by the bedside of her estranged husband Paul Kolbe. Their ashes were buried in her old station cemetery “Gunantambu” at [[Ralum]], which is today the site of the Ralum Club in Kokopo, New Britain, [[Papua New Guinea]]. Emma's son from her first marriage, James "Coe" Forsayth, reinterred the urns in Sydney at the South Head Cemetery in 1924.&lt;ref name="pngaa"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Forsayth is portrayed by [[Barbara Carrera]] in the 1988 television serial ''[[Emma: Queen of the South Seas]]'', which was directed by John Banas for Australia's Network 10. She is featured in [[Christian Kracht]]'s 2012 novel ''[[Imperium (Kracht novel)|Imperium]]'', which focuses on [[August Engelhardt]].

She was a sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]]. Her husband, [[Sargent Shriver]], was the [[United States Ambassador to France]] during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] presidency.

In 1962, Shriver founded Camp Shriver, which started on her Maryland farm known as Timberlawn, and evolved into [[Special Olympics]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver |website=Special Olympics |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/eunice_kennedy_shriver_biography.aspx |access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eunice Mary Kennedy was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. She was the fifth of nine children of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref name="cnndeath"/&gt;

Shriver was educated at the Convent of The Sacred Heart, Roehampton, London and at [[Manhattanville College]] in Upper Manhattan (the school later moved farther north to [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]], [[New York (state)|New York]]). After graduating from [[Stanford University]] with a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[sociology]] in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.Y. (August 11, 2009).

In 1969, Shriver moved to France and pursued her interest in intellectual disability there. She started organizing small activities with Paris organizations, mostly reaching out to families of kids who had special needs to provide activities for them, laying the foundation for a robust international expansion of the Special Olympics in the late '70s and '80s.&lt;ref name="ABILITY Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Chet |title=Timothy Shriver — Special Olympics |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Special-Olympics-Shriver.html |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Shriver actively campaigned for her elder brother, John, during his successful [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 U.S. presidential election]]. In 1968, she helped [[Anne McGlone Burke]] nationalize the Special Olympics movement and is the only woman to have her portrait appear, during her lifetime, on a [[Coins of the United States dollar|U.S. coin]] – the 1995 [[Modern United States commemorative coins#1995|commemorative]] Special Olympics [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]].

Although Shriver was a Democrat, she was a vocal supporter of the [[pro-life movement]]. In 1990, Shriver wrote a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' denouncing the misuse of a quotation by President Kennedy used out of context by a [[pro-choice]] group.&lt;ref&gt;Biofiles: Eunice Kennedy Shriver [http://www.historyguy.com/biofiles/shriver_eunice_kennedy.htm].

Lenz, whose son, Sam, has [[Down syndrome]] and is an enthusiastic Special Olympics athlete, was inspired by Shriver's dedication to working with people with intellectual disabilities.

Shriver became involved with [[Dorothy Hamill]]'s special skating program in the Special Olympics after Hamill's [[Olympic Games]] [[ice skating|ice-skating]] win. In September 2010, the [[State University of New York at Brockport]], home of the 1979 Special Olympics, renamed its football stadium after Shriver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20100925/SPORTS09/9250344/1007/SPORTS ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Shriver posthumously received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2017 ESPY Awards.

==Personal life==
On May 23, 1953, Shriver married [[Sargent Shriver]] in a [[Roman Catholic]] ceremony at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|Saint Patrick's Cathedral]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="JFKLibrary"&gt;Archives.

Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum]], John F. Kennedy Library National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband served as the [[United States Ambassador to France|U.S. Ambassador to France]] from 1968 to 1970 and was the 1972 Democratic U.S. Vice Presidential candidate (with [[George McGovern]] as the candidate for [[President of the United States|U.S. President]]).&lt;ref name="JFKLibrary"/&gt; They had five children:
* [[Bobby Shriver|Robert Sargent Shriver III]] (born April 28, 1954)
* [[Maria Shriver|Maria Owings Shriver]] (born November 6, 1955)
* [[Timothy Shriver|Timothy Perry Shriver]] (born August 29, 1959)
* [[Mark Shriver|Mark Kennedy Shriver]] (born February 17, 1964)
* [[Anthony Shriver|Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver]] (born July 20, 1965)

With her husband, Shriver had nineteen grandchildren, the second-most of any of her siblings (her brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] had eleven children who have produced thirty-four grandchildren).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taylor Swift -- "You Belong with Me" (2009) |website=2or3lines.blogspot.de |url=http://2or3lines.blogspot.de/2013/08/taylor-swift-you-belong-with-me-2009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Maria Shriver is divorced from actor and former [[California Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

As executive vice president of the [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation]] in the 1950s, Shriver shifted the organization's focus from Catholic charities to research on the causes of intellectual disabilities and humane ways to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=J.Y. |date=August 12, 2009 |title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Special Olympics Founder, Dies at 88 |publisher=washingtonpost.com |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/11/AR2009081100689.html |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interest eventually culminated in, among other things, the Special Olympics movement.

Upon the death of her sister [[Rosemary Kennedy]] on January 7, 2005, Shriver became the eldest of the four then-surviving children of Joseph and Rose Kennedy. Her sister [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia Kennedy]] died on September 17, 2006, and her brother [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] died on August 25, 2009, leaving former [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|U.S. Ambassador to Ireland]] [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] as the only surviving sibling.&lt;ref name="abc-ted"&gt;Staff writer.

Shriver's family issued a statement upon her death, reading in part:

{{quote|Inspired by her love of God, her devotion to her family, and her relentless belief in the dignity and worth of every human life, she worked without ceasing—searching, pushing, demanding, hoping for change. She was a living prayer, a living advocate, a living center of power. She set out to change the world and to change us, and she did that and more. She founded the movement that became Special Olympics, the largest movement for acceptance and inclusion for people with intellectual disabilities in the history of the world. Her work transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the globe, and they in turn are her living legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eunicekennedyshriver.org/articles/article/171|title=Statement from The Shriver Family |publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver's website|date= 2009-08-11|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] remarked after Shriver's death that she was "an extraordinary woman who, as much as anyone, taught our nation—and our world—that no physical or mental barrier can restrain the power of the human spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2010/08/one-year-ago-eunice-kennedy-shriver.html|title=One year ago: Eunice Kennedy Shriver|date=August 11, 2010 |first=Michael|last=Farr|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Moshiri was born in Iran, and his parents left just before the revolution in 1979.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andy Hunter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/everton-majority-shareholder-farhad-moshiri-increase-stake-bill-kenwright |title=Everton's new majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri likely to increase stake &amp;#124; Football |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moshiri has said that his father was "an [[Imperial Iranian Army|army]] doctor who trained as a pathologist and later became a senior military judge", and his mother "came from Iran's leading publishing house, ''[[Kayhan]]''."&lt;ref name="Liverpool Echo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton takeover – Farhad Moshiri who is he?|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-takeover-farhad-moshiri-who-10959138|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[University College London]], and trained in the UK as a [[chartered certified accountant]].&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

==Career==
Moshiri worked for [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[PKF International|PKF]] and [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metinvest.com/eng/metalloinvest/rykovodstvo/Board_of_directors/Moshiri_F/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131150526/http://www.metinvest.com/eng/metalloinvest/rykovodstvo/Board_of_directors/Moshiri_F/ |date=31 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshiri and longstanding business partner [[Alisher Usmanov]] were co-owners of Red &amp; White Holdings, which bought 14.65% of the shares in [[Arsenal F.C.]] from former club vice-chairman [[David Dein]] in August 2007.  On 18 September 2007, Red and White Holdings increased their stake in Arsenal to 21%, and on 28 September 2007 to 23%, a week after Moshiri announced that he wanted at least a 25% holding in the football club. As of June 2012, Red and White Holdings have acquired at least 29.72%.  Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman told [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], "They've said previously they are not going to make a bid for the company and they want to be long-term shareholders."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In February 2016 it was announced that Moshiri had sold his stake in Arsenal Football Club to Red &amp; White Holdings partner Usmanov in a bid to raise capital required to launch a takeover at [[Everton F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/12175747/Everton-poised-for-takeover-by-former-Arsenal-shareholder-Farhad-Moshiri.html |title=Everton poised for takeover by former Arsenal shareholder Farhad Moshiri |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February, the club officially confirmed Moshiri's purchase of a 49.9% stake in the club, which was ratified two weeks later by the [[Premier League]].  He currently part owns Everton F.C.

==Personal life==
Moshiri lives in Monaco.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; His former wife [[Nazenin Ansari]] is a London-based Iranian journalist, managing editor of Kayhan London, a weekly Persian-language newspaper, and series producer at Manoto, an international free-to-air Persian language TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miles |first=Tina |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/who-farhad-moshiris-wife-nazenin-10971357 |title=Who is Farhad Moshiri's wife Nazenin Ansari? |newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=27 February 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children.

[[File:Cemitey Manhattan.jpg|thumb|Graveyard]]  What is now called the "First Shearith Israel Graveyard," near [[Chatham Square]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], was in use from 1683 to 1833. An older cemetery called "Beth Haim," dated to 1656 — two years after the community arrived, was located around the corner of Madison and Oliver Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haswell |first= Charles Haynes |date= 1896 |title= Reminiscences of an Octogenarian of the City of New York (1816 to 1860)|publisher= Harper &amp; Brothers |page= 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site for First Shearith Israel Graveyard was originally on a hill overlooking the [[East River]] in an open area at the northern periphery of the British-Dutch colonial settlement. The plot was purchased in 1682 by Joseph Bueno de Mesquita, and its first interment was for his relative, Benjamin Bueno de Mesquita, the following year. The cemetery expanded in the 1700s so that at one point it extended from Chatham Square over what is now the upper part of Oliver Street down to [[Madison Street (Manhattan)|Bancker (now Madison) Street]].&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web | title = Chatham Square Cemetery | publisher = Shearith Israel | url = http://shearithisrael.org/content/chatham-square-cemetery | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FSSSC&gt;{{cite web | title = Cemeteries of Congregation Shearith Israel - The Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue | publisher = Foundation for the Study of Sephardic Studies and Culture | url = http://www.sephardicstudies.org/csi11.html | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mfrench/&gt;&lt;ref name=untapped&gt;{{cite web | title = The NYC Cemetery That Moved Four Times: The Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue Cemetery | publisher = Untapped Cities | url = http://untappedcities.com/2015/06/26/the-nyc-cemetery-that-moved-four-times-the-spanish-and-portuguese-synagogue-cemetery/ | date = 26 June 2015 | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter in 1776, a staff officer of General [[George Washington]] recommended emplacing an artillery battery "at the foot of the Jews' burying ground" to help secure [[Long Island Sound]]. American prisoners of war were buried en masse in entrenchments beyond the graveyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stone |first= William L. |date= 1876 |title= The Centennial History of New York City |publisher= R. D. Cooke |page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, a city ordinance prohibited burials south of [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], compelling the congregation to rely on its second burial ground, consecrated in 1805 at West 11th Street in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite web | title = West 11th Street Cemetery | publisher = Shearith Israel | url = http://shearithisrael.org/content/west-11th-street-cemetery | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Notwithstanding this, a few more burials took place at Chatham Square up to 1833.) Much of this burden was alleviated in 1829, when Shearith Israel's third cemetery was consecrated at 21st Street just west of 6th Avenue.&lt;ref name=mfrench /&gt;&lt;ref name=third&gt;{{cite web | title = Twenty-First Street Cemetery | publisher = Shearith Israel | url = http://shearithisrael.org/content/twenty-first-street-cemetery | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encroaching development and erosion necessitated several instances over the years in which the congregation was forced reduce the size of the Chatham Square Cemetery and disinter bodies, which were moved to their three other graveyards.  In 1851, city public health officials prohibited burial south of 86th Street and in partnership with other synagogues, the congregation purchased a large plot of land in [[Ridgewood, Queens]] as a fourth cemetery.  The most notable of these instances was in 1855, when a large portion of the cemetery was seized by [[eminent domain]]. This accommodated expansion of the [[Bowery]] — including the cut-through of today's St. James Place — and some 256 graves were removed.

Today, access to the cemetery is by appointment only.

==Interees==

From 1656 until 1825, all of the practicing Jews of New York City belonged to the Shearith Israel congregation and were buried here, including 22 who fought in the Revolutionary War. Among the notable interees (which may include those whose bodies were later removed) were...
* Reverend [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]] (1745–1816), the first American born Jewish spiritual leader
* Dr. Walter Jonas Judah, the second Jew known to attend an American medical school (King's College, now [[Columbia University]]) and the first native-born Jew to do so; he died at age 20 of [[Yellow fever epidemic of 1793|yellow fever]]

'''Cold Spray (CS)''' (formerly gas dynamic cold spray) is a coating deposition method.&lt;ref&gt;developed in the mid-1980s at [http://www.itam.nsc.ru/index_eng.php The Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt; Solid powders (1 to 50 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in diameter) are accelerated in a [[supersonic]] gas jet to velocities up to 500–1000 [[metre per second|m/s]]. During impact with the substrate, particles undergo [[plastic deformation in solids|plastic deformation]] and adhere to the surface. To achieve a uniform thickness the spraying nozzle is scanned along the substrate. [[Metal]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[composite material]]s and [[nanocrystalline]] powders can be deposited using cold spraying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moridi|first=A. |author2=Hassani-Gangaraj, S.

Unlike [[thermal spraying]] techniques, e.g., [[plasma spraying]], arc spraying, [[flame spraying]], or high velocity oxygen fuel ([[HVOF]]), the powders are not melted during the spraying process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Warm spraying—a novel coating process based on high-velocity impact of solid particles| pmc=5099653|doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/9/3/033002 | journal = Sci.

==Types==
There are two types of CS. High pressure cold spray (HPCS) in which the working gas is nitrogen or helium at pressures above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.075|title=Application of a holistic 3D model to estimate state of cold spray titanium particles|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=89|pages=1227–1241|year=2016|last1=Faizan-Ur-Rab|first1=M.|last2=Zahiri|first2=S.H.|last3=Masood|first3=S.H.|last4=Phan|first4=T.D.|last5=Jahedi|first5=M.|last6=Nagarajah|first6=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a flow rate of more than 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min, heating power of 18&amp;nbsp;kW. It is used for spraying pure metal powders with the sizes of 5–50&amp;nbsp;µm. In low pressure cold spray (LPCS), the working gas is a compressed gas with pressure 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;MPa, flow rate 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min and the heating power 3–5&amp;nbsp;kW. It is used for spraying a mechanical mixture of metal and ceramic powders. The inclusion of a ceramic component in the mixture provides high-quality coatings with relatively low energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-008-9203-3|title=Review on Cold Spray Process and Technology: Part I—Intellectual Property|journal=Journal of Thermal Spray Technology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=495|year=2008|last1=Irissou|first1=Eric|last2=Legoux|first2=Jean-Gabriel|last3=Ryabinin|first3=Anatoly N.|last4=Jodoin|first4=Bertrand|last5=Moreau|first5=Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
The most prevailing bonding theory in cold spraying is attributed to "[[Adiabatic shear band|adiabatic shear instability]]" which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate from the point of contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in [[viscous flow]] of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to [[melting point|melting temperature]] of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in [[explosive welding]] of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-009-9298-1|title=Bonding Mechanisms in Cold Spraying: The Contributions of Metallurgical and Mechanical Components|year=2009|last1=Hussain|first1=T.|last2=McCartney|first2=D.

== Key parameters in cold spray ==
There are several factors that can affect the quality of cold-sprayed coatings and the deposition efficiency. Main influential factors are: 
* Gas type, e.g. air, nitrogen, helium
* Gas pressure 
* Gas temperature
* Particle size
* Feedstock material properties, e.g. density, strength, melting temperature 
* Nozzle type
* Substrate
* Deposition kinetics (gun transverse speed, scan velocity, number of passes …)
* Standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the cold spray nozzle and the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahiri | first1 = Saden H. | last2 = Antonio | first2 = Christian I. | last3 = Jahedi | first3 = Mahnaz | year = 2009 | title = Elimination of porosity in directly fabricated titanium via cold gas dynamic spraying | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013608002112 | journal = Int. J. Journal of Materials Processing Technology | volume = 209 | issue = 2| pages = 922–929 | doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2008.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cold spray parameters are selected with respect to the desired coating characteristics and economic considerations. This can be done by considering correlations between process parameters and final coating properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-011-9662-9|title=On Parameter Selection in Cold Spraying|journal=Journal of Thermal Spray Technology|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1161|year=2011|last1=Assadi|first1=H.|last2=Schmidt|first2=T.|last3=Richter|first3=H.|last4=Kliemann|first4=J.-O.|last5=Binder|first5=K.|last6=Gärtner|first6=F.|last7=Klassen|first7=T.|last8=Kreye|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also software packages available for this purpose.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
CS has many advantages that make the technology potentially very competitive. Being a cold process, the initial physical and chemical particle properties are retained and the heating of the substrate is minimal, resulting in cold-worked microstructure of coatings where no melting and solidification happen. Dynamic recrystallization with refined grains has been observed between particle and particle bonding region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.07.020|title=Dynamic recrystallization in the particle/particle interfacial region of cold-sprayed nickel coating: Electron backscatter diffraction characterization|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=61|issue=9|pages=899|year=2009|last1=Zou|first1=Yu|last2=Qin|first2=Wen|last3=Irissou|first3=Eric|last4=Legoux|first4=Jean-Gabriel|last5=Yue|first5=Stephen|last6=Szpunar|first6=Jerzy A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.11.034|title=Microstructure and nanohardness of cold-sprayed coatings: Electron backscattered diffraction and nanoindentation studies|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=62|issue=6|pages=395|year=2010|last1=Zou|first1=Yu|last2=Goldbaum|first2=Dina|last3=Szpunar|first3=Jerzy A.|last4=Yue|first4=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the technology allows to spray thermally sensitive materials and highly dissimilar materials combinations, due to the fact that the adhesion mechanism is purely mechanical.

Other advantages are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The cold spray materials deposition process|last = Champagne|first = Victor K.|publisher = Woodhead Publishing|year = 2007|isbn = 9781845691813|location =|pages = 63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High thermal and electrical conductivity of coatings;
* High density and hardness of coatings;
* High homogeneity of coatings;
* Low shrinking;
* Possibility to spray micro-sized particles (5–10 μm);
* Possibility to spray nanomaterials and amorphous materials;
* Short stand off distance;
* Minimum surface preparation;
* Low energy consumption;
* Possibility to obtain complex shapes and internal surfaces;
* High productivity due to high power feed rate;
* High deposition rates and efficiencies;
* Possibility to collect and reuse 100% of particles;
* No toxic wastes;
* No combustion;
* Increased operational safety due to the absence of high temperature gas jets and radiation.
The jet obtained is a high-density particle beam due to the small size of the nozzle (10–15&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the short stand-off distance (25&amp;nbsp;mm). This results in high focus of the jet and precise control over the deposition area. Finally, inducing compressive stresses allows to obtain dense uniform and ultra-thick (20 μm – 50&amp;nbsp;mm) coatings.

On the other side, some difficulties can be found. For instance, it is difficult to spray hard and brittle materials because, in this case, mechanical adhesion through plastic deformation could be not as effective as it is for ductile particles. Other problems could include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Near-zero ductility in the as-sprayed condition;
* Need for ductile substrate;
* Difficulty in processing pure ceramics and some alloys as work-hardening alloys;
* high cost of Helium;
* fouling and erosion of the nozzle.

==Applications==

===Coatings===
The ability for CS to deposit materials that are phase-sensitive or temperature-sensitive has positioned the technique to prepare coatings not possible with other thermal spray techniques. CS can generally be used to produce coatings of a wide variety of metals, alloys, and metal-based composites, including those materials that have an exceptionally high melting temperatures (e.g. [[tantalum]], [[niobium]], [[superalloys]]). The process is also valuable for depositing materials that are extremely sensitive to the presence of oxygen and will readily oxidize at modest elevated temperatures – a result which is deleterious to the performance of these materials. Some examples of oxygen sensitive coatings that are commonly produced with CS are aluminum, copper, titanium, and carbide composites (e.g. [[tungsten carbide]]),&lt;ref&gt;Karthikeyan, J. (December, 2004). [http://www.asbindustries.com/documents/int_status_report.pdf "Cold Spray Technology: international status and USA efforts"]. ASB Industries. &lt;/ref&gt; as well as coatings made from amorphous alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A.P. (January 2006) [http://www.inovati.com/information/literature/amorphous-ni.pdf "Ni-based fully amorphous metallic coating with high corrosion resistance"]. Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, Institute of Metal Research. &lt;/ref&gt;

Additional developments in CS are related to the deposition of ceramic materials on metals, notably [[titanium dioxide]] for photocatalytic effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kliemann | first1 = J. -O. | last2 = Gutzmann | first2 = H. | last3 = Gärtner | first3 = F. | last4 = Hübner | first4 = H. | last5 = Borchers | first5 = C. | last6 = Klassen | first6 = T. | doi = 10.1007/s11666-010-9563-3 | title = Formation of Cold-Sprayed Ceramic Titanium Dioxide Layers on Metal Surfaces | journal = Journal of Thermal Spray Technology | volume = 20 | pages = 292–298 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of CS in [[additive manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solid-State Spray Forming of Aluminum Near-Net Shapes|journal= JOM|volume= 49|issue= 8|pages= 31|url= http://www.inovati.com/information/literature/jom97.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF02914398|year= 1997|last1= Gabel|first1= Howard|last2= Tapphorn|first2= Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repair===
Cold spray is now used to repair machine parts in a matter of minutes. Metal (nickel alloys) particles travel in a blend of [[nitrogen]] and [[helium]] gas and gradually stack up on the damaged part to recreate the desired surface. A robot controls the movement of the sprayer. The U.S. Army uses the technology to repair a component in [[Blackhawk helicopter]]s. [[General Electric]] is adapting the technology for civilian applications.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Matt. (2013-11-22) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/11/22/repairing-an-airplane-engine-on-a-tight-budget-might-become-a-lot-easier/ Repairing an airplane engine on a tight budget might become a lot easier]. The Washington Post. Retrieved on 2016-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
Additive manufacturing using cold spray technology can be used to develop parts and components rapidly with deposition rates as high as 45kg/hour - much faster than other additive manufacturing methods.

Unlike other additive manufacturing methods such as [[selective laser melting]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Selective laser melting]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} or electron beam additive manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;[[Electron-beam additive manufacturing]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}, cold spray technology does not melt metals. This means that metals are not affected by heat-related distortion, and parts do not need to be manufactured in an inert gas or vacuum sealed environment, allowing the creation of much larger structures. The world's largest and fastest metal 3D printer has a build envelope of 9 x 3 x 1.5m and utilizes gas dynamic cold spray. Manufacturing with cold spray technology provides advantages such as the ability to create shapes with no shape or size constraints, more efficient buy-to-fly ratio when compared to machining, and capable of fusing dissimilar metals to create hybrid metal parts - materials such as titanium alloys, copper, zinc, stainless steel, aluminium, nickel, even hastelloy and inconel can be sprayed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/MF/Areas/Metals/Cold-Spray | title=Cold spray for melt-less direct manufacturing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9193">[[File:Gulf of Maine Closure Areas.jpg|thumb|388x388px|Gulf of Maine Closed Areas]]The [[Gulf of Maine]] has been fished since the 1700s, and has been a historic fishing area since. Climate change is having significant impacts on this ecosystem; between 2004 and 2013, the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99.9% of the global oceans, increasing average temperature by {{Convert|2|C-change|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pershing|first=Andrew J.|last2=Alexander|first2=Michael A.|last3=Hernandez|first3=Christina M.|last4=Kerr|first4=Lisa A.|last5=Bris|first5=Arnault Le|last6=Mills|first6=Katherine E.|last7=Nye|first7=Janet A.|last8=Record|first8=Nicholas R.|last9=Scannell|first9=Hillary A.|date=2015-11-13|title=Slow adaptation in the face of rapid warming leads to collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/809|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6262|pages=809–812|doi=10.1126/science.aac9819|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26516197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having seen the depletion of [[groundfish]] stocks starting in the early 1990s, managers took care to create five closure areas in the Gulf of Maine.

These closed areas do not prohibit all fishing, rather they prevent the further degradation of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] habitat and groundfish species. Closed areas are different than [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]] (MPA) because they allow some forms of fishing and other activities to occur that would normally not be allowed in MPA.

== Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area ==

=== Background ===
The Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area (WGoMAC) was established in 1998 in response to the decreasing [[Atlantic cod|Atlantic Cod]] (''Gadus morhua'') stock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol17/iss1/art20/|title = Ecology and Society: Implementing the Western Gulf of Maine Area Closure: The Role and Perception of Fishers' Ecological Knowledge|website = www.ecologyandsociety.org|access-date = 2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGoMAC is located off the shores of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine and is approximately {{Convert|3100|km2||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is rectangular and runs in straight lines from 42° 15' to 43° 15' North, and 69° 55' to 70° 15' West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/regs/infodocs/multsclosedareas.pdf|title = Northeast (NE) Multispecies Information Sheet Closed Area Regulations|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charter and recreational vessels are allowed and may fish with a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cashes Ledge Closure Area ==

=== Background ===
Cashes Ledge Closure Area (CL) was permanently closed in 1998, in response to overfished groundfish resources.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murawski|first=Steven A.|last2=Wigley|first2=Susan E.|last3=Fogarty|first3=Michael J.|last4=Rago|first4=Paul J.|last5=Mountain|first5=David G.|date=2005-01-01|title=Effort distribution and catch patterns adjacent to temperate MPAs|url=http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/6/1150|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science: Journal du Conseil|language=en|volume=62|issue=6|pages=1150–1167|doi=10.1016/j.icesjms.2005.04.005|issn=1054-3139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area boundaries of the five sided polygon that is CL run from 42° 42.5' to 43° 0.7' North, and 68° 46' to 69° 26' West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cashes Ledge is a shallow habitat ({{Convert|30-33|m||abbr=on}}) known for being rocky bottom habitat, located {{Convert|130|km||abbr=on}} off the Northeastern US shore.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinnegar|first=J.k.|last2=Polunin|first2=N.v.c.|last3=Francour|first3=P.|last4=Badalamenti|first4=F.|last5=Chemello|first5=R.|last6=Harmelin-Vivien|first6=M.-L.|last7=Hereu|first7=B.|last8=Milazzo|first8=M.|last9=Zabala|first9=M.|date=2000-06-01|title=Trophic cascades in benthic marine ecosystems: lessons for fisheries and protected-area management|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0376892900000205|journal=Environmental Conservation|volume=|issue=02|pages=179–200|doi=|issn=1469-4387}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Charter and recreational vessels are allowed and may fish with a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on fisheries ===
This area serves as habitat for fish such as cod and pollock,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and cod found in these areas have a higher mean age and gut fullness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/73/2/316.full|title=A comparison of cod life-history parameters inside and outside of four year-round groundfish closed areas in New England, USA|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the closed area is working, and the fish are living longer and have access to more food. With cod stock having been decreased steadily since the early 1990s, having healthier and more robust fish will positively impact the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Closed Area I ==

=== Background ===
Closed Area I (CA-I) was established in 1994 in an effort to protect [[Benthic zone|benthic]] habitat and groundfish species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The area boundaries of the four sided polygon run from 40° 45' to 41° 30' North and 68° 30' to 69° 23' West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fishing vessels that are suing exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vessels using a midwater trawl are allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the success of the scalloping industry, [[Scallop#Wild_fisheries|scallop fishing]] is allowed, as well as vessels in the multispecies Special Access Program (SAP).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on fisheries ===
CA-I is known for high aggregations of [[haddock]], with 73% of the US catch being within {{Convert|5|km||abbr=on}} of the closed area.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is an area also known for [[winter flounder]] and [[yellowtail flounder]], suggesting these closed areas are aiding unsustainable populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The northern edge of CA-I is fished intensely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Closed Area II ==

=== Background ===
Closed Area II (CA-II) was established in 1994 in an effort to protect [[Benthic zone|benthic]] habitat and groundfish species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The area boundaries of the four sided polygon run from 41° 00' to 42° 22' North and 66° 35.8' to 67° 20' West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fishing vessels that are suing exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vessels using a midwater trawl are allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the success of the scalloping industry, scallop fishing is allowed, as well as vessels in the groundfish Special Access Program (SAP).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on fisheries ===
This area serves as habitat for fish such as cod and pollock,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and cod found in these areas have a higher mean age and gut fullness.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This indicates that the closed area is working, and the fish are living longer and have access to more food. With cod stock having been decreased steadily since the early 1990s, having healthier and more robust fish will positively impact the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The southern edge of CA-II is fished intensely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Nantucket Lightship Closed Area ==

=== Background ===
Nantucket Lightship Closed Area (NLCA) was established in 1994 in an effort to protect [[Benthic zone|benthic]] habitat and groundfish species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is rectangular and runs in straight lines from 40° 20' to 40° 50' North, and 69° 00' to 70° 20' West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vessels using a midwater trawl are allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the success of the scalloping industry, scallop fishing is allowed, as well as vessels using [[Atlantic surf clam|surf clam]] or [[quahog]] dredging gear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Charter and recreational vessels are also allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">'''IDDEA (Interactive Discovery &amp; Design by Evolutionary Algorithms)''' is a [[quantitative marketing research|quantitative method]] used by [[Affinnova]], a market research company.  This method involves generating and presenting a number of design alternatives to persons who are participating in the design, selection, or market research exercise. 

The participants (referred to as “selectors”) transmit data indicative of their preferences among or between the presented design alternatives, and that data is used to derive a new generation of design alternatives or proposals. The new designs are generated through the use of a computer program exploiting a genetic or evolutionary computational technique. The process is repeated, typically for many iterations or cycles.

This technology is very effective in brand development, product optimization and concept testing. Compared to [[conjoint analysis (in marketing)]], IDDEA can search through billions of options and quantifiably identify interaction effects for top performing concepts.

'''[[Intellectual property]]''' (IP) consists of four kinds: [[patent]], [[trademark]], [[copyright]], and [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bramson|first=R.S.|date=1981|title=Intellectual property as collateral — patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights.|url=|journal=The Business Lawyer|volume=36|pages=1567-1604|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand these areas and use them correctly, a person needs to be trained and educated. That training may be delivered through various types of resources, including webinars, college courses, webpages, and books. Intellectual property education should teach the individual what these areas are, what aspects of the law apply to them, and how to understand normal situations which might arise regarding those specific area.  Because of its importance, intellectual property education should be available to people of all age groups and education levels. Because intellectual property laws are specific to each country, training on the topic is also specific to each country.

Copyright protects original expression of ideas in different forms, but not the ideas themselves. The goal of copyright law is to encourage individual and business entities to produce original work by rewarding them with exclusive rights for their benefits, which is subject to time and statutory exceptions.

As outlined in the United States Copyright Office's guide, [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Circular 1: Copyright Basics]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;United States Copyright Office, Library of Congress. (2017).  ''Copyright Basics'' (Circular 1). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;, a work is given copyright protection once it is fixed within a tangible medium, which includes "written works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial works, graphic works, sculptural works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The copyright protection given to the work provides the owner of the work with specific rights including the right to reproduce the work, the right to create a derivative work, the right to perform the work, the right to display the work, and the right to distribute copies of the work. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Governing Laws of Copyright ==

=== Constitution ===
United States copyrights law is based in U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to provide authors with certain exclusive rights in their writings for a limited period of time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/10617&lt;/nowiki&gt; U.S.C.A. § 106&lt;/ref&gt; The "writings" is a broad term, which means any work of original expression in any form or medium, including literary, artistic, musical and etc.. "Authors" is also a broad term, which includes all creators of works.

=== Copyright Act of 1976 ===
Copyright law is primarily governed by federal statute and the current controlling statute is Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.[https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf] Under the [[Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clause of Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. 6, cl. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, with few exceptions, the Copyright Act of 1976 preempts state law.

=== Regulations ===
The US Copyright Office administers copyrights authorized by the Copyright Act, whose functions include rulemaking, regulate copyright registration, administering statutory and compulsory licenses. It also provides legal and regulatory background information as well as procedural guidance on its [https://copyright.gov/ website].

=== TEACH Act ===
The federal [[TEACH Act]] (Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002) was signed in November 2002, and governs the use of copyrighted materials in online learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/teach-act|title=New Copyright Legislation (TEACH Act) {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TEACH Act eases some of the rules put in place by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2006/1/managing-intellectual-property-for-distance-learning|title=Managing Intellectual Property for Distance Learning|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities, including the University of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/uwcopy/Copyright_Law/TEACH_Act/|title=UW Copyright Connection : TEACH Act : TEACH Act|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide information about compliance with the TEACH Act, often related to the use of [[Learning management system|learning management systems]]

=== State Law ===
Though the Copyright Act preempts state law, state law covers the issues which is outside the scope of Copyright Act, such as works of authorship that have not been expressed in a tangible medium(outside of scope of "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 fixed in any tangible medium of expression]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102(a)&lt;/ref&gt;), right not equivalent to any of the "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 exclusive rights]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106&lt;/ref&gt;, etc..

=== International Copyright Treaties ===
International copyright treaties between U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is enforceable in U.S. territory under the Supremacy Clause, including: [[Berne Convention|The Berne Convention]], [[Universal Copyright Convention|The Universal Copyright Convention]], [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|The WIPO Copyright Treaty]], [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty|The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], [[Geneva Phonograms Convention|The Geneva Phonograms Convention]] and [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]. While their specific terms are different, two fundamental rules govern each member under each treaty: member countries must meet certain minimum standards for copyright protection in their local law and provide reciprocal treatment to copyright owners in other member jurisdictions. The copyright law provided by each jurisdiction is based on its own national laws.

== Popular Topics ==

=== Fair Use ===
[[Fair use]] is one important topic in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. Fair use law allows for limited use of copyrighted materials without seeking and/or acquiring copyright clearance from the copyright owner. There are four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount or portion used of the work, and (4) the effect of the use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461034081|title=Copyright and cultural institutions: Guidelines for digitization for U.S. libraries, archives, and museums|last=Hirtle|first=Peter, B.|date=|publisher=Cornell University Library|others=Hudson, Emily., &amp; Kenyon, Andrew T.|year=2009|isbn=9780935995107|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=461034081}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty, staff, and students may find a [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] helpful when determining whether or not their use of a material would fall under fair use. Columbia University Libraries' [https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html Copyright Advisory Services] provides their own [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] and information about fair use law, as well as other information regarding copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html|title=Copyright Advisory Services|last=|first=|date=|website=Columbia University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For further clarification on Fair Use and how to determine if a person's use falls under that exception, Stanford University has a [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/charts-and-tools/ Charts and Tools] section on their website. This website includes links to codes of best practices - including the Center for Media &amp; Social Impact's [http://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education/ Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education], a [http://dirc.vraweb.org/ Digital Image Rights Computator] to help a user discover if an image they wish to use is copyrighted, and a [http://navigator.carolon.net/ Copyright Navigator] that provides basic information on how copyright law works. Each of the links on the website equips a user with enough resources to determine if their use of a copyrighted material falls under the protection of Fair Use.

The legislative intent for fair use in Section 107 in Copyright Act is stated as following: "the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/us/works/aba/ibr/H.Rep.94-1476.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; H.R. REP. 94-1476, 66, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5680&lt;/ref&gt;  It means courts have broad discretion to decide fair use application. U.S. Copyright Office creates a [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html Fair Use Index] which summarizes the newest case law development in fair use. 

=== Public Domain ===
[[Public Domain]] is another important concept in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. If a work is in public domain - i.e., if its copyright has expired, been lost, or was never given - that work may be used by anyone. In order to help determine if a work is in Public Domain, Cornell University provides a [https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain Public Domain Flow Chart] to help users identify if a work is protected by copyright law. Stanford University Libraries' guide, [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ Welcome to the Public Domain], also provides in-depth information that can help users identify how a work enters the public domain based on the date it was published. For example, within the United States, all works that were created prior to 1923 are currently within the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University Libraries (2018). Copyright &amp; Fair Use: Welcome to the Public Domain. ''Stanford University''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further understand copyright and public domain, the [https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809 Copy This Podcast] provides listeners with a brief history of Copyright Law and Public Domain. Each podcast is approximately twelve minutes long and covers topics such as "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/pop-culture-and-the-public-domain Pop Culture and the Public Domain]," "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/you-use-it-more-than-you-realize Fair Use: You Use It More Than You Realize]," and "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/notice-and-takedown-leave-it-be Notice and Takedown: Leave it Be]." Each of these podcasts features experts and scholars of copyright law and can provide users with information about how to navigate the world of copyright. 

=== Orphan Works ===
[[Orphan work|Orphan works]], or works where the creator or rightsholder is unable to be determined, are an important current topic in copyright law. There is currently no legislation in the United States place to fully address this issue, though progress has been made specifically for music with the [[Music Modernization Act]] in 2018. 

After the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright holders were no longer required to register copyrighted works, which benefited copyright holders by simplifying the process to obtain and maintain copyright protection, but in turn complicated the process for potential users of copyrighted material to determine ownership over certain works as the central register for copyrighted materials was no longer deemed necessary. This made any usage of copyrighted materials outside of fair use a violation of copyright, but did not take into account the drastic changes of access and dissemination that would soon occur due to digitization and the internet. 

In 2006 the U.S. Copyright Office held a study and released a report on orphan works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|title=Report on Orphan Works|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main conclusion was that new legislation was needed to address this issue, and that clearly delineated steps need to be identified for potential users of such works, as well as protocols set in place for when an author comes forward. 

Another report, ‘Orphan Works and Mass Digitization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf|title=Orphan Works and Mass Digitization|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ was completed in 2012 with particular focus on how how efforts to preserve copyrighted material needed to be balanced with reasonable access to the work. This report laid out the prospective changes needed to alter the outdated legislation and better serve current informational needs. 

It is also important to note that in 2013, the UK passed a copyright act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works|title=Guidance: Copyright: orphan works|last=Intellectual Property Office|first=|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that permitted usage of orphan works as long as a diligent effort was made and certain conditions were met, such as filing a ‘notice of use’ for the work.

Michaels served as the longtime editor of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine from 1961 until his retirement in 1999.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |title= James W. Michaels, 86; former editor of Forbes|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-me-michaels5oct05,1,693358.story?coll=la-headlines-business|work= [[Bloomberg News]] |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2007-10-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Michaels was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], on June 17, 1921.&lt;ref name=afs/&gt; He attended the [[Culver Military Academy]] in Indiana and graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[economics]] in 1942. Michaels joined the [[U.S. military]] during [[World War II]]. He applied to the [[American Field Service]] in April 1943 and was sent to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] India to drive an [[ambulance]] for the [[British Army]] as part of AFS India Burma Unit 1.  James was the nephew of the comedy writer [[Al Boasberg]].

==Career==
James Michaels stayed with the military until September 1944 when he was released to the Office of War Information. After the war, Mr. Michaels remained in India and worked for the [[United Press]] wire service's New Delhi office, giving Mr. Michaels the biggest story of his life; in 1948 he broke the story of the assassination of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Mr. Michaels spent over four decades with ''Forbes'' magazine, after joining as a reporter in 1954 and rising to [[managing editor]] in 1957 where he served until 1961 when he became editor.

Mr. Michaels retired from ''Forbes'' magazine in 1999 and was succeeded as editor by [[William Baldwin (editor)|William Baldwin]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He left the magazine to help expand the [[Forbes|Forbes Inc]] [[parent company]] into new [[mediums]] including [[television]], [[books]] and [[new media]]. During his time as with Forbes, the magazine's circulation grew from 130,000 to 785,000, demonstrating how much readers enjoyed the magazine.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

==Editorial Style==

According to [[Allan Sloan]] of ''Fortune'' magazine, James Michaels, "was an absolutely brilliant editor who transformed business magazine journalism."&lt;ref name=sloan&gt;{{cite news|author=Allan Sloan |title=A farewell to a brilliant business editor |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/10/03/magazines/fortune/sloan_michaelsobit.fortune/?postversion=2007100318 |work=Fortune.com |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316042641/http://money.cnn.com/2007/10/03/magazines/fortune/sloan_michaelsobit.fortune/?postversion=2007100318 |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Forbes]] described James Michaels as a tough editor who wanted articles short, dramatic, and opinionated.&lt;ref name = forbes/&gt; According to the New York Times, when Michaels took over as editor, "American journalism remained a polite, dry affair, and corporate spin was reported without much skepticism. Ahead of his time, he made Forbes opinionated, interpretive and often indecorous, a magazine staunchly pro-business (and, its critics said, pro-wealthy) but did not hesitate to skewer companies and executives it saw as failures."&lt;ref name = nytimes&gt;{{cite news | author = RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA | title = James Michaels, Longtime Forbes Editor, Dies at 86 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/business/04michaels.html | work = The New York Times | date = 2007-10-04 | accessdate = 2009-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Forbes, "he despised 'bad actors' who were cheating investors, customers, employees."

According to the New York Times many of his former writers and editors remember Mr. Michaels as much for his brutal assessments of their work as for his incisive teaching. While always a gentlemen and available to talk, he could not stand verbose writing and would ruthlessly cut words and forced writers to state their view. A staunch contrarian, he did not let public opinion dictate the magazines views.

Michaels focused on the needs of his readers, rather than pleasing corporate executives or the mainstream media. [[Allan Sloan]] wrote, "Unlike many of his competitors, Michaels didn't particularly lionize corporate chieftains. His focus was on representing small investors' interests."&lt;ref name = sloan/&gt; Mr. Michaels wrote, "MY THESIS is this: If newspapers hope to survive they would do well to be less concerned with a liberal social agenda and more with the lives, hopes, and fears of their potential readers."&lt;ref name = national&gt;{{cite news | author = James W. Michaels | title = One size fits none - development of politically correct slant in newspaper reporting | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v45/ai_13952926/?tag=content;co11 | work = National Review | date = 1993-06-21 | accessdate = 2009-06-03 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaels was a hater of [[weasel words]]. William Baldwin (current Forbes editor) wrote "Jim had a novel idea. Why not speak to the reader as if you were speaking to a friend on a street corner? Brevity helps. Judgments help. If the chairman of the company is a nincompoop, say so -- if there's evidence to prove it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = William Baldwin | title = James W. Michaels, feather ruffler | url = https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0111/6301116a.html | work = Forbes.com | date = 1999-01-11 | accessdate = 2009-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As editor, Michaels edited 1,000 issues and he worked on almost every story. He wanted articles to be shorter, more direct, and with a clear conclusion to ensure they were fit for readers. He also wanted stories in Forbes to be original. If a story had been covered in another publication, he didn't want it in the magazine. To quote him, "Our readers look to us for groundbreaking, helpful stuff. Who needs us if we're doing what everyone else is doing?"

==Contributions==
Mr. Michaels' writing on Gandhi's death is included in the anthology "A Treasury of Great Reporting".&lt;ref name=afs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afs.org/afs_or/news/index/5488 |title=James W. Michaels (1921-2007) |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |work=AFS News |publisher=AFS Intercultural Programs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721140513/http://www.afs.org/afs_or/news/index/5488 |archivedate=2009-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels' dispatches from India are still taught in [[journalism]] [[anthologies]] of model [[Journalism|reporting]] on [[time limit|deadline]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Steve Forbes credits Mr. Michaels with Forbes success. Mr. Forbes wrote, "When Jim joined FORBES in 1954, this magazine was, to put it charitably, second-tier. Moreover, business journalism itself was a backwater, a place where publications dumped their drunks and burned-out sportswriters. Today business, finance and economics are front-page stuff." "Jim made FORBES not only the most influential magazine in the business field but also one of the world's premier publications. Indeed, with no exaggeration, Jim Michaels was the foremost editor of our era. He virtually created modern business journalism."&lt;ref name = forbes/&gt;

In the 1950s Mr. Michaels foresaw the growth of the then nascent mutual fund industry. Michaels was integral in the development of Forbes' grading system of the long-term performance of funds.&lt;ref name = forbes&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Steve_Forbes | author = Steve Forbes | title = James W. Michaels | url = https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1029/023_print.html | work = Forbes.com | date = 2007-10-29 | accessdate = 2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He helped create the [[Forbes 400]] ranking of America's richest people, first published in 1982.

==Mentorship and Influence==
Mr. Michaels has been cited as mentoring and influencing a long and influential group of writers, journalists, and editors including (but not necessarily limited to): [[Norman Pearlstine]], [[Allan Sloan]], [[Richard Behar]], [[David Churbuck]], [[Gretchen Morgenson]], [[Kenneth Fisher]], [[Peter Brimelow]], [[William M Reddig Jr]] and [[Ed Finn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.churbuck.com/wordpress/?p=1383 | title = James W. Michaels | accessdate =   2009-06-01 | author =  David Churbuck | date =  2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Michaels was honored with many awards, including the [[Gerald Loeb Award|Loeb Award]] (1972), Editor of the Year by Ad Week (1983), and Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award (1994). The TJFR Group honored Michaels by naming him one of the Top Ten Business News Luminaries of the Century.&lt;ref name = afs/&gt;

==Death==
James Michaels died at age 86 of [[pneumonia]] on October 2, 2007 in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Michaels was a resident of Manhattan and [[Rhinebeck, New York]], at the time of his death. Michaels was survived by his wife, Jean Briggs, whom he married June 29, 1985. Jean Briggs spent time as a senior editor and manager of the reporter/resesarcher department at Forbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = James W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25234">A '''knock-down kit''' is a kit containing the parts needed to assemble a product. The parts are typically manufactured in one country or region, then [[export]]ed to another country or region for final assembly. Variant names include '''knockdown kit''', '''knocked-down kit''', or simply '''knockdown''', and the abbreviated '''KD''' or '''CKD'''.

A common form of knock-down is a '''complete knock-down''' ('''CKD'''), which is a kit of the completely non-assembled parts of a product. It is also a method of supplying parts to a market, particularly in shipping to foreign nations, and serves as a way of counting or pricing.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller | first=Russell R. |title=Doing business in newly privatized markets: global opportunities and challenges |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2000 | page=281 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9SVncxZNLYC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Basic+Knock+Down+Kit&amp;q |isbn=978-1-56720-260-1 |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CKD is a common practice in the [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[bus]], heavy [[truck]] and [[rail transport|rail vehicle]] industries, as well as electronics, furniture and other products. Businesses sell knocked-down kits to their foreign affiliates or licensees for various reasons, including the avoidance of import taxes, to receive tax preferences for providing local manufacturing jobs, or even to be considered as a bidder at all (for example, in [[public transport]] projects with "buy national" rules).

A '''semi-knocked-down kit''' ('''SKD''') is a kit of the partially assembled parts of a product. It is also called an '''incompletely disassembled kit''', although it has never been assembled. Both types of KDs, complete and incomplete, are collectively referred to within the auto industry as '''KDX''' (for '''knocked-down export'''), and cars assembled in the country of origin and exported whole to the destination market are known as '''BUX''' (for '''built-up export''').

Technically, the terms "knock-down", "incompletely disassembled kit" and "kits of parts" are all [[misnomer]]s, because the knock-downs were never built up in the first place, and the shipments of parts are often not in the form of kits,&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; but rather bulk-packed by type of part into [[shipping container]]s. The degree of "knock-down" depends on the desires and technical abilities of the receiving organization, or on government import regulations.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Developing nations may pursue trade and economic policies that call for [[import substitution]] or local content regulations.  Companies with CKD operations help the country substitute the finished products it imports with locally assembled substitutes.

Knock-down kit assembling plants are less expensive to establish and maintain, because they do not need modern robotic equipment, and the workforce is usually much less expensive in comparison to the home country. The plants may also be effective for low-volume production. The CKD concept allows firms in developing markets to gain expertise in a particular industry. At the same time, the CKD kit exporting company gains new markets that would otherwise be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lind |first=Tommy |url=http://www.tlind.dk/eng-rhistory_louis.htm |title=Partnerships - a solution |publisher=Tommy Lind's History of Renault 1898-1975 |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automotive==
In the automotive industry, the most basic form of a vehicle in KD kit lacks the wheels, [[internal combustion engine]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[battery (electricity)|battery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} They are either supplied as ''parts'' for assembly (a "complete" kit), or obtained from third parties (an "incomplete" kit); all of the interiors are already installed at the originating factory. The term SKD for semi-knocked-down refers to a kit with a complete, welded car body, usually coated or already painted. To gain some extra tax preferences, the manufacturer needs to further ''localise'' the car, i.e. increase the share of parts produced by local manufacturers, such as tires, wheels, seats, headlights, windscreens and glass, batteries, interior plastics, etc., even down to the engine and transmission.  At some point, the steel body could be pressed, welded, and painted locally, which effectively makes KD assembly only a couple of steps away from full-scale production.

By the time that [[Henry Ford]] co-wrote his 1922 memoir ''My Life and Work'', the Ford Motor Company was already shipping car parts from its Michigan plants for final assembly in the regions of the United States or foreign countries where the cars would be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Henry |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel | year=1922 |title=My Life and Work |publisher=Garden City Publishing |pages=81, 167 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ford+1922+%22My+Life+and+Work%22 |access-date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, a great number of U.S. and Canadian-built vehicles&amp;nbsp;— most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW and vehicles from the [[Canadian Military Pattern truck|CMP family]]&amp;nbsp;— were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries, in order to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single Unit Pack), or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds or tires, that were built and provided locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CMP Assembly Overseas|journal=Wheels &amp; Tracks |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhf4ynHqVqA&amp;feature=related|title=148th MVA Ordnance - WWII - Dad in France on Assembly Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited]] in [[India]] began its business in 1947 with assembling CKD [[Jeep]]s.  Mahindra expanded their operations to include domestic manufacture of Jeep vehicles with a high level of local content [[Licence-built|under license]] from [[Kaiser Jeep Corporation]] and later [[American Motors]] (AMC).

In the 1950s and 1960s [[Lotus Cars]] sold its [[Lotus Seven]] car in CKD form to avoid the UK [[purchase tax]] that applied to sales of fully assembled vehicles.

By 1959, and with the introduction of the [[Mini]], the products of [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] were still either imported or assembled from CKD kits in several international markets.

In 1961, [[Renault]] began negotiations for a first partnership agreement with AMC for assembly of [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] automobiles in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lind |first=Tommy |url=http://www.tlind.dk/eng-rhistory_louis.htm  |title=International agreements... |publisher=Tommy Lind's History of Renault 1898-1975 |access-date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1962, and continuing until 1967, AMC also sold CKD kits of its passenger cars to Renault.  They were assembled in Renault's factory in [[Haren, Belgium]] and sold through its dealers in [[Algeria]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].  The deal allowed AMC to sell its cars in new markets without having to make a major [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI).  The arrangement was good for the French automaker because its product range was lacking large cars and it needed to offer an "executive" model in its European markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://club.doctissimo.fr/phedor/blog/cimetiere-oubliees-rambler-2264660.html |title=Le cimetière des autos oubliées: Renault Rambler (1962-67) |publisher=The graveyard of forgotten cars |language=French |date=2007-04-04 |access-date=2010-06-08 |journal= |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69tfaWqwX?url=http://blog.doctissimo.fr/phedor/cimetiere-oubliees-rambler-2264660.html |archive-date=2012-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation had changed by 1977. It was now AMC that sought outside support for a new car in the United States [[subcompact car|sub-compact]] market segment, which led to the first of many agreements with Renault.

Volvo's [[Volvo Halifax Assembly|Halifax Assembly Plant]], which opened 1963, completed vehicles in CKD form from Sweden for North American consumers. Halifax Assembly closed in December 1998.

In 1967, [[Rootes Group]] UK began exporting CKD [[Rootes Arrow|Hillman Hunters]] to Iran where they were sold as the [[Paykan]] (meaning "arrow" in [[Persian language|Persian]]). Bought by Chrysler in 1967 and then part of the sale to the [[PSA Group]] by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] of its European operations in late 1978, the Rootes business basis in Iran became the primer for the very significant PSA Peugeot Citroën business in Iran involving engine and CKD deliveries, particularly from the 405, introduced in 1990 and facelifted as the Pars in 1999 and 206 introduced in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Peugeot Pars: petite histoire de la 405 iranienne !, uploaded on 15 Sept. 2015, con sulted on 17 Febr. 2017 [http://boitierrouge.com/2015/09/05/peugeot-pars-petite-histoire-de-la-405-iranienne/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Peugeot's partner [[Iran Khodro]] produced 281'000 Peugeot vehicles, securing a 36% market share.

In 1967 as well, [[Peugeot]] introduced CKD-based production of a light pick-up vehicle based on the [[Peugeot 403]] in Peugeot's Berazategui factory (in [[Buenos Aires]]) under the name Peugeot 4TB.&lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Uldane, La primera camioneta de SAFRAR, article containing many additional links, consulted on 17 Febr. 2017 [https://www.taringa.net/post/autos-motos/18473438/La-primera-camioneta-de-SAFRAR.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, this model was replaced by the [[Peugeot 404|404 pick-up]] and later (1990) by the [[Peugeot 504|504 pick-up]]. The 404 and 504 were massively marketed worldwide through local CKD assembly shops: the 404 was assembled, besides France and Argentina, in Australia, Belgium, Canada (at the SOMA plant shared with Renault), Chile, Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Perú, Rhodesia, South Africa and Uruguay;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1972 | ref = WC72 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 402 | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-910714-04-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 504, mainly in Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South-Africa, Australia and China by the [[Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company]] which developed a specific crew cab version.

In 1968, the independent German automotive firm, [[Karmann]], began assembly of CKD kits of AMC's newly introduced [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] for distribution in Europe.  American Motors also provided [[right hand drive]] versions of their automobiles to markets such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. The components were shipped in containers to Australia from AMC's plants in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], or [[Brampton, Ontario]]. Assembly of Rambler and AMC vehicles in Australia was done by [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]]. Local content requirements were met by using Australian suppliers for the interiors (seats, carpeting, etc.) as well as for lights, heaters, and other components.  Various Rambler models were assembled in New Zealand from the early 1960s until 1971 by Campbell Motors in [[Thames, New Zealand#Business|Thames]] (later [[Toyota New Zealand]]), which had also built Toyota, Datsun, Hino, Renault, and Peugeot cars.

New Zealand had developed a car assembly industry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Mark|year=2002|title=Assembly: New Zealand car production 1921-98 |publisher=Reed Books |location=New Zealand |pages=1–223 |isbn=0-7900-0846-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means of [[import substitution]] and providing local employment, despite the small size of the local market.   Following economic reforms in the 1980s, including the lowering of import tariffs, the ability to import Australian-built vehicles duty-free under the [[Closer Economic Relations|CER]] agreement, many car companies ended assembly in New Zealand and switched to importing completely built up vehicles from [[Japan]], [[Australia]], or [[Europe]].  More significantly, the easing of import restrictions led to a large number of Japanese [[grey import vehicles|used imports]], which were far cheaper than locally assembled used cars, and continue to outnumber so-called 'NZ New' vehicles. The last companies to assemble CKD kits in New Zealand were [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Honda]], which closed their plants in 1998, when the government announced plans to abolish import tariffs on cars.

More recent examples include [[Ukraine]], which has almost prohibitive import taxes on finished cars. [[ZAZ|AutoZAZ]] assembles CKD kits of some [[Lada]], [[Opel]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aval.ua/eng/press/partners/?id=35008 "ZAZ increased car output by 7% in Q1 2006" Bank AVAL], retrieved on: 3 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711205613/http://www.aval.ua/eng/press/partners/?id=35008 |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It went as far as adopting a version of [[Daewoo Lanos]] for full-scale production and equipping it with a domestic engine.  The German [[automotive industry|automotive]] giant - [[Volkswagen Group]] also produces SKDs in the Ukraine at its [[Solomonovo]] plant, producing cars under its [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] and [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] [[marque]]s.

In [[Russia]], the most well-known KD assembling facilities are owned by [[Avtotor]],{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} which produces [[Hummer H2]], [[BMW 3 Series]] and [[BMW 5 Series]] in [[Kaliningrad]], and [[Renault Logan]] in [[Moscow]] using facilities that once belonged to [[AZLK]].  In [[Kaluga]], Volkswagen Group is currently constructing a new plant, which when completed, is expected to have an annual output of 150,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Volkswagen Plant in Kaluga |publisher=Volkswagen-Media-Services.com |date=28 February 2009 |url=https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/medias_publish/ms/content/en/pressemitteilungen/2009/02/28/the_volkswagen_plant.standard.gid-oeffentlichkeit.html |access-date=2009-08-22 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daimler AG]] has a CKD assembly plant in [[South Carolina]] that re-assembles [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] vans for sale in the United States and Canada at [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] dealers, along with [[Dodge]] dealers prior to [[Fiat Group]]'s takeover of [[Chrysler Group LLC]] &amp;mdash; essentially to circumvent the 25% tariff on imported light trucks known as the "[[Chicken Tax]]". The Sprinter was eventually replaced in the Dodge/[[Ram Trucks|Ram]] lineup with the similar Ram ProMaster, a rebadged [[Fiat Ducato]]. Unlike the CKD Dodge Sprinter, the ProMaster is fully imported to the U.S. from a Chrysler plant in [[Mexico]], which is part of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and not subject to the Chicken Tax.

In 2009, [[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited]] announced that it would export pickup trucks powered by [[diesel engine]]s from India to the United States in knockdown kit (CKD) form, again to circumvent the [[chicken tax]].&lt;ref name="mtrend"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mahindra Planning Kit Assembly of Diesel Pickups To Avoid Chicken Tax |journal=Motor Trend |first=Benson |last=Kong |date=June 2009 |url= http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2009/163_news090601_mahindra_planning_kit_assembly_of_diesel_pickups_to_avoid_chicken_tax/index.html |access-date=23 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahindra planned to export CKDs to the United States as complete vehicles that will be assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates.&lt;ref name="mtrend"/&gt; However, Mahindra's United States CKD and export plans never materialized and were subject to several lawsuits.

Since 2013 [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] operates an assembly plant in [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-opens-assembly-plant-tilburg-netherlands|title=Tesla Motors Opens Assembly Plant in Tilburg, Netherlands|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the assembly of their fully electric [[Tesla Model S|Model S]] sedan and [[Tesla Model X|Model X]] SUV for the [[European Union]], but not all of Europe since only cars imported to the EU benefit from circumventing the 10% import duty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfax.eu/article/customs-clearance-and-import-tax-usa.html|title=Customs clearance &amp; import tax US cars|website=www.carfax.eu|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. cars to Norway are shipped directly from the United States). For the most part the car is still manufactured in the [[Tesla Factory]] in [[Fremont, California]]. During the final assembly in the Netherlands various parts are added to the car most notably the rear subframe with the drive train as well as the battery pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gopressmobility.be/2017/02/07/tesla-assembly-pant-tilburg-full-capacity/|title=Tesla assembly plant in Tilburg at full capacity|date=2017-02-07|website=GoPress Mobility|access-date=2017-09-08}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buses==

*[[Motor Coach Industries]] opened its [[Pembina, North Dakota]], assembly plant in 1963, as part of an expansion into the U.S. market. Unfinished KD (knocked down) coach bodies are shipped from [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], by flatbed trailer and completed, outfitted and delivered at Pembina. This practice simplifies [[U.S. Customs]] and meets the "[[Buy America Act]]" provisions (49 USC 5323(j) and 49 CFR Part 661) for public agencies purchasing new equipment with federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busmag.com/mci-celebrates-80-years-bus-production "MCI Celebrates 80 Years of Bus Production", National Bus Trader, June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[North American Bus Industries]] opened operations in [[Anniston, Alabama]], in 1993, with incomplete buses shipped from [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], to Anniston for final assembly. NABI expanded production operations in Anniston to allow full production with its first fully domestically produced bus unit in 2008.

==Rail==
*The practice of selling "knocked down" railcars, called by that name, pre-dates the 20th century, as evidenced by an advertisement by [[J. G. Brill and Company]] in the ''Street Railway Journal'' from 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brill |first=Debra |year=2001 |title=History of the J.G. Brill Company |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=56–57 |isbn=978-0-253-33949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many rail equipment builders have used kits or incomplete vehicles, often to meet local assembly and production requirements or quotas, or to satisfy tariffs. Some examples include:
**Between 1938 and 1951, the [[St. Louis Car Company]] shipped [[PCC streetcar]] body shells and trucks north for assembly by [[Canadian Car &amp; Foundry]]. The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC fleet]] was purchased and delivered in this method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetcar.org/streetcars/1074 Market Street Railway: "Historic Streetcars: Car 1074" Market Street Railway, San Francisco].&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] ships incomplete cars from its plant at [[La Pocatière, Quebec]], to [[Plattsburgh, New York]], and (until 2002) [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]], facilities for final assembly. These are to meet "Buy America Act" provisions for U.S. public transit agencies and tariff rules. Since 2009 the Plattsburgh assembly plant has full stainless steel welding and fabrication capability, allowing for cars to be fully assembled and completed on site.
**[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] (KHI) has an assembly plant in [[Yonkers, New York]], that completes final assembly of cars using bodies shipped from [[Kobe, Japan]]. KHI also has a car body plant in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], full cars are built there and can be shipped to Yonkers for completion.
**[[Alstom]]'s [[Hornell, New York]], assembly plant produces final completed cars using stainless body assemblies shipped from the Lapa plant in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The same production method was used by [[Morrison Knudsen]] when it built new passenger cars at the Hornell shops in the 1990s.
**From their first U.S. order from the [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] in 1982 until the opening of a full body manufacturing and assembly line in [[Rochelle, Illinois]] thirty years later,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-sharyo.co.jp/topics_e/tp130430.htm "Expansion of Rochelle Production Facility", Nippon Sharyo USA, Inc, 30 April 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nippon Sharyo]] sent commuter train bodies from Japan to U.S. finishers, including an American unit of [[Sumitomo]].
**[[Hyundai Rotem]] opened an assembly facility in [[South Philadelphia]], located in an industrial park off [[Columbus Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Columbus Boulevard]]. Car shells are assembled, outfitted and completed for delivery at this site, which is served by [[Conrail Shared Assets|Conrail]] on the [[Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad|Philadelphia Belt Line]], allowing delivery of new cars by rail.
**The [[London Underground]] [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]] and [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]] fleets have aluminium bodies built by [[Alstom]] in [[Barcelona]] with assembly completed at the [[Metro-Cammell]] works in [[Washwood Heath]], [[Birmingham]].

==Aircraft==
Unserviceable military [[aircraft]] are also sold as "knock-downs" after they have ended their [[service life]], packaging them with serviceable aircraft.  This allows them to be used for [[Cannibalization of machine parts|cannibalization]] of [[spare part]]s.

The European aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]] uses knock-down kits to assemble [[Airbus A320 family|A320 family]] aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 final assembly line in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] assembles fuselage, wing, and tail sections made in Europe with [[avionics]] and [[jet engine|engines]] made in [[European Union|Europe]] or the [[United States]] and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus has opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in [[Mobile, Alabama]]; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and tail sections. However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and tail sections from Europe via [[Ship transport|ocean freight]] using specially designed [[ship]]s, as the plants are located in [[port]] cities.

==Housing==
{{main|Kit houses in North America}}
[[File:Knock down kits for houses Popular Mechanics 1908.png|thumb|Advertisement for knocked down kits for houses, in ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1908.]]
A 1908 advertisement in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' attests that knock-down kits for houses were on the market by the early 20th century, if not before.

The '''Kolbe–Schmitt reaction''' or '''Kolbe process''' (named after [[Hermann Kolbe]] and [[Rudolf Schmitt]]) is a [[carboxyl]]ation [[chemical reaction]] that proceeds by heating sodium phenoxide (the [[sodium]] salt of [[phenol]]) with [[carbon dioxide]] under pressure (100 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]], 125&amp;nbsp;°C), then treating the product with [[sulfuric acid]]. The final product is an [[aromatic]] hydroxy [[acid]] which is also known as [[salicylic acid]] (the precursor to [[aspirin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By using [[potassium hydroxide]], [[4-hydroxybenzoic acid]] is accessible, an important precursor for the versatile [[paraben]] class of [[biocides]] used e.g. in personal care products.

The methodology is also used in the industrial synthesis of [[3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid|3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid]].  The regiochemistry of the carboxylation in this case is sensitive to temperature.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Gerald Booth|title=Naphthalene Derivatives|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a17_009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction proceeds via the nucleophile addition of a phenoxide, classically [[sodium phenoxide]] (NaOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), to carbon dioxide to give the salicylate.
The final step is reaction of the salicylate with acid to form the desired salicylic acid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7371">A '''limiting factor''' is a variable of a system that, if subject to a small change, causes a non-negligible change in an output or other measure of the system. A factor not limiting over a certain [[Domain of a function|domain]] of starting conditions may yet be limiting over another domain of starting conditions, including that of the factor.

==Overview==
The identification of a factor as limiting only in distinction to one or more other factors that are non-limiting. Disciplines differ in their use of the term as to whether they allow the simultaneous existence of more than one limiting factor (which may then be called "co-limiting"), but they all require the existence of at least one non-limiting factor when the terms are used.  There are several different possible scenarios of limitation when more than one factor is present.  The first scenario, called ''single limitation'' occurs when only one factor, the one with maximum demand, limits the system.  ''Serial co-limitation'' is when one factor has no direct limiting effects on the system, but must be present to increase the limitation of a second factor. A third scenario, ''independent limitation,'' occurs when two factors both have limiting effects on the system but work through different mechanisms.  Another scenario, ''synergistic limitation,'' occurs when both factors contribute to the same limitation mechanism, but in different ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecology==
In ''ecology'', common limiting factor [[Resource (biology)|resources]] are environmental conditions that limit the growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism or a population of organisms in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=TMS&gt;Thomas M. Smith., Robert Leo Smith. 2009. Or simply,  Limiting factors are things that prevent a population from growing any large. ''Elements of Ecology''. Pearson International Edition. 7th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|G-11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Limiting_factor|title=Limiting factor - Biology-Online Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of limiting factors is based on ''[[Liebig's Law]] of the Minimum,'' which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource. In other words, a factor is limiting if a change in the factor produces increased growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism, when other factors necessary to the organisms life do not. Limiting factors may be physical or biological.&lt;ref name=TMS/&gt;{{rp|417,8}}

Limiting factors are not limited to the condition of the species. Some factors may be increased or reduced based on circumstances. An example of a limiting factor is [[sunlight]] in the [[rain forest]], where growth is limited to all plants on the [[forest floor]] unless more light becomes available. This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process, but only one is in effect at any one place and time. This recognition that there is always a ''single'' limiting factor is vital in [[ecology]]; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes. The limiting factor also causes [[competition]] between individuals of a species population. For example, [[space]] is a limiting factor. Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival: food, water, and other biological needs. If the population of a species is too high, they start competing for those needs. Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve. Some other limiting factors in biology include [[temperature]] and other [[weather]] related factors. Species can also be limited by the availability of macro- and micronutrients.  There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems.  A study published in 2017 showed that sodium (a micronutrient) had no effect on its own, but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus (macronutrients), it did show positive effects, which is evidence of serial co-limitation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspari|first=Michael|last2=Roeder|first2=Karl A.|last3=Benson|first3=Brittany|last4=Weiser|first4=Michael D.|last5=Sanders|first5=Nathan J.|date=2017-02-01|title=Sodium co-limits and catalyzes macronutrients in a prairie food web|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=315–320|doi=10.1002/ecy.1677|pmid=27936500|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and technology==
AllBusiness.com defines a limiting (constraining) factor as an "item that restricts or limits production or sale of a given product". The examples provided include: "limited machine hours and labor-hours and shortage of materials and skilled labor. Other limiting factors may be cubic feet of display or warehouse space, or working capital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=AllBusiness Business Glossary|title=Business definition for: Limiting (constraining) factor|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/constraining-limiting-factor/4949815-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used in technology literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Sheriff, A., Bouchlaghem, D., El-Hamalawi, A., and Yeomans, S. |year=2012|title=Information Management in UK-Based Architecture and Engineering Organizations: Drivers, Constraining Factors, and Barriers|journal=Journal of Management Engineering|volume =28 |issue =2|pages= 170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institutional Factors in Information Technology Innovation|authors=

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of limiting business factors is part of the [[program evaluation and review technique]], [[critical path analysis]], and [[theory of constraints]] as presented in the novel ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]''.

In the design of [[chemical reaction]]s to produce a chemical product, one of the reagents may be consumed by the reaction before the others. The amount of product is limited by the supply of this reagent. This [[limiting reagent]] determines the theoretical [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] of the reaction.

'''Mahan Coal Limited''' is a disputed coal mine project in [[Singrauli district]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.   The project has been opposed by environmentalists since it seeks to pull down 1200 acres of old sal forests&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; for a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mahan-at-all-costs-34230&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 500,000 prime [[sal tree]]s would be chopped, and 54 villages&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/fAB8jZp3H6OUkFxdAUVbXK/A-war-to-save-our-forests.html&lt;/ref&gt; with a considerable tribal population would be displaced.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32443739 | title=How tribal Indians beat big coal firms | date=11 May 2015 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a group of villagers have also been supporting the mine since it would boost the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/madhya-pradesh-battle-for-coal-divides-mahan-villages/story-yyKkfeKOULc869B9wUVe3I.html | title=Madhya Pradesh: Battle for coal divides Mahan villages  | date=4 February 2015 | newspaper=Hindustan Times | first=Neeraj | last=Santoshi | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Mahan Coal Ltd is a Rs 5,000-crore joint venture between [[Essar Energy]] and the [[Aditya Birla Group]] (Hindalco).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/essar-hindalcos-mahan-coal-block-lobbying-for-3-yrs-greenpeace-claims-clearance-given-under-pressure/29279/&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the controversy is based on claims by [[Greenpeace India]] that the sanction for the coal mine was given based on a Gram Sabha (village board) resolution that had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;

}}Quote: Greenpeace alleged
that signatures of most of the villagers had been forged and that the
resolution also included signatures of at least six villagers who were not
alive.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The land was allocated to the company based on this document.  However, in 2014, the coal block land was deallocated by the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-supreme-court-cancels-214-of-218-coal-block-allocations-gives-operational-mines-6-months-to-wrap-up-2021185&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in sharp drops in the company's stocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/jspl-hindalco-drop-on-concerns-over-de-allocation-of-coal-mines-114090400273_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Its original allocation in 2006 is part of the [[Indian coal allocation scam]]. During investigations, the Ministry of Power stated that it had opposed a role for Hindalco in the mine,&lt;ref name=fp&gt;

quote: Ministry of Power [told the CBI] that it did not recommend the 2006
allocation of 
Mahan coal block to Hindalco. Instead, it claimed to have asked the Ministry
of Coal to allocate Mahan to Essar Power.
&lt;/ref&gt; but the coal ministry under [[Manmohan Singh]] allocated the mine to the joint company.

===Opposition by Greenpeace India===
Since the BJP government came to power, the project has seen considerable support, and has been linked in the media for the Government actions against Greenpeace India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/nda-govt-s-grouse-with-greenpeace-mahan-coal-block-protests-115022000023_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a Greenpeace campaigner very active in Mahan, was [[Priya Pillai Offloading|offloaded from a flight]] while she was to meet some British MPs inquiring into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-greenpeace-campaigner-priya-pillai-speaks-to-british-mp-s-via-skype-2052620&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue is relevant to Britain since Essar Power is listed in the London Stock Exchange.

This incident was seen

In March 2015, the Ministry of Environment did not give a clearance for the project,&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mahan-coal-block-mp-greenpeace-union-government/1/429588.html&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently Ministry of Coal announced that the Mahan coal block would not be auctioned for mining, which was viewed as a victory by the tribespeople living in the villages.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Background==
Shriver was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] He is part of the [[Kennedy political family]], since his mother was [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice Mary Kennedy]]. He may also be considered to be a part of the "Shriver political family", since his ancestor David Shriver was a delegate of [[Frederick County, Maryland]] who signed the Maryland Constitution and Bill of Rights at Maryland's Constitutional Convention of 1776. His father is [[Sargent Shriver]], the first director of the [[Peace Corps]] upon its establishment by President John F. Kennedy on March 1, 1961, a former ambassador to [[France]] and the 1972 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate. Mark Shriver has written a memoir about his father, ''A Good Man: Rediscovering My Father, Sargent Shriver''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/markk-shriver/good-man-sargent-shriver/ "A Good Man"], ''Kirkus Reviews'', March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shriver won a [[Christopher Award]] for the book. In 2016, he wrote a second book, ''Pilgrimage: My Search for the Real Pope Francis''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mark-k-shriver/pilgrimage-search/]&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, [[Maria Shriver]], is a former journalist and the former First Lady of [[California]] (she was married to former Governor of California [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] until mid-year 2011).

Shriver attended high school at the [[Georgetown Preparatory School]], [[North Bethesda, Maryland|North Bethesda]], [[Maryland]] and graduated in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gprep.org/about/alumni/notable-alumni |title=Notable Alumni |publisher=Georgetown Preparatory School |accessdate=October 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in 1986, and a [[master's degree]] in public administration from [[Harvard University]] in 1993.

Shriver's godfather is former professional tennis player [[Donald Dell]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2009-08-26-ted-kennedy_N.htm "Keeping Score" column by Christine Brennan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1989 to 1994, he was a member of the Maryland Juvenile Justice Advisory Council. Starting in 1991, he also served on the Board of Directors of the Public Justice Center. From 1991 to 1992, he served on the Maryland Governor's Task Force on Alternative Sanctions to Incarceration. From 1994 to 1995, he served on the Maryland Governor's Commission on Service.

In 1994, he was elected to the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], the lower house of the [[Maryland]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], representing [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], District 15, and was reelected in 1998. He did not seek reelection in 2002 and was succeeded in that post by [[Brian Feldman (politician)|Brian Feldman]].

In addition to serving as a delegate, he worked on the Task Force on the Maryland Prepaid-Tuition Savings Program in 1996, and on the Task Force to Study the Governance, Coordination, and Funding of the [[University System of Maryland]] from 1998 to 1999. He was a Founder and Executive Director of The Choice Program, an at-risk youth intervention project of the Shriver Center at [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] established in 1987. He then served on the Advisory Board on After-School Opportunity Programs from 1999 to 2003. From 2000 to 2001, he served on the Judith P. Hoyer Blue Ribbon Commission on Early Child Care and Education.

In 2002, he ran for [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the 8th [[Congressional District]] of Maryland, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by [[Chris Van Hollen]]. Van Hollen received 43.5% of the vote to Shriver's 40.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/41electp/html/2002p/2002usrepp.html#8th Maryland State Archives -- 2002 8th District Primary Election Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriver joined Save the Children in 2003, serving as Senior Vice President for U.S. Programs until 2013. In that capacity, he created and oversaw the agency’s early childhood education, literacy, health, and emergency preparedness and response programs in the United States.

As president of Save the Children Action Network, he is working to build bipartisan political will to increase access to early-childhood education in the United States and to end preventable deaths of mothers and children around the world. Shriver told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2016: "We’re actually engaged in elections, and we’re trying to support candidates who are good on [kids'] issues. And we’re going to try and defeat those who aren’t. So we want to be the NRA for kids. We want to be a movement, but we want to have political juice as well." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/why-cant-the-us-invest-in-its-children/2016/07/01/65633fd8-29a9-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Market access'''  for goods means the conditions, [[tariff]] and [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|Non-tariff measures (NTMs)]], set by countries for the entry of specific goods into their markets. In the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], tariff commitments for goods are agreed upon and set out in each member's [[schedules of concessions]] on goods. The schedules represent commitments not to apply tariffs above the listed rates — these rates are “bound”. Under WTO rules, bound rates may not be raised without compensating the affected members.

Non-tariff measures (NTMs) are non-tariff policy measures that affect international trade. NTMs cover a broad range of measures both directly and indirectly related to trade, and their use has risen as tariff rates have fallen under subsequent WTO negotiation rounds. In many cases, NTMs can be classified as [[non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs)]]. Some areas of NTMs are dealt with under specific WTO agreements, notably the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]], the [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]], the Anti-dumping agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the Agreement on Safeguards. WTO Members seek to continually improve market access through the regular WTO work programme and through negotiations such as those launched at the [[Doha Ministerial Conference]] in November 2001.

==Market access and import regulations==
Countries have various different systems controlling the import of products. Often authorization from certification bodies and/or international [[product certification]] is required. An overview of market access regulations can be given for example by http://fita.org/countries/ or http://www.macmap.org/.

==Pharmacoeconomics==
Market Access is also used in [[Pharmacoeconomics]] and refers to the process by which a company gets a drug to market so that it becomes available for patients.  Access is defined as a patient's ability to obtain medical care. Ease of access is determined by such factors as the availability of medical services and their acceptability to the patient, location of health care facilities, the transportation, the hours of operation and cost of care.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Evidence-Based Market Access (see [[Evidence-based medicine]]) refers to a process for producing Market Access reports based on scientific, preferably [[peer-reviewed]] and referenced material.

==Social and political activity==
Balakin has been a member of the Public Council of the Russian [[Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector]] since 2014.

===Politics===
In 2014, Balakin [[Moscow City Duma election, 2014|ran for the Moscow City Duma]] in 38th constituency. Initially, it was assumed that he would run as an independent candidate, but in the end he went to the polls from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Balakin was elected to the City Duma gaining 46% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/641211/stroitelnyj-element Строительный элемент]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ko.ru/news/2836 Строитель-депутат]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yabloko.ru/regnews/Moscow/2014/08/04_1 За кандидата от ЛДПР агитирует городская администрация и управляющая организация]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbcdaily.ru/politics/562949991850239 Владелец СУ-155 пойдет в Мосгордуму по списку Жириновского]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://top.rbc.ru/politics/07/07/2014/934970.shtml Владелец СУ-155 пойдет в Мосгордуму по списку Жириновского]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moscow_city.vybory.izbirkom.ru/region/region/moscow_city?action=show&amp;root=772003101&amp;tvd=27720001542919&amp;vrn=27720001539308&amp;region=77&amp;global=null&amp;sub_region=0&amp;prver=0&amp;pronetvd=null&amp;vibid=27720001542919&amp;type=424 Выборы депутатов Московской городской Думы шестого созыва.

In 2018, he [[Moscow mayoral election, 2018|ran for Mayor of Moscow]]. Balakin was nominated by the [[Union of Citizens]] party. To register, he had to pass the so-called "municipal filter", collect from 110 to 115 signatures of municipal deputies. Initially, he collected 112 signatures, this number was enough for registration, but then three deputies withdrew their signatures and the City Election Committee rejected the candidacy of Balakin citing a lack of signatures. On 23 July 2018, the [[Moscow City Court]] found the refusal of registration illegal and ordered to register Balakin as a mayoral candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3701266 Мосгоризбирком зарегистрирует Балакина кандидатом в мэры Москвы]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3694540 Мосгорсуд обязал избирком зарегистрировать Балакина кандидатом в мэры Москвы]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the mayoral election Balakin ranked last, scoring 42,192 votes (1.87%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moscow_city.vybory.izbirkom.ru/region/region/moscow_city?action=show&amp;root=1&amp;tvd=27720002197406&amp;vrn=27720002197402&amp;region=77&amp;global=&amp;sub_region=0&amp;prver=0&amp;pronetvd=null&amp;vibid=27720002197406&amp;type=234 Данные о предварительных итогах голосования.

==Philanthropy==
Balakin and the [[SU-155|SU-155 Group of companies]] that he heads are actively involved in the construction and [[Building restoration|restoration]] of churches.

Between 2002 and 2005, the SU-155 Group of companies restored the cathedral of St. Nicholas of Myra (the White St. Nicholas) in Serpukhov (Moscow region), founded in the sixteenth century; the cathedral was restored based on sketches and photographs.&lt;ref name="riarealty.ru.20130424"&gt;[http://riarealty.ru/analysis_trends/20130424/400280536.html Православный девелопмент: храм как элемент социального заказа] "[[RIA Novosti]]", 24.04.2013 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2009 and 2012, the [[Kronstadt Naval Cathedral|Naval cathedral of Saint Nicholas]] in [[Kronstadt]] was restored, having been closed in 1929 and used as a [[movie theater]], housing for officers in the [[Baltic Fleet]], a concert hall and a branch of the [[Central Naval Museum]] in Soviet times.

Construction of a new church in [[Shcherbinka]] ([[Moscow]]) proceeded in 2014 with the support of Mikhail Balakin and the SU-155 Group – the church containing the icon of Our Lady “Queen of All Creation”, which had been halted earlier after repair of the foundation and when funds collected for the construction ran out.

Restoration was begun in 2014 on the church of St. Nicholas in Butki in Serpukhov (Moscow region). The church was closed in Soviet times and gradually fell into ruin.

Along with the churches mentioned, the SU-155 Group has laid the foundation and built the church of the [[Intercession of the Theotokos|Protection of Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary]] in [[Yasenevo District|Yasenevo]] (Moscow) and the church of the Protection of Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary in [[Ivanovo]], as well as restoring the [[Sunday school]] for the church of Sts. [[Boris and Gleb]] in [[Zyuzino District|Zyuzino]] (Moscow) and the church of Holy Father [[Sergius of Radonezh]] in [[Verkhnyaya Vereya]] ([[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod region]]).&lt;ref name="riarealty.ru.20130424" /&gt;

==Awards and prizes==
Awards have been presented at various times by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]: the [[Order of Holy Prince Daniel of Moscow]] III class in 2005, the Order of Holy Father [[Serafim of Sarov]] III class in 2007, the Medal of Holy Prince [[Yuri II of Vladimir|George Vsevolodovich]] III class and the Order of Holy Father [[Serafim of Sarov]] II class in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.su155.com/company_group/press_center/news/balakin-was-awarded-the-order/ Patriarch Kirill Awards Order of St. Serafim of Sarov 2nd Class to Mikhail Balakin (en anglais)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and effects of municipally owned corporations are posited to be different from those of [[state-owned enterprises]]. [[Corporatization]] may be more utilised locally than nationally a way to allow hybrid or flexible forms of public service delivery such as [[public-private partnerships]] and [[inter-municipal cooperation]]. It also allows charging user fees.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt; Effects can be different because of lower regulator expertise, lower contracting capacity for municipalities,&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski /&gt; and the higher presence of scale economies. Current research shows that municipally owned corporations are frequently more efficient than [[bureaucracy]] but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; An additional problem is the fact that municipally owned corporations often have more than one municipal owner, and conflict between municipal owners can lead to reduced output for the municipally owned corporation due to various negative spillovers.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327833751_Background_Autonomy_Steering_and_Corporate_Governance_Determinants_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Governance_of_Municipal_Corporations|title= Background, Autonomy, Steering, and Corporate Governance: Determinants of the Effectiveness of (Governance of) Municipal Corporations|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke van Genugten, and Sandra van Thiel (2018)|publisher=Lausanne: EGPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Under [[New Public Management]], [[corporatization]] became prominent as a step towards (partial) [[privatization]].&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1527533|title=Debate: Corporatization as more than a recent crisis-driven development|last=Voorn, Bart, Sandra Van Thiel, and Marieke van Genugten (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became an end in itself, aiming to combine government control with efficient, businesslike service delivery that was considered lacking in bureaucratic service delivery. The [[state-owned enterprise]]s that resulted were to be organized akin to private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain state ownership are not traded on the [[stock market]].&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Marra2/publication/4732914_Internal_Regulation_by_Mixed_Enterprises_The_Case_of_the_Italian_Water_Sector/links/0deec529a2526c7663000000/Internal-Regulation-by-Mixed-Enterprises-The-Case-of-the-Italian-Water-Sector.pdf|title=Internal regulation by mixed enterprises: the case of the Italian water sector|last=Marra, Alessandro (2007)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 78(2): 245-275.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also became a trend at the local level. Municipal corporation followed a process of [[externalization]] that required new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and followed common changes in the institutional landscape of [[public services]].&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossi, Giuseppe, and Christoph Reichard (2008)|title=Municipal corporatization in Germany and Italy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030802264275|publisher=Public Management Review, 10(5): 597-617}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a substantial growth in the number of municipally owned corporations in the 1990s and 2000s throughout Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1486629|title=New development: Corporatization of local authorities in England in the wake of austerity 2010–2016|last=Ferry, Laurence, Rhys Andrews, Chris Skelcher, and Piotr Wegorowski (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorioFecher2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/blaannpce/v_3a82_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a361-373.htm|title=The future of public enterprises: Contributions to a new discourse|last=Florio, Massimo, and Fabienne Fecher (2011)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 82(4): 361-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons and effects ==
Municipal corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes) or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. Its reasons and effects are somewhat similar as those of [[corporatization]].&lt;ref name=Voornetal18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferryetal /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares&gt;{{cite web|last=António F. Tavares (2017)|title=Ten years after: revisiting the determinants of the adoption of municipal corporations for local service delivery|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1356723|publisher=Local Government Studies, 43(5): 697-706.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt; Such externalization gives the service delivery organization legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, because it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, it can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy also reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; At the local level there may also be higher transaction costs, because contracting capacity may be lower.&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownPotoski&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown, Trevor, and Matthew Potoski (2003)|title=Transaction Costs and Institutional Explanations for Government Service Production Decisions|url=http://spa.hust.edu.cn/2008/uploadfile/2009-9/20090910194210575.pdf|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Once a service has been corporatised, it is often relatively easy to (partially) privatise it by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Thus corporatisation can be a stop on the way towards (partial) privatization.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of [[hybrid organization|hybrid]] forms of organization, such as institutional private-partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations, which are especially relevant at the local level because of opportunities to capture scale economies.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;

=== Alleviating fiscal stress ===
Municipal corporations tend to be established by local governments experiencing some degree of fiscal stress.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavares /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citroni&gt;{{cite web|last=Citroni, Giulio, Andrea Lippi, and Stefania Profeti (2013)|title=Remapping the State: Inter-Municipal Cooperation through Corporatisation and Public-Private Governance Structures|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03003930.2012.707615|publisher=Local Government Studies, 39(2): 208-234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen, Rune J. (2007)|title=Does dispersed public ownership impair efficiency? The case of refuse collection in Norway|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.5414&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Public Administration,85(4): 1045-1058.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization was a way to allow local governments to "hide their liabilities by allocating them partly to their companies" or "corporatized their utilities (…) to raise new sources of income from their companies."&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;

== Problems with multiple ownership ==
The frequent ownership of municipally owned corporations by multiple municipalities can cause problems, the so-called 'multiple principal problem', that can lead these to be inefficient&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt; or have high failure rates.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt; There can be free-riding or duplication in steering and monitoring procedures, resulting in high costs. If there is heterogeneity in interests between the multiple municipalities, there may be directive ambiguity or lobbying of the corporations by individual municipalities, leading to high inefficiency. Delegating governance to one elected party may be a way to solve this problem.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;

== Usage ==
Municipal corporatization is more prominent for some services than for others. It is typically prominent in:&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b" /&gt;
*Water management
*Bus services
*Refuse collection

The '''Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville''', also known as '''MOCA Jacksonville''', is a [[contemporary art]] [[art museum|museum]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], funded and operated as a "cultural institute" of the [[University of North Florida]]. One of the largest contemporary art institutions in the Southeastern United States, it presents exhibitions by international, national and regional artists.
{{TOC limit|2}}
== History ==
MOCA Jacksonville was founded in 1924 as the Jacksonville Fine Arts Society,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridadesign.com/issues/14_2/pr2/jacksonville/1.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first organization in the Jacksonville community devoted to the visual arts. In 1948 the Museum was incorporated as the Jacksonville Art Museum, and in 1978 it became the first institution in Jacksonville to be accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]].

In late 1999 the Museum acquired its permanent home, the historic Western Union Telegraph Building on [[Hemming Plaza]], adjacent to the newly renovated City Hall, and became the Jacksonville Museum of Modern Art (JMOMA). In 2000, a series of preview exhibitions opened in a temporary exhibition space while the building facade was restored to its original Art Deco style. The interior was completely refurbished to house the Museum’s galleries, educational facilities, a theater/auditorium, Museum Shop and Café Nola. Total renovation of the {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, six-floor facility was completed in 2003, culminating in a grand re-opening in May of that year.

== Growth ==
After moving to its downtown location the Museum experienced rapid growth in both membership and the size of the permanent collection. The many substantial additions to the collection increased not only its quality, but also its size to almost 800 pieces. After completing a recent review of the current scope of the Museum’s collection and exhibitions, discussions were held regarding the distinctions between modern and contemporary art, as well as the Museum’s mission and vision for the future. It was decided that in order for the Museum to convey a strong sense of identity and purpose to both the community and other art institutions across the country, its name should change. Therefore, in November 2006, JMOMA became the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/110906/met_6104435.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116102054/http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/110906/met_6104435.shtml |archive-date=2007-11-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum continues to be a cornerstone of Jacksonville’s multibillion-dollar downtown revitalization plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flheritage.com/services/magazine/index.cfm?action=article&amp;season=04summer&amp;article=79 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024132258/http://www.flheritage.com/services/magazine/index.cfm?action=article&amp;season=04summer&amp;article=79 |archivedate=2007-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its exhibitions and programming bring new visitors to the civic core during the day, at night and on weekends. Educational programming includes children’s literacy initiatives and weekend art making classes as well as regular tours, lectures, films and publications for children and adults.

MOCA Jacksonville is an inviting environment in which to learn about the art of our time. Stroll through the permanent collection galleries and view the works of [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Ed Paschke]], and other contemporary masters. MOCA Jacksonville’s changing exhibitions feature the works of many contemporary artists working in a wide assortment of media from painting, sculpture, and video. The third floor hosts exhibitions, which rotate approximately every four months, designed to provide insightful, stimulating and educational experiences.

The [[University of North Florida]] acquired the museum in 2009 to act as a cultural resource of the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/28818/university-of-north-florida-to-acquire-jacksonville-moca/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Network of Bay Area Worker Cooperatives''' ('''NoBAWC''' ''- pronounced "No Boss"'') is a network of [[worker cooperative]]s dedicated to building [[workplace democracy]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Lydia. [http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2005-07-29/article/21968?headline=Be-Your-Own-Boss-Join-a-Collective-By-LYDIA-GANS-Special-to-the-Planet&amp;status=301 Be Your Own Boss, Join a Collective.] ''The Berkeley Daily Planet.'' 29 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

NoBAWC was founded in September 1994 when workers representing nine worker cooperatives met to address their isolation and to build a worker cooperative movement in the region. Twelve years later, NoBAWC comprises 30 dues-paying workplaces with a paid staff. NoBAWC is a member of the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]].

'''Paper chemicals''' designate a group of chemicals that are used for paper manufacturing, or modify the properties of [[paper]]. These chemicals can be used to alter the paper in many ways, including changing its color and brightness, or by increasing its strength and resistance to water.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Patt et al. "Paper and Pulp" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_545.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulping ==
Chemical pulping involves dissolving lignin in order to extract the cellulose from the wood fiber. The different processes of chemical pulping include the [[Kraft process]], which uses caustic soda and sodium sulfide and is the most common; alternatively, the use of sulfurous acid is known as the [[sulfite process]], the neutral sulfite semichemical is treated as a third process separate from sulfite, and [[soda pulping]] which is the least ecologically hazardous utilizing [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[anthraquinone]].&lt;ref name=ap42&gt;{{cite book|author1=Office of Air and Waste Management|author2=Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards|title=Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|date=August 1977|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|location=Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711|isbn=978-1-249-50100-8|edition=3rd|url=http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol2/hydropower/APA_DOC_no._1762.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015|format=PDF|chapter=10 Wood Processing|page=419|editor-last=Lahre|editor-first=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caustic soda]] is added to increase the pH in the [[Pulp (paper)|pulping]] process of fibers. The higher pH of the paper-fiber solution causes the fibers to smoothen and swell, which is important for the grinding process of the fibers.

== Bleaching ==
{{Main article|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

In the production of white paper, the wood pulp is bleached to remove any color from the trace amounts of lignin that was not extracted in the chemical pulping process. There are three predominant methods of bleaching:
# '''Elemental [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine_and_hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]]''' uses [[chlorine]] and [[hypochlorite]].
# '''Elemental chlorine-free bleaching''' is more environmentally friendly since it eliminates the use of hypochlorite and replaces chlorine with [[chlorine dioxide]] or [[sodium chlorate]].&lt;ref name=akzo&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.akzonobel.com/eka/system/images/AkzoNobel_Eka%20Chemicals_ProductLine_WebRes_tcm56-60891.pdf |title=Performance chemicals for the pulp and paper industry |date=2011 |page=2 |publisher=EKA Chemicals/Akzo Nobel |location=Gothenburg, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Totally chlorine-free bleaching''' utilizes [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]. This is the most environmentally friendly process since it eliminates all chlorinated pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1997 |chapter=7.3.9. Totally Chlorine-Free Bleaching of Papergrade Kraft Pulps | title=Supplemental Technical Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/pulp-paper-and-paperboard-effluent-guidelines |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=7–26 |id=EPA-821-R-97-011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sizing ==
{{Main article|Sizing}}
Most paper types must have some water-resistance to maintain a specific writing quality and printability. Until 1980, the typical manner of adding this resistance was by using a [[rosin]] in combination with [[alum]]. When the paper industry started using chalk instead of [[china clay]] as filler, the paper chemistry had to switch to a neutral process. Today, mainly AKD ([[Diketene|alkyl ketene dimer]]) and ASA ([[alkenyl succinic anhydride]]) are used.

== Strengthening ==

=== Wet-strength ===
{{Main article|Wet strength}}

Wet-strength additives ensure that paper retains its strength when it gets wet. This is especially important in [[tissue paper]]. Chemicals typically used for this purpose include [[epichlorohydrin]], [[melamine]], [[urea formaldehyde]] and [[polyimine]]s. These substances polymerize in the paper and result in the construction of a strengthening network.

[[File:Cationic starch.jpg|thumb|Cationic starch]]

To enhance the paper's strength, [[cation]]ic starch is added to wet pulp in the manufacturing process. Starch has a similar chemical structure as the cellulose fibre of the pulp, and the surface of both the starch and fibre are negatively charged. By adding cationic (positive charged) starch, the fibre can bind with the starch and thus also increase the interconnections between the fibres. The positively charged portion of the starch is usually formed by [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s. Quaternary salts that are used include 2.3-epoxy propyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (EPTAC, also known as or Glytac Quab, GMAC™) and (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC, also known as Quat 188, Quab 188, Reagens™).

=== Dry-strength ===

Dry-strength additives, or dry-strengthening agents, are chemicals that improve paper strength normal conditions. These improve the paper's [[compression strength]], [[bursting strength]], [[tensile breaking strength]], and [[delamination resistance]]. Typical chemicals used include cationic [[starch]] and [[polyacrylamide]] (PAM) derivatives. These substances work by binding fibers, often under the aid of [[aluminum]] ions in paper sheet.

== Binders ==
Binders promote the binding of pigment particles between themselves and the coating layer of the paper.&lt;ref name=Surface1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 1- Fiber Surface and Wet End Chemistry|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binders are spherical particles less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. Common binders are [[styrene maleic anhydride]] copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer.&lt;ref name=Surface2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 2- Coating and Printability|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the [[adsorption]] of [[acrylic acid]] or an anionic [[surfactant]], both of which are used for stabilization of the dispersion in water.&lt;ref name=Granier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granier|title=Adhesion of latex particles on inorganic surfaces|journal=Tappi J|year=1994|volume=77|issue=5|pages=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-binders, or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, [[sizing]], and gloss. Some common examples are [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] (CMC), cationic and anionic [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]] (EHEC), [[modified starch]], and [[dextrin]].
[[Styrene-butadiene|Styrene butadiene]] latex, Styrene acrylic, [[dextrin]], [[modified starch|oxidized starch]] are used in coatings to bind the filler to the paper. Co-binders are natural products such as starch and CMC ([[Carboxymethyl cellulose]]), that are used along with the synthetic binders, like styrene acrylic or styrene butadiene. Co-binders are used to reduce the cost of the synthetic binder and improve the [[Water retention curve|water retention]] and [[rheology]] of the coating.

[[File:Cationic starch.jpg|thumb|The molecular structure of cationic starch. The repeating unit of starch is derived from glucose interconnected with [[glycosidic bond]]s.]]

== Fillers ==
{{Main article|Filler (materials)}}

Mineral fillers are used to lower the consumption of more expensive binder material or to improve some properties of the paper.&lt;ref name=Ceresana&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Study: Fillers (3rd edition)|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/fillers/|publisher=Ceresana|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China clay]], calcium carbonate, [[titanium dioxide]], and [[talc]] are common mineral fillers used in paper production.

&lt;!-- move pigments under filler maybe?? as per mention in this ref.. future ref / content source -&gt; https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/24645/nelson_kimberly_l_200708_phd.pdf --&gt;

== Retention ==
{{Main article|Retention agent}}

A Retention agent is added to bind [[Filler (materials)|fillers]] to the paper. Fillers, such as [[calcium carbonate]], usually have a weak surface charge. The retention agent is a polymer with high cationic, positively charged groups. An additional feature of a retention agent is to accelerate the dewatering in the wire section of the [[paper machine]]. [[Polyethyleneimine]] and polyacrylamide are examples of chemicals used in this process.

== Coating ==
{{Main article|Coated paper}}

=== Pigments ===
[[File:Paper Coating.png|thumb|Paper Coating]]

[[Pigment]]s that absorb in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum can be added. As the [[dye]] absorbs light, the brightness of the paper will decrease, unlike the effect of an optical-brightening agent. To increase whiteness, a combination of pigments and an optical-brightening agent are often used. The most commonly used pigments are blue and violet dyes.

=== Optical-brightening agent ===

[[Optical brightener]] is used to make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use [[fluorescence]] to absorb invisible radiation from the [[ultraviolet]] part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that is added to the reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=He Shi, Hongbin Liu, Yonghao Ni, Zhirun Yuan, Xuejun Zou, Yajun Zhou |date=2012 |title=Review: Use of Optical Brightening Agents (OBAs) in the Production of Paper Containing High-Yield Pulps |url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/download/BioRes_07_2_2582_Shi_LNYZZ_Review_OBAs_High_Yield_Pulp/1529 |journal=BioResources |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=2582–2591 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paper machine''' (or '''paper-making machine''') is an industrial machine used in the [[pulp and paper industry]]
to create [[paper]] in large quantities at high speed. Modern paper-making machines are based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a moving woven [[mesh]] to create a continuous paper web by filtering out the fibres held in a paper stock and producing a continuously moving wet mat of fibre. This is dried in the machine to produce a strong paper web. 

The basic process is an industrialised version of the historical process of hand paper-making, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of a printing and writing substrate. The first modern paper machine was invented in Britain by [[Henry Fourdrinier|Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier]], and patented in 1806.

The same process is used to produce [[paperboard]] on a paperboard machine.

==The process sections==

Paper machines usually have at least five distinct operational sections:

* [[#Forming section or wet end|Forming section]], commonly called the wet end, is a continuous rotating wire mesh which removes water from the paper by sucking it out of suspension.
* [[#Press section|Press section]] where the wet fibre web passes between large rolls loaded under high pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible.
* [[#Drying section|Drying section]], where the pressed sheet passes partly around, in a serpentine manner, a series of steam heated drying cylinders.  Drying removes the water content down to a level of about 6%, where it will remain at typical indoor atmospheric conditions. Infra-red driers are also used to supplement cylinder drying where required.
* [[#Calender section|Calender section]] where the dried paper is smoothened under high loading and pressure.  Only one ''nip'' (where the sheet is pressed between two rolls) is necessary in order to hold the sheet, which shrinks through the drying section and is held in tension between the press section (or breaker stack if used) and the calender.  Extra nips give more smoothing but at some expense to paper strength.
* [[#Reel section|Reel section]] where paper coming out of the machine is wound onto individual spools for further processing. 
There can also be a coating section to modify the surface characteristics with coatings such as china clay.

== History ==
Before the invention of [[continuous production|continuous]] paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry.

=== Fourdrinier machine ===
In 1799, [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], France, was granted a [[patent]] for a continuous paper making machine.&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt; At the time Robert was working for [[Didot family#Saint-Léger Didot|Saint-Léger Didot]], with whom he quarreled over the ownership of the invention. Didot thought that England was a better place to develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the [[French Revolution]], he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers [[Sealy Fourdrinier|Sealy]] and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], [[stationers]] of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. The Fourdrinier machine used a specially woven fabric [[mesh]] [[conveyor belt]] (known as a ''wire,'' as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. The original Fourdrinier forming section used a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the ''drainage table''.

With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

Thomas Gilpin is most often credited for creating the first U.S cylinder type [[papermaking]] machine at [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], [[Delaware]] in 1817. This machine was also developed in England, but it was a cylinder mould machine. The Fourdrinier machine wasn't introduced into the USA until 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Richard, "Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988", Athlone Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar designs ===
Records show Charles Kinsey of [[Paterson, NJ]] had already patented a continuous process papermaking machine in 1807.  Kinsey’s machine was built locally by Daniel Sawn and by 1809 the Kinsey machine was successfully making paper at the Essex Mill in Paterson.  Financial stress and potential opportunities created by the [[Embargo of 1807]] eventually persuaded Kinsey and his backers to change the mill’s focus from paper to cotton and Kinsey's early papermaking successes were soon overlooked and forgotten.&lt;ref name="Bidwell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bidwell|first1=John|title=American Paper Mills, 1690–1832: A Directory of the Paper Trade with Notes...|date=2013|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-58465-964-8|pages=154–155|url=http://www.upne.com/1584659648.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAER NJ-6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historic American Engineering Record Essex Mill NJ-6|journal=National American Engineering Record|page=3|url=http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/nj/nj0100/nj0180/data/nj0180data.pdf|publisher=National Park Service Department of the Interior Washington D.C. 20240|quote=The Essex Mill is historic as the first new mill site leased by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufacturers, and as the scene of some of the earliest experiments with continuous paper manufacture in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilpin's 1817 patent was similar to Kinsey's, as was the John Ames patent of 1822.  The Ames patent was challenged by his competitors, asserting that Kinsey was the original inventor and Ames had been pilfering other peoples' ideas, their evidence being the employment of Daniel Sawn to work on his machine.&lt;ref name=Bidwell /&gt;

== Pulp types and their preparations ==
{{Main|Pulp (paper)}}
The plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water.  After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded.  It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.

Rags of [[cotton]] and [[linen]] were the major source of pulp for paper before wood pulp.  Today almost all pulp is of wood fibre.  Cotton fibre is used in speciality grades, usually in printing paper for such things as resumes and currency.

Sources of rags often appear as waste from other manufacturing such as denim fragments or glove cuts.  Fibres from clothing come from the cotton boll.  The fibres can range from 3 to 7&amp;nbsp;cm in length as they exist in the cotton field.  Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric in a process of cooking, usually with steam.  The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process.  Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop.  A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a knife bed is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly.  As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length.  The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the knives and bed.

Another source of cotton fibre comes from the [[cotton ginning]] process.  The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as [[linter]]s for their short length and resemblance to lint.  Linters are too short for successful use in fabric.  Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts.  The first cuts are longer.

The two major classifications of pulp are [[chemical pulp|chemical]] and [[mechanical pulp|mechanical]].  Chemical pulps formerly used a [[sulfite process|sulphite process]], but the [[kraft process]] is now predominant.  Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical pulps and kraft process spent pulping chemicals are easier to recover and regenerate. Both chemical pulps and mechanical pulps may be bleached to a high brightness.

Chemical pulping dissolves the [[lignin]] that bonds fibres to one another, and binds the outer [[fibril]]s that compose individual fibres to the fibre core.  Lignin, like most other substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength.  Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains.  The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline [[hemicellulose]], which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.

Kraft pulp makes superior [[linerboard]] and excellent printing and writing papers.

Groundwood, the main ingredient used in [[newsprint]] and a principal component of magazine papers (coated publications), is literally ground wood produced by a grinder.  Therefore, it contains a lot of lignin, which lowers its strength.  The grinding produces very short fibres that drain slowly.

Thermomechanical pulp (TMP) is a variation of groundwood where fibres are separated mechanically while at high enough temperatures to soften the lignin.

Between chemical and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining.  Semi-chemical pulp is often used for corrugating medium.

Bales of [[recycled paper]] (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned.  Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. [[Deinked pulp]] is used in printing and writing papers and in [[tissue paper|tissue]], napkins and [[paper towel]]s. It is often blended with virgin pulp.

At integrated pulp and paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation.  Non integrated mills use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales.  The pulp bales are slushed in a [re]pulper.

== Stock (pulp) preparation ==

Stock preparation is the area where pulp is usually refined, blended to the appropriate proportion of [[hardwood]], [[softwood]] or recycled fibre, and diluted to as uniform and constant as possible consistency. The [[pH]] is controlled and various fillers, such as whitening agents, [[sizing|size]] and [[wet strength]] or dry strength are added if necessary.  Additional [[filler (materials)|fillers]] such as [[clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] and [[titanium dioxide]] increase [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] so printing on reverse side of a sheet will not distract from content on the obverse side of the sheet.  Fillers also improve printing quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called ''chests'', which may be either round or more commonly rectangular.  Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used.  Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.

In the following process, different types of pulp, if used, are normally treated in separate but similar process lines until combined at a blend chest:

From high density storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped to a low density storage chest (tank).  From there it is typically diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest.  From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner.  Refining is an operation whereby the pulp [[slurry]] passes between a pair of discs, one of which is stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, respectively.  The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance.  This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the [[fibril]]s of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength.  For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.

Hardwood fibres are typically 1&amp;nbsp;mm long and smaller in diameter than the 4&amp;nbsp;mm length typical of softwood fibres. Refining can cause the softwood fibre tube to collapse resulting in undesirable properties in the sheet.

From the refined stock, or blend chest, stock is again consistency controlled as it is being pumped to a machine chest. It may be refined or additives may be added en route to the machine chest.

The machine chest is basically a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest to be levelled out by the action of the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.)&lt;ref&gt;Results from dynamic material balance sensitivity analysis: The timing for the basis weight control loop is much slower than that of a consistency loop.  Also, varying pressure of the consistency control dilution water will introduce swings in consistency.  This can be and should be verified for any particular system using dynamic material balance software such as CADSIM Plus. Run model by creating a sharp consistency change ~ 1/2% and observe system stability. [http://www.aurelsystems.com/csplus.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
There are four main sections on this paper machine. The forming section makes the pulp into the basis of for sheets along the wire. The press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. In practice calender rolls are normally placed vertically in a ''stack''.

=== Forming section or wet end ===
[[File:Florida Pulp and Paper Company mill, Cantonment, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|300px| A worker inspecting wet, bleached wood pulp on an old-fashioned Hollander pulper or "beater".]]

From the machine chest stock is pumped to a head tank, commonly called a "head tank" or ''stuff box'', whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the fiber slurry or ''stock'' as it feeds the basis weight valve.  The stuff box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The consistency of the pulp slurry at the stuff box is in the 3% range.  Flow from the stuff box is by gravity and is controlled by the basis weight valve on its way to the fan pump suction where it injected into main flow of water to the fan pump.  The main flow of water pumped by the fan pump is from a whitewater chest or tank that collects all the water drained from the forming section of the paper machine. Before the fiber stream from the stuff box is introduced, the whitewater is very low in fiber content.  The whitewater is constantly recirculated by the fan pump through the headbox and recollected from the wire pit and various other tanks and chests that receive drainage from the forming wire and vacuum assisted drainage from suction boxes and wet fiber web handling rolls.  On the way to the head box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris. The fan pump ultimately feeds the headbox, whether or not any centrifugal cleaners or screens are present.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Machine_ops"&gt;{{cite book

The purpose of the headbox is create turbulence to keep the fibers from clumping together and to uniformly distribute the slurry across the width of the wire. Wood fibers have a tendency to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called flocculation.  Flocculation is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency.  Minimizing the degree of flocculation when forming is important to physical [[properties of paper]].&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

The consistency in the headbox is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres.  Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the '''z''' direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the '''x-y''' direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity).&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum because they have been sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).

The stock slurry, often called ''white water'' at this point, exits the head box through a rectangular opening of adjustable height called the ''slice'', the white water stream being called the ''jet'' and it is pressurized on high speed machines so as to land gently on the moving fabric loop or ''wire'' at a speed typically between plus or minus 3% of the wire speed, called ''rush'' and ''drag'' respectively.  Excessive ''rush'' or ''drag'' causes more orientation of fibres in the machine direction and gives differing physical properties in machine and cross directions; however, this phenomenon is not completely avoidable on Fourdrinier machines.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

On lower speed machines at 700 feet per minute, gravity and the height of the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice.  The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name.  The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the ''jet-to-wire ratio''.  When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction.  On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as ''shake''.  This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions.  On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine.  When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.

Two large rolls typically form the ends of the drainage section, which is called the ''drainage table''.  The ''breast roll'' is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre.  At the other end of the drainage table is the suction (''couch'') roll.  The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.  The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine.  Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box.  From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Down machine from the suction roll, and at  a lower elevation, is the ''wire turning roll''. This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a considerable angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;

Supporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements.  In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet.  On low speed machines these table elements are primarily ''table rolls''.  As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation.  To prevent this drainage foils are used.  The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action.  Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Approaching the dry line on the table are located low vacuum boxes that are drained by a barometric leg under gravity pressure. After the dry line are the suction boxes with applied vacuum.  Suction boxes extend up to the couch roll.  At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

=== Variations of the Fourdrinier forming section ===
The forming section type is usually based on the grade of paper or paperboard being produced; however, many older machines use a less than optimum design.  Older machines can be upgraded to include more appropriate forming sections.

A '''second headbox''' may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer.  A ''secondary headbox'' is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained.  This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer.  Secondary headboxes are common on [[linerboard]].

A modification to the basic fourdrinier table by adding a second wire on top of the drainage table is known as a '''top wire former'''.  The bottom and top wires converge and some drainage is up through the top wire.  A top wire improves formation and also gives more drainage, which is useful for machines that have been sped up.

The '''Twin Wire Machine''' or '''Gap former''' uses two vertical wires in the forming section, thereby increasing the de-watering rate of the fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.&lt;ref&gt;Technology choice in a global industry : the case of the twin-wire in Canada, Ofori-Amoah, Benjamin, 1989
Thesis (Ph.D.) – Simon Fraser University, 1990, http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/handle/1892/6373&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also machines with entire Fourdrinier sections mounted above a traditional Fourdrinier. This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics.  These are called '''top Fourdriniers''' and they make multi-ply paper or [[paperboard]]. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.

Another type forming section is the '''cylinder mould machine'''&lt;ref&gt;''Paper Machine Clothing: Key to the Paper Making Process'' Sabit Adanur, Asten, CRC Press, 1997, p. 120–136, {{ISBN|978-1-56676-544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially immersed  in a tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the [[cellulose]] fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD).  High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.

'''Tissue machines''' typically form the paper web between a wire and a special fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll.  The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a ''yankee''.  The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a ''doctor''.  [[Tissue paper|Tissue]] machines operate at speeds of up to 2000&amp;nbsp;m/min.

=== Press section ===
[[File:Paper machine.ogv|thumb|Paper machine]]
[[File:Granite Press Roll.JPG|thumb|Granite press roll at a granite quarry site]]

The second section of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.  The paper web consistency leaving the press section can be above 40%.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry"&gt;{{cite book

Pressing is the most efficient method of de-watering the sheet as only mechanical action is required. Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They are made up of a [[polyamide]] woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.

Presses can be single or double felted. A single felted press has a felt on one side and a smooth roll on the other. A double felted press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press felt. Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear smoother than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet.  Double felted presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.

Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or [[Blind hole|blind drilled]] surface. More advanced press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated shell and cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel is covered with rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted in the core of the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. [[End face mechanical seal]]s are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Papermaking: Papermachine – Pressing|pages=2, 3, 12, 13|url=http://www.fibrelab.ubc.ca/files/2013/01/Topic-14-Papermaking-Pressing-text.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=UBC Fibre Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granite rolls can be up to {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} long and {{Convert|6|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richter|first1=Dorothy A.|title=Barre granite quarries, Barre, Vermont|journal=Geological Society of America Centennial Field Guide—Northeastern Section|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional roll presses are configured with one of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.

Some grades of paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to transfer the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections.  Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have a large number of drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed [[centrifugal force]] flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.

Crown Controlled Rolls (also known as CC Rolls) are usually the mating roll in a press arrangement. They have [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the crown on the roll flat, to counteract the natural "bend" in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.

Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a relatively modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll is usually a standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved to the shape of the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to  a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases.  ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.

=== Dryer section ===

[[File:Papermaking machine at a paper mill near Pensacola.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Dryer section of an older Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. These narrow, small diameter dryers are not enclosed by a hood, dating the photo to before the 1970s.]]
The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe.  From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head.  Wide machines require multiple siphons.  In faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry" /&gt;

The sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer section.  The felts greatly improve heat transfer.  Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a very open weave that is almost see through,  It is common to have the first bottom dryer section unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.

Paper dryers are typically arranged in groups called ''sections''  so that they can be run at a progressively slightly slower speed to compensate for sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. Some grades of paper may also stretch as they run through the machine, requiring increasing speed between sections.  The gaps between sections are called ''draws''.

The drying sections are usually enclosed to conserve heat.  Heated air is usually supplied to the pockets where the sheet breaks contact with the driers.  This increases the rate of drying. The pocket ventilating tubes have slots along their entire length that face into the pocket.  The dryer hoods are usually exhausted with a series of roof mounted hood exhausts fans down the dryer section.

=== Sizer ===
Additional [[sizing]] agents, including [[resin]]s, [[glue]], or [[starch]], can be added to the web to alter its characteristics. [[Sizing]] improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength.  These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a ''size press''. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator .   It is usually placed before the last dryer section.  Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a [[coated paper|coating]] of [[fillers]] such as [[calcium carbonate]] or [[china clay]] usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and [[styrene-butadiene]] latex.  Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W1015-015, Technitz, Schreibpapier AROS aus Altrohstoffen.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Paper leaving the machine is rolled onto a ''reel'' for further processing.]]

=== Calender section ===
{{Main|Calender}}
&lt;!-- Note: This is the correct spelling of 'calender' as used in this sense. --&gt;
A [[calender]] consists of two or more rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. It also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper.

=== Reel section ===

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). The paper is wound onto metal spools using a large cylinder called a ''reel drum''. Constant nip pressure is maintained between the reel drum and the spool, allowing the resulting friction to spin the spool. Paper runs over the top of the reel drum and is wound onto the spool to create a ''master roll''.

To be able to keep the paper machine running continuously, the reel must be able to quickly switch from winding a finished roll to an empty spool without stopping the flow of paper. To accomplish this, each reel section will have two or more spools rotating through the process. Using an overhead crane, empty spools will be loaded onto two ''primary arms'' above the reel drum. When the master roll reaches its maximum diameter, the arms will lower the new spool into contact with the reel drum and a machine behind the drum will run a tape along the moving sheet of paper, swiftly tearing it and attaching incoming paper onto the new spool. The spool is then lowered onto the ''secondary arms'', which steadily guide the spool away from the reel drum as the diameter of paper on the spool increases.
 
The [[Roll hardness tester|roll hardness]] should be checked, obtained and adjusted accordingly to insure that the roll hardness is within the acceptable range for the product.


===Winder section===
Reels of paper wound up at the end of the drying process are the full trimmed width, minus shrinkage from drying, of the web leaving the wire.  In the winder section reels of paper are slit into smaller rolls of a width and roll diameter range specified by a customer order. To accomplish this the reel is placed on an unwind stand and the distances between the slitters (sharp cutting wheels), are adjusted to the specified widths for the orders.  The wider is run until the desired roll diameter is reached and the rolls are labeled according to size and order before being sent to shipping or the warehouse.  A reel usually has sufficient diameter to make two or more sets of rolls.

== Glossary ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

'''broke''': waste paper, either made during a sheet break or trimmings.  It is gathered up and put in a repulper for recycling back into the process.

'''consistency''': the percent dry fibre in a pulp slurry.

'''couch''': French meaning ''to lie down''.  Following the couch roll the sheet is lifted off the wire and transferred into the press section.

'''dandy roll''': a mesh covered hollow roll that rides on top of the Fourdrinier. It breaks up fibre clumps to improve the sheet formation and can also be used to make an imprint, as with [[laid paper]]. See also [[watermark]].

'''fan pump''': the large pump that circulates white water from the white water chest to the headbox.  The pump is a special low pulse design that minimizes the effect of vane pulses which would cause uneven basis weight of paper in the machine direction known as ''barring''. The flow from the fan pump may go through screens and cleaners, if used.  On large paper machines fan pumps may be rated in tens of thousands of gallons per minute.

'''felt''': a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water.  Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.

'''[[filler (materials)|filler]]''': a finely divided substance added to paper in the forming process.  Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity.  The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity.  Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called ''alkaline sizing'' and uses different chemistry than acid sizing.  Alkaline sized paper has superior ageing properties.

'''formation''': the degree of uniformity of fiber distribution in finished paper, which is easily seen by holding paper up to the light.

'''[[headbox]]''': the pressure chamber where turbulence is applied to break up fibre clumps in the slurry.  The main job of the headbox is to distribute the fiber slurry uniformly across the wire.

'''nip''': the contact area where two opposing rolls meet, such as in a press or calender.

'''[[pH]]''': the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Alkaline paper has a very long life.  Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.

'''[[sizing|size]]''': a chemical (formerly rosin derived but now a different chemical) or starch, applied to paper to retard the rate of water penetration.  Sizing prevents ''bleeding'' of ink during printing, improving the sharpness of printing.

'''slice''': the adjustable rectangular orifice, usually at the bottom of the headbox, through which the whitewater jet discharges onto the wire.  The slice opening and water pressure together determine the amount and velocity of whitewater flow through the slice.  The slice usually has some form of adjustment mechanism to even out the paper weight profile across the machine (CD profile), although a newer methods is to inject water into the whitewater across the headbox slice area, thereby using localized consistency to control CD weight profile.

'''stock''': a pulp slurry that has been processed in the stock preparation area with necessary additives, refining and pH adjustment and ready for making paper

'''web''': the continuous flow of un-dried fibre from the couch roll down the paper machine

'''white water''': filtrate from the drainage table.  The white water from the table is usually stored in a white water chest from which it is pumped by the fan pump to the headbox.

'''wire''': the woven mesh fabric loop that is used for draining the pulp slurry from the headbox. Until the 1970s bronze wires were used but now they are woven from coarse mono-filament synthetics similar to fishing line but very stiff.

==Materials ==

Stainless steels are used extensively in the [[Pulp and paper industry|Pulp and Paper]] industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/TechnicalLibrary/Reference%20Book%20Series/11025_StainlessSteelsandSpecialtyAlloysforModernPulpandPaperMills.aspx|title=Stainless Steels and Specialty Alloys for Modern Pulp and Paper Mills|last=A. H. Tuthill|first=|date=2002|website=Nickel Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two primary reasons, to avoid iron contamination of the product and their corrosion resistance to the various chemicals used in the paper making process. Type 316 stainless steel is a common material used in paper machines.

The '''Portlands Energy Centre''' is a  550-[[megawatt]] [[natural gas]] [[power station|electrical generating station]] on the [[Toronto waterfront]] at 470 Unwin Avenue, next to the site of the decommissioned [[Hearn Generating Station]].

==Corporate support==
The Portlands Energy Centre is owned and operated as a 50/50 joint partnership between [[Ontario Power Generation]] and [[TransCanada Corp.|TransCanada Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.powermag.com/issues/cover_stories/Top-Plants-Portlands-Energy-Centre-Ontario-Canada_2123.html |title=Top Plants: Portlands Energy Centre, Ontario, Canada |author=Dr. Robert Peltier, PE |date=September 1, 2009|publisher=Tradefair Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical specifications of the proposed plant==
The technical specifications of the plant in the original submission of the environmental review report (a less rigorous form of a full environmental assessment) to the [[Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change|Ministry of the Environment]] in November 2003 have been significantly altered. This was due to the government instructing Ontario Power Generation to stop participating in projects which use more environmentally acceptable generations systems, such as co-generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opg.com/pdf/memorandum.pdf Memorandum of Agreement between the Crown and Ontario Power Generation, August 17, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the plant was described as two identical 275 MW power train systems, each comprising a 175 MW GE 7FA [[gas turbine]] generator, and other equipment. This proposed configuration was capable of producing over 272,000 kilograms per hour of steam for district heating. This design would, according to a PEC newsletter, allow for the efficiency of the plant to be “about 55% compared to 35% for a typical fossil power plant” There were also plans to include “Canada’s largest [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]]” capable of producing “hundreds of kilowatts” though no actual specification seems to have ever been given.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Local opposition==

===Environmental issues===
The original design met with some community resistance and many local residents, all local politicians and a number of significant City of Toronto departments including the Works Department and the Board of Health. These groups called for a full Environmental Assessment (EA) as a way to resolve some of the technical and health related issues with the plant. The [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberal]] Government denied a full EA. Over time, the plan was altered significantly in a way that reduced the efficiency and aesthetic virtues of the plant. In November 2004, the proponents hosted a meeting to tell the community that the generation of steam for district heating was no longer going to happen and that the solar panels were no longer going to be included.  It was also noted that the attempts to make the exterior of the plant aesthetically pleasing had been dropped in favour of a [[shed]] type design.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Location issues===
The plant was met with considerable local opposition, since it was to be sited on the Waterfront, which is currently undergoing a revitalization process, and has been striving to be a “world leader in sustainable design” (according to the Corporation Chair, Robert Fung). The Ontario Liberal Government decided that, despite significant opposition, the project would be allowed to move forward without a full Environmental Assessment. The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation played a more neutral role, offering criticism of the plant but falling short of calling for a change of plans.

==Power purchase agreement, timing and capital costs==
On September 18, 2006, TransCanada issued a press release&lt;ref&gt;[[TransCanada Corp.]], Press Release dated September 18, 2007: [http://www.transcanada.com/news/2006_news/2006_09_18.html Portlands Energy Centre Signs Accelerated Clean Energy Supply Contract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513180032/http://www.transcanada.com/news/2006_news/2006_09_18.html |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing that Portlands Energy Centre L.P. had signed a 20-year Accelerated Clean Energy Supply (ACES) contract with the Ontario Power Authority for the power output of the PEC.

The plant started delivering 340 MW of power to the City of Toronto in June 2008 in single-cycle operation and was fully operational with an output of 550 MW by the second-quarter 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[TransCanada Corp.]] [http://www.transcanada.com/investor/annual_reports/2007/index.html 2007 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403072814/http://www.transcanada.com/investor/annual_reports/2007/index.html |date=2008-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total capital costs are expected to reach $730MM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7345">In [[English law]], '''poundage''' was an ''ad valorem (in proportion to [[Value (economics)|value]])'' [[customs duty]] imposed on imports and exports at the rate of 1 [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] for every [[Pound (Weight)|pound]] of goods imported or exported.&lt;ref name="palgrave"&gt;Higgs, Henry. ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy'', Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd., London, 1926, p.548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poundage was implemented in order to keep a strong naval force that would protect the [[Kingdom of England]]. The [[Tariff|custom duty]] would allow the Monarch of the Kingdom to collect money that would then be spent to develop and maintain the naval force that protects the Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/icp/ID/25522|title=HumanitiesWeb.org - The History of England Vol V Charles I (Tonnage and poundage) by David Hume|website=www.humanitiesweb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poundage was closely associated with ''[[tonnage]]'', or ''tunnage'', which was a duty on every tun of wine imported.&lt;ref name=palgrave/&gt;

== Poundage in English History ==
The levy was introduced in 1347 under [[Edward II of England]] and was then granted by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1373. It  continued for many years at the same rate until after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] ((in 1660, when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under King Charles II) from when the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] set the rates according to current needs.&lt;ref name="palgrave" /&gt;

Moreover, the Parliament voted in 1414, under [[Henry V of England|Henri V of England]], the right for life for every successive monarch to benefit of a royal collection on the ton and pound on imports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-24.htm|title=1625-29: Charles I - the first crisis|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|316x316px|'''King Charles I (reign 1625-1649),  portrayed from the studio of [[Anthony van Dyck]], 1636''']]

=== Poundage under Charles I of England ===
Under the reign of [[Charles I of England]] (1600-1649), the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted a limitation of the royal collection to a period of one year (while the period was for life for the previous monarchs). Charles continued to collect the customs duties, even if no Parliament act was established. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-30|title=Charles I of England|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_I_of_England&amp;oldid=838940058|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been [[Legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of [[John Rolle (Parliamentarian)|John Rolle]], a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On March 2, 1629, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ordered a parliamentary adjournment, but when the parliament’s speaker, [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch|Sir John Finch]], was held by members of the Parliament in his chair in order to delay the end of the session, Charles decided to dissolve the Parliament. [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch|Sir John Finch]] as well as nine members of the Parliament were imprisoned. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== The Tonnage and Poundage Act (1641) ====
In September 1640, following the [[Bishops' Wars]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] issued writs summoning the Parliament to convene on 3 November 1640. It was the creation of the [[Long Parliament]], that lasted until it voted its own dissolution on the 16 March 1660. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1641, the Tonnage and Poundage Act was voted by the [[Long Parliament]], that would regulate all the taxes in force within the kingdom, concerning consequently the current poundage imposed on imports and exports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/1641-the-tonnage-and-poundage-act|title=1641: The Tonnage and Poundage Act
 - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:King Charles II by John Michael Wright or studio.jpg|thumb|235x235px|'''King Charles II (reign 1660–1665) in [[Order of the Garter#Habit and insignia|Garter robes]] by [[John Michael Wright]]''' ]]

=== Poundage under Charles II of England ===
Under the reign of Charles II of England (1660-1685), the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] (25 April 1660 – 29 December 1660) was founded and followed the [[Long Parliament]] that was dissolved on 16 March 1660.

The [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], that only has been existing for eight months, established back the right for life to collect the poundage to the monarch of England. 

From 1660, the successive monarchs of the Kingdom of England are able to collect once again the poundage. 

=== Abolition of poundage ===
The Customs Consolidation Act of 1787 replaced all the [[Tariff|customs duties]], which was including poundage, by a system where individual [[Tariff|tariffs]] would be applied to importations.  

The act is divided in two mains parts. A first part that includes a statement related to the regulation of all the customs duties. A second part that is listing tables of duty and drawback amounts for all types of products. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quaritch.com/books/great-britain-parliament/drop-head-title-an-act-for-repealing-the-several/H2724/|title=Homepage - Bernard Quaritch Ltd - Rare books, manuscripts &amp; photographs|website=www.quaritch.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list comprising all importations and [[Tariff|tariffs]] related to each import was consequently put in place. 

== Poundage on postal orders ==
[[File:1943 Australia Defence Canteen order.jpg|thumb|One penny poundage on a canteen order, a form of postal order|248x248px]]
In Britain, and elsewhere, the term ''poundage'' is used for the charge imposed on the sale of a [[postal order]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Register 1914, p.262.&lt;/ref&gt;

A postal order is a financial instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail. It is purchased at a [[post office]] and is payable at another post office to the named recipient.

The poundage represents the small fee for the service that is paid by the purchaser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8718">The '''Retail Banking Academy''' (RBA) is a UK-based educational body, founded with the objective of playing a leading role in the development and professionalisation of consumer-oriented [[retail banking]] around the world. It is the only educational and professional academy exclusively dedicated to retail banking anywhere in the world.
The RBA is the only international, educational and professional body that's exclusively dedicated to retail banking. 

The Certified Retail Banker ('''CRB''') programme makes it possible for retail bankers to embark on a structured certification programme that covers every aspect of the industry end to end. 
. The Retail Banking Academy has its headquarters in London, UK.

== History ==

The organisation was founded in London, UK in 2011 as the ''International Academy of Retail Banking'' with the objective of educating retail bankers worldwide to a high professional standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarb.org |title=International Academy of Retail Banking |publisher=iarb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It believes that a separated, independent retail banking sector should be led by professionally qualified retail bankers, bound by an ethical code &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d83d321e-94de-11e3-af71-00144feab7de.html |title=We believe retail banking should be ethics-based |publisher=FT.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to those already in place for accountants and lawyers. This ethical code &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/teaching-banks-to-value-trust-and-honesty-1.1673998?page=1 |title=Teaching banks to value trust and honesty - Financial Services News &amp;#124; Business News &amp;#124; The Irish Times - Fri, Jan 31, 2014 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended to oblige retail bankers to act in the customer’s best interests. Bankers who persistently fail to comply would be barred from membership of the profession. To that end, the RBA believes that the foundation stone for a retail banking profession must be the complete separation of retail banking from both investment banking and large-scale corporate banking.

In 2012 the UK [http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/professional-standards-in-the-banking-industry/ Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards] accepted evidence from a number of participants operating in the banking sector.  The Retail Banking Academy was one of the participants, and its submission was included in selected submissions in its final published report, Changing Banking for Good,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/professional-standards-in-the-banking-industry/news/changing-banking-for-good-report/ |title=Banking Commission publishes report on changing banking for good - News from Parliament - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines the radical reform required to improve standards across the banking industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/27v_we85.htm |title=House of Commons - Banking Standards: Written evidence from the International Academy of Retail Banking |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the organisation changed its name from the International Academy of Retail Banking to the Retail Banking Academy.

== Certifications ==

The RBA offers a large variety of programmes such as:

=== Certified Retail Banker (CRB) ===


The ''Certified Retail Banker programme'' was designed by senior retail bankers and academics from around the world.  Since 2011 the qualification strategy has evolved to grow with sector demands, for example, it was made available in the French language in 2012.
To become a Certified Retail Banker, and to be able to use the designation CRB, you need to join RBA Membership and successfully pass examinations at three separate levels.

*Retail Banking I (RB I)

Retail Banking I was designed to introduce candidates to the theoretical and practical core competencies that are required for success within a retail banking organisation. It is ideal for retail bankers looking to broaden their scope and banking knowledge. 

*Banking II (RB II)

Retail Banking II focuses on the issues that are encountered when leading people and retail banking departments. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to fast track their career and understand the key divisions/functions of a retail bank.

*Retail Banking III (RB III)

Retail Banking III focuses on developing and enhancing the capabilities required to run retail banking strategic business units. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to understand how different functions are brought together in one retail bank, and challenges associated to leadership.

=== Accelerated Programmes ===


The ''Accelerated Programmes'' have been created for experienced retail bankers with over 10 or 15 years experience, , which means that eligible candidates will be exempt from Retail Banking I exams (Accelerated 10) or exempt from Retail Banking I &amp; II (Accelerated 15) due to their extensive number of years working full-time in the sector. 
and renowned industry speakers are invited to lead thought-leadership discussion groups.

=== Certified Cards and Payments Professional ===


The ''Certified Cards and Payments Programme'' was launched in 2013 as a result of the introduction of an increasing number of new card payment methods to the market. CCPP certification is gained in the same way as the CRB certification above, with three levels of study and exams to pass. At that point in time, the programme was delivered as an in-bank classroom programme only.  

On the back of the success of the in-bank sessions, there are now first and second levels of the programme available for individual candidates to enrol on our site:

*Cards and Payments I

Cards and Payments I is a specialised programme that provides a broad overview and coverage of the entire lifecycle of all types of payments cards, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, corporate cards and mobile payments.
The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry. As a functional specialist you will gain an excellent understanding of other areas along with a strategic grasp of the industry which embraces international trends and best practices.

*Cards and Payments II

Cards and Payments II is a specialised programme focussed on the key areas of the Cards and Payments industry. The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry.

=== Executive Management Programme ===


For senior retail bankers with over 15 years of experience, the RBA also offers the Executive Management Programme that is hosted twice per year in London or Johannesburg. It's a three or five-day immersive programme for senior delegates, where a group our distinguished faculty deliver lectures, facilitate practical workshops

== Types of learning ==

=== ELearning ===

The Retail Banking Academy offers access to the CRB qualification via eLearning with a series of interactive modules and analytics solutions that continuously adapts to the candidates’ performance, facilitates critical reasoning and provides continuous coaching and feedback to help you become proficient at the core curriculum and enhance your retail banking training. 

=== Classroom (for in-bank programmes) ===

Programmes can also be tailored specifically to meet the needs of individual bank requirements, strategy and objectives with the in-bank programmes. Not only programmes can be bespoke, but can also be delivered by faculty staff in a classroom setting or via the e-learning platform, or in fact a combination of both types of learning.


== Governance ==

The Retail Banking Academy is governed by a board of directors, an academic standards board, an awarding organisation and its governing body. The board of directors is chaired by [[Michael Lafferty]] (chairman of Lafferty Group and a former [[Financial Times]] journalist). The academic director is Professor Abdul Rahman, a former full professor of economics and finance and Telfer teaching Fellow at the [[Telfer School of Management]], [[University of Ottawa]].

[[File:Schlumberger Sektkellerei 03.jpg|thumb|320px|Facade of Schlumberger champagne cellars, Vienna-Döbling]]
'''Robert Alwin Schlumberger, Edler von Goldeck''' (September 12, 1814 - July 13, 1879) was an entrepreneur and the first producer of [[sparkling wine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Sekt}}) in [[Austrian Empire|Austria]].

== Life ==
Schlumberger was born in [[Stuttgart]] in the German [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. Upon the early death of his father, he began a commercial apprenticeship. As director of [[Ruinart (Champagne)|Ruinart]], one of the leading champagne houses in [[Reims]], France, he was experienced with the ''[[Sparkling wine production|méthode champenoise]]'' when he on an 1841 boat trip met his future wife Sophie Kirchner from [[Vienna]], the daughter of a wealthy factory owner. He had the idea to produce champagne-like wine (''Schaumwein'') in Austria using the French method but Austrian grapes.

In 1842, Schlumberger founded his company renting several vineyards in [[Bad Vöslau|Vöslau]], a small [[Lower Austria]]n town south of Vienna situated in the present-day ''[[Austrian wine|Thermenregion]]'' wine-growing area of the eastern [[Vienna Woods]]. His  alliance which Sophie Kirchner, whom he married in the following year, helped him finance his business venture. Schlumberger presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name ''Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein'' (White sparkling wine of Vöslau), from 1859 under ''Vöslauer Goldeck'', the first protected wine trademark in Austria. It was produced from red [[Blauer Portugieser]] grapes growing in the Goldeck vineyards in Vöslau, which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/Schlumberger_3.0.2673.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Schlumberger], accessed on January 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlumberger wines were on board of the [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS Novara]] on its around-the-world mission 1857-59. The company opened branch stores in Berlin and after the [[1862 International Exhibition]] also in London, where the wine was sold under the brand name "Vöslauer Sparkling". Robert Schlumberger also served as Vöslau mayor from 1864 to 1870. In 1878, one year before his death, he was ennobled by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] as "[[Edler]] von Goldeck". He died in Vöslau, aged 64.

== Schlumberger Sekt company ==
Robert Schlumberger's son and heir Otto received the title of a ''[[Royal Warrant of Appointment|K.u.k. Hoflieferant]]'' in 1895. The company survived the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in 1918 and up to today, Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] with its seat at Vienna-[[Döbling]] is one of the leading producers of sparkling wine in [[Austria]]. In 1973, it was taken over by the German [[Underberg]] company.

* Grape Varieties:  [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] (Red), [[Merlot]] (Red), [[Cabernet Franc]] (Red)
* Specific Vineyards:  Goldeck, Hupfenberg, Oberkirchen

==Quotes==
[[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] (1832–1910) in a letter to his daughter Bergliot from [[Schwaz]] in Tyrol, 29 May 1894: {{cquote|We drank ''Vöslauer Schaumwein'', and maybe it was time place and mood that made a difference, but the best Champagne does not suit me like this one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/litteratur/bjoernson/bbaulestad.txt {{no icon}} Documentation project of the Oslo University]&lt;/ref&gt;}}Vöslauer wine is also mentioned by [[John Galsworthy]] (1867–1933) in his 1926 play ''Escape'' as well as in the 1957 volume of novellas ''Fin de siècle'' by [[Paul Morand]] (1888–1976).

'''Samuel Muthui Maina''' (born 1987) is a Kenyan businessman.

He was born in 1987 in [[Rumuruti]] village. He went to Mutamaiyu Primary school in 1993 and completed in 2002. He managed to score 193 marks out of 500. He was unable to proceed to high school since his parents were unable to pay the admission fees. In 2010, after stealing Sh1 123,000 from his employer, he spent six months in [[remand prison]]. He was released after the case was settled out of court and after he agreed to return the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How an ex-convict saw a real jewel in recruitment agency |author=Simon Ciuri |date=June 12, 2013 |work=Business Daily |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/How-an-ex-convict-saw-a-real-jewel-in-recruitment-agency-/-/539444/1880674/-/8c64tg/-/index.html |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729184236/http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/How-an-ex-convict-saw-a-real-jewel-in-recruitment-agency-/-/539444/1880674/-/8c64tg/-/index.html |archivedate=July 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After release, he took a job as a [[sales representative]]. However, the pay was not enough to return the stolen money to his previous employer. Muthui then stole Sh150,000 from this employer with the aim of starting his own business.

'''Solomon Bernard Levine'''(August 10, 1920 - October 3, 2006) was one of the U.S.'s foremost experts on Japanese [[Labor movement|labor]] and [[industrial relations]].

==Biography==
Levine's book "Industrial Relations in Postwar [[Japan]]", published in 1958, was considered to be a landmark in the field, influencing a generation of Asian scholars. His deep knowledge and interest in Japan came long before the 1980s explosion in interest and writing about the rapid growth and success of the Japanese [[economy]] and employment system.  Levine’s book then became the classic reference that everyone working on these topics were told to read.

Levine was a [[naval intelligence]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in [[World War II]] and learned to speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as part of the war effort.  While in the language program, he met his wife, Betty, also a naval intelligence officer.  Levine was part of the [[Okinawa]] landing and, later, the occupation of Japan. While serving in the occupation, Levine developed a fascination with Japanese culture that was to last the rest of his life. Still in [[Naval intelligence]], he served as a translator for a Japanese admiral who had helped design the battleship [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']].

After the service, Levine received a BA and MBA from [[Harvard]] and a Phd. in Economics from [[MIT]]. He was then hired as an assistant professor at the [[University of Illinois]] and began to do research on Japanese labor relations. His department head warned, "no one would ever be interested in" his chosen field.  Eventually, Levine became the Director of the Asian Studies Center at the Univ. of Illinois and, later, Chairman of the East Asian Studies program and professor of industrial relations and [[international business]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].

Although widely respected, Levine's work often ran counter to accepted [[truism]]s on the subject.  For example, Japan's postwar boom was often attributed to an extraordinarily loyal and docile workforce. Levine showed that Japanese workers in the 1950s were actually just as likely to strike as American ones.  And he contended that the supposed cradle-to-grave [[job security]] offered by Japanese corporations was a myth, long before the economic decline of the 90s demonstrated this on a widespread basis. He noted, correctly, that life-time security was afforded at best one third of the male labor force.  It did not extend to those working outside of large firms in smaller manufacturing supplier firms, those over the age of 55, women, and those in the service sector.

Levine’s work was widely acclaimed by other Japanese and international scholars and experts for its rich understanding of the Japanese culture, institutions, and history.  He attracted to the University of Illinois, and then to the University of Wisconsin, many Japanese students who went on to take up faculty positions in leading Japanese universities and to become top advisors of Japanese government leaders.  Much of this came from the time he and his wife lived and studied in Japan and from the knowledge he gained from the wide array of Japanese scholars, students, and professionals with whom he interacted. Noted industrial relations expert, [[Thomas Anton Kochan]], wrote, “Unlike much of the more superficial writing about the Japanese ‘model’ of labor and employment relations that appeared during the peak of its success and popularity, Levine’s work and depiction of industrial relations in Japan has stood the test of time well."

'''''The Astor Orphan''''' is a 2013 memoir by Alexandra Aldrich, a member of the [[Astor family]].

==Summary==
Alexandra Aldrich, a direct descendant to [[John Jacob Astor]], recounts her childhood at [[Rokeby (Barrytown, New York)|Rokeby]], a 43-room historic estate in [[Barrytown, New York]]. The family is land-rich but cash-poor. Her father is unemployed and her grandmother is an alcoholic. The book ends as she leaves for boarding school.

==Critical reception==
The book was described by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as a "sparklingly mischievous debut".&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-220793-7 The Astor Orphan: A Memoir ], ''Publishers Weekly'', 12/24/2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Kevin Nance compared it to ''[[Grey Gardens]]'', adding that, "Aldrich delivers buckets of eccentricity."&lt;ref name="kevinnance"&gt;Kevin Nance, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-03/features/ct-prj-0505-astor-orphan-alexandra-aldrich-20130503_1_little-edie-grey-gardens-printers-row-journal Review: 'The Astor Orphan' by Alexandra Aldrich], ''The Chicago Tribune'', May 03, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argued that her "petulant grievance and thwarted entitlement" made the book "wearisome fast".&lt;ref name="kevinnance"/&gt; He added that the dialogues lacked credibility, and that there is a "lack of an adult, emotionally mature perspective".&lt;ref name="kevinnance"/&gt; 

Writing for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', Matthew Kassel argued that it "read[s] like a cross between ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and ''[[Running with Scissors (memoir)|Running with Scissors]]'', adding that "it contain[ed] more than a few unsavory details about her family, personal things that one might not want the public to know about."&lt;ref name="matthewkassel"&gt;Matthew Kassel, [http://observer.com/2013/04/rokeby-baby-in-new-memoir-astor-descendant-details-impoverished-mansion-upringing/ Rokeby Baby: In New Memoir, Astor Descendant Details Impoverished Mansion Upbringing], ''The New York Observer'', 04/16/13&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "the book feels like a child's revenge on her family."&lt;ref name="matthewkassel"/&gt; 

In ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', Laura Miller called it "a mournful, curious tale of an anxious child's longing for security."&lt;ref name="lauramiller"&gt;Laura Miller, [http://www.salon.com/2013/04/14/the_astor_orphan_rich_little_poor_girl/ {{"'}}The Astor Orphan': Rich little poor girl"], ''Salon'', April 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She added that it lacked "the fluency of truly accomplished storytelling".&lt;ref name="lauramiller"/&gt; 

In ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Buzzy Jackson, the author of ''Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist'', argued that it was "unpleasant for the reader to spend time with these spoiled, deranged people."&lt;ref name="buzzyjackson"&gt;Buzzy Jackson, [https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/04/29/book-review-the-astor-orphan/B5iDLtrlQdWaGUiqs5FFfN/story.html ‘The Astor Orphan’ by Alexandra Aldrich], ''The Boston Globe'', April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', Eric Hanson called the book, "wearying, gorgeous, ugly, sad, bohemian and only mildly sordid or scandalous by TV or literary standards."&lt;ref name="erichanson"&gt;Eric Hanson, [http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/202597581.html "Review: 'The Astor Orphan{{'"}}, by Alexandra Aldrich], ''Star Tribune'', April 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trello''' is a [[Web application|web-based]] [[Project management software|project management application]] originally  made by [[Fog Creek Software]] in 2011, that was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Special Announcement: Trello is now part of Trello, Inc.|url=http://blog.trello.com/trello-is-now-trello-inc/|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later sold to [[Atlassian]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.trello.com/trello-atlassian|title=Trello Is Being Acquired By Atlassian|first=Michael|last=Pryor|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=ForbesNYCStartups2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2016/03/23/the-10-hottest-startups-in-nyc/2/#7e9c7d417bed|title=10 Hot Startups In NYC|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Trello was released at a [[TechCrunch]] event by Fog Creek founder [[Joel Spolsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/joel-spolskys-trello-is-a-simple-workflow-and-list-manager-for-groups/ |title=Joel Spolsky's Trello Is A Simple Workflow And List Manager For Groups |first=Leena |last=Rao |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine named the application in September 2011 one of "The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/09/startups-techcrunch-disrupt/ |title=The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet |publisher=Wired.com |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifehacker]] said "it makes project collaboration simple and kind of enjoyable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5839942/trello-makes-project-collaboration-simple-and-kind-of-fun |title=Lifehacker Trello Review |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date= |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, it raised $10.3 million in funding from [[Index Ventures]] and [[Spark Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/24/digital-whiteboard-trello-spins-out-of-fog-creek-with-10-3m/|title = Digital Whiteboard Trello Spins Out of Fog Creek With $10.3M |date=July 24, 2014 |accessdate= |website = |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |last=Gage |first=Deborah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its "Power-Ups Platform" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.&lt;ref&gt; Lardinois, Frederic (January 19, 2016). [https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/19/trello-launches-developer-platform/ "Trello Launches Developer Platform"]. ''TechCrunch''. AOL.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Trello claimed it had more than 1.1 million daily active users and 14 million total signups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/05/23/trello-get-serious-about-big-businesses-as-it-passes-1-1-million-daily-users-and-triples-sales/#5683f3376ce2|accessdate = |title=Trello Get Serious About Big Businesses As It Passes 1.1 Million Daily Users And Triples Sales |website=[[Forbes]] |date=May 23, 2016|last=Konrad |first=Alex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2017, [[Atlassian]] announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options. Trello had earlier sold 22% of its shares to other investors with the remaining majority held by founders Michael Pryor and [[Joel Spolsky]] at the time of acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/ |title=Atlassian acquires Trello for $425M |last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/01/09/productivity-app-trello-sold-for-425-million.html|title=Productivity app Trello sold for $425 million|publisher=New York Business Journal|date=January 9, 2017|last=Noto|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Trello has a variety of work and personal uses including real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, lesson planning, accounting, web design, gaming and law office case management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leanpub.com/trellodojo |title=Trello Dojo |first=Daniel |last=Root |date=February 9, 2014 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rich API as well as email-in capability enables integration with enterprise systems, or with cloud-based integration services like [[IFTTT]] and [[Zapier]].

== Architecture ==
According to a Fog Creek blog post in January 2012, the client was an extremely thin web layer which downloads the main app, written in [[CoffeeScript]] and compiled to [[minified]] JavaScript, using [[Backbone.js]]&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web |title=Trello|url=http://backbonejs.org/#examples}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HTML5]] &lt;code&gt;[[pushState|.pushState()]]&lt;/code&gt; and the [[Mustache (template system)|Mustache]] [[templating language]].&lt;ref name="Trello, Stack" &gt;{{cite web|title=The Trello Tech Stack|url=http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/|first=Brett |last=Kiefer| date=January 19, 2012| accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server side was built on top of [[MongoDB]], [[Node.js]] and a modified version of [[Socket.io]].&lt;ref name="Trello, Stack" /&gt;

== Reception ==
On January 26, 2017, ''PC Magazine'' gave Trello a 3.5 / 5, calling it "flexible" and saying that "you can get rather creative," while noting that "it may require some experimentation to figure out how to best use it for your team and the workload you manage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2487001,00.asp|title=Trello|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm's primary operating subsidiary is [[national bank]] '''Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.''', which designates its main office as [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo &amp; Company and [[Minneapolis]]-based [[Norwest Corporation]] in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]-based [[Wachovia]]. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the "[[Big Four (banking)#United States|Big Four Banks]]" of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/|title=FRB: Large Commercial Banks-- March 31, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|06}}, it had 8,050 [[branches]] and 13,000 [[automated teller machines|ATM]]s.&lt;ref name="WF Quarterly Fact Sheet 2Q2018" /&gt; In 2018 the company had operations in 35 countries with over 70 million customers globally.&lt;ref name="WF Quarterly Fact Sheet 2Q2018" /&gt;

===Wachovia acquisition===
[[File:2011-11-22 Wells Fargo ATMs lit at night.jpg|thumb|A former Wachovia branch converted to Wells Fargo in the fall of 2011 in [[Durham, North Carolina]]]]
On October 3, 2008, [[Wachovia]] agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about US$14.8 billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the US [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) made moves to have [[Citigroup]] buy Wachovia for US$2.1 billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-10-03-378872640_x.htm | title=Wells Fargo agrees to buy Wachovia; Citi objects | publisher=[[USA Today]] | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 4, 2008 | accessdate=October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the situation was sorted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/archive/6432867/ | title=Court tilts Wachovia fight toward Wells | date=October 5, 2008 | accessdate=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081005/wells_fargo_wachovia.html?.v=29|title=Court tilts Wachovia fight toward Wells Fargo}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the US$42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over US$42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of US$60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-10-09-2208148309_x.htm | title=Wells Fargo plans to buy Wachovia; Citi ends talks | publisher=[[USA Today]] | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 9, 2008 | accessdate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2009, Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009, raising US$8.6 billion in capital. The remaining US$4.9 billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the US$25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of US$131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to US$1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wellsfargo.com/press/2009/20091223_tarp_repayment|title=News Releases|publisher=Wells Fargo|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406010401/https://www.wellsfargo.com/press/2009/20091223_tarp_repayment|archive-date=April 6, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of Wells Fargo Securities====
Wells Fargo Securities was established in 2009 to house Wells Fargo's capital markets group which it obtained during the Wachovia acquisition. Prior to that point, Wells Fargo had little to no participation in investment banking activities, though Wachovia had a well established investment banking practice which it operated under the [[Wachovia Securities]] banner.

Wachovia's institutional capital markets and investment banking business arose from the merger of Wachovia and First Union. First Union had bought [[Bowles Hollowell Connor &amp; Co.]] on April 30, 1998 adding to its [[merger and acquisition]], [[high yield]], [[leveraged finance]], equity underwriting, [[private placement]], [[loan syndication]], [[risk management]], and [[public finance]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-union-to-expand-investment-banking-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-bowles-hollowell-conner-77048217.html | title=First Union To Expand Investment Banking Capabilities With Acquisition Of Bowles Hollowell Conner | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=March 10, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legacy components of Wells Fargo Securities include [[Wachovia Securities]], [[Bowles Hollowell Connor &amp; Co.]], Barrington Associates, [[Halsey, Stuart &amp; Co.]], [[Bache &amp; Co.|Leopold Cahn &amp; Co.]], [[Bache &amp; Co.]]. [[Prudential Securities]], [[A.G.

===Cross-selling===
A key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is [[cross-selling]], the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wellsfargo.com/invest_relations/vision_values/4|title=Our strategy: How we're going to get there|publisher=Wellsfargo.com|accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers in an attempt to increase the customer's profitability to the bank.&lt;ref name="WSJ-HardSell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704430304576170702480420980.html|title=In Tribute to Wells, Banks Try the Hard Sell|first=Randall|last=Smith|date=February 28, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-ArtOfTheCrossSell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2012/01/25/the-art-of-the-cross-sell/|title=The Art Of The Cross-Sell|first=Halah|last=Touryalai|date=January 25, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a [[hard sell]] technique);&lt;ref name="WSJ-HardSell"/&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine describes Wells Fargo as "better than anyone" at the practice.&lt;ref name="Forbes-ArtOfTheCrossSell"/&gt;

===International operations===
Wells Fargo has banking services throughout the world, with offices in [[Hong Kong]], [[London]], [[Dubai]], [[Singapore]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wellsfargo.com/com/international/locations/|title=International Locations and Contacts – Wells Fargo Commercial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/13/a-look-at-wells-fargos-overseas-expansion/|title=A Look at Wells Fargo's Overseas Expansion|last=Glazer|first=Emily|access-date=2016-08-25|date=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They operate back-offices in India and the Philippines with more than 3,000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/why-us-banking-giant-wells-fargo-is-creating-back-office-jobs-in-india-353273.html|title=Why US banking giant Wells Fargo is creating back-office jobs in India|date=2012-06-22|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charter===
Wells Fargo operates under Charter #1, the first national bank [[charter]] issued in the United States. This charter was issued to [[First National Bank (Philadelphia)|First National Bank]] of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://blogs.wf.com/guidedbyhistory/2009/07/last-week-ryan-baum-began/ | title=Wells Fargo's Charter Number (cont'd) | first=Charles | last=Riggs | date=July 6, 2009 | publisher=Wells Fargo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, acquiring banks assume the earliest issued charter number. Thus, the first charter passed from First National Bank of Philadelphia to Wells Fargo through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had inherited it through one of its many acquisitions.

===1981 MAPS Wells Fargo embezzlement scandal===
In 1981, it was discovered that a Wells Fargo assistant operations officer, Lloyd Benjamin "Ben" Lewis, had perpetrated one of the largest embezzlements in history, through its Beverly Drive branch. During 1978 - 1981, Lewis had successfully written phony debit and credit receipts to benefit [[boxing promoter]]s [[Harold Rossfields Smith|Harold J. Smith]] ([[Given name|né]] Ross Eugene Fields) and Sam "Sammie" Marshall, chairman and president, respectively, of Muhammed Ali Professional Sports, Inc. (MAPS), of which Lewis was also listed as a director; Marshall, too, was a former employee of the same Wells Fargo branch as Lewis. In excess of US$300,000 was paid to Lewis, who pled guilty to [[embezzlement]] and [[conspiracy]] charges in 1981, and testified against his co-conspirators for a reduced five-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vs9wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT666 Miller, Wilbur R.]''The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia'', SAGE Publications, 2012, page 666.

===Settlement and fines regarding mortgage servicing practices===
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest [[mortgage servicers]] ([[Ally Financial]], [[Bank of America]], [[Citi]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the US Federal Government and 49 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com/faq|title=Joint State-Federal Mortgage Servicing Settlement FAQ|publisher=NMS|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement, known as the [[National Mortgage Settlement]] (NMS), required the servicers to provide about US$26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the federal and state governments.

She went on to add, "perhaps more disturbing is Wells Fargo's refusal to voluntarily correct its errors. It prefers to rely on the ignorance of borrowers or their inability to fund a challenge to its demands, rather than voluntarily relinquish gains obtained through improper accounting methods."&lt;ref&gt;''Jones'', supra&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit regarding excessive overdraft fees===
In May 2013, Wells Fargo paid US$203 million to settle class-action litigation accusing the bank of imposing excessive [[overdraft]] fees on checking-account customers. Also in May, the New York attorney-general, [[Eric Schneiderman]], announced a lawsuit against Wells Fargo over alleged violations of the national mortgage settlement, a US$25 billion deal struck between 49 state attorneys and the five-largest mortgage servicers in the US.

===2015 Violation of New York credit card laws===
In February 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to pay US$4 million for violations where an affiliate took interest in the homes of borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for the homeowners. This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a US$2 million penalty with the other US$2 million going towards restitution to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Freifeld|first1=Karen|title=Wells Fargo to pay US$4 million for violations on credit card accounts: New York|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-wells-credit-settlement-idUSKBN0L92C720150205|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive compensation===
With CEO John Stumpf being paid 473 times more than the median employee, Wells Fargo ranks number 33 among the S&amp;P 500 companies for CEO—employee pay inequality. In October 2014, a Wells Fargo employee earning US$15 per hour emailed the CEO—copying 200,000 other employees—asking that all employees be given a US$10,000 per year raise taken from a portion of annual corporate profits to address wage stagnation and income inequality. After being contacted by the media, Wells Fargo responded that all employees receive "market competitive" pay and benefits significantly above US federal minimums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/09/wells-fargo-email_n_5960072.html|title=Wells Fargo Employee Calls Out CEO's Pay, Requests Company-Wide Raise In Brave Email|work=The Huffington Post|first=Kevin|last=Short|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/279224582.html|title=Schafer: Wells Fargo missed mark after worker requested $10,000 raises for all|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=October 15, 2014|last=Schafer|first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax avoidance and lobbying===
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization [[Public Campaign]] criticized Wells Fargo for spending US$11 million on [[lobbying]] and [[tax avoidance|not paying any taxes]] during 2008–2010, instead getting US$681 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of US$49 billion, laying off 6,385 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 180% to US$49.8 million in 2010 for its top five executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Portero |first=Ashley |title=30 Major U.S. Corporations Paid More to Lobby Congress Than Income Taxes, 2008–2010 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |work=[[International Business Times]] |accessdate=26 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64D9GyQG0?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 however, at an effective tax rate of 31.2% of its income, Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest payer of corporation tax in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mef45kghl/4-wells-fargo/|title=Wells Fargo - In Photos: The 25 U.S. Corporations That Pay The Highest Taxes|author=Christopher Helman|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wells Fargo account fraud scandal===
{{main|Wells Fargo account fraud scandal}}
In September 2016, Wells Fargo was issued a combined total of US$185 million in fines for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The US [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] issued US$100 million in fines, the largest in the agency's five-year history, along with US$50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and US$35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/09/08/wells-fargo-fined-185m-over-unauthorized-accounts/90003212/|title=Wells Fargo fined $185M for fake accounts; 5,300 were fired|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and US$5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-to-pay-185-million-fine-over-account-openings-1473352548|title=Wells Fargo Fined for Sales Scam|date=September 9, 2016|last=Glazer|first=Emily|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|page=A1|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carrie Tolstedt]], who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received US$124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gandel|first1=Stephen|title=Wells Fargo Exec Who Headed Phony Accounts Unit Collected $125 Million|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=September 12, 2016|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/12/wells-fargo-cfpb-carrie-tolstedt/|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-senate-testimony.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|date=September 20, 2016|last=Corkery|first=Michael|newspaper=New York Times| title= Illegal Activity at Wells Fargo May Have Begun Earlier, Chief Says|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 2016, [[John Stumpf]], the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company.

===Racketeering lawsuit for mortgage appraisal overcharges===
In November 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay US$50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit in which the bank was accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans.  While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners US$95 to US$125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged US$50 or less.  The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U S [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Aubin|first1=Dena|title=Wells Fargo agrees to $50 million settlement over homeowner fees|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-settlement-idUSKBN12V27F|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=10 November 2016|date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dakota Access Pipeline investment ===
Wells Fargo is a top investor in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] project in [[North Dakota]], a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground [[oil pipeline]] project in the United States. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its necessity, and potential impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/how-to-contact-the-17-banks-funding-the-dakota-access-pipeline-20160929|title=How to Contact the 17 Banks Funding the Dakota Access Pipeline|last=Fuller|first=Emily|newspaper=[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|YES! Magazine]]|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, [[Seattle, Washington]]'s city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo "in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its "creation of millions of bogus accounts." and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve "social responsibility."  The City Council in [[Davis, California]], took a similar action voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/08/514133514/two-cities-vote-to-pull-more-than-3-billion-from-wells-fargo-over-dakota-pipelin |title=2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline |last=Chappell |first=Bill |date=February 8, 2017}}2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failure to comply with document security requirements ===
In December 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Wells Fargo US$5.5 million for failing to store electronic documents in a "write once, read many" format, which makes it impossible to alter or destroy records after they are written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FINRA fines Wells Fargo, others $14 mln for records' changeable format|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 advertising campaign===
On May 6, 2018, Wells Fargo launched an integrated marketing campaign called "Re-Established" to emphasize the company's commitment to re-establish trust with stakeholders and to demonstrate how Wells Fargo is transforming as it emerges from a challenging period in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/wells-fargo-launches-reestablished-a-new-brand-campaign-20180507-00639|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|website=NASDAQ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television commercial opens with the bank's origins in the [[Old West]], references the scandal and fast-forwards to depict dedicated bank employees and happy customers as a narrator assures viewers: "It's a new day at Wells Fargo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-ad-campaign-20180509-story.html|title=Wells Fargo launches ad campaign to leave accounts scandal behind.

===Connections to the gun industry and NRA===
	 
Wells Fargo is the top banker for US gun makers and the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). From December 2012 through February 2018 it reportedly helped two of the biggest firearms and ammunition companies obtain US$431.1 million in loans and bonds. It also created a US$28-million line of credit for the NRA and operates the organization’s primary accounts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wells Fargo is the top banker for the NRA and gunmakers| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-guns-20180307-story.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2018 statement Wells Fargo said, "Any solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated. This is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process. ... We plan to engage our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities.” &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Wells Fargo’s CEO subsequently said that the bank would provide its gun clients with feedback from employees and  investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Deon|title=Wells Fargo is talking to its gun maker clients, CEO says|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-guns-20180327-story.html||publisher=LA TIMES|date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discontent among female workers ===
In June 2018, about a dozen female Wells Fargo executives from the wealth management division met in Scottsdale, Arizona to discuss the minimal presence of women occupying senior roles within the company. The meeting, dubbed "the meeting of 12", represented the majority of the regional managing directors, of which 12 out of 45 are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-wells-fargo-discontent-simmers-among-female-executives-1535707801|title=At Wells Fargo, Discontent Simmers Among Female Executives|last=Glazer|first=Emily|date=2018-08-31|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells Fargo had previously been investigating reports of gender bias in the division in the months leading up to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/wells-fargo-investigating-reports-of-gender-bias-in-wealth-division.html|title=Wells Fargo said to be investigating reports of gender bias in its wealth division|last=Rooney|first=Kate|date=2018-08-31|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women reported that they had been turned down for top jobs despite their qualifications, and instead the roles were occupied by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/wells-fargo-investigating-reports-of-gender-bias-in-wealth-division.html|title=Wells Fargo said to be investigating reports of gender bias in its wealth division|last=Rooney|first=Kate|date=2018-08-31|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also complaints against company president Jay Welker, who is also the head of the Wells Fargo wealth management division, due to his sexist statements regarding female employees. The female workers claimed that he called them "girls" and said that they "should be at home taking care of their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/wells-fargo-investigating-reports-of-gender-bias-in-wealth-division.html|title=Wells Fargo said to be investigating reports of gender bias in its wealth division|last=Rooney|first=Kate|date=2018-08-31|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yehuda Talit''' ({{lang-he|יהודה טלית}}, born on 2 December 1944) is an [[Israel]]i [[businessman]], [[record producer]] and [[talent agent]].

==Biography==

===Childhood, teenage years and early career stages===

Talit was born in [[Tel Aviv]] where he studied at [[Gymnasia Balfour|Balfour]] Elementary School and later at the Agricultural High School at [[Mikve Israel]]. He first stepped into the business world with the production, promotion and selling of key chains with celebrity portraits imprinted on them, which were very popular during the 60’s.

===A producer and an agent===
In 1966 Talit met [[Haim Saban]] who was a member of “The Lions” band. Talit offered Saban to sell key chains with The Lions’ portraits, a move which was their first business partnership. The two of them went on and established a company that represented The Lions and other known Israeli performers of that time like Arik Einstein and The Churchills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=יאיר מנדלסון |url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.278862 |title=מהפחון בבת ים לווילה בהוליווד TheMarker |publisher=Themarker.com |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Talit founded “Talit Productions”. During the 1980s the company produced large concerts and brought international artists to Israel such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Boy George]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Duran Duran]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Eurythmics]] and many others. The company also initiated a line of Opera productions, Musicals, theater shows and sport events. The most prominent of them were The Bolshoy Theater, [[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]], [[Walt Disney]]’s [[World on Ice]] and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].

Among other things Talit was also responsible for the Night of Love performance which was held in Tzemach, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, The Magician, a musical based on The [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]], which ran since 1994 and had more than 600 shows. During the past few years, Talit has been responsible in a joint production with the Beit Lesin Theater in Israel, for the hit one man show starring [[Avi Kushnir]], Returning the Cave Man.

At the same time, the company has represented many artists and Israeli performers from Kaveret and Shalom Hanoch to Avi Kushnir and Danny Sanderson. Some of them still represented by the agency until this day.

===The TV business===
In 1997 Talit expanded his company when he got into the television business and founded “Talit Communications”, which later became “Talit Productions” founder. At the same time, he joined a business partnership with Ron Isaac and founded "Iguana Productions". In 1998, a year later, Talit added the broadcast rights for FTV. In 1999, together with Tamira Yardeni and Haim Slotzki, he founded “Synergy Communications”, which went on to win the rights to operate the Israeli Satellite Channel of [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. Talit also started a co partnership with EM.TV, the German content giant, which brought to the Israeli television children’s classics like Maya the Bee, The Muppet Show, Marco, Pinocchio, Niles Holgerson and Pippee Long stocking.

Although Talit sold half of the Talit group to the same German Company a few years later he bought back all of it from EM. TV.

In 2000 Talit created yet another partnership with Jim Hanson’s production company and reserved the Israeli rights for The Muppet Show. A year later, Talit went into sports with his Group Channel that broadcast the games of [[Maccabi Haifa]] and [[Manchester United]].

In 2003 Talit got the rights of representation for the French channel, TV5, and established the baby channel, [[Baby TV]].

Two years later Talit received the broadcast rights for the National Geographic Channel in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b.walla.co.il/?w=/3050/1624735 |title=ערוצי נשיונל ג'אוגרפיק ייוצגו בישראל ע"י טלית תקשורת |publisher=B.walla.co.il |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today “Talit Communications” owns and represents 20 channels broadcast in Israel.
