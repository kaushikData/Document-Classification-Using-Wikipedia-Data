      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25365">'''Adaptive hypermedia''' ('''AH''') uses [[hypermedia]] which is adaptive according to a ''user model''. In contrast to linear media, where all users are offered a standard series of [[hyperlink]]s, adaptive hypermedia (AH) tailors what the user is offered based on a model of the user's goals, preferences and knowledge, thus providing links or content most appropriate to the current user.&lt;ref name="article6" /

==Background==
Adaptive hypermedia is used in educational hypermedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gerherd |last=Weber |author2=Peter Brusilovsky|title = ELM-ART: An adaptive versatile system for Web-based instruction |journal = International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education |year = 2003 |volume = 13 |issue = 2–4 |pages = 159–172 |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32229516_ELM-ART_An_Adaptive_Versatile_System_for_Web-based_Instruction }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Brusilovsky |author2=John Eklund|title = A study of user-model based link annotation in educational hypermedia |journal = Journal of Universal Computer Science |year = 1998 |volume = 4 |issue = 4 |pages = 429–448 |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2787148_A_Study_of_User_Model_Based_Link_Annotation_in_Educational_Hypermedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul De Bra |author2=Licia Calvi |title = AHA! An open Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture |journal = The New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia |year = 1998 |volume = 4 |pages = 115–139 |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220590224_AHA%21_An_open_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Architecture }}&lt;/ref&gt; on-line information and help systems, as well as institutional information systems.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt; Adaptive educational hypermedia tailors what the learner sees to that learner's goals, abilities, needs, interests, and [[knowledge]] of the subject, by providing hyperlinks that are most relevant to the user in an effort to shape the user's [[cognitive load]]. The teaching tools "adapt" to the learner. On-line information systems provide reference access to information for users with a different knowledge level of the subject.&lt;ref name="article4" /&gt;

An adaptive hypermedia system should satisfy three criteria: it should be a [[hypertext]] or [[hypermedia]] system, it should have a [[Standard user model|user model]] and it should be able to [[Adaptation|adapt]] the hypermedia using the model.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

A [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction is made between ''[[adaptation]]'', referring to system-driven changes for [[personalisation]], and ''adaptability'', referring to user-driven changes. One way of looking at this is that adaptation is automatic, whereas adaptability is not. From an [[epistemic]] point of view, adaptation can be described as analytic, [[a priori and a posteriori|a-priori]], whereas adaptability is synthetic, [[a-posteriori]]. In other words, any adaptable system, as it "contains" a human, is by default "intelligent", whereas an adaptive system that presents "[[intelligence]]" is more surprising and thus more interesting.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

==Architecture==
The system categories in which user modelling and adaptivity have been deployed by various researchers in the field share an underlying architecture. The conceptual structure for adaptive systems generally consists of interdependent components: a [[Standard user model|user model]], a [[domain model]] and an [[interaction model]].&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;

===User model===
The user model is a representation of the knowledge and preferences which the system 'believes' a user (which may be an individual, a group of people or non-human agents) possesses.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; It is a knowledge source which is separable by the system from the rest of its knowledge and contains explicit assumptions about the user.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Knowledge for the user model can be acquired implicitly by making inferences about users from their interaction with the system, by carrying out some form of test, or from assigning users to generic user categories usually called '[[stereotypes]]'.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; The student model consists of a personal profile (which includes static data, e.g., name and password), cognitive profile (adaptable data such as preferences), and a student knowledge profile.&lt;ref name="Triantafillou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusilovsky2" /&gt; Systems may adapt, depending on user features such as:&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt; 
* goals (a feature related with the context of a user's work in hypermedia)
* knowledge (knowledge of the subject represented in the hyperspace)
* background ( all the information related to the user's previous experience outside the subject of the hypermedia system which is relevant enough to be considered)
* hyperspace experience (how familiar is the user with the structure of the hyperspace and how easily can the user navigate it)
* preferences (the user can prefer some nodes and links over others and some parts of a page over others).

===Domain model===
The [[domain model]] defines the aspects of the application which can be adapted or which are otherwise required for the operation of the adaptive system.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; The domain model contains several concepts that stand as the backbone for the content of the system. Other terms which have been used for this concept include content model, application model, system model, device model and task model.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; It describes educational content such as information pages, examples, and problems. The simplest content model relates every content item to exactly one domain concept (in this model, this concept is frequently referred to as a domain topic). More advanced content models use multi-concept indexing for each content item and sometimes use roles to express the nature of item-concept relationship.&lt;ref name="Brusilovsky2" /&gt;
A cognitively valid domain model should capture descriptions of the application at three levels,&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; namely:
* The task level which makes the user aware of the system purpose.
* The logical level which describes how something works.
* The physical level which describes how to do something.
Each content concept has a set of topics.  Topics represent individual pieces of knowledge for each domain and the size of each topic varies in relation to the particular domain.  Additionally, topics are linked to each other forming a semantic network.  This network is the structure of the knowledge domain.&lt;ref name="Triantafillou"&gt;Triantafillou, E, Pomportsis, A, &amp; Demetriadis, S. (2003). The design and the formative evaluation of an adaptive educational system based on cognitive styles. Computers &amp; Education, 41(87-103), Retrieved from http://www.cdli.ca/~bmann/0_ARTICLES/FormEval_Triantafillou_03.pdf {{doi|10.1016/S0360-1315(03)00031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusilovsky2"&gt;{{cite book| first = Peter| last = Brusilovsky| chapter=Developing Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems: From Design Models to Authoring Tools| title = Authoring Tools for Advanced Technology Learning Environments: Toward cost-effective adaptive, interactive, and intelligent educational software| date = 2003| publisher = Kluwer | isbn = 978-1-4020-1772-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction model===
The interaction or adaptation model contains everything which is concerned with the relationships which exist between the representation of the users (the user model) and the representation of the application (the domain model).&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt; It displays information to the user based on his or her cognitive preferences.  For instance, the module will divide a page's content into chunks with conditions set to only display to certain users or preparing two variants of a single concept page with a similar condition.&lt;ref name="Triantafillou" /&gt;
The two main aspects to the interaction model are capturing the appropriate raw data and representing the inferences, adaptations and evaluations which may occur.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;

Content-level and link-level adaptation are distinguished as two different classes of hypermedia adaptation; the first is termed ''adaptive presentation'' and the second, ''adaptive navigation support''.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

====Adaptive presentation====
The idea of various adaptive presentation techniques is to adapt the content of a page accessed by a particular user to current knowledge, goals, and other characteristics of the user. 
For example, a qualified user can be provided with more detailed and deep information while a novice can receive additional explanations. 
Adaptive text presentation is the most studied technology of hypermedia adaptation. 
There are a number of different techniques for adaptive text presentation.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

====Adaptive navigation support====
The idea of adaptive navigation support techniques is to help users to find their paths in hyperspace by adapting the way of presenting links to goals, knowledge, and other characteristics of an individual user. 
This area of research is newer than adaptive presentation, a number of interesting techniques have been already suggested and implemented. 
We distinguish four kinds of link presentation which are different from the point of what can be altered and adapted:
* Local non-contextual links – This type includes all kinds of links on regular hypermedia pages which are independent from the content of the page. 
* Contextual links or "real hypertext" links – This type comprises "hotwords" in texts, "hot spots" in pictures, and other kinds of links which are embedded in the context of the page content and cannot be removed from it. 
* Links from index and content pages – An index or a content page can be considered as a special kind of page which contains only links. 
* Links on local maps and links on global hyperspace maps – Maps usually graphically represent a hyperspace or a local area of hyperspace as a network of nodes connected by arrows.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

===Methods===
Adaptation methods are defined as generalizations of existing adaptation techniques. Each method is based on a clear adaptation idea which can be presented at the conceptual level.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

====Content adaptation====
*'''additional explanations''' – hides parts of information about a particular concept which are not relevant to the user's level of knowledge about this concept,
*'''prerequisite explanations''' – before presenting an explanation of a concept the system inserts explanations of all its prerequisite concepts which are not sufficiently known to the user, 
*'''comparative explanations''' – if a concept similar to the concept being presented is known, the user gets a comparative explanation which stress similarities and differences between the current concept and the related one, 
*'''explanation variants''' – assumes that showing or hiding some portion of the content is not always sufficient for the adaptation because different users may need essentially different information, 
*'''sorting''' – fragments of information about the concept are sorted from information which is most relevant to user's background and knowledge to information which is least relevant.&lt;ref name="article5" /&gt;

====Link adaptation====
*'''global guidance''' – the system suggests navigation paths on a global scale,
*'''local guidance''' – the system suggests the next step to take, for instance through a "next" or "continue" button,
*'''local orientation support''' – the system presents an overview of a part of the (link) structure of the hyperspace,
*'''global orientation support''' – the system presents an overview of the whole (link) structure of the hyperspace,
*'''managing personalized views in information spaces''' – each view may be a list of links to all pages or sub-parts of the whole hyperspace which are relevant for a particular working goal.&lt;ref name="article5" /&gt;

===Techniques===
Adaptation techniques refer to methods of providing adaptation in existing AH systems.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

====Content adaptation====
*'''conditional text''' – with this technique, all possible information about a concept is divided into several chunks of texts. Each chunk is associated with a condition on the level of user knowledge represented in the user model. When presenting the information about the concept, the system presents only the chunks where the condition is true. 
*'''stretchtext''' – turns off and on different parts of the content according to the user knowledge level.
*'''page variants''' – the most simple adaptive presentation technique. With this technique, a system keeps two or more variants of the same page with different presentations of the same content. 
*'''fragment variants''' – The system stores several variants of explanations for each concept and the user gets the page which includes variants corresponding to his or her knowledge about the concepts presented in the page
*'''frame-based techniques''' – With this technique all the information about a particular concept is represented in form of a frame. Slots of a frame can contain several explanation variants of the concept, links to other frames, examples, etc. Special presentation rules are used to decide which slots should be presented to a particular user and in which order.&lt;ref name="article2" /&gt;

====Link adaptation====
*'''direct guidance''' – the "next best" node for the user to visit is shown, e.g. through a "next" or "continue" button,
*'''link sorting''' – all the links on a particular page are sorted according to the user model and to some goal-oriented criteria: the more towards the top of the page, the more relevant the link is,
*'''link hiding''' – hiding links to "non-relevant" pages by changing the color of the anchors to that of normal text,
*'''link annotation''' – to augment the link with some form of comment which tells the user more about the current state of the pages to which the annotated links refer,
*'''link disabling''' – the "link functionality" of a link is removed, 
*'''link removal''' – link anchors for undesired links (non-relevant or not yet ready to read) are removed,
*'''map adaptation''' – the content and presentation of a map of the link structure of the hyperspace is adapted.&lt;ref name="article5" /&gt;

==Authoring adaptive hypermedia==
Authoring adaptive hypermedia uses designing and creation processes for content, usually in the form of a resource collection and [[domain model]], and adaptive behaviour, usually in the form of [[Conditional (programming)|IF-THEN rules]]. Recently, adaptation languages have been proposed for increased generality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/231/184 LAG language] by Alexander I. Cristea et al., the [https://archive.is/20121217161305/https://commerce.metapress.com/content/d7821442r8551453/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&amp;sid=zqkup055h2ihdh45prjrnqm0&amp;sh=www.springerlink.com LAG-XLS language] by Natalia Stash et al.&lt;/ref&gt; As adaptive hypermedia adapts at least to the user, authoring of AH comprises at least a [[Standard user model|user model]], and may also include other aspects.

===Issues===
Authoring of adaptive hypermedia was long considered as secondary to adaptive hypermedia delivery. This was not surprising in the early stages of adaptive hypermedia, when the focus was on research and expansion. Now that adaptive hypermedia itself has reached a certain maturity, the issue is to bring it out to the community and let the various [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] reap the benefits. However, authoring and creation of hypermedia is not trivial. Unlike in traditional authoring for hypermedia and the web, a linear storyline is not enough. Instead, various alternatives have to be created for the given material. For example, if a course should be delivered both to [[visual]] and [[Language|verbal]] learners, there should be created at least two perfectly equivalent versions of the material in visual and in verbal form, respectively. Moreover, an adaptation strategy should be created that states that the visual content should be delivered to visual learners, whereas the verbal content should be delivered to the verbal learners. Thus, authors should not only be able to create different versions of their content, but be able to specify (and in some cases, design from scratch) [[adaptation strategies]] of delivery of contents. Issues with which authoring of adaptive hypermedia is confronted are:
* creation of exchange language for the content (some early examples are [http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/231/184 the CAM language]),
* creation of exchange language for adaptation (with [http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/231/184 the LAG language] and the [https://archive.is/20121217161305/https://commerce.metapress.com/content/d7821442r8551453/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&amp;sid=zqkup055h2ihdh45prjrnqm0&amp;sh=www.springerlink.com LAG-XLS language] as examples),
* creation of a framework for adaptation (see, e.g., the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193644/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/HTML/Minerva/papers/UM03-cristea-calvi-accepted.pdf LAG framework]),
* standardization of adaptation processes.

===AH authoring frameworks===
There already exist some approaches to help authors to build adaptive-hypermedia-based systems. However, there is a strong need for high-level approaches, formalisms and tools that support and facilitate the description of [[Reusability|reusable]] adaptive [[hypermedia]] and websites. Such models started appearing (see, e.g., the [[AHAM model]] of adaptive hypermedia, or the [http://www2003.org/cdrom/papers/alternate/P301/p301-cristea.pdf LAOS framework] for authoring of adaptive hypermedia). Moreover, recently have we noticed a shift in interest, as it became clearer that the implementation-oriented approach would forever keep adaptive hypermedia away from the 'layman' [[author]]. The creator of adaptive hypermedia cannot be expected to know all facets of the process as described above. Still, he/she can be reasonably trusted to be an [[expert]] in one of these facets. For instance, it is reasonable to expect that there are content experts (such as, e.g., experts in chemistry, for instance). It is reasonable to expect, for adaptive educational hypermedia that there are experts in [[pedagogy]], who are able to add pedagogical [[metadata]] to the content created by content experts. Finally, it is reasonable to expect that adaptation experts will be the one creating the implementation of adaptation strategies, and descriptions (metadata) of such nature that they can be understood and applied by laymen authors. This type of division of work determines the different authoring personas that should be expected to collaborate in the creation process of adaptive hypermedia. Moreover, the contributions of these various personas correspond to the different modules that are to be expected in adaptive hypermedia systems.

==History==
By the early 1990s, the two main parent areas – [[hypertext]] and [[user modeling]] – had achieved a level of maturity that allowed for the research in these areas to be explored together. Many researchers had recognized the problems of static hypertext in different application areas, and explored various ways to adapt the output and behavior of hypertext systems to suit the needs of individual users. Several early papers on adaptive hypermedia were published in the ''User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction'' (UMUAI) journal; the first workshop on adaptive hypermedia was held during a user modeling conference; and a special issue of UMUAI on adaptive hypermedia was published in 1996. Several innovative adaptive hypermedia techniques had been developed, and several research-level adaptive hypermedia systems had been built and evaluated.&lt;ref name="article6" /&gt;

After 1996, adaptive hypermedia grew rapidly. Research teams commenced projects in adaptive hypermedia, and many students selected the subject area for their PhD theses. A book on adaptive hypermedia, and a special issue of the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (1998) were published. Two main factors accounted for this growth. Due a diverse audience, the [[World Wide Web|internet]] boosted research into adaptivity. Almost all the papers published before 1996 describe classic pre-Web hypertext and hypermedia; the majority of papers published since 1996 are devoted to Web-based adaptive hypermedia systems. The second factor was is the accumulation and consolidation of research experience in the field. Early papers provided few references to similar work in adaptive hypermedia, and described original laboratory systems developed to demonstrate and explore innovative ideas. After 1996, papers cite earlier work, and usually suggest either real world systems, or research systems developed for real world settings by elaborating or an extending techniques suggested earlier. This is indicative of the relative maturity of adaptive hypermedia as a research direction.&lt;ref name="article6" /&gt;

==Research==
Adaptive hypermedia and [[user modeling]] continue to be actively researched, with results published in several journals and conferences such as:
* [http://www.umuai.org/ User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction (UMUAI)]
* [http://www.ah2008.org/ Adaptive Hypermedia]

'''Rostrum Australia''' (formerly '''Australian Rostrum''') is an association of Australian [[public speaking]] clubs, founded on 21 July 1930. It is the main continuation of the original Rostrum club ("The Rostrum") founded in [[Manchester]], [[United Kingdom]] on 21 July 1923.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.act.rostrum.asn.au/Rostrum%20Recorder%20December%202005.pdf|title=Newsletter|year=2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828231412/http://www.act.rostrum.asn.au/Rostrum%20Recorder%20December%202005.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2007|publisher=Australian Rostrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; This club's other surviving descendants are "Rochdale Rostrum", a Rostrum club in the Greater Manchester area founded in 1978; and the presently dormant "Wellington Rostrum Club" in New Zealand.

Its early establishment makes Rostrum the longest running public speaking organisation in the world.

Rostrum clubs aim to help their members improve their speaking and meeting skills. They do this primarily through regular club meetings and less frequent competitions.

Australian Rostrum's main national competition for members is the "Sidney Wicks Speaking Competition". This is held roughly every six to eight years. In other years, state and territory competitions are dominant.

Its other main national competition is the annual Rostrum Voice of Youth (VOY). This is open to all [[high school]] students. It involves a prepared speech and an impromptu speech.

==History==
===1920s===
Rostrum was founded by [[Sidney F. Wicks]]. Wicks was an [[author]], an advertising executive for the [[Manchester Guardian]], [[public relations]] practitioner Company Director and Newspaper Chief Editor. He came to believe that people needed to think through their own decision-making processes rather than just accept the promotions of the press and other interested parties. On 21 July 1923, he founded a club in [[Manchester, England|Manchester]] with the prime purpose to encourage men to listen to many sources before formulating their own opinions, and then to speak their minds to groups of others in a way that would encourage them to listen. The club began as an offshoot of the Manchester [[YMCA]] Businessmen's Speaking Class.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms7157|title=Records of Australian Rostrum Council|website=nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded.jpg|thumb|Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded]]
After the first meeting under a [[taxus|yew]] tree at [[Listed buildings in Mottram St Andrew|Greendale Farm]] near Manchester, meetings for YMCA members were held on Wednesday evenings in the local YMCA building. In 1924 a young Australian Engineer training in Manchester, [[Alan Crook]] (later MBE), joined Rostrum while studying at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]]. The following year he returned to Australia.

===1930s===
[[File:Rostrum Club 1 August 1930 Pilgrimage to Speaker's Rock.jpg|thumb|Rostrum Club 1, July 1931 Pilgrimage to Speaker's Rock, Back Row: s c Robertson, C M Purnell, J G Hardman, Stuart McPhee, NC Burgess, Hilton Gordon, R Noble, Robert Swainson, A C Stiles, Edgar Barratt, Fred Seasons. Front Row: Jack Caffin, Charles Claiton, Alan Crook]]
Crook, with the help of Robert Swainson and Stuart McPhee, formed a Rostrum Club in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]].&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"/&gt; It was founded on 21 July 1930, coincidentally exactly seven years after the original club. It was founded under an [[Angophora]] tree on the shores of [[Middle Harbour]] in Sydney. Alan Crook was the first President and Robert Swainson the Critic.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rostrum.com.au/about-us|title=Rostrum Australia - About Rostrum Public Speaking|first=|last=|website=www.rostrum.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Manchester Club, this was a dinner club. In November 1931, "Luncheon Club No.1" was formed, Alan Crook again being the first President.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; "No.2 Luncheon Club" was formed in July 1932, No.3 in July 1933 and No.4 Club in July 1934. The original club was given the name of "Foundation Club".

In May 1934, Alan Crook went to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] for a holiday and formed a Rostrum Club which a few months later, together with the then five Sydney Clubs, became the first Dais (regional council). Fred Seamons was the first President and held this office for 15 years. A second Rostrum club was formed in Melbourne in July 1935 and the Victorian clubs then formed their own Dais.

On the evening of 3 December 1935, George McNicholl, Treasurer of the [[Melbourne Water|Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works]] and Chairman of the [[Governance Institute of Australia|Australian Institute of Secretaries]] (AIS), moved a very gracious vote of thanks to a guest speaker from the SA branch of the AIS. Afterwards, some SA residents present asked McNicholl how he became to be such a good speaker. He told them about Rostrum. This discussion lead to the first [[South Australia]]n meeting. It was held in [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] on 18 February 1936 in the inner suburb of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829180918/http://www.sa.rostrum.asn.au/hist.htm|title=Rostrum SA - About Us - History|date=29 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Alan Crook took a business trip to [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] and during this trip, he initiated [[Queensland, Australia|Queensland]]'s first club on 6 May 1937. By November that year Brisbane's second club was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/community/display/100212-founding-of-the-first-rostrum-club-in-brisbane-/photo/1|title=Founding of the First Rostrum Club in Brisbane  - Monument Australia|first=UBC Web|last=Design|website=monumentaustralia.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rostrum Speakers Rock Middle Harbour MAP.001.jpg|thumb|Rostrum Australia was started under an Angophora Tree at the junction of Rocky Creek and Middle Harbour Creek, by Speakers Rock.]]
An Australian Rostrum Council was established on 5 January 1938, bringing together the state Daises. Fred Seamons was the President for the first eight years. Alan Crook served as Secretary for 27 years until his death on 9 August 1965.

By the end of the 1930s there were many Rostrum clubs throughout NSW, Victoria, SA and Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Rostrum In Australia 1930-1965, Alan Milston, Rostrum Australia, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
Rostrum in Australia took a while to spread further west and south, as [[World War II]] curtailed expansion. The first club in [[Tasmania, Australia|Tasmania]] started in 1947 and [[Western Australia]]'s first club was founded on 21 May 1948.
[[File:AGH Rostrum Constitution Changi 1.jpg|thumb|AGH Rostrum Constitution Changi - Page 1]]
However, there was some growth to the north, with the [[AGH Rostrum Club at Changi|AHG Rostrum Club]] running in the Changi POW camp from 1943 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/search?/Yrostrum&amp;SORT=D&amp;submit=Submit/Yrostrum&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=rostrum/1,79,79,B/frameset&amp;FF=Yrostrum&amp;SORT=D&amp;submit=Submit&amp;6,6,|title=State Library of South Australia / All Locations|website=www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papers of Private TH (Bill) Hadden, Australian War Memorial  https://www.awm.gov.au/advanced-search?query=hadden%20rostrum&amp;collection=true&amp;facet_type=Private%20Record&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
The second Rostrum Club in the UK was started in 1951. By this time, there were nearly 100 Rostrum Clubs in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rostrum.com.au/nsw/how-to-join/a-short-history|title=Rostrum Australia - About Rostrum Public Speaking|first=|last=|website=www.rostrum.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking clubs were not as popular in the UK as in Australia, the main speaking club group there at the time, [[Toastmasters]] had only six clubs before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171803/http://www.clarkstonspeakersclub.org.uk/page20/page20.html|title=Club History|date=24 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACT's first club was founded on 3 March 1953.

In 1956, the Secretary of the Victorian Dias, Jo Davis, began a speaking competition for Victorian members. This competition later took his name as the "Jo Davis Cup" after his death in 1964.

In the late '50s, a Dais was formed for the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]].&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms4963|title=Records of Australian Rostrum ACT Dais|website=nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Dais went on to include clubs from nearby parts of NSW.

A book titled ''Rostrum in Victoria: 1934-1959'' by RE Tonkin was released by the Victorian Dais around this time.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au|title=NLA Home - National Library of Australia|website=www.nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
The 1960s were a time of rapid growth in the organisation in the ACT and surrounds. Five new clubs became established there during this time.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

''Take the Chair'', a book on meeting procedure was written for Rostrum by WA members Cecil Carr and Alan Foyster in 1962. The book sold over 90,000 copies in Australia between its release and 1990, when it was rewritten.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902115203/http://wa.rostrum.com.au/Publications/|title=Publications — Rostrum|date=2 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Alan Crook died, shortly after receiving an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his work establishing Australian Rostrum.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

''Have something to say: a text book for public speakers'' was written in 1969 by ACT member Laurie Burgess.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

''Chairmanship and Public Speaking'' was written for Rostrum in the 1960s by NSW member Evan Bowen-Thomas.

===1970s===
[[File:Rostrum Voice of Youth 1976.jpg|thumb|Rostrum Voice of Youth 1976 Advertisement ]]
Various levels of Australian Rostrum ran youth competitions in the early 1970s. In 1974, the various NSW local competitions were combined into a statewide "Voice of Youth" competition. In 1975, Voice of Youth went national, the first national final being held in Canberra. This competition continues today.

1974 saw the creation of the "ACT Rostrum Critics Club", a group devoted to improving critiques in the ACT.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au1"/&gt;

Until 1978, Rostrum in Australia was restricted to men but in that year, the national constitution was changed to allow the entry of women. However, women could not become a member without the Dais council in their state or territory also changing their rules to allow it. Within a few months there were female members in all states except Western Australia, which remained male only until 1986.

Also in 1978, a new club was founded in the UK – [[Rochdale]] Rostrum.

The release of "History of ACT Rostrum" by Roy Ayrton and Tom Trebilco was another 1978 event.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt; Tom was later awarded an MBE for his Rostrum work.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

===1980s===
The first "Sidney Wicks Speaking Competition" was held in Sydney in 1980 to celebrate 50 years of Rostrum in Australia. It was won by David Mead from WA. The competition is also known as the "National Rostrum Speaking Competition" and "Sidney Wicks Trophy".

1984 saw Victorian member David Shaw write ''Towards Better Meetings''.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

In 1985 Rostrum Victoria celebrated its Golden Jubilee with a dinner at the National Gallery of Victoria and other celebrations.

Western Australian clubs began to admit women in 1986.

Also in 1986, NSW member John White and WA President David Julian Price released the first version of Rostrum's current curriculum standard, the "Personal Development Program" (then "Member's Development Program").&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org1"/&gt;

''Brighter Rostrum meetings: how to make your Rostrum Club meetings more interesting'' (edited by George Shaw) and ''History of ACT Rostrum, Club 8, 1965-1986'' (by Eric Martin and Don Clark) were yet more Rostrum titles released in 1986.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

1987 saw Rostrum release the book ''Excellence for Communicators'' by Laurie Burgess.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt; The then Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]], wrote the foreword.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

This book was followed in 1988 by ''How Do I?'',&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt; and the South Australian "Word master: word a day calendar: a vocabulary expander concept".&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

The second Sidney Wicks competition was held in Canberra in August 1988 during the Australian Bicentenary celebrations, and was won by Bill Smith from WA. It was held in conjunction with a national conference entitled "Speak up Australia", held at the [[Australian Academy of Science]]'s "Shine Dome". The conference was joint project of Australian Rostrum and the Penguin Club of Australia, aimed to promote oral communication, especially to children.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"/&gt;
In 1989, the book ''A Critic's Bag of Remedies'' was produced by WA members.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1990, a new version of popular ''Take the Chair'' (rewritten by Rostrum WA members David Julian Price, Harold Luxton and Bill Smith) was released.&lt;ref name="archive.org1"/&gt;

1990 also saw NSW member Alan Milston release the history ''Rostrum in Australia 1930-1965''.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

In 1993, Australian Rostrum declared [[Robyn Williams]] "Speaker of the Year".

Sydney hosted the third Sidney Wicks competition in 1994. The winner was Brian Gillespie of Queensland Rostrum.

Also in 1994, Bert Crummer wrote the 84 page book ''A brief history of Rostrum Club No. 3 (Brisbane)''.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt;

In 1997, [[New Zealand]] Rostrum declared Peter Biggs "Speaker of the Decade". Also in that year, ''Not to be silent: a history of Rostrum in Tasmania'' was written by Malcolm Grant, ''Meetings Made Easy'' (a revised version of ''Towards Better Meetings'') was produced by Arthur Martin for Rostrum Victoria,&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt; and South Australian member Ron Johnson released ''Tips on Public Speaking and Meeting Procedure''.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au3"&gt;[http://librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au Libraries Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth Sidney Wicks competition was held in Hobart on 7 August 1999 in conjunction with the first Rostrum National Convention. The winner was Andrew Dickson from the ACT zone.

===2000s===
2000 saw the release of ''The torch of truth and freedom: the South Australian Rostrum history, 1936-1999'' by Colin Chiverton,&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au2"/&gt; and ''Tips on Public Speaking and Meeting Procedure: Volume 2'' by Ron Johnson.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au3"/&gt;

In 2005 the fifth Sidney Wicks competition was held in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] on 15 October at the National Convention celebrating 75 years of Rostrum in Australia. The winner was Clarrie Pryor from Tasmania.

In 2005, there were over 140 clubs in Australia, collectively containing nearly 1700 members. There is currently one small club in Manchester, England. The sole remaining club in New Zealand, in Wellington, is at present in recess.

Over 3000 students participate in the Voice of Youth each year, covering over 500 schools.

In 2011 the sixth Sidney Wicks competition was held in Adelaide South Australia in October in conjunction with the National Convention.  The winner was Jenny Blain of Malvern Rostrum Club 45 in Victoria.

The seventh Sidney Wicks competition was held in Brisbane in conjunction with the annual Australian Rostrum Council conference and the forty third Voice of Youth National finals in late July 2017.  The winner was Rob Ellison of Carnegie Rostrum Club 68 in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rostrum.com.au/newsletters/650-rostrum-taking-action-30-august-2017/file | title=Rostrum Taking Action | date=30 August 2017 | ISSN=2207-7448 | volume=5 | series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and territory competitions==
Each year clubs in Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory hold inter club regional competitions which lead into state wide competitions.

These typically determine the Speaker of the Year for the state or territory.  In Victoria the competition is called the state Jo Davis Cup in recognition of a previous active and respected member.

The national Sydney Wicks competition is held between representatives of the State and Territory Rostrum Zones every 5 to 7 years as part of an annual Australian Rostrum Council conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4575">'''Beverly Whipple''' is Professor Emerita at Rutgers University and a professional author and [[Sexology|sexologist]]. She is a co-author of the publication ''[[The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality]].''

Following a career in [[nursing]], much of her academic work has been concerned with the enhancement of female sexual function. In 1981, she was co-author of ''Addiego et al.'''s "[[Female ejaculation]]: a case study." The paper was presented in ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]'' and includes the first published instance of the term "[[G-Spot]]".&lt;ref name="Addiego"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Addiego, F |author2=Belzer, EG |author3=Comolli, J |author4=Moger, W |author5=Perry, JD |author6=Whipple, B. |year =1981|title =Female ejaculation: a case study. |journal =Journal of Sex Research |volume =17 |issue =1|pages =13–21 |doi =10.1080/00224498109551094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the book, Whipple continued to publicize her work, including a 9 min video made in 1981 ''Orgasmic Expulsions of Fluid in the Sexually Stimulated Female''.&lt;ref&gt;Whipple, Beverly (consultant), Schoen, Mark (filmmaker). "Orgasmic expulsions of fluid in the sexually stimulated female." Film available from Focus International, Inc., 1776 Broadway, New York, N.Y.10019.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the ''Journal of Sex Research'' described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as 'heated'.&lt;ref name=heath&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heath D |title=An investigation into the origins of a copious vaginal discharge during intercourse: "Enough to wet the bed" – that "is not urine" |journal=J.

Her techniques include using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI scans]] to gather evidence on what is happening in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Godson, Suzi. ''Sex on the brain'' The Times 15 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[animal experiments]] contributed to the isolation of the [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]]&lt;ref&gt;[[The Independent]] ''Thrill cuts out the middle man'' 8 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery that [[orgasm]]s can be rerouted to the brain via the [[vagus nerve]] without using the spinal cord,&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Letts]] ''Thrill pill threatens role of men'' [[The Times]] 8 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; thus enabling females with [[spinal cord injury]] to achieve orgasm by psychological stimulation alone.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Komisaruk, B. |author2=Whipple, B. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Functional MRI of the brain during orgasm in women|journal=Annual Review of Sex Research|volume= 16 |issue= |pages= 62–86|year=2005 |pmid= |doi=|accessdate=January 3, 2012|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/302148/Functional-MRI-of-the-Brain-During-Orgasm-In-Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Grey has asked "I would like to prevent the use of my full name on the page to bring the article in alignment with the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons." Please do not add it per [[WP:BLPPRIVACY]] --&gt;
'''CGP Grey''' is an American–Irish [[educational entertainment|educational]] [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] and [[podcast]]er who has been posting on YouTube under the channel ''CGP Grey'' since 12 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey/about|title=CGP Grey/about|via=YouTube|access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey also posts videos on his secondary channel, ''CGPGrey2'', and livestreams gameplay on another channel, ''CGP Play''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey2|title=CGPGrey2|via=YouTube|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSBv-iml0SCoAE-6v2ReWQ|title=CGPPlay|via=YouTube|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His YouTube channel mainly features short explanatory videos on varying subjects, including politics, geography, economics, history, and culture. The channel's most popular video is an explanation of the [[terminology of the British Isles]], which went [[Viral video|viral]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. G. P. Grey|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CQ3qWgH4B0|title=One Year &amp; 100,000 Subscribers Later (Thank You!)|via=YouTube|work=CGP Grey|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey's videos have since received increasing attention, and have been reviewed in several publications, including ''[[Business Insider]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

In addition to video production, Grey is known for creating the audio podcast ''[[Hello Internet]]'' in 2014 with fellow educational YouTuber [[Brady Haran]]. Since 2015, he has also hosted the audio podcast ''Cortex'' with [[Myke Hurley]] of [[Relay FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hackett |first=Stephen |date=2 June 2015 |title=Introducing Relay FM's 2015 Summer Pilots |url=http://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2015/6/2/relay-fm-2015-summer-pilots |publisher=Relay FM |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell|Philipp Dettmer]] and Dave Wiskus, Grey started the company Standard Broadcast LLC, which provides production and administrative support to digital creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Standard|url=https://standard.tv/pages/about|website=Standard.tv|publisher=Standard Broadcast LLC|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Grey grew up in the [[Long Island]] suburbs of New York City. He went to college in [[upstate New York]], earning two degrees – one in physics and another in sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A With Grey for 500,000 Subscribers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOiIxqcbzyM|via=YouTube|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His grandmother was born in Ireland, and when he was a child, his father had applied for [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]] on his behalf; Grey thus has dual American–Irish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#26: Pick your Poison|url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/26|website=Relay.FM|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled him to look into opportunities in the European Union, and its largest city, London. He later said that if he did not live abroad while "still free of life's anchors", he never would, which made it all the more reason for him to go. He attended a masters in economics program in London, and stayed in the city for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="qa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K63ZKa_tt3s&amp;ab_channel=CGPGrey|title=Q&amp;A With Grey #3: Millenia of Human Attention|via=YouTube|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey decided to become a physics teacher in the UK; he went through a one-year course to earn a physics [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]], and graduated being qualified to teach physics in England and Wales. He taught on and off until his career as a YouTube creator became reliable. Since January 2014 he has co-hosted a general discussion podcast, ''[[Hello Internet]]'', and began a second podcast, ''[[Cortex (podcast)|Cortex]]'' with [[Myke Hurley]] of [[Relay FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.I. #10: Two Dudes Talking|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/10|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Videos==

The YouTube channel ''CGP Grey'' features, among other things, ''Grey Explains'', a series of explanatory videos&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite web|author=Allegra Tepper|url=http://mashable.com/2012/07/24/youtube-tough-topics/|title=These 10 Videos Turn Tough Topics into Child's Play, 7. C.G.P. Grey: Copyright: Forever Less One Day|publisher=Mashable|date=24 July 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a range of subjects, including politics, [[geography]], economics, and [[British culture]]. The videos feature Grey narrating over animations, stock footage, and still photographs. While nearly all of Grey's videos feature his voice, his face has never been shown in his videos, and Grey almost always has his face obscured when appearing in other people's videos;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Veritasium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnrdqCQuwK8|title=Science YouTubers Unite! feat. ... CGP Grey|via=YouTube|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he generally uses a stick figure with glasses to represent himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Numbers confuse Americans – Numberphile|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBbBbY4qvv4|publisher=Numberphile (YouTube)|accessdate=7 November 2013|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His videos also often include hidden links,&lt;ref name=everyatheistneeds&gt;{{cite web|author1=Godless Mom|title=Every Atheist Needs: CGP Grey|url=http://godlessmom.com/every-atheist-needs-cgp-grey/|website=Godless Mom|accessdate=27 January 2015|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; often leading to [[Monty Python]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CGP Grey: Government of the City of London|url=http://politicsisstupid.com/link/324953|website=Politics is Stupid|accessdate=27 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713085352/http://politicsisstupid.com/link/324953|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey has stated that the presentation style of his videos is influenced by that of [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw|Yahtzee Croshaw]]'s ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' series.&lt;ref name="H.I. #13: Nobody Owns the Facts"&gt;{{cite podcast|last2=Grey|first2=CGP|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|title=Nobody Owns the Facts|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/13|work=Hello Internet|number=13|publisher=Hellointernet.fm|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/10 |title=Cortex #10: Zero Artistic Skills |website=Cortex |publisher=Relay FM |host=Grey, C. G. P.; Hurley, Myke |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey records his voice over the music playing in the background on [[Logic Pro]] X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/status/452850062847381504|title = Twitter / cgpgrey: Finally getting the hang of...|date = 6 April 2014|accessdate = 17 July 2014|website = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The backing music of his early videos is usually credited to [[Kevin MacLeod (composer)|Kevin MacLeod]]. Since 2016, most videos contain music written by David Rees. He used to use [[Inkscape]] to make the key frames of his videos and [[Final Cut Pro X]] to edit them together from 2010 to early 2016; but now he uses [[Adobe After Effects]] to do both. The switch is primarily because he now works with other animators on most of his videos, and they use After Effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grey|first1=CGP|last2=Hurley|first2=Myke|title=Cortex Episode #41: Spiralling|url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/41|website=Relay FM|publisher=Relay FM|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos are released on the channel significantly less frequently than other YouTube channels; Grey has said that this is due to thorough research and scriptwriting, with the majority of videos never being finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlsU_YT9n_g#t=156|title = Q&amp;A with Grey No. 2 (One Million Subscribers)|date = 20 November 2013|accessdate = 17 July 2014|via = YouTube|publisher = CGP Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey's video that debunks popular misconceptions has been featured on [[CBS]],&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|author=Bailey Johnson|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-57364879-10391705/eskimos-to-not-have-100s-of-words-for-snow-and-other-myths-debunked/|title=Eskimos do not have 100's of words for snow, and other myths debunked|publisher=CBS|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has his video about the history of the [[British Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-become-a-british-monarch-and-why-it-wont-be-you/ | title=How to become a British monarch and why it won't be you | publisher=CBS | date=17 July 2013 | accessdate=16 October 2016 | author=Savage, Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two videos differentiate London, England and the [[City of London]], while explaining certain oddities that arise from the ancient customs of the latter.&lt;ref name="CBSLondon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kieth Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/287001/learn-about-london-inside-london|title=Learn about the London inside London|publisher=IT World|date=23 July 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GizmodoLondon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Gibbs|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2012/09/how-to-become-the-lord-mayor-of-the-secret-city-of-london/|title=How to Become the Lord Mayor of the (Secret) City of London|publisher=Gizmodo UK|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two videos explaining copyright law and the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] have been featured on [[Mashable]].&lt;ref name=Mash/&gt; The channel has also explained the economic disadvantages of US [[Penny (United States coin)|one-cent coins]], in a video titled ''Death to Pennies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Beth Quirk|url=http://consumerist.com/2012/01/making-a-case-against-pennies-can-be-informative-and-funny.html|title=The Case Against Pennies Might Make You Want To Send Yours Back To Uncle Sam For Something Useful|publisher=Consumerist|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSDTP&gt;{{cite web|author=Bailey Johnson|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-57333884-10391705/death-to-pennies/|title=Death to Pennies|work=The Feed Blog|publisher=CBS|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other videos, including ''How to Become Pope,'' have received media attention and used in instructional settings.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron Blake|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/25/why-is-the-pope-always-so-old-video/|title=Why is the pope always so old?

Several videos under the collective name "Politics in the Animal Kingdom" explain some differences between various election procedures, and are critical of [[first-past-the-post voting]] ([[gerrymandering]], [[minority rule]], lack of [[Condorcet winner]], [[two-party system]], [[spoiler effect]]) and discuss the advantages of the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]], [[mixed-member proportional representation]], and the [[single transferable vote]].

Grey's video ''Humans Need Not Apply'' was positively covered by ''[[Business Insider]]''&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider"&gt;{{cite web |last = Love |first = Dylan |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/humans-need-not-apply-video-2014-8 |title = Not Even Doctors And Lawyers Are Safe From Machines Taking Their Jobs |work = Business Insider |date = 13 August 2014 |accessdate = 23 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/18/robots-steal-your-job_n_5687541.html|title=Why Robots Will Steal Your Job, In One Brutal 15 Minute Video|date=18 August 2014|work=HuffPost|access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video on his ''CGPGrey2'' YouTube channel, published 14 September 2018, CGP Grey announced he was "taking a step back" from internet consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2VxeIm1no|title=Thinking about attention – walk with me|via=YouTube|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campus Compact''' is a coalition of [[University President|college and university presidents]], committed to fulfilling the public purposes of [[higher education]].  Nearly 1,100 educational institutions, more than a third of all higher education providers in [[the United States]], are members.

The non-profit comprises a national office located in Boston, MA as well as state and regional compact offices to support the work of member colleges. Campus Compact has members mostly throughout the United States, but also has members in many [[US Territories]] and countries outside of the US as well. 

{{TOC left}}

== History ==

The Compact was co-founded in 1985 by the presidents of [[Brown university|Brown]], [[Georgetown university|Georgetown]] and [[Stanford university|Stanford]] universities, and [[Frank Newman (educator)|Frank Newman]], the former president of the [[Education Commission of the States]].

Initially, the work of the Compact focused on engaging students in [[community service]].  Media coverage at the time portrayed college-age students as part of a 'me generation', more interested in increasing their wealth and status than serving their community.  The founding presidents aimed to counteract this prevailing image, by showcasing the good work college students were already and providing support and encouragement for others to participate.

In 1988, the first two state Compact affiliates were formed to provide greater support to campuses and build regional and local networks.

In 1991, membership had reached 500 colleges and universities.  By this time, national attention had turned to the connection between participation in community service and academic achievement.  Campus Compact launched the Integrating Service with Academic Study (ISAS) initiative, which funded grants and workshops to support colleges interested in building [[service-learning]] into their institutions.

By 2000, service-learning had become an increasingly important educational movement.  Campus Compact began a series of publications that documented the effects of service learning and provided resources to help faculty and departments build their own programs and curricula.

In 2002, Campus Compact launched the Raise Your Voice campaign, the Compact's first national effort to work with students themselves.  Over the two years of the campaign, the participation of more than 250,000 students was documented.

In 2005, the 20th year of its existence, Campus Compact had grown to 32 state affiliates and more than 1000 member campuses.

Over time, the Compact has grown from a presidents' organization to one that supports the work of a variety of constituencies - college presidents, faculty, staff, students and community partners.

In 2009, Campus Compact moved its national office from the campus of [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to the [[Downtown Crossing]] district of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. They share an office building with the [[New England Board of Higher Education]].

In 2016, Campus Compact celebrated their 30th anniversary and circulated an [http://compact.org/actionstatement/ Action Statement]. This commitment of more than 400 college and university presidents expressed shared goals and enhanced action throughout the network regarding the public purpose of higher education.

Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Her first two books, ''[[Children's Past Lives]]'' ([[Bantam Books|Bantam]], 1997) and ''Return from Heaven'' ([[HarperCollins]], 2001), about reincarnation, have been published in more than twenty three foreign languages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Bowman has also been a practicing [[past life regression]] therapist for adults for more than twenty-five years and conducts training courses to teach practicing  therapists her method of past life regression therapy.  She studied with pioneers Morris Netherton and [[Roger Woolger]] in the field of past life regression, and holds an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[counseling]] from [[Villanova University]], after [[graduating]] from [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] in [[Boston]].

She has been a leading spokesperson for children's past lives since the publication of her books.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} She has appeared on many TV and radio programs, including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'', ''ABC Primetime'', "The Katie Couric Show", and ''The Art Bell Show'', as well as shows on [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[Discovery Channel]] and the [[BBC]].

'''Cherie Kluesing''' was an American [[landscape architect]], designer, and educator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Leonie|date=Spring–Summer 1990|title=A Tribute to Cherie L. Kluesing|url=|journal= Public Art Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She received a Boston Society of Landscape Architects award in 1988 for her restoration plan for [[Fredrick Law Olmsted]]'s [[Buttonwood Park Historic District|Buttonwood Park]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She wrote extensively on land art and landscape architecture, and was known for her advocacy for integrating art works and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CHERIE KLUESING, FORMER PROFESSOR, BELMONT LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT; AT 43|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8130270.html|accessdate=8 March 2016|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=July 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Kluesing lived in various locations in the Midwest during her formative years. Her parents, Byron and Ginger, had two other later offspring, John and Nancy. The near Kluesing family was composed of siblings John, Alvin, Peter, Olga and Herman. Byron, Cherie's father, was a child of John's first wife along with Alvin and Millie. Cherie often mentioned the childhood influences of her great uncle Herman Kluesing, great aunt Olga Ryan and aunt Marylin Duke (daughter of Peter). Herman, an interior designer, created a sketch of World War I that is reputedly part of the Louvre's collection. Childless, Herman spent time with Marylin Duke, as well as John's other stepchildren Connie Springborn and Lucy Ihrcke. Olga was a milliner (hat designer) and Marylin Duke was a costume designer.  Connie Springborn worked briefly for Marylin Duke who influenced her to attend art school at [[McMurry University|McMurry College]]. She later completed her studies at the Museum School at [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston's Museum of Fine Arts]]. Cherie and her aunt Connie met later (c1983) and formed a familial and artistic bond.

==Education==
Kluesing received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the [[Bradley University]] in 1969 under the tutelage of Nita Sunderland and others. She continued her studies at [[Temple University]], [[Tyler School of Art]]. With the Creative and Performing Arts fellowship, she received her Masters of Landscape Architecture degree from [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1978 along with the Outstanding Graduate Student Award from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]]. Her thesis focused on Allerton Park in Monticello IL, a 1,517 acre former estate that is now a National Historic Place. Her thesis dealt with issues of art in the landscape and [[historic preservation]], two topics that became central to her practice in later life.

==Teaching==
Chair Robert Riley and Natalie Alpert recognized the promise Kluesing offered and brought her on as part of the faculty upon her graduation.  Kluesing began teaching as an assistant professor at the [[Department of Landscape Architecture UIUC|Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois]] (1978 to 1982) where she served as Chair of the Lorado Taft Lecture Committee from 1981 to 1982 and received the Outstanding Educator Award from the [http://thecela.org/ Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture] (CELA) in 1981.  She moved on the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) an assistant professor from 1982 - 1985 where she taught with [[Laurie Olin]], [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]], Carl Steinitz and [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]].

==Professional work==
Kluesing was exposed to landscape architecture while working for Barton-Ashman Associates in Evanston IL from 1973 to 1975 where she contributed primarily as a graphic designer on urban redevelopment planning projects prior to attending the University of Illinois.  Kluesing began professional practice with Walker Design Group in Urbana, Illinois in 1979.  She became a partner with Walker-Kluesing Design Group as the office moved from Belmont MA to Boston MA in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landecker|first=Heidi|date=October 1989|title=In Memoriam|url=|journal=Landscape Architecture|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work focused on a mix of institutional, commercial, corporate and public work, with the latter focusing primarily on large historic parks.

A '''Computationally enhanced craft item''' (CETI) is a simple [[mechanical device]] that is fitted with a small computer or [[computer interface]] and a [[Servomechanism|servo system]]. A larger computer programs or directly controls the CETI according to the wishes of the user-programmer. CETIs are educational devices, but they can possibly provide guidance towards a future of user-programmable robots and [[ubiquitous computing]]. Tom Wrensch was one of the earliest proponents of CETI.

== History ==
A Department of Military Science existed at King's College London from 1848 to 1859. Military Science was subsequently approved as a subject for the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science general degrees from 1913, and was taught under the Faculty of Arts and also the Faculty of Engineering.

In 1926 the intervention of William Norton Medlicott prevented the Department of History from ridding itself of the lectureship in Military History.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=66374&amp;back=&lt;/ref&gt; With [[War Office]] support the Military Studies Department was established in 1926 and formed part of the Faculty of Arts, with Major General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Sir Frederick Barton Maurice]] holding the Chair. It became known as the War Studies Department in 1943 but was discontinued in 1948, although the subject continued to be taught under the Department of Medieval and Modern History.

Following the [[World War II]], there was an initiative by senior members of [[University of London]] notably [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]], [[Charles Webster (historian)|Sir Charles Webster]] and [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]], to revive Military Studies at the University. In 1953, [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]] was appointed to the Lectureship in Military Studies, and by 1962 Sir Michael was able to reinstate the Department of War Studies to offer postgraduate courses.

A Bachelor of Arts degree in War Studies was offered from 1992 onwards. The department became part of the School of Humanities in 1989 and the School of Social Science and Public Policy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/k/10ki4655 |title=King's College London: Department of War Studies Records |publisher=King's Collections |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121043821/http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/k/10ki4655 |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the department celebrated its 50th anniversary, with a series of celebratory events to mark the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2012/01Jan/War-Studies-celebrates-50-years.aspx |title=  War Studies celebrates 50 years|publisher=King's College London |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3781">'''Education City Karachi''' is a precinct of educational facilities from school age to research level encompassing branch campuses of leading national and international institutions, along the lines of [[Dubai International Academic City]] and [[Education City| Education City Qatar]]

==History== 
The idea of an Education City had been proposed by the [[Sindh]] cabinet on October 16, 2001. It was revived in 2004, when the provincial Chief Secretary directed the city government to prepare a map indicating the boundaries of the project site, categories of allotments, lease period, roads, amenity plots, etc., in order to get the project under way. The city will be located on 8,000 acres of Deh Chuhar, a strip of land linking [[National Highways of Pakistan|National Highway]] and [[Super Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/370338 Dawn September 13, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast forward to 2013 and a number of institutions have express an interest in setting up campuses with this precinct. They are the [[Aga Khan University]] Hospital, [[Sindh Institute of Urology &amp; Transplantation]], Quaid-e-Azam Public School (a project of [[Sindh Madressa]] Board), [[Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology]], [[Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology]], [[Ziauddin University]], [[Habib University]] Foundation, Newports Institute of Communication and Economics, [[Dow University of Health Sciences]] and the Judicial Academy of Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/607753/karachi-education-city-a-project-that-can-set-off-an-era-of-prosperity/ Tribune  September 22, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Education City Board constituted a 5 member core committee to oversee development works, audit and financial matters and human resources, and a finance committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.com.pk/03-Apr-2014/master-plan-for-education-city-at-malir-okayed The Nation April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that the $800 million is to be spent on the infrastructure development of the Education City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/157247-Education-Citys-infrastructure-work-to-begin-soon The News October 15, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sindh Board of Investment which appears to have responsibility for the project, has said that the provincial government would start construction work on the Education City project from January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/11/18/sindh-to-start-work-on-education-city-in-2018/  Pakistan Today NOVEMBER 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NED University of Engineering and Technology]] is the first institution to be allocated a site in Education City to establish a campus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pakobserver.net/ned-university-establish-campus-karachi-education-city/ Pakistan Observer Accessed 13 December 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2017, the Chief Minister of Sindh [[Syed Murad Ali Shah|Murad Ali Shah]] offered to give land to build a Catholic University on Link Road in Education City to the Archbishop of Karachi [[Joseph Coutts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicsinpakistan.org/chief-minister-sindh-assures-land-catholic-university/ Catholics in Pakistan website Accessed 17 December 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the foundation stone laying ceremony of [[Sindh Madressatul Islam University]], Malir Campus at the Education City was announced. This first phase of the development is expected to cost of Rs. 1.57 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nation.com.pk/24-Dec-2017/main-campus-of-smiu-to-be-built-in-education-city-malir The Nation December 24, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Voice of America]] featured a four-part series in September 2012 "on keeping traditions alive", reporting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"United States Representative [[Heather Wilson]] of New Mexico wrote the bill to help stop American Indian languages from disappearing.  She says languages are an important part of American heritage and, once lost, will never be recovered.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The purpose of the law is to help keep Native American languages alive through [[language immersion]] programs.   In immersion programs, the native language is used most of the time to teach different subjects and to communicate with students.&lt;ref name = "voiceofamerica"&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==
In December 2006, US H.R. 4766, the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act, was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]], becoming Public Law No: 109-394. It authorized funding for new programs for tribes to prevent the loss of heritage and culture.&lt;ref name = "nativeamaffairs"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="thomas"&gt;{{Cite web

A [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] summary describes the types of instruction funded by the act:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amends the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as part of the Native American languages grant program, to make three-year grants for educational Native American [[language nest]]s, survival schools, and [[Language revitalization|restoration programs]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Requires that Native American language nests: (1) provide instruction and child care through the use of a Native American language for at least 10 children under the age of seven for an average of at least 500 hours per year per student; (2) provide classes in such language for the parents of such students; and (3) use such language as the dominant medium of instruction in the nest.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Requires that Native American language survival schools: (1) provide an average of at least 500 hours of instruction per year per student through the use of at least one Native American language for at least 15 students for whom the school is their principal school; (2) develop instructional courses and materials that service the goal of making all students fluent in such a language and proficient in mathematics, reading, and science; (3) provide teacher training; and (4) be located in areas having high concentrations of Native American students. Requires applicants for language survival school funding to have at least three years of experience in running such a school, a Native American language nest, or any other educational program in which instruction is conducted in a Native American language.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Requires that Native American language restoration programs: (1) operate at least one Native American language program for the community they serve; (2) train teachers of such languages; and (3) develop Native American language instructional materials.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012.&lt;ref name ="thomas" /&gt;

According to Willard Gilbert, president of the [[National Indian Education Association]] (NIEA), "There were 175 Native American languages still spoken in 1996.

ECDL / ICDL certification is a globally recognised [[Information and communication technologies in education|information and communication technology]] (ICT) and digital literacy qualification.&lt;ref name=ucl&gt;{{cite web|title=European Computer Driving Licence|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/training/ecdl|work=UCL Information Services Division|publisher=University College London|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the name, there is no difference between ECDL and ICDL and they are recognised as equivalent.&lt;ref name=poulter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulter|first=A.|author2=McMenemy, D.|title=Beyond the European Computer Driving Licence: basic and advanced ICT skills for the new library professional|journal=IFLA Journal|date=1 January 2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=37–46|doi=10.1177/034003520403000107|citeseerx = 10.1.1.140.9351|accessdate=&lt;!-- 29 November 2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ECDL Foundation, over 14 million people in over 100 countries had registered as candidates for ECDL.&lt;ref name=countries&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - ECDL Foundation|url=http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=93&amp;n=94|work=News archive|publisher=ECDL Foundation|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the ECDL certification programme was developed through a task force of the [[CEPIS|Council of European Professional Informatics Societies]] (CEPIS) and was recommended by the [[European Commission]] High Level Group, ESDIS, to be a Europe-wide certification scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Testing ==
In order to take the tests, a candidate buys an ECDL Skills Card, which usually is issued electronically and serves as a login to the testing platform. To prepare for a module test, the candidate may use ECDL diagnostic tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diagnosetest.ch/en/ ECDL site with all diagnostic tests]&lt;/ref&gt; Testing is done using software which simulates the Windows/Microsoft Office environment. The candidate's mouse movements and keystrokes are monitored and the result of the test is reported immediately after the test is completed.&lt;ref name=ucl /&gt;

===New ECDL / ICDL===
Since 2013, the syllabus has been divided into 18 modules on three levels:

* Base Modules
** Computer Essentials
** Online Essentials
** [[Word Processing]]
** [[Spreadsheets]]
** Theory
* Intermediate Modules
** Presentation
** Using [[Database]]s
** IT Security
** Online Collaboration
** Image Editing
** Web Editing
** Project Planning
** 2D Computer Aided Design
** Health Information Systems Usage
** ICT in Education
** Digital Marketing
* Advanced Modules
** Advanced Word Processing
** Advanced Spreadsheets
** Advanced Database
** Advanced Presentation

=== Original ECDL / ICDL ===

Until 2013 the ECDL/ICDL syllabus was divided into seven modules.&lt;ref name=ucl /&gt;&lt;ref name=ver5&gt;{{cite web|title=ECDL/ICDL Syllabus version 5.0|url=http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/media/ECDL_ICDL_Syllabus_Version_51.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214054841/http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/media/ECDL_ICDL_Syllabus_Version_51.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 December 2010|publisher=ECDL Foundation|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

* Using Email and the Internet (Windows Explorer in Windows 7)

Additionally, there was an Advanced version that was divided into four modules. These are:

* Advanced Word Processing
* Advanced Spreadsheets
* Advanced Presentation
* Advanced Database

Many training centres used Microsoft software (the applications used are shown in parenthesis) but other software environments could be used, such as [[Apache OpenOffice]]/[[LibreOffice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">'''Inquiry education''' (sometimes known as the '''inquiry method''') is a student-centered method of [[education]] focused on asking questions.  Students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid giving answers when this is possible, and in any case to avoid giving direct answers in favor of asking more questions.  The method was advocated by [[Neil Postman]] and [[Charles Weingartner]] in their book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''.

==Overview==
The inquiry method is motivated by Postman and Weingartner's recognition that good learners and sound reasoners center their attention and activity on the dynamic process of inquiry itself, not merely on the end product of static knowledge.  They write that certain characteristics are common to all good learners (Postman and Weingartner, 31–33), saying that all good learners have:

:* Self-confidence in their learning ability
:* Pleasure in problem solving
:* A keen sense of relevance
:* Reliance on their own judgment over other people's or society's
:* No fear of being wrong
:* No haste in answering
:* Flexibility in point of view
:* Respect for facts, and the ability to distinguish between fact and opinion
:* No need for final answers to all questions, and comfort in not knowing an answer to difficult questions rather than settling for a simplistic answer

In an attempt to instill students with these qualities and behaviors, a [[teacher]] adhering to the inquiry method in [[pedagogy]] must behave very differently from a traditional teacher.  Postman and Weingartner suggest that inquiry teachers have the following characteristics (pp. 34–37):

:* They avoid telling students what they "ought to know".
:* They talk to students mostly by questioning, and especially by asking [[divergent questions]].
:* They do not accept short, simple answers to questions.
:* They encourage students to interact directly with one another, and avoid judging what is said in student interactions.
:* They do not summarize students' discussion.
:* They do not plan the exact direction of their lessons in advance, and allow it to develop in response to students' interests.
:* Their lessons pose problems to students.
:* They gauge their success by change in students' inquiry behaviors (with the above characteristics of "good learners" as a goal).

'''James Alfred Miller''' (21 September 1944 – 13 February 1982) - in religious '''Leo William''' and known also as '''Santiago''' - was an [[American people|American]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Brother (Christian)|professed religious]] and member of the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]].&lt;ref name=LS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lasalle.org/en/who-are-we/lasallian-holiness/br-santiago-miller/|title=Br.

Miller served as a teacher first in [[Cretin High School]] before being sent to teach in [[Bluefields, Nicaragua|Bluefields]] in [[Nicaragua]] where he remained until his superiors ordered him to leave. He was requested to leave his work in Nicaragua due to political tensions that put Miller at risk of being killed but he was frustrated to be sent back to his native home where he remained for some time to teach.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TQ&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://mcquad.org/2017/02/13/murder-of-a-lasallian-educator-remembering-brother-james-santiago-miller/|title=Murder of a Lasallian Educator: Remembering Brother James Santiago Miller|publisher=The Guadrangle|author=Aaron Mayorga|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his construction and practical abilities to the point where students at Cretin High School referred to him as "Brother Fix-It". Miller was later sent to [[Guatemala]] where he taught and he remained there until he was shot dead while on a ladder. His murder was never resolved despite a long investigation into the assassination.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;&lt;ref name=TQ/&gt;

Miller's beatification process opened in [[Huehuetenango]] on 2 September 2009 - though the cause's formal introduction came on 15 December 2009 - and Miller became titled as a [[Servant of God]].&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;&lt;ref name=WD/&gt; [[Pope Francis]] approved Miller's beatification in late 2018 and it is expected to be celebrated in his native United States sometime in 2019.

==Life==
James Alfred Miller Miller was born [[Premature babies|premature]] on 21 September 1944 to [[farmers]] in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]]. Miller weighed almost four pounds upon birth but later would stand at six feet two inches and weighed 220 pounds.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TQ/&gt; He grew up in [[Custer, Wisconsin|Custer]]. In his adulthood he was noted for having a boisterous [[guffaw]] that could startle people.

Miller first attended grammar school in his area before he entered high school.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; He later joined the [[De La Salle Brothers]] as a [[freshman]] at [[Pacelli High School (Stevens Point, Wisconsin)|Pacelli High School]] and received a [[master's degree]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from [[Saint Mary's University of Minnesota|S.M.U.]] in [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]]. It was while a freshman that he first met the De La Salle Brothers. In September 1959 he entered the juniorate in [[Missouri]] and was then admitted as a [[postulant]] into the order in 1962. He commenced his [[novitiate]] in August 1962 then assumed the [[Religious habit|habit]] and the [[religious name]] "Leo William".&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; But he would later resume using his baptismal name like some of his confreres.

Miller first worked as a teacher in [[Cretin High School]] where he taught Spanish and English in addition to [[religious education]]. It was also there that he oversaw maintenance and coached [[American football|football]]. Miller made his perpetual vows in August 1960.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;

In 1969 he was sent to [[Bluefields]] in [[Nicaragua]] where he taught in schools until 1974 when he was sent to [[Puerto Cabezas]] and helped build an industrial arts and vocational complex. Under his leadership as director the school he taught at managed grew from 300 to 800 students. He also accepted a task of supervising the construction of ten new rural schools.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; But his superiors later ordered him to leave Nicaragua in July 1979 due to the [[Sandinista guerrilla|Sandinistas]] revolution that had broken out. This was also exacerbated due to Miller's distant collaboration with the [[Somoza family|Somoza]] government which placed him in direct risk of being a Sandinistas victim.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; Miller maintained distant ties to the Somoza government because he saw that as a good chance to have the government expand the schools according to his former classmate and confrere Francis Carr. But some residents took his cordial relations with the government as tacit support which came to concern his superiors. This grew after Miller received threats to the point that the Sandinistas placed his name on a list of people to be "dealt with".&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;

But he became worried that his leaving would be seen as an act of cowardice and so wrote to the people to tell them that he would return. But Miller was never to return to Nicaragua which frustrated him. He was frustrated with his time back in his native home and wrote that "I'm bored up here" and that "I am anxious to return to Latin America".&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;

He returned to the [[United States]] where he taught once again at Cretin High School in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in [[Minnesota]] before he returned to teach in [[Central America]] from 1979 to 1981. In 1980 he participated in the De Cristo renewal program in [[New Mexico]]. While teaching he fixed things around the school to the point that the students referred to him as "Brother Fix-It" since he dealt with maintenance issues and was often seen with a [[wrench]] in his hand. He also assisted students who had forgotten their locker combinations.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TQ/&gt; He was later transferred to [[Guatemala]] in January 1981 where he would remain for the remainder of his life teaching in [[Huehuetenango]]. Miller devoted himself to providing job and leadership skills to the natives in order to ease the oppression the native Guatemalan Indians suffered.

Three hooded and masked men shot and killed Miller during the afternoon on 13 February 1982 as the latter was on a ladder repairing a wall at the De La Salle Indian School at Huehuetenango.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; Miller died at the scene and died before he hit the ground. He had sent a student inside to get a tool to aid his work and several children witnessed the murder while watching Miller from a window.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt; Unsuccessful attempts were made to find the assassins and the Guatemalan government expressed regret that the case had dragged on for so long. The government later concluded that "subversive criminal elements" were perhaps responsible for the murder and closed the case.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt; His funeral rites were celebrated in both Guatemala and St. Paul before his remains were interred in the Polonia parish in Wisconsin.

There were some who believed that his murder was in retaliation for the work of the order to prevent native males from being [[Conscription|conscripted]]. Despite students being exempt from armed service four men abducted the native student named Epifanio Camposeco to force him to enter on after seizing him in the Huehuetenango marketplace on 31 January 1982. To that end the religious brother Paul Joslin went to the authorities to obtain the student's release between 31 January and 11 February but failed to do so despite the religious' adamant protests. Joslin later recalled that Miller came to his office hours before his murder (in the morning) to inform him that he would be going on a picnic with his class later that afternoon.

Miller's murder in Guatemala came during a string of priests and religious being assassinated such as [[Stanley Rother|Blessed Stanley Francis Rother]] (five months after Miller).&lt;ref name=TQ/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in Huehuetenango on 2 September 2009 in a diocesan process that later concluded in 2010. This diocesan investigation collected available documentation regarding Miller's life as well as a series of witness testimonies from those who knew Miller. But the formal introduction to the cause came on 15 December 2009 under [[Pope Benedict XVI]] after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared "[[nihil obstat]]" (nothing against the cause) and titled Miller as a [[Servant of God]]. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process on 9 July 2010 in [[Rome]] while later receiving the [[Positio]] dossier for assessment.

Nine theologians that consult the C.C.S. issued unanimous approval to Miller's cause on 20 March 2018. [[Pope Francis]] confirmed Miller's beatification in a decree issued on 7 November 2018; the beatification is set to take place in his native United States sometime in 2019.

The current [[postulator]] for the cause is the De La Salle brother Rodolfo Cosimo Meoli.

==Honors==
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of La Crosse|La Crosse]] diocese sponsors an annual Brother James Miller Social Justice Award. The "Brother James Miller Fund" was established after Miller's death and aims to continue his work for the poor and oppressed.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;

'''Helen Kathleen Ramsay Whyte''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (1909&amp;ndash;1996) was a Scottish embroiderer and teacher of [[textile arts]].

==Early life==
Kathleen Whyte was born in [[Arbroath]], on the east coast of Scotland, in 1909. From 1911 to 1913, and 1920 to 1923, she and her family joined her father who was working in India. The move to [[Jamshedpur]] had a huge impact on the young Kathleen. In particular the rich variety of textiles and brilliant colours made vivid impressions on her. On their return from India, Kathleen attended [[Arbroath High School]]. When at school in Arbroath she followed the curriculum derived from the system published by Anne Macbeth and Margaret Swanson published in their book ''Educational Needlecraft'' in 1911. In her final year she embroidered a huge panel of Saint Elizabeth of Bohemia.

On leaving school Kathleen went to [[Gray's School of Art]] in Aberdeen to follow a Diploma Course in General Design from 1928 to 1932. Amongst other things she studied [[embroidery]] and was strongly influenced by her teacher Dorothy Angus who inspired her with what she later described as, "the vast potential of stitchery".{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} She was a particularly successful student, winning the Founder's Prize as the best student in the second year of the general course, the Alexander Barker Prize as a result of the competition for third year students, and in the fourth year won the Former Students Association Prize for her entry The Fish Wife. In 1932 she was awarded a Diploma in Design and Decorative Art with distinction.

==Teaching==
After a year at Aberdeen Teacher Training College Kathleen became assistant art teacher at Frederick Street School in the East End of [[Aberdeen]]. On leaving Frederick Street in 1940 she taught briefly at the Central Secondary School and then went on the [[Aberdeen High School for Girls]]. As well as teaching children she taught adults in evening classes at the Art School. Later, during the war, she taught service men and women to do leather work.

Kathleen had been making her own clothes since the mid-1920s and in the early 1940s, because of the wartime restrictions, she began [[weaving]] fabric, not only for herself but for her mother, sisters and friends too. Despite the scarcity of material and the clothing coupon limitations she always seemed able to lay her hands on plenty of yarn.

In 1948, on the advice of Mr. D. M. Southerland, Head of Gray's School of Art, and supported by Dorothy Angus, Kathleen successfully applied for the post of embroidery and weaving lecturer at [[Glasgow School of Art]].

This was the time of an embroidery revival in [[Glasgow]]. As Kathleen was making improvements at Glasgow School of Art, the [[Needlework Development Scheme]] was becoming more active and was beginning to make an impact on the wider public. In particular, modern stylish examples of Scandinavian embroidery and weaving were hugely influential. Over some years Kathleen travelled in Scandinavia, visiting weaving and craft centres and developing relationships with leading needle workers and weavers. There were frequent exhibitions of Scandinavian designs throughout Britain, including Glasgow School of Art whose staff and students also visited Denmark. 

The Glasgow School of Art design courses were constantly being improved in response to commercial demands. Kathleen visited several English art schools to assess and evaluate the new Diploma in Art and Design courses they were teaching and was later invited to serve on the Dip AD visiting panel as the embroidery expert. She continued to be extremely influential in the development of higher education courses and became an Art Adviser to the Scottish Education Department, planning new examinations. Three of her former students became heads of the Embroidery Departments at [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]], Gray's School of Art and Glasgow School of Art. In 1969 she was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to Scottish Art Education.

==Commissioned work==
Although honoured for her contribution to education, it is her own distinctive work for which she is best known. Throughout her career she has had many prestigious commissions, including her very well known ecclesiastical work. Many of these were [[pulpit fall]]s and communion cloths undertaken for the [[Church of Scotland]], depicting simple, elegantly stylised religious imagery.

However, her commissions were not limited to those for the church. In 1966 she was commissioned, by the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, through the Scottish Craft Centre, to embroider a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] as a gift for [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]]. The stole was to be presented to the Queen Mother to commemorate her opening the [[Tay Road Bridge]]. This inspired Kathleen to create a design incorporating pearls from the River Tay. These were supplied by a jeweller in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], pierced for sewing, and ranging in size from tiny seeds to 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. The Tay Bridge Stole was worn by Her Majesty and was exhibited at the "Skill" exhibition staged by the [[Institute of Directors]], The Craft Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre in 1968. It was shown again in 1987 in a retrospective exhibition of her work, organised by the Scottish Branch of the Embroiders' Guild and held in the [[Edinburgh College of Art]].

Kathleen's book ''Design in Embroidery'' was published in 1982 and ''Kathleen Whyte Embroiderer'', her biography written by Liz Arthur, was published in 1989.

The work of Kathleen Whyte was featured in "A Scottish Celebration", a touring exhibition of contemporary textiles to mark the centenary of the foundation of the Embroiderers' Guild, which opened at [[Aberdeen Art Gallery]] in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/CouncilNews/ci_cns/pr_embroider_051006.asp?text=small |title=Contemporary textiles on show to mark centenary of Embroiderers' Guild |publisher=Aberdeen City Council |accessdate=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of her work can be found in the [[Royal Museum|Royal Scottish Museum]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], many churches, and in other public and private collections.

The '''Kenya Literature Bureau''' ('''KLB''') is a [[publishing house]] and [[state corporation]] in [[Kenya]] founded in 1947. It is located in South-C off Popo Road in [[Nairobi]].

==History==
KLB was initially established by the [[British High Commission]] in 1947 as the '''East African Literature Bureau''', to publish books for the general public in [[Kiswahili]], [[East African vernacular languages]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="Kenya Hansard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x1SHxxWwrAC&amp;pg=PA809-IA1|accessdate=18 November 2012|volume=LII|year=1980|publisher=Republic of Kenya|pages=811–14|chapter=The Kenya Literature Bureau Bill, 13th May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regional status continued after independence with the establishment of the [[East African Community]] (EAC). In the early 1970s the Bureau published many pioneering anthologies of English-language poetry from East Africa:

'''Kurt Julian Weill''' (March 2, 1900{{spaced ndash}}April 3, 1950) was a German Jewish composer, active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steynonline.com/7344/mack-the-knife "Mack the Knife" – Sinatra Song of the Century #95] by [[Mark Steyn]], December 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with [[Bertolt Brecht]]. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which included the ballad "[[Mack the Knife]]". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose.&lt;ref name="cjschuler.net"&gt;[http://www.cjschuler.net/weill.htm Kurt Weill]. Cjschuler.net. Retrieved on August 22, 2011.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311215544/http://www.cjschuler.net/weill.htm |date=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote several works for the concert hall. He became a United States citizen on August 27, 1943.

==Childhood==
Weill was born on March 2, 1900,&lt;ref name="NYCcyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth T.|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|year=1995|publisher=The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press|location=New York City|isbn=0-300-05536-6| page=1252}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third of four children to Albert Weill (1867–1950) and Emma Weill (née Ackermann; 1872–1955). He grew up in a religious [[Jewish]] family in the "Sandvorstadt", the Jewish quarter in [[Dessau]] in [[Saxony]], where his father was a [[Hazzan|cantor]].&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurt Weill Dead; Composer, Was 50|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1EFD385F177A93C6A9178FD85F448585F9|format=PDF, fee required|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|edition=New York|issn= 0362-4331|oclc=1645522|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|page=28|date=April 4, 1950|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of twelve, Weill started taking piano lessons and made his first attempts at writing music; his earliest preserved composition was written in 1913 and is titled ''Mi Addir. Jewish Wedding Song''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Weill started taking private lessons with Albert Bing, [[Kapellmeister]] at the "Herzogliches Hoftheater zu Dessau", who taught him piano, composition, music theory, and conducting. Weill performed publicly on piano for the first time in 1915, both as an accompanist and soloist. The following years he composed numerous [[Lied]]er to the lyrics of poets such as [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Arno Holz]], and [[Anna Ritter]], as well as a cycle of five songs titled ''Ofrahs Lieder'' to a German translation of a text by [[Yehuda Halevi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, pp. 540–541&lt;/ref&gt;

Weill graduated with an [[Abitur]] from the ''Oberrealschule'' of Dessau in 1918, and enrolled at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Berliner Hochschule für Musik]] at the age of 18, where he studied composition with [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]],&lt;ref name="nytimesobit" /&gt; conducting with Rudolf Krasselt, and counterpoint with Friedrich E. Koch, and also attended philosophy lectures by [[Max Dessoir]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]]. The same year, he wrote his first [[string quartet]] (in B minor).&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, pp. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work and compositions==
Weill's family experienced financial hardship in the aftermath of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a [[répétiteur]] at the Friedrich-Theater under the direction of the new Kapellmeister, [[Hans Knappertsbusch]]. During this time, he composed an [[orchestral suite]] in E-flat major, a [[symphonic poem]] of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s ''The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke'' as well as ''Schilflieder'', a [[song cycle|cycle]] of five songs to poems by [[Nikolaus Lenau]]. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in [[Lüdenscheid]], where he directed opera, operetta, and [[singspiel]] for five months, and also composed a [[cello sonata]] and ''[[Ninon de Lenclos]]'', a now lost [[one-act]] operatic adaptation of a play by [[Ernst Hardt]]. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a couple of months in [[Leipzig]], where his father had become the new director of a Jewish orphanage. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed ''Sulamith'', a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.

==Studies with Busoni==
[[File:Berliner Gedenktafel Altonaer Str 22 (Hansa) Kurt Weill.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Berlin memorial plaque|de|3=Berliner Gedenktafel}}, Berlin-[[Hansaviertel]], Germany]]
Back in Berlin, Weill had an interview with [[Ferruccio Busoni]] in December 1920. After examining some of Weill's compositions, Busoni accepted him as one of five master students in composition at the [[Akademie der Künste|Preußische Akademie der Künste]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, pp. 541–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1921 to December 1923, Weill studied music composition with him and also counterpoint with [[Philipp Jarnach]] in Berlin. During his first year he composed his first [[symphony]], ''Sinfonie in einem Satz'', as well as the lieder ''Die Bekehrte'' ([[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]) and two ''Rilkelieder'' for voice and piano. To support his family in Leipzig, he also worked as a pianist in a Bierkeller tavern. In 1922, Weill joined the [[November Group (German)|November Group]]'s music faction. That year he composed a psalm, a [[divertimento]] for orchestra, and ''Sinfonia Sacra: Fantasia, Passacaglia, and Hymnus for Orchestra''. On November 18, 1922, his children's [[pantomime]] ''Die Zaubernacht'' (''The Magic Night'') premiered at the Theater am Kurfürstendamm; it was the first public performance of any of Weill's works in the field of musical theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of financial need, Weill taught music theory and composition to private students from 1923 to 1925. Among his students were [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Maurice Abravanel]], [[Henry Jolles|Heinz Jolles (later known as Henry Jolles)]],&lt;ref name=Musica&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?sl=de&amp;u=http://www.musica-reanimata.de/komponisten.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Henry%2BJolles%2522%26hl%3Den&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1UGoK2br8M78KPijOJROixgds_w Musica Reanimata of Berlin, Henry Jolles] accessed September 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nikos Skalkottas]]. Arrau, Abravenel, and Jolles remained members of Weill's circle of friends thereafter,&lt;ref name=KWF&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenya|first=Lotte|authorlink=Lotte Lenya|author2=George Davis|date=Spring 1997|title=Weill and His Collaborators|journal=Kurt Weill Newsletter|volume=15|issue=1|pages=4–9|publisher=Kurt Weill Foundation for Music|issn=0899-6407|url=http://www.kwf.org/kwf/images/newsletter/kwn151p1-24.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jolles's sole surviving composition predating the rise of the [[Nazi]] regime in 1933 is a fragment of a work for four pianos he and Weill wrote jointly.&lt;ref name=Musica/&gt;

Weill's compositions during his last year of studies included ''Quodlibet'', an orchestral suite version of ''Die Zaubernacht'', ''Frauentanz'', seven medieval poems for soprano, flute, viola, clarinet, French horn, and bassoon, and ''Recordare'' for choir and children's choir to words from the [[Book of Lamentations]]. Further premieres that year included a performance of his ''Divertimento for Orchestra'' by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] under the direction of [[Heinz Unger]] on April 10, 1923, and the [[Amar Quartet|Hindemith-Amar Quartet]]'s rendering of Weill's ''String Quartet'', Op. 8, on June 24, 1923. In December 1923, Weill finished his studies with Busoni.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, pp. 542–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success in the 1920s and early 1930s==
In 1922 he joined the ''Novembergruppe'', a group of [[leftist]] Berlin artists that included [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Stefan Wolpe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/weill-kurt "Music and the Holocaust"], holocaustmusic.ort.org; retrieved August 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1924 the conductor [[Fritz Busch]] introduced him to the dramatist [[Georg Kaiser]], with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in [[Grünheide]], Weill first met singer/actress [[Lotte Lenya]] in the summer of 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (following their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the '''Kurt Weill Foundation'''. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide ''Der deutsche Rundfunk''. Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton &amp; Schebera, pp. 208–09&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, or the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], Weill tended more and more to vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular with the wider public in Germany at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Weill's music was admired by composers such as [[Alban Berg]], [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and Stravinsky, but it was also criticised by others: by [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], who later revised his opinion, and by [[Anton Webern]].

His best-known work is ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928), a reworking of [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' written in collaboration with [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Engel directed the original production of ''The Threepenny Opera'' in 1928. It contains Weill's most famous song, "[[Mack the Knife]]" ("{{Lang|de|Die Moritat von Mackie Messer}}"). The stage success was filmed by [[G. W. Pabst]] in two language versions: ''[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|Die 3-Groschen-Oper]]'' and ''L'opéra de quat' sous''. Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicised lawsuit—which Weill won and Brecht lost. Weill's working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAweill.htm Kurt Weill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205031534/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAweill.htm |date=December 5, 2013 }}. Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk (April 3, 1950). Retrieved on August 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; after Brecht tried to push the play even further into a left wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to "set the [[Communist Party of Germany|communist party]] manifesto to music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ata-divisions.org/LD/newsletter/2009/2009Source_july3.pdf Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809000749/http://www.ata-divisions.org/LD/newsletter/2009/2009Source_july3.pdf |date=August 9, 2013 }}, ata-divisions.org; accessed June 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris, London and New York==
Weill fled [[Nazi Germany]] in March 1933.&lt;ref name="Mercado"&gt;Mercado, Mario R. ''Kurt Weill: A Guide To His Works'', The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent and popular Jewish composer, Weill was officially denounced for his populist views and sympathies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrencebudmen.com/articles_weill.htmlpopulist influences]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a target of the Nazi authorities, who criticized and interfered with performances of his later stage works, such as ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' (''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny'', 1930), ''[[Die Bürgschaft (opera)|Die Bürgschaft]]'' (1932), and ''[[Der Silbersee]]'' (1933). With no option but to leave Germany, he went first to Paris, where he worked once more with Brecht (after a project with [[Jean Cocteau]] failed) on the ballet ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]''.

On April 13, 1933 his musical ''The Threepenny Opera'' was given its premiere on Broadway, but closed after 13 performances to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="NYCcyclopedia" /&gt; In 1934 he completed his Symphony No. 2, his last purely orchestral work, conducted in Amsterdam and New York by [[Bruno Walter]], and also the music for [[Jacques Deval]]'s play, ''{{ill|Marie Galante (play)|fr|Marie Galante (pièce de théâtre)|lt=Marie Galante}}''.&lt;ref name="Mercado" /&gt; A production of his operetta ''[[Der Kuhhandel]]'' (''A Kingdom for a Cow'') took him to London in 1935, and later that year he went to the United States in connection with ''[[The Eternal Road (opera)|The Eternal Road]]'',&lt;ref name="nytimesobit" /&gt; a "Biblical Drama" by [[Franz Werfel]] that had been commissioned by members of New York's Jewish community and was premiered in 1937 at the [[Manhattan Opera House]], running for 153 performances.

[[File:Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya at home 1942.jpg|thumb|Weill and Lenya at home in 1942]]
He and his wife moved to New York City on September 10, 1935, living first at the St. Moritz Hotel before moving on to an apartment at 231 East 62nd Street between Third and Second Avenues.&lt;ref name="NYCcyclopedia"/&gt; Weill and his wife rented an old house with [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] during the summer of 1936 near [[Pine Brook Country Club]] in [[Nichols, Connecticut]], the summer home of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], while finishing ''[[Johnny Johnson (musical)|Johnny Johnson]]''. Some of the other artists who summered there in 1936 were; [[Elia Kazan]], [[Harry Morgan]], [[John Garfield]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Will Geer]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Howard Da Silva]] and [[Irwin Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ Pinewood Lake website retrieved on September 10, 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727174723/http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |date=July 27, 2011 }}.

Rather than continue to write in the same style that had characterized his European compositions, Weill made a study of American popular and stage music. His American output contains individual songs and entire shows that not only became highly respected and admired, but have been seen as seminal works in the development of the American [[Musical theatre|musical]]. In 1939 he wrote the music for ''Railroads on Parade,'' a musical spectacular put on at the [[1939 World's Fair]] in New York to celebrate the American railroad industry (book by Edward Hungerford). Unique among Broadway composers of the time, Weill insisted on writing his own orchestrations (with some very few exceptions, such as the dance music in ''Street Scene'').&lt;ref&gt;"The Boys That Make the Noise", Music section, ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', July 5, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with writers such as [[Maxwell Anderson]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], and wrote a film score for [[Fritz Lang]] (''You and Me'', 1938). Weill himself strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful. The most interesting attempt in this direction is ''[[Street Scene (opera)|Street Scene]]'', based on a play by [[Elmer Rice]], with lyrics by [[Langston Hughes]]. For his work on ''Street Scene'' Weill was awarded the inaugural [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardscategoryinfo.cfm?catname=Score Tony Award for Best Original Score]. Broadwayworld.com. Retrieved on August 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s Weill lived in [[Downstate New York]] near the [[New Jersey]] border and made frequent trips both to New York City and to Hollywood for his work for theatre and film. Weill was active in political movements encouraging American entry into World War II, and after America joined the war in 1941, Weill enthusiastically collaborated in numerous artistic projects supporting the war effort both abroad and on the [[home front]]. He and Maxwell Anderson also joined the volunteer civil service by working as air raid wardens on [[High Tor State Park|High Tor Mountain]] between their homes in [[New City, New York]] and [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw, New York]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. Weill became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1943.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit" /&gt;

Weill had ideals of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In the US, he wrote ''[[Down in the Valley (opera)|Down in the Valley]]'', an opera including the [[Down in the Valley (folk song)|song of the same name]] and other American folk songs. He also wrote a number of songs in support of the American war effort, including the satirical "Schickelgruber" (with lyrics by [[Howard Dietz]]), "Buddy on the Nightshift" (with [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]]) and – with Brecht again as in his earlier career – the "Ballad of the Nazi Soldier's Wife" ("Und was bekam des Soldaten Weib?"). Intended for broadcast to Germany, the song chronicled the progress of the Nazi war machine through the gifts sent to the proud wife at home by her man at the front: furs from Oslo, a silk dress from Paris etc., until finally, from Russia, she receives her widow's veil.&lt;ref name="cjschuler.net" /&gt;

Apart from "[[Mack the Knife]]" and "[[Pirate Jenny]]" from ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', his most famous songs include "[[Alabama Song]]" (from ''Mahagonny''), "Surabaya Johnny" (from ''Happy End''), "[[Speak Low]]" (from ''[[One Touch of Venus]]''), "Lost in the Stars" (from the musical of that name), "[[My Ship]]" (from ''Lady in the Dark''), and "[[September Song]]" (from ''Knickerbocker Holiday'').

==Death==
Weill suffered a heart attack shortly after his 50th birthday and died on April 3, 1950, in New York City.&lt;ref name="Mercado" /&gt; He was buried in Mount Repose Cemetery in [[Haverstraw, New York]]. The text and music on his gravestone come from the song "A Bird of Passage" from ''[[Lost in the Stars]]'', itself adapted from a quotation from the [[Venerable Bede]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum'' (History of the English Church and People) Book 2, Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;This is the life of men on earth:
Out of darkness we come at birth
Into a lamplit room, and then –
Go forward into dark again.
:(lyric: [[Maxwell Anderson]])&lt;/poem&gt;

An excerpt from Maxwell Anderson's eulogy for Weill read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wish, of course, that he had been lucky enough to have had a little more time for his work. I could wish the times in which he lived had been less troubled. But these things were as they were – and Kurt managed to make thousands of beautiful things during the short and troubled time he had...&lt;ref name="cjschuler.net" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sixty years after his death, Weill's music continues to be performed both in [[popular music|popular]] and [[classical music|classical]] contexts. In Weill's lifetime, his work was most associated with the voice of his wife, [[Lotte Lenya]], but shortly after his death "[[Mack the Knife]]" was established by [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bobby Darin]] as a jazz standard. His music has since been recorded by many performers, ranging from [[Nina Simone]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[The Doors]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[David Bowie]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Judy Collins]], [[John Zorn]], [[Dagmar Krause]], [[Steeleye Span]], [[The Young Gods]] and [[PJ Harvey]] to New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. Singers as varied as [[Teresa Stratas]], [[Ute Lemper]], [[Gisela May]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Max Raabe]], [[Heinz Karl Gruber]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]] have recorded entire albums of his music.

In 1985, [[Hal Willner]] produced ''[[Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill]]'', a [[tribute album]] in which Weill's songs were interpreted by a variety of artists, including [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-in-the-stars-the-music-of-kurt-weill-r23905/review| title = Lost in the Stars| author = Viglione, Joe| date = February 9, 2010| accessdate = May 2, 2012

[[Amanda Palmer]], singer/pianist of the 'Brechtian Punk Cabaret' duo [[The Dresden Dolls]], has Kurt Weill's name on the front of her keyboard (a pun with the name of the instrument maker [[Kurzweil Music Systems|Kurzweil]]) as a tribute to the composer. In 1991, seminal [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Industrial music]] band [[The Young Gods]] released their album of Kurt Weill songs, ''[[The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill]]''. Weill was also often cited as an influence on [[Goldfrapp]]'s ''[[Felt Mountain]]''. In 2008, Weill's songs were performed by Canadian musicians (including [[Sarah Slean]] and [[Mary Margaret O'Hara]]) in a tribute concert as part of the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. In 2009 [[Duke Special]] released an EP, [[Huckleberry Finn (EP)|''Huckleberry Finn'']], of five songs from an unfinished musical by Kurt Weill based on [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|the novel]] by [[Mark Twain]].

Caesar's younger brother was {{Interlanguage link multi|Gustav Hochstetter|de}} (born May 12, 1873, [[Mannheim]] – died 1942, [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]]), Professor of Literature at the University of Brussels, writer and poet and friend of [[Wilhelm Busch]]. His second cousin was the childhood prodigy pianist, [[Lisy Fischer]] (born August 22, 1900, Zürich, Switzerland – died June 6, 1999, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''''Lean on Me''''' is a 1989 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] written by Michael Schiffer, directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and starring [[Morgan Freeman]]. ''Lean on Me'' is loosely based on the story of [[Joe Louis Clark]], a real life [[inner city]] [[high school]] principal in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], whose school is at risk of being taken over by the [[New Jersey]] state government unless students improve their test scores on the New Jersey Minimum Basic Skills Test. This film's title refers to the 1972 [[Bill Withers]] [[Lean on Me (song)|song of the same name]].
Parts of the film, including the elementary school scenes, were filmed in [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]].

==Plot==
By 1987, the once successful [[Eastside High School (Paterson, New Jersey)|Eastside High School]] in Paterson, New Jersey, has deteriorated due to [[drugs]] and [[crime]].  The majority of students cannot pass basic skills testing, and even the teachers are not safe from [[gang violence]]. Mayor Bottman ([[Alan North]]) learns that the school will be turned over to state administration unless 75% of the students can pass the minimum basic skills test. He consults with school superintendent Dr. Frank Napier ([[Robert Guillaume]]), who suggests the school hire elementary school principal Joe Clark, aka "Crazy Joe" ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a former teacher at Eastside High, as the new principal. Reluctantly, the mayor hires Clark.

Clark's immediate radical changes include expelling 300 students identified as [[drug dealers]] or abusers and troublemakers, instituting programs to improve school spirit including painting over graffiti-covered walls, and requiring students to learn the school song, and be punished if they cannot sing it on demand. When one of the expelled students is found beating up another student, Clark orders the doors of the school chained shut during school hours since alarmed security doors cannot be purchased. 

Some parents react strongly to these measures, including Leonna Barrett ([[Lynne Thigpen]]), mother of one of the expelled students, who presses the mayor to oust Clark. Clark's radicalism causes him to come into conflict with members of the faculty, particularly English teacher Mr. Darnell, whom Clark suspends for picking up a piece of trash during a recital of the school song, and choir teacher Mrs. Elliot, whom Clark fires for being insubordinate after he cancels a pre-planned choral event, the school's upcoming annual [[Lincoln Center]] [[concert]]. Napier sets Clark straight over these incidents and lectures him to start being a team player. Clark reinstates Mr. Darnell, though he is too late to re-hire Mrs. Elliot.

His actions begin to have a positive effect on his students. Thomas Sams, a student expelled for crack use, pleads to be allowed to return to school and gradually reforms. Clark also reunites one of his old elementary students, Kaneesha Carter, with her estranged mother. Unfortunately, a practice basic skills test fails to garner enough passing students. Clark confronts his staff for their failure to educate their students and to prepare them for the world. He institutes a tutorial program to strengthen academic skills and encourages remedial reading courses on Saturdays which parents may attend alongside their children.

When the minimum basic skills test is finally assessed, the students are much better prepared and filled with a sense of self-worth. Before the results can arrive, the fire chief raids the school and discovers the chained doors. Clark is arrested for violating [[fire safety]] [[codes]]. That evening, the students gather at the meeting of the [[Paterson Board of Education]], where school board member Leona  Barrett, is leading for Clark's removal. The students demand that Clark be released from jail and retained as principal. The mayor has Clark released from jail and talk to the students to go home. Clark calls for his students to return to their homes. He is interrupted by assistant principal Ms. Levias who reports that more than 75% of the students have passed the basic skills test. He announces the results over his megaphone. As a result, the school's current administration remains intact, and Clark is allowed to keep his job as principal of Eastside High. The students break into their school song in celebration. The film ends with the senior students graduating high school and Clark handing them their diplomas.

'''Lingua.ly''' is an [[Educational technology|EdTech]] startup that takes a digital [[language immersion]] approach to teaching languages. The company was founded by Jan Ihmels and Orly Furhman, two academics from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]] respectively. Lingua.ly operates under the [[freemium]] business model and exists as a [[Cloud computing|Cloud]]-based [[Web application|web app]] and [[mobile app]] available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].

==Launch==
After its beta launch in August 2013, the company's [[Browser extension|extension]] for [[Google Chrome]] saw widespread early adoption in the US, Spain, and Latin America as a [[spaced repetition]] vocabulary acquisition tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lardinois|first1=Frederic|title=Lingua.ly Transforms The Web Into A Language-Learning Opportunity|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/lingua-ly-transforms-the-web-into-a-language-learning-opportunity/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several publications have recommended Lingua.ly as a free platform for language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sema|first1=Alexandra|title=Opciones para aprender y practicar idiomas|url=http://www.lapatria.com/tecnologia/opciones-para-aprender-y-practicar-idiomas-61636|website=LaPatria.com|publisher=La Patria|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seis opciones online para aprender y practicar inglés|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/educacion/seis-opciones-online-para-aprender-y-practicar-ingles-150477|website=El Universal|publisher=El Universal|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Méndez|first1=Manuel Ángel|title=Aprende idiomas mientras lees en Internet con esta aplicación|url=http://es.gizmodo.com/aprende-idiomas-mientras-lees-en-internet-con-esta-geni-1123517338/all|website=Gizmodo en Español|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opciones para aprender y practicar idiomas|url=http://www.vanguardia.com/vida-y-estilo/galeria/251107-opciones-para-aprender-y-practicar-idiomas|website=Vanguardia.com|publisher=Galvis Ramirez &amp; Cia|accessdate= 10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 Lingua.ly launched its mobile app for Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawers|first1=Paul|title=12 of the best new Android apps launched in April|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/05/01/12-best-new-android-apps-launched-april/?awesm=tnw.to_g4qhI|website=TheNextWeb.com|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving 100K downloads in its first month on the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lingua.ly released a stand-alone web app in June 2014, which was met with largely positive reviews, including coverage in the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hong|first1=Kaylene|title=Lingua.ly, which helps you learn new languages by browsing the Web, is now available as a Web app|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/06/04/lingua-ly-which-helps-you-learn-new-languages-by-browsing-the-web-is-now-available-as-a-web-app/|website=TheNextWeb|publisher=The Next Web, Inc.|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Brian|title=Lingua.ly: New Language Learning Web App|url=http://www.latg.org/2014/06/review-lingua.ly.html|website=Languages Around the Globe|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbloom|first1=Stephanie|title=Inventive, Cheaper Tools for Learning a Language|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/travel/inventive-cheaper-tools-for-learning-a-language.html|website=NYTimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Lingua.ly released an iOS mobile app in July 2014, which was quickly listed as one of the top iPhone apps of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dredge|first1=Stuart|title=20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/21/best-iphone-ipad-apps-glow-nurture-lingualy|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the company won the regional 1776 Challenge Cup's Innovation in Education Award for its patent pending algorithm and language learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rayford|first1=Meg|title=Lingua.ly, Winflex, MediSafe Project, and Pink Park Win the Tel Aviv Challenge Cup|url=http://tech.co/lingua-ly-winflex-medisafe-project-pink-park-win-tel-aviv-challenge-cup-2014-02|website=Tech Cocktail|publisher=Tech Cocktail LLC|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 Lingua.ly was selected as one of eight global finalists for the Challenge Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barba|first1=Ronald|title=Startups Win Big as 1776′s Challenge Cup Competition Comes to an End|url=http://tech.co/startups-win-big-1776s-challenge-cup-competition-comes-end-2014-05|website=Tech Cocktail|publisher=Tech Cocktail LLC|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==

While traditional [[language immersion]] entails a target language rich environment where the user is exposed to ample linguistic input from various sources, Lingua.ly utilizes digital language immersion, a method of employing a [[virtual learning environment]] to simulate the language learning environment. Users are exposed to authentic input in their target language through their computer, tablet, or mobile device as opposed to lesson-based instruction. [[Duolingo]] and [http://bliubliu.com/en/ Bliu Bliu] are other examples of language education tech startups that also partially rely on a digital language immersion approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cicerchia|first1=Meredith|title=Digital immersion creates wave of change in language education|url=http://smartblogs.com/education/2014/04/22/digital-immersion-creates-wave-of-change-in-language-education/|website=SmartBlog on Education|publisher=SmartBrief|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classroom learning, language immersion is often used to teach children in [[Bilingual education|bilingual]] or [[content and language integrated learning]] programs. Digital language immersion is the [[E-learning]] extension of these trends.

Lingua.ly relies on a number of applied linguistics principles, including the [[Natural approach|Natural Approach]] and Krashen's [[Input hypothesis|Input Hypothesis]], which argues that fluent language learners benefit most from language they acquire through exposure rather than direct instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krashen|first1=Stephen|title=Explorations in Language Acquisition and Use|date=2003|publisher=Heinemann|location=Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and platform ==

Lingua.ly's platform contains an online and mobile dictionary powered by [[Babylon (software)|Babylon]] that learners can use to look up words from the web in their target language. Through a learner's collected words and [[Clickstream|click-patterns]], the technology maps an individual's vocabulary in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other online language learning sites and apps and how to make the most of them!|url=http://www.gamesforlanguage.com/language-learning-sites|website=GamesForLanguage|publisher=GamesForLanguage|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then rates the suitability of online content suggestions in the target language in order to create an environment for language acquisition based on a 90:10 percentage of known to unknown words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tanwani|first1=Manika|title=A blue friendly creature can teach you a new language!|url=http://e27.co/a-blue-friendly-creature-can-teach-you-a-new-language-20140530/|website=e27|publisher=e27|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users customize vocabulary flashcards with images, audio, and example sentences and practice them at spaced repetition intervals to enhance acquisition and transfer into [[Long term memory|long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Ihmels, Lingua.ly|url=http://itsaapp.com/jan-ihmels-lingua-ly/|website=ITSAAPP.com|publisher=ITSAAPP.com|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EdTech for languages ==

Lingua.ly is part of a growing trend of digital language education startups including, [[Memrise]], [[Busuu]], [[Babbel]] and [[Duolingo]] that are attracting significant investment funding and unseating former industry leader Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disrupting Rosetta Stone?

'''Alternative universities''' or '''colleges''' in the United States offer an education, and in some cases a lifestyle, that is intentionally not mainstream compared to other institutions. Through the use of experimental and unconventional [[curricula]] and offering choice to students as to what and how they will study, such institutions distinguish themselves from traditional faculties. They often attract faculty and students who are interested in such values and are often politically liberal{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Additionally, some of them expand on the concept of [[democratic education]] to integrate students in various facets of school administration. Methods of evaluation frequently favor detailed written evaluations instead of grades. Some institutions do not require an SAT/ACT, but rather ask for a series of essays. Many of these institutions are private, though most offer scholarships, grants, and other aid.

===Prosecutor===
Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in [[Peterborough]] Crown Court, Cambridgeshire. Throughout his career he successfully prosecuted many criminal cases including prosecution of a fraudster who was found guilty of involvement in a £1.5&amp;nbsp;million fraud in 2002,&lt;ref name="“worksopguardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fraudster on the run|url=http://www.worksopguardian.co.uk/news/fraudster-on-the-run-1-626865 |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a solicitor who plead guilty to stealing £350,000 in fees from clients in 2005.&lt;ref name="“www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Solicitor pleads guilty to theft |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4634803.stm |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solicitor Christopher McChrystal was arrested in October 2004 after the [[Law Society]] referred his case to the police.&lt;ref name="“www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk |url=http://www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files-sdt/9159-2004%20-%20McChrystal.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McChrystal was subsequently struck off after Lincoln Crown Court's finding that he used the clients' money to make an investment into his business.&lt;ref name="“www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk"/&gt; In 2003 Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in court cases resulting from Operation Harrier,&lt;ref name="“justiceinspectorates.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE INSPECTORATE'S REPORT ON CPS CAMBRIDGESHIRE |url=http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/crown-prosecution-service/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/04/Cambs0103Rep.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clean-up operation which has declared all-out war against Class A drugs in [[Peterborough]], Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref name="“peterboroughtoday.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=A TEAM of prosecutors has moved into a city police station to deal with the mass arrests resulting from drugs crackdown Operation Harrier |url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/crime-extra-lawyers-to-handle-mass-drug-arrests-1-101561|accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence counsel===
Beddoe has defended at the criminal bar in drug cases, fraud, homicide and other serious crime.&lt;ref name="“zoominfo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin Beddoe: barrister |url=https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Martin-Beddoe/636223420 |accessdate=15 October 2017 |date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dealt with Courts Martial, Inquests and Public Enquiries. In 2005 he successfully defended Jason Smith, British soldier who served eight years in the British Army. The court heard that Smith's successful Army career was halted prematurely due to a back injury and he had struggled to come to terms with it. In March 2005, as a result of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Smith had carried out a raid of a petrol station in Northampton at knife-point, but later dropped 45 in cash as the owner and several villagers gave chase.&lt;ref name="“northamptonchron.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=A FORMER soldier who saw active service in Bosnia and Northern Ireland has escaped a prison sentence for an armed robbery at a petrol station in a Northamptonshire village |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/no-jail-term-after-petrol-station-raid-1-909379 |accessdate=15 October 2017 |date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing Jason Smith to a two-year suspended sentence, Judge Nigel Daly told him: {{quote|It is the first time you have been in court and you are of previous good character and here you are in relation to a very serious offence. You had considerable problems with your finances and then suffered a reactive depression brought on by the spiralling debts.&lt;ref name="“northamptonchron.co.uk"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">The '''National Educational Radio Network''' ('''NERN''') was a means of distributing radio programs in the [[United States of America|United States]] between 1961 and 1970.  With funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the network began broadcasting on six radio stations on April 3, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. McCauley, ''NPR: the trials and triumphs of National Public Radio'' (Columbia University Press, 2005) p17&lt;/ref&gt;

A forerunner was formed in 1925 as the [[Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations]], then renamed the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] in 1934. In 1951 a grant from the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]] enabled the network to become the "(NAEB) Tape Network", based at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seattler|first=Paul|title=The evolution of American educational technology|publisher=Information Age Publishing Inc.|year=2004|pages=217ff|isbn=1-59311-139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAEB Tape Network became part of the National Educational Radio Network in 1963. As a result of the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]] NERN became part of [[NPR|National Public Radio]] in 1970.

'''New World School of the Arts''' ('''NWSA''') is a [[State school|public]] [[magnet school|magnet]] [[high school]] and [[college]] in [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] [[Miami, Florida]]. Its dual-enrollment programs in the visual and performing arts are organized into four strands: [[visual arts]], [[dance]], [[theatre]] (comprising programs in [[theater]] and [[musical theatre]]), and music (comprising programs in [[Instrumental|instrumental music]] and [[vocal music]]).

The New World School of the Arts was a pioneer in dual-enrollment education, arising out of an experiment between [[Miami Northwestern High School]] and Dade Community College (now [[Miami Dade College]]). NWSA was formally created as an outcome of that experiment by the 1986 New World School of the Arts Act of the Florida State Legislature as "a center of excellence for the performing and visual art",&lt;ref name="statutes"&gt;1986 Florida Statutes, 204.535 New World School of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; with the stated intention "that specific attention be given to the needs of artistically talented high school students who are occupationally oriented to the arts."&lt;ref name="statutes"/&gt;

The school is jointly administered by [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]], [[Miami Dade College]], and the [[University of Florida]]. The administrative structure includes an executive board with representatives from each of the partners as well as community seats and a foundation board.

The school awards an [[Associate's degree|Associate of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] from Miami Dade College, [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Music]] degrees from the [[University of Florida]], and a high school degree from the Miami Dade County schools.

Admissions into the high school are through the Miami Dade Visual and Performing Arts Magnet Program, requiring an audition and/or portfolio (see [[New World School of the Arts#High School Admissions and Enrollment|High School Admissions]]).

New World High School is rated #149 in the national rankings for best high schools, #17 in rankings for  best Florida high schools and #42  magnet schools in accordance with the 2018 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. In 2009, NWSA was 82nd in this ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/florida/districts/miami-dade-county-public-schools/new-world-school-of-the-arts-4873.html|title=USNEWS  ranking|website=USNews.com|access-date=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the college and the high school are accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].

==History==
The vision of PAVAC (Performing and Visual Arts Center) was to integrate Miami Northwestern High School and provide high-quality arts training for students in Dade County. The original PAVAC director (1975) was Jackie (last name unknown), with Dr. Everett Abney serving as principal. At that time, Ms. Samiento served as an art teacher and Charlie Austin as music instructor. Later, Samiento took over as director when Jackie relocated out of state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the early days of PAVAC, Irene Fox was the Modern Dance instructor and Shelley Fox (recommended by Carrie Meek) was hired as the ballet instructor-choreographer. After Irene Fox left the program, Shelley Fox continued to recruit students from Dade County Public Schools. She developed a high quality ballet program and performing company.

The PAVAC program provided students with busing from their local high school to Miami Northwestern for the afternoon arts classes. The PAVAC Dancers performed at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, at locations on Miami Beach, Florida state conferences and festivals, and on local TV stations. The highlight of the program was the premier of Richard Strauss' original ballet ''Death and Transfiguration'' at Miami Dade Jr. College North. At that time, the PAVAC ballet program was the only department that successfully integrated Miami Northwestern High School.

Kendell Bently-Baker, inspired by the academic success of that program, and attempting to take greater advantage of the facilities and faculty of [[Miami Dade College]] (MDC), then known as Miami Dade Community College, proposed the creation of a dual-enrollment school of the arts: morning academics were to be at the student's home high school; in the afternoon students were to be bussed to one of the two MDCC campuses for classes in art or the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', July 5, 1984, Dade Arts Students Pay Price of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon high school graduation, the student received a diploma from the home high school and college credits for the art classes, awarded through MDC.

In summer 1982, county auditions were held for 10th–12th graders. In fall 1982, two dual-enrollment PAVACs opened, one at the North Campus of MDCC, "PAVAC North", headed by Kendell Bently-Baker; the other at the South Campus of MDCC (now called the Kendall Campus), "PAVAC South", headed by Richard Janaro and Margaret Pelton. Marcy Samiento continued to serve as DCPS coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', June 24, 1982. Special Arts Program is planned.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, many Miami-Dade high schools served only 10th–12th grade.

The first PAVAC dual-enrollment graduates were in 1983. The Miami Northwestern High School program continued as before the creation of PAVAC,&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', June 1, 1986, Northwestern PAVAC Gets Chance To Rebuild&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently among the PVA (performing and visual arts) magnet programs in the Miami-Dade County school system.

In 1984, Marcy Sarmiento, Kandell Bentley-Baker and Richard Janaro were asked to plan a successor school to PAVAC. Knowing they would need approval from the Florida Legislature they enlisted civic leader and lobbyist Seth Gordon to join them. Gordon was later elected to serve as the first chair of the Executive Board of the school and served in that capacity for six years. They studied other arts schools in the country, visiting [[LaGuardia High School]], [[Juilliard]] and the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, December 25, 1986, Young Artists Get a Chance at New School.&lt;/ref&gt; A bill creating the "South Florida School of the Arts" passed the Florida House of Representatives on May 30, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, May 31, 1984, Bill Creates Expanded Arts Center for Gifted Students. Florida House of Representatives passed bill for South Florida School for the Performing and Visual Arts on May 30, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the New World name was chosen as part of larger plans for urban and cultural development which included the eponymous [[New World Symphony Orchestra]], and to avoid confusion with the Florida School of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://floarts.org|title=florida school of the arts|website=FloArts.org|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Florida legislature passed the "New World School of the Arts Act" in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Statute 240.535 (1986). Revised 1989, section 240.535, to create the NWSA Foundation and to establish the Governor's summer arts program. Current section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=new+world&amp;URL=CH1002/Sec35.HTM 1002.35 of the Florida Statutes].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204021715/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=new+world&amp;URL=CH1002%2FSec35.HTM |date=February 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWSA opened its doors in fall 1987. The continuing students at PAVAC's North and South transitioned into NWSA, as did many of PAVAC's faculty. NWSA issued its first high school diploma in 1988 to the former PAVAC students. NWSA enrolled its first freshman college students in 1988. In order to award a BFA, it partnered with [[Florida International University]] (FIU).  On January 12, 1994 [[University of Florida]] replaced FIU in this partnership.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', January 12, 1994, New World Committee Supports Switch to UF.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', January 13, 1994, FIU Leaves New World Partnership.&lt;/ref&gt; The first graduating class of the college was in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', May 4, 1992, "Arts School Graduates 1st College Class"&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the high school expanded to include 9th grade.

The combined administration of the high school and college consists of a provost, under which are four deans and a principal. The Principal oversees the high school and high school academics, and Deans oversee each of the four strands, Dance, Music, Theater and Visual Arts, for both the high school and the college. There is an executive board of directors for the school, as well as a foundation board to direct the NWSA Foundation.

=== Provost ===
Richard A. Klein was hired away from being the principal of the [[LaGuardia High School]] to be the founding provost of NWSA. In April 1994 the executive board reduced Richard Klein's contract to one year and began looking for a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, February 23, 1994, Backstage Drama Unfolds at New World School&lt;/ref&gt; D. Hansen became interim provost for the 1995-96 school year, replaced by Bennett Lentczner, who served until 1999. Several provosts have served since then. Since the 2009 school year, Dr. Jeffrey Hodgson has been provost.

=== Principal ===
Alan Weiss was the founding principal. Since then, principals have been: Mandy Offerle, 1989–1993; Ellery Brown, 1993 until retirement in 2007; Dr. Frederic Conde, 2007–2010; Lisa S. Noffo, 2010–2012; Evonne Alvarez 2012–2018; Jason Allen, 2018 - Present.

=== Dean of Dance ===

[[Daniel Lewis (choreographer)|Daniel Lewis]] was the founding Dean of Dance of NWSA. Daniel Lewis retired for the 2011 school year. The current Dean of Dance is Mary Lisa Burns.

=== Dean of Music ===

[[John de Lancie (oboist)|John de Lancie]] was the director of Philadelphia's famed [[Curtis Institute of Music]] before becoming the founding Dean at New World.  He submitted his resignation in December 1991 but rescinded it that same month,  then resigned definitively in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, December 16, 1991, De Lancie is Quitting New World Music Dean Cites Lack of Funding&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', December 21, 1991, Miami New World Dean Rescinds Resignation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', September 17, 1992, New World Dean Quits&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Willie Anthony Waters, principal conductor of the Greater Miami Opera. Waters was replaced in August 1993 with [[Balint Vazsonyi]], who was asked to resign in September 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', September 16, 1994, Embattled New World Music Dean Facing Dismissal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', September 21, 1994, MDCC Moves Toward Firing Music Dean&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', September 27, 1994, Suspended New World Dean Sues School&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

Since then the position has been filled by: Tallulah Brown, 1994–95; Karl Kramer, 1995–97; Roby George, 1997–98; Mark Camphouse, 1998–99;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markcamphouse.com/|title=Mark Camphouse|website=Mark Camphouse|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Prime, 1999–2002; Jeffrey Hodgson, 2002-2009; Jim Gasior, 2009-2012; and Milton Ruben Laufer 2012-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miltonlaufer.com/|title=Bio|website=Milton Rubén Laufer|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Dean of Music is Daniel Andai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielandai.com/|title=Daniel Andai - Online|website=Daniel Andai|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alumnus of NWSA Music Division. He was appointed in summer 2014.

=== Dean of Theater ===

Dr. Richard Paul Janaro agreed to serve as acting Dean of Theater at the school's inception. Jorge Guerra Castro became Dean of Theater in 1988, and Dr. Janaro assumed the role of Assistant Dean of Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, July 4, 1988, New World School Names Theater Dean&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Patrice Bailey took over from Castro, and has continued until the present.

=== Dean of Visual Arts ===

The founding Dean of Visual Arts was Ed Love. Since then, the deans have been: [[Mel Alexenberg]], 1990–2000; Louise Romeo, 2000–2005; Maggy Cuesta, 2005–present.

==Campus==

The school's main building is located at 25 NE 2nd Street, Miami, and holds other classes on the [[Miami Dade College]] Wolfson Campus.

Much like the school today, all of its classes were held in different buildings in downtown Miami when the school opened, including the main building of MDC Wolfson campus, as well as space at the Christ Fellowship church at 500 N.E. 1st Avenue, where drawing classes were held on the top floor. The school's current main building (a former AT&amp;T communications department building) was first used for the 1990-1991 school year, as an electrical fire destroyed the school's original administration headquarters.  The main building (the 5000 Building) houses most of the high school academic classes there, as well as both the high school and college administration units, dance studios, theaters, and art studios.  The MDC Wolfson Science building (the 2000 Building, located at 300 NE 2nd Avenue) houses the science facilities.  All music classes are held across the street from the MDC Wolfson Building at the aptly named Music Building (the 4000 Building, located at 401 NE 2nd Avenue; also houses MDC's Literary Center).

==High school admissions and enrollment==
NWSA is run as a magnet school, and is therefore open to students throughout Miami-Dade county. NWSA continued the PAVAC model of admission based entirely on audition. This differs from other  Miami-Dade County Public School ([[MDCPS]]) magnets which are not VPA (visual and performing arts) magnets, which have a mixed model of entrance eligibility requirements and lottery. Also unlike the other MDCPS magnets, but like other VPA magnets, it does not have the "sibling rule", a policy of giving priority if a student's sibling is already attending the magnet school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://choice.dadeschools.net/mag_faq.asp |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107104733/http://choice.dadeschools.net/mag_faq.asp |archivedate=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, 1,268 students applied for admission to New World, competing for 140 available spots. This gives New World an 11% admissions rate, making it one of Miami's most competitive public high schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/12/2062813/magnet-schools-preparation-for.html{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total enrollment for 2009–10 was 828, with 473 in the high school and 355 in the college.

School demographics for 2009–10 were 35% male and 65% female; 42% Hispanic (of any race), 36% White non-Hispanic, 19% Black, 3% Asian, and  less than 1% other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalscholar.com/schoolfinder/49463-new-world-school-of-the-arts/student-information.aspx |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904070643/http://www.globalscholar.com/schoolfinder/49463-new-world-school-of-the-arts/student-information.aspx |archivedate=September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born Te Kumeroa Ngoingoi Ngāwai on 29 December 1921 at [[Tokomaru Bay]], on [[New Zealand]]'s East Coast, the eldest of five children of Hori Ngāwai, a labourer and minister in the [[Ringatū]] faith from the Te Whānau-a-Ruataupare [[hapū]] of the [[Ngāti Porou]] [[iwi]] of Tokomaru Bay, and his wife Wikitoria Karu of [[Ngāti Tara Tokanui]] in the [[Hauraki]] region. She attended [[Hukarere Girls' College|Hukarere Girls’ School]] from 1938 to 1941.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

Ngoi was a niece of [[Tuini Ngawai|Tuini Ngāwai]], another prominent composer and promoter of the language and culture. In the early 1940s, Ngoi travelled around New Zealand in a fundraising drive for the war effort with the [[Hokowhitu-ā-Tū]] Concert Party. Her aunt, who founded the group, trained her in [[kapa haka]] performance and groomed her for leadership. She continued her involvement after the war.

In 1945 she married Rikirangi Ben Pēwhairangi of Tokomaru Bay. The only child of the marriage was a son, Terewai Pēwhairangi, but they fostered many other children.

Ngoi taught Māori language and tutored the Māori club at [[Gisborne Girls' High School]] for three years from 1973. In 1974 she also began teaching a course of Māori studies in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] for the [[University of Waikato]]. In 1977, [[Kara Puketapu]], the new secretary of the [[Department of Māori Affairs]] called on her assistance in setting up Tū Tangata, a scheme that targeted at-risk Māori youth in the cities, and attempted to connect them with their [[iwi]]. She continued working for the Department as an adviser, and was involved in the preliminary consultations that led to the establishment of the [[kōhanga reo]] movement, which saw children receiving their schooling in Māori.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

From 1978 on, she was an adviser to the National Council of Adult Education. In this capacity she promoted Māori language and culture around the country, especially in rural areas. She was the co-founder, with [[Katerina Mataira]], of the highly acclaimed [[Te Ataarangi]] programme of teaching Māori, which was the basis of a TV programme and a series of books, ''Te reo'' (1985).

Among [[Pākehā]] who have heard of her, she is best known as the composer of the [[poi (performance art)|poi]] song ''[[Poi E]]'', which topped New Zealand charts in 1984 in a recording by [[Dalvanius Prime]] and the [[Patea Māori Club]], and sold 15,000 copies. She also wrote the popular song ''[[E Ipo]]'' which was performed by [[Prince Tui Teka]].&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

She died in Tokomaru Bay on January 29, 1985. Her ''[[tangihanga]]'' (funeral) was held at Pākirikiri Marae. A ''[[waiata tangi]]'' (lament) composed for her by Dr. [[Timoti Karetu]] was for a number of years the signature piece of the kapa haka group of the Te Tumu School of Māori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies at the [[University of Otago]].

In 2016 she was presented with the Nostalgia Award from the [[Variety Artists Club of New Zealand]], an award presented to an artist deemed not to have received suitable honours during their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vac.org.nz/awards/|title=Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Inc, 2016 Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with Disabilities''' refers to the ordinance that every public school district in the [[United States]] must provide all students with disabilities ages 3 through 21 with an individualized and free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.  President [[Gerald R. Ford]] established this right when in 1975 he signed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Law 94-142, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of children with disabilities and other advocates hailed EAHCA as the “education civil rights act” for their children.

==History==
The Act was reauthorized in 1983, 1990, 1997, and 2004. In 1997 the Act was renamed The &lt;ref&gt;[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the Act into law on December 3, 2004 ([http://Public%20Law%20108-446 Public Law 108-446]).

Public Law 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, is most commonly called [https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/osep-idea.html IDEA 2004]. Following enactment, the U.S. Department of Education took nearly two years to develop the federal regulations to answer common questions about critical parts of the law. The final draft of the federal regulations were published August 14, 2006, and took effect 60 days later, October 13, 2006. To some extent, the federal regulations clarify how the law should be put into practice. In some areas the final implementation of the law is up to the state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) - the public school districts.

IDEA 2004 continues granting to students with disabilities the right to a public education. IDEA 2004 continues regulating the special education services provided to these students through the SEAs and the public schools. Most notably, IDEA 2004 emphasizes preparing students with disabilities, ages 16 (or younger) through 21, for life beyond high school.

== From “Get’em in” – to “Get’em through” – and now “Get’em ready!” ==

===An Act in three stages===
The intent of the law changed over time in keeping with increasingly improved understandings of the needs of students with disabilities.  PL 94-142, ‘stage one,’ purposed to “Get’em in” – opening the doors of public schools to students with disabilities.

== Further underscores transition ==

IDEA 2004 builds upon the amendments and reauthorizations of 1983, 1990, and 1997, clarifies the concept and position of transition, and strengthens the future-focus of special education services.  IDEA 2004 indicates one of its purposes is “…to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for '''''further''''' education, employment and independent living…” (author emphasis).  The key word “further” emphasizes the direction and purpose and expected results of this special education legislation.

== From breaking down the walls to looking beyond the walls ==

===Educational near-sightedness no longer===
No longer will teachers be permitted to restrict their vision of education to the four walls of the classroom and the four years of high school.  The focus is on the future. One constraining influence is the ‘other’ education legislation - the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]] (NCLB). NCLB constantly pulls [[special education]] services and resources towards standardized testing and improving test scores. IDEA 2004 continuously counteracts by emphasizing individualized education and individualized preparation of individual children with disabilities for their individual lives in their individual communities beyond high school.
 
IDEA 2004 and the accompanying regulations most clearly reflect the focus on the future through the many uses of the word “transition” when it comes to directing the high school education and activities of children with disabilities: transition, transition planning, transition assessments, transition services, transition service providers.
 
An effective transition plan, in the eyes of many, drives middle school students’ and high school students’ IEPs [[Individualized Education Program]]s (IEPs). IDEA 2004 highlights post secondary goals and putting in place transition services, including courses of study, to facilitate the students’ movement from high school to post high school life.

== EI to ECE transition in IDEA 2004 ==

Within IDEA 2004, the word “transition” has several different definitions according to its context in the Act.

In IDEA 2004, transition describes the process of a young child moving from early intervention services (EI) to early childhood education (ECE). In this EI to ECE process, transition indicates moving young children from one environment, set of services, and service personnel to another: “…the steps to be taken to support the transition of the toddler with a disability to preschool or other appropriate services.”  It also indicates moving from one set of entitlements to another, “…a child who is transitioning from Part C of the Act to Part B and is no longer eligible for Part C services because the child has turned 3…” (See [http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-3/081406a.html].)

== Post secondary transition in IDEA 2004 ==

When talking about post secondary transition the context is “…services and activities for older students (e.g., transition services, postsecondary goals).”  But unlike the EI services to ECE transition, the high school students only start in the position of receiving entitlements  – entitlements to services. The students who leave, whether by graduation, aging out, or dropping out, leave to a condition of possible eligibility for services, with no guarantee by law that they will continue to receive services.

One of the consequences, then, is an urgency to help students with disabilities make the most of the time they are in high school, while some funding, at least, is available, to prepare for post high school life.

== IDEA 2004 citations related to post secondary transition ==

References to the Act and the corresponding regulations within this article on post secondary transition are from FR Doc 06-6656  [Federal Register: August 14, 2006 (Volume 71, Number 156)] [Rules and Regulations [Page 46539-46845] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr14au06-14].  Please see [http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-3/081406a.html].

==Transition services, post-secondary goals, and transition assessments==
These include:
“(b) Transition services. Beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, and updated annually, thereafter, the IEP must include--

“(aa) appropriate measurable postsecondary goals based upon age appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and where appropriate independent living skills;

“(bb) the transition services (including courses of study) needed to assist the child in reaching those goals…”

===Transition services===
Section 300.43  Transition services include:

“(a) Transition services means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that—

“(1) Is designed to be within a results-oriented process, that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation;

“(2) Is based on the individual child’s needs, taking into account the child’s strengths, preferences, and interests; and includes--

“(i) Instruction;

“(ii) Related services;

“(iii) Community experiences;

“(iv) The development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives; and

“(v) If appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and provision of a functional vocational evaluation.

“(b) Transition services for children with disabilities may be special education, if provided as specially designed instruction, or a related service, if required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.

“(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(34))”

===Transition – IEP participants===

“b) Transition services participants.

“(1) In accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the public agency must invite a child with a disability to attend the child's IEP Team meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals under Sec. 300.320(b).

“(2) If the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, the public agency must take other steps to ensure that the child's preferences and interests are considered.

“(3) To the extent appropriate, with the consent of the parents or a child who has reached the age of majority, in implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the public agency must invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services.”

===Parental consent and notification===

“2) For a child with a disability beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, the notice also must

“(i) Indicate--

“(A) That a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals and transition services for the child, in accordance with Sec. 300.320(b); and

“(B) That the agency will invite the student; and

“(ii) Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a representative.

“(2) Parental consent, or the consent of an eligible child who has reached the age of majority under State law, must be obtained before personally identifiable information is released to officials of participating agencies providing or paying for transition services in accordance with Sec. 300.321(b)(3).”

===Non-LEA agencies not meeting transition commitments===

“(c) Failure to meet transition objectives—

“(1) Participating agency failure. If a participating agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP in accordance with Sec.  300.320 (b), the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the IEP.

“(2) Construction. Nothing in this part relieves any participating agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise provide to children with disabilities who meet the eligibility criteria of that agency.”

== State Performance Plans put “teeth” into IDEA 2004 transition requirements ==

''Where’s the teeth?''  As of 2005, the federal government will monitor transition plans for students with disabilities.  The anticipated results of the monitoring will be improvements in the post school results for students with disabilities, made possible through the improvement of in-school educational programs.

===Monitoring===
The monitoring will happen through three related vehicles.

--State Performance Plan (SPP) (and especially Indicators 1, 2, 13 and 14)

--Annual Performance Report (APR)

--Continuous Improvement Focused Monitoring Process (CIFMP)

Early years of the monitoring focus on establishing a baseline for transition plans, and beyond that the federal and state governments will be using the data collection and analysis results to approve, inform, direct, and assist local school districts in the improvement of their educational programs.

== Transition for students means a transition for teachers ==

Planning for the future of the individual student often requires a paradigm shift for everyone involved. With the IEP that is in effect the year the student turns 16, the IEPs often make a subtle change from overcoming deficits and approaching developmental norms to post secondary goals, transition plan activities and transition services that capitalize on the students’ strengths, needs, preferences, and interests.

The special education professional community is working hard to catch up with this change in emphasis, and certainly many believe that it has a long way to go. At this point, nearly 6½ million children receive special education services. However, few college programs, like those at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater (see [http://www.uww.edu/gradstudies/]) are preparing the next generation of professional educators to become effective in the transition planning and preparation process.

== An electronic checklist simplifies transition planning ==

The Department of Education is working hard to clarify the content of IDEA 2004 to the state directors of special education, the state transition specialists, and the national secondary transition technical support staff (see [http://www.nsttac.org]).  Meanwhile, LEA directors of special education and special education teachers across the country are working and periodically struggling to get their arms around post secondary transition, what it means, and how it affects the education of their students.

One of the promising means of guiding students and teachers through the maze of transition involves deploying corporate research-based technologies used for decades in private industry.
In 1999, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services provided two grants to fund research into the feasibility of adapting existing technology (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20060621101915/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/SBIR/FY00/phase2/phii00wizdom.html]). The research launched a web-based, commercially available product in use by teachers and parents primarily in Illinois and Minnesota but increasingly around the country (see [http://www.wizdomeducation.com/]).

The '''Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013''' ({{USBill|113|hr|1891}}) is a bill that would create the position of Science Laureate of the United States, meant to be similar to the [[United States Poet Laureate]].  The Science Laureate would spend their term traveling around the country promoting science and research to students and the general public.&lt;ref name="wiredMay" /&gt;  The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=1891sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 1891 – Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1891 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 would establish the position of Science Laureate of the United States.&lt;ref name="1891sum" /&gt;  The bill would require the [[President of the United States]] to appoint a Science Laureate on the basis of: (1) merit, particularly the ability of such individual to foster and enhance public awareness and interest in science and to provide ongoing significant scientific contributions; and (2) recommendations received by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) based on those factors.&lt;ref name="1891sum" /&gt;  The bill would also encourage each Science Laureate to continue his or her scientific work and directs the NAS to facilitate such Science Laureate's duties.  Finally, the bill would require each Science Laureate to serve a term of one or two years.&lt;ref name="1891sum" /&gt;

==Procedural history==

===House===
The Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 was introduced by [[Zoe Lofgren|Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D, CA-19)]] on May 8, 2013.&lt;ref name=1891allactions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 1891 – All Actions |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1891/all-actions/ |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]] and the [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Research and Technology]].&lt;ref name=1891committees&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 1891 – Committees |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1891/committees |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] placed H.R. 1891 on the House calendar for the week of September 9, 2013.&lt;ref name=weeklysched&gt;{{cite web |title=Leader's Weekly Schedule – Week of September 9, 2013 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/9-9-13.pdf |publisher=Majority Leader's Office |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Supporters of the bill argued that it would bring important attention to the importance of science and the benefits of scientific research, hopefully inspiring more Americans to pursue scientific careers.&lt;ref name="wiredMay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pfol1" /&gt;

One commentator, on learning of the proposed position of "Science Laureate of the United States," immediately nominated [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] for the position, listing several humorous and serious qualifications.&lt;ref name=raatznomination&gt;{{cite news |last=raatz |title=I nominated Neil deGrasse Tyson as U.S. Science Laureate |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/08/1207827/-I-nominate-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-as-U-S-Science-Laureate# |accessdate=September 11, 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Kos |date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil deGrasse Tyson was also mentioned on a [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] list of potential nominees alongside [[Brian Greene]], [[Jill Tarter]], Mike Brown, and [[Sylvia Earle]].&lt;ref name=wiredMay&gt;{{cite news |last=Marlow |first=Jeffrey |title=The Science Laureate of the United States |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/the-science-laureate-of-the-united-states/ |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |newspaper=Wired Magazine |date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several concerns about the effectiveness of the bill were raised.  First, objections were made to the fact that the position lacked a salary, with one commentator pointing out that this would make things very difficult on the scientist who was simultaneously supposed to continue performing their own research (and finding grants for it) and fulfill the role of Science Laureate.&lt;ref name="wiredMay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scilogs1" /&gt;  A second objection was raised to the decision to make the National Academy of Sciences as the group selecting the official list of candidates since, while they would be well placed to choose an excellent scientist, they might not do a good job of choosing an excellent communicator.&lt;ref name="wiredMay" /&gt;  A third objection was the possibility for the position to become heavily politicized.&lt;ref name=pfol1&gt;{{cite news |last=S. |first=Beth |title=Congress Roots for STEM, Proposes Science Laureate Position |url=http://www.pocketfullofliberty.com/and-the-next-science-laureate-of-the-united-states-is/ |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |newspaper=Pocket Full of Liberty |date=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source speculated on what considerations should be used to choose a Science Laureate.  These included avoiding unrelated controversy, diversity (to better represent a diverse American public), active research, diversity (in research fields, from one laureate to the next), and finding someone willing to do it, despite the position being unpaid.&lt;ref name=scilogs1&gt;{{cite news |last=Shipman |first=Matt |title=Picking a National Champion for Science |url=http://www.scilogs.com/communication_breakdown/science-laureate/ |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |newspaper=SciLogs |date=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8374">The '''Seal of Biliteracy''' (SoBL) is an award granted by a school, district, or state in the [[United States|United States of America]], "In recognition of students who have studied and attained proficiency in two or more languages by high school graduation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/a-new-marker-of-success-at-graduation-the-seal-of-biliteracy/2017/06/02/240c79ce-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?utm_term=.a0d4e1d86f7b|title=A new marker of success at graduation: The seal of biliteracy|last=Sanchez|first=Isabella|date=June 7, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzZDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT194&amp;dq=%22Seal+of+Biliteracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxcHkg_PeAhXht1kKHSxWBmkQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seal%20of%20Biliteracy%22&amp;f=false|title=An Asset-Based Approach to Latino Education in the United States: Understanding Gaps and Advances|last=Garcia|first=Eugene E.|last2=Ozturk|first2=Mehmet|date=2017-12-15|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781134835898|location=|pages=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SoBL is meant to encourage students towards [[Literacy|biliteracy]] in their first language and in English and to prepare for future bilingual teachers, as these candidates will already have proficiency in the four language domains. It originated in California in 2008 and was formally adopted by the state in 2011. 

== About ==
This SoBL is a seal that can be earned by students who are learning a second language aside from their native English or who are learning [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]] and will be noted on the recipient's transcript or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leadwithlanguages.org/language-advocacy/the-biliteracy-seal/|title=The Seal of Biliteracy|last=|first=|date=|work=Lead with Languages|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/seal-of-biliteracy-ells/|title=What the Seal of Biliteracy Can Do for English Language Learners|website=New America|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates for the SoBl can be bilingual in any two languages, which includes American Sign Language, and have proficiency in all language domains such as listening, speaking, reading and writing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sealofbiliteracy.org/faq/|title=The Seal of Biliteracy|website=The Seal of Biliteracy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Kristin J. Davin and Amy J. Heineke have stated that the program's benefits are stronger efforts for academic success, bilingualism, and official recognition for their efforts. 

In the United States, biliteracy has not always been the method of teaching English to [[English-language learner|English Language Learners]] (ELLs). In the past ELLs learned through the Sink or Swim method of total English immersion education, not having culturally relevant testing questions, or equitable assessment in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, E., Henderson, K. and Hinojosa, R. (2014) An Overview of U.S. Bilingual Education: Historical Roots, Legal Battles and Recent Trends. Texas Education Review 2 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent behind the SoBL is that it will, “offer a promising policy solution to increase biliteracy among K–12 students, both as a means to promote the maintenance of students’ home languages and encourage native English speakers to study additional languages” and make them "attractive to future employers".&lt;ref&gt;Davin, K. J. &amp; Heineke, A. J. . (2018). The Seal of Biliteracy: Adding students’ voices to the conversation. Bilingual Research Journal, 41(3), 312–328. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15235882.2018.1481896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and eligibility ==
The SoBL was first developed in California in 2008 by Californians Together and was implemented in 2010 along with [[Velázquez Press]]. In 2011, legislation creating a California State Seal of Biliteracy was passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPA2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Seal+of+Biliteracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxcHkg_PeAhXht1kKHSxWBmkQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seal%20of%20Biliteracy%22&amp;f=false|title=Promoting the Educational Success of Children and Youth Learning English: Promising Futures|last=|first=|date=2017-08-25|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309455404|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been adopted by multiple states, including Colorado and New Jersey. It is only awarded to students in the public school system; students in private schools are not eligible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/el/er/ssbfaq.asp|title=State Seal of Biliteracy FAQs - Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=CA Dept of Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain this Seal students must pass a proficiency exam. In the state of California students have to pass the the California Assessment of English Performance and Progress before they may obtain this Seal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Students must also complete all ELA (English Language Arts) courses with a grade point average of 2.0 or above prior to high-school graduation in order to be eligible to obtain the Seal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The SoBL has been adopted into legislature in multiple states and the District of Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmplBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=%22Seal+of+Biliteracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYpL-0hPPeAhXiwVkKHZrkBlQ4ChDoAQgpMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Seal%20of%20Biliteracy%22&amp;f=false|title=The Bilingual Advantage: Language, Literacy and the US Labor Market|last=Callahan|first=Rebecca M.|last2=Gándara|first2=Patricia C.|date=2014-10-03|publisher=[[Channel View Publications|Multilingual Matters]]|year=|isbn=9781783092444|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; however elements defined as barriers to success by students includes a lack of awareness of the Seal and the assessment exams needed to obtain the Seal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sealofbiliteracy.org/doc/seal-biliteracy-implementation-benefits-challenges.pdf|title=Seal of Biliteracy Implementation: Benefits &amp; Challenges|last=|first=|date=|website=Seal of Biliteracy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students expressed a lack of awareness and preparedness until their senior year of high-school and in turn this made them ineligible for the seal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specific schools that have implemented the SoBL include [[Norwalk High School (California)|Norwalk High School]] in California and [[Logan-Rogersville High School|Logan-Rogersville High Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l in Missouri.

The '''Southern Legal Resource Center, Inc.''' (SLRC) is a [[South Carolina]] [[non-profit]] [[public law]] corporation&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt; which offers legal support to defend what they see as [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] violations, violation of [[civil rights]], or [[discrimination]] against advocates of [[Southern Heritage]].

==History==
The SLRC was founded in 1995 by a group of four attorneys: [[Carl A. Barrington]] (deceased), [[Kirk David Lyons]], Larry Norman, and [[Lourie A. Salley, III]]. Lyons was appointed Chief Trial Counsel, a position he still holds, and Salley became the firm's first Board Chairman. The organization is a registered South Carolina corporation with its executive offices in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina|Black Mountain]], [[North Carolina]].

In 1996, the SLRC successfully defended the "[[Blacksburg (SC) 7]]" and in 1999 sued a Greenville, South Carolina, private academy on behalf of Dr. Winston McCuen, a teacher at the school who had been fired for refusing to remove a Confederate flag that was part of a classroom historical display, and for refusing to salute the US in protest.

In 2004 the SLRC hired advertising executive and Southern activist [[Roger McCredie]] as its full-time Executive Director. Under McCredie the organization doubled the size of its Board of Directors, increased its advertising program and undertook an ambitious five-year growth and development plan.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Roger McCredie November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==SLRC Advocacy==

The SLRC, was the first law firm to promote a legal theory developed by Lyons that combined First Amendment protection with an interpretation of the "National Origin" provision of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that would afford federal legal protection for what Lyons termed "[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Southern Americans." Using this interpretation of Civil Rights law, the SLRC undertook cases on behalf of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] workers in Florida, utility company employees in South Carolina, workers at a DuPont plant in Virginia (the "[[DuPont Seven]]"), and Cherokee students in Alabama. Federal judges have shown almost universal hostility to legal protection for "Confederate Southern Americans," but Lyons and the SLRC still advocate for clients claiming an increase in the number of job-related persecution of "Confederate Southern Americans" and a paucity of legal protection in the workplace save for cases that come under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Lyons has noted that "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] judges are adamantly opposed to any extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Judges are hostile to almost all things Confederate."{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The SLRC has supported the rights of students to use and display Confederate symbols. Its most significant victory was [[Castorina v. Madison County Schools]], in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] in 2001 overturned a federal district court's ruling in favor of a Kentucky school board's ban on student displays of Confederate symbols, and remanded the case for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Castorina v. Madison County Schools, [1] (6th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the Castorina decision led to an out-of-court award of damages for [[Jacqueline Duty]], an SLRC client who had sued her own school board after she was barred from attending her high school prom in a [[Confederate flag]]-patterned evening gown.

==Criticism==
The SLRC has drawn fire from the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which has frequently attacked the SLRC by citing Lyons' pre-SLRC defense of some controversial right-wing figures such as [[Aryan Nations]] members, [[White Aryan Resistance]] founder [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]]&lt;ref&gt;"In the Lyons Den: Kirk Lyons, a white supremacist lawyer whose clients have been a 'Who's Who' of the radical right". Southern Poverty Law Center. Summer 2000. {{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=251 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807074726/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=251 |archivedate=2007-08-07 |df= }}. Retrieved 2007-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lyons' 1990 marriage to the sister of jailed [[The Order (white supremacist group)|Order]] defendant David Tate. The SPLC also criticized Lyons tie to [[Deborah Davila]]'s [[FBI]] [[espionage]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=26|title=Spy vs. Spy: Kirk Lyons, linked by the FBI to a bizarre espionage case|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|date=Spring 2003|first= |last=  |accessdate =2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the SPLC has called Southern Legal's fundraising practices "deceitful" citing, for example, "the SLRC Web site detailed two disputes under a headline that read 'Cases Pending,' implying that the SLRC represented the parties involved. In both cases, the plaintiff's families say Lyons actually did very little for them."&lt;ref&gt;"Cashing in on the Confederacy". Southern Poverty Law Center. Spring 2003. {{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714195211/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=26 |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }}. Retrieved 2007-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Kirk Lyons and SLRC Director Neill Payne befriended [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] [[NAACP]] President [[H. K. Edgerton]]. In response, the NAACP deprived Edgerton of his presidency. Edgerton became a "born-again Confederate" and for a time served as an SLRC Director and Chairman of the SLRC's Board of Advisors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=="Confederate Southern Americans"==

The SLRC has called on "Confederate Southern Americans" to identify as a separate race on the [[2010 United States Census]] form.&lt;ref name="race"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/declare-confederate-southern-american-405738.html|title=Declare 'Confederate Southern American' on Census forms, group says|accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19065">'''Spatial citizenship''' describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal [[space|spatial]] decision making through the [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as [[map]]s, [[virtual globe]]s, [[GIS]], and the [[Geoweb]]). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. [[Convention (norm)|social rule]]s, [[spatial planning]]) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.

Spatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are [[Emancipation|emancipatory]] forms of [[citizenship]] and the "reflexive appropriation of space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boscaljon |first=Daniel |date=Spring 2014 |title=The reflexive appropriation of space |journal=Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=15 |pages=3–11 |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1438&amp;context=ijcs |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in citizenship education ==
Spatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: 
* Spatial citizenship respects multiple institutional and locational setups. It is de-linked from traditional national "citizenship" as it is not tied to the nation or local state as predefined spatial entities. Spatial citizenship is based upon the principles of [[human rights]] and [[democracy|democratic negotiation]] to ensure a basis for conciliation and compromise.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It is based on the concept of activist citizenship (in contrast to [[active citizenship]]) formulated by Katharyne Mitchell and Sarah Elwood, who challenge unquestioned social rules that limit participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elwood |first1=Sarah |last2=Mitchell |first2=Katharyne |date=Winter 2013 |title=Another politics is possible: neogeographies, visual spatial tactics, and political formation |journal=Cartographica |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=275–292 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katharyne_Mitchell/publication/265895477_Another_Politics_Is_Possible_Neogeographies_Visual_Spatial_Tactics_and_Political_Formation/links/54c07e490cf28eae4a696b59.pdf |quote=Recognizing neogeography as a site of political formation paves the way toward realizing its broader potential in the development and practice of a critical spatial citizenship. We develop these arguments from a three-year neogeography project conducted with young teens. [...] As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or challenge those put forth by others. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship refers to an open and flexible conception of social institutions. It supplants the notion of belonging to one specific place with the notion of belonging to multiple and fluid [[community|communities]] that may or may not be linked with a particular location on the Earth's surface. Angharad Stephens and Vicki Squire have argued that societal negotiation processes have shifted away from fixed communities due to new information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Angharad Closs |last2=Squire |first2=Vicki |date=June 2012 |title=Politics through a web: citizenship and community unbound |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=551–567 |doi=10.1068/d8511 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13714/1/13714.pdf |quote=What happens to citizenship when the nation and the state are no longer assumed to be the inevitable starting points from which politics is defined? This article considers how a refusal of the nation as political community and a questioning of the state as guarantor of rights and responsibilities reconfigure our understandings of citizenship. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Vânia |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |date=2013 |chapter=Where do critical thinking and spatial citizenship meet? Proposing a framework of intersections |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Car |editor2-first=Adrijana |editor3-last=Strobl |editor3-first=Josef |editor4-last=Griesebner |editor4-first=Gerald |title=Creating the GISociety: conference proceedings |location=Berlin; Offenbach |publisher=Herbert Wichmann Verlag |pages=306–316 |isbn=9783879075324 |oclc=854921245 |chapterurl=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vania_Carlos/publication/270818697_Where_Do_Critical_Thinking_and_Spatial_Citizenship_Meet_Proposing_a_Framework_of_Intersections/links/54b53b5c0cf28ebe92e4dcb0.pdf |quote=Consequently, every citizen can produce own spatial narratives, and can communicate and negotiate them with others in fluent web communities (Closs Stephens &amp; Squire 2012). This links to concepts of emancipated citizenship education (e.g. Bennett, Wells &amp; Rank 2009; Mitchell &amp; Elwood 2012) aimed to challenge existing frameworks of rules, referring to an ideological approach that considers power relations and divergent interests in society as driving forces. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship draws special attention to [[web community|web communities]] and geo-social networks. A spatial citizen is a 'self-actualizing citizen' who, in contrast to the 'dutiful citizen' concept of the past, is able to use [[Web 2.0]] and [[cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications to compare different and potentially contradicting information sources and communicate his/her own alternative ideas via [[collaboration|collaborative]] web tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=W. Lance |last2=Wells |first2=Chris |last3=Rank |first3=Allison |date=April 2009 |title=Young citizens and civic learning: two paradigms of citizenship in the digital age |journal=Citizenship Studies |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=105–120 |doi=10.1080/13621020902731116 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lance_Bennett/publication/248984320_Young_citizens_and_civic_learning_Two_paradigms_of_citizenship_in_the_digital_age/links/53e336b70cf275a5fddab4db.pdf |quote=The preponderance of school-based civic education programs reflects traditional paradigms of dutiful citizenship (DC) oriented to government through parties and voting, with citizens forming attentive publics who follow events in the news. The authors expand upon these conventional learning categories by identifying additional civic learning opportunities that reflect more self-actualizing (AC) styles of civic participation common among recent generations of youth who have been termed digital natives. Their AC learning styles favor interactive, networked activities often communicated through participatory media such as videos shared across online networks. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gryl |first1=Inga |last2=Jekel |first2=Thomas |date=2012 |title=Re-centring geoinformation in secondary education: toward a spatial citizenship approach |journal=Cartographica |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |doi=10.3138/carto.47.1.18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in social geography: appropriation of space ==
Spatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented [[social geography]] and new [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jekel |first1=Thomas |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |last3=Schulze |first3=Uwe |date=2015 |chapter=Education for spatial citizenship |editor1-last=Solari |editor1-first=Osvaldo Muñiz |editor2-last=Demirci |editor2-first=Ali |editor3-last=Schee |editor3-first=Joop |title=Geospatial technologies and geography education in a changing world: geospatial practices and lessons learned |location=Tōkyō; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=35–49 |isbn=9784431555186 |oclc=900306594 |doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55519-3_4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Werlen |first=Benno |date=1993 |title=Society action and space: an alternative human geography |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415069653 |oclc=25372963 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

In these theories, spaces are regarded as being [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and [[discourse]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of [[Power (social and political)|social power relations]], the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the [[deconstruction]] of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a "us". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;Sbicca, Joshua and Perdue, Robert. (2014). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14742837.2013.822782 Protest Through Presence: Spatial Citizenship and Identity Formation in Contestations of Neoliberal Crises] Social Movement Studies, Volume 13, Issue 4 pp. 309-327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial citizenship in the geoinformation society ==
Geographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to [[mobile computing]] in combination with [[Geoweb]] applications. For instance, maps on [[smart phone]]s guide people in their everyday actions, but at the same time limit their opportunities for action by limiting the variety of potential meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Florian |date=2014 |chapter=Everyday geomedia use and the appropriation of space |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Sanchez |editor2-first=Eric |editor3-last=Gryl |editor3-first=Inga |editor4-last=Juneau-Sion |editor4-first=Caroline |editor5-last=Lyon |editor5-first=John |title=Learning and teaching with geomedia |location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=10–28 |isbn=9781443862134 |oclc=885014629 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDxQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of spatial citizenship understand geo-media as instruments of [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] and [[communication]].
* Reflection on geo-media means reflecting on the limitations of previously given meanings by using theories of [[critical cartography]] to ask which aspects of potential relevance for a certain spatial problem or decision making are included and excluded in the given meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harley |first=John Brian |date=Summer 1989 |title=Deconstructing the map |journal=Cartographica |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008?rgn=main;view=fulltext |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, self-reflection requires being aware of one's own, [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[hypothesis]] construction while using geo-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEachren |first1=Alan M. |last2=Buttenfield |first2=Barbara P. |last3=Campbell |first3=James B. |last4=DiBiase |first4=David W. |last5=Monmonier |first5=Mark |date=1992 |chapter=Visualization |editor1-last=Abler |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Marcus |editor2-first=Melvin G. |editor3-last=Olson |editor3-first=Judy M. |title=Geography's inner worlds: pervasive themes in contemporary American geography |series=Occasional publications of the Association of American Geographers |volume=2 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |pages=99–137 |isbn=0813518296 |oclc=25008961 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aspects allow for a more mature appropriation of space with geo-media, while being aware of and gaining insight into the construction process of meanings attached to space.
* Communication with geo-media means communicating using spatial representations. Thanks to [[usability|user-friendly]] [[web mapping]] tools within the Geoweb, users ([[prosumer]]s) can easily produce their own geo-media and share it web-wide. Collaboration features allow for the negotiation of constructions of space with other users, for example through [[volunteered geographic information]] (VGI). The study of spatial citizenship examines subjectivity, impact on everyday action, social power relations, competition, and negotiation in VGI.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Spatial citizenship also aims at increasing awareness of [[geographic information]] produced involuntarily by users through automatic data collection that many Geoweb platforms (especially mobile phones) include to support the interests of service providers (see [[location-based service]]s).

== Education ==
The goal of education for spatial citizenship is to enable learners to achieve a reflexive appropriation of space as the basis for mature action in space by reflective geo-media use and active, reflective geo-media production.&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"/&gt; Using a broad variety of learning environments orientated toward the learners' needs, the educational approach of spatial citizenship is applicable at different levels from [[primary education|primary]] to [[tertiary education]]. Apart from technological proficiency, spatial citizenship education aims at two additional main competencies:
* Being able to achieve a reflective use of geo-media, while understanding the process of the social construction of spaces, with the result of either consciously accepting given meanings or producing alternative meanings.
* Being able to communicate alternative meanings effectively with geo-media and using geo-media as instruments to support [[argumentation]] in negotiation processes on contradictory meanings.

== Scientific response ==
The [[European Commission]]-funded project SPACIT furthers education for spatial citizenship by developing teacher training standards, [[curriculum|curricula]], and learning modules for teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPACIT: education for spatial citizenship |url=http://www.spatialcitizenship.org/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-10-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another EU-funded project, digital-earth.eu, linked with the SPACIT project by connecting stakeholders using or interested in using geo-media in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital-earth.eu |url=http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112227/http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported spatial citizenship through the creation of [[Standards-based education reform|educational standards]], the collection of best-practice examples, and the provision of learning environments applicable to teachers in everyday classroom situations. Digital-earth.eu also promoted these concepts related to spatial citizenship in political circles concerned with the development of the Europe2020 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe2020: Europe's growth strategy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-11-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Student Council Members.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Members of a student council]]
A '''student council''' (also known as a '''student union''' or '''associated student body''') is a [[Curriculum|curricular]] or [[extracurricular activity]] for [[student]]s within elementary and secondary schools around the world. These councils are present in most [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school|private]] [[K-12]] school systems across the United States, Canada, Greece, Australia and Asia. Student councils often serve to [[student engagement|engage students]] in learning about [[democracy]] and [[leadership]], as originally espoused by [[John Dewey]] in ''[[Wikisource:Democracy and Education|Democracy and Education]]'' (1917).

==Function==
The student council helps share [[student voice|students’ ideas, interests, and concerns]] with [[teacher]]s and [[school principal]]s. They often also help raise funds for school-wide activities, including social events, community projects, helping people in need and [[school reform]]. Most schools participate in food drives, fundraisers and parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellow-springs.k12.oh.us/ys-mls/student%20council.htm "Student Council"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211061224/http://www.yellow-springs.k12.oh.us/ys-mls/student%20council.htm |date=2007-12-11 }}, Mills Lawn School.

Retrieved 11/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many members learn skills that were an extension of their formal education.

Student councils operate in many forms. There are representative-based and modeled loosely after the [[U.S. Congress]], or based on the [[Executive Branch]] of the [[United States]], with a President, Vice-President, secretary, treasurer, and reporter. In this form student representatives and officers are usually elected from and by the [[student body]], although there may be prerequisites for candidacy or suffrage. In [[elementary schools]], there are typically one or two student representatives per classroom and one presiding set of officers. However, many [[secondary schools]] have one set of officers per grade level.

An example of the structure of an [[elementary school|elementary]] student council may include a president, a vice president, secretary, treasurer, sergeant of arms, fundraising officer, historian, boys rep, and girls rep. These roles may be assigned or voted on, either within the student council or by the entire student body. They may also reflect descending grade-levels, with the president in the oldest grade, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcps.k12.md.us/departments/studentaffairs/pdf/sa/resources/aboutsga/yearjourney.pdf "A Journey Through the Student Council School Year œ Elementary Focus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201044700/http://www.mcps.k12.md.us/departments/studentaffairs/pdf/sa/resources/aboutsga/yearjourney.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }}, Montgomery County Public Schools. Retrieved 11/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary school governments often have more independence and power than younger governments. Often a student government is overseen by a sponsor, which is usually a teacher at that particular school. Most [[junior high school|junior or middle school]] student councils have a constitution of some sort and usually do not have a judicial branch.&lt;ref&gt;English, U.

ED103795. Retrieved 11/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to elementary school councils, junior high and high school councils generally have fewer people.

In some schools, a student council representative is assigned to each class. That person passes on requests, ideas and complaints from students in that class to the student council. In other schools, the elected [[Class Officers]] are automatically members of the student council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcps.edu/EdisonHS/updates/Letter%20and%20petition.pdf "Student Government Association Officers' Petition"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} FAIRFAX COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS website&lt;/ref&gt;

Student councils usually do not have funding authority and generally must generate their operating funds through [[fundraising|fundraisers]] such as car washes and bake sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michiganprincipals.org/masc/fundraising.htm "Fundraising ideas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312105000/http://www.michiganprincipals.org/masc/fundraising.htm |date=2008-03-12 }}, Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals. Retrieved 11/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Some student councils have a budget from the school, along with responsibility for funding a variety of student activities within a school.

The '''Texas Tech University System''' is a [[state university system]] in [[Texas]] consisting of four separate universities in the state of Texas, of which two are academic institutions: [[Angelo State University]] and [[Texas Tech University]], and two are health institutions: [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], and [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso]]. The System is headquartered in the Administration Building on the [[Texas Tech University]] campus in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.texastech.edu/bor/contact.php Board of Regents Contact Information]." ''Texas Tech University System''. Retrieved on November 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On February 10, 1923, Texas Technological College (now named [[Texas Tech University]]) was founded, and that August, a committee selected to locate the institution in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. The Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (now named the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System) was established to oversee the institution.

In 1969, the Texas Tech University School of Medicine (now named [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]), was founded as separate multi-campus institution from Texas Tech University. It was also overseen by same board of regents as Texas Tech University.

In 1985, then state senator, and future TTU System chancellor, John Montford proposed the creation of the Texas Tech University System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lubbockonline.com/news/122296/question.htm|title=Questions emerge as signs point toward Tech systemBy MATTHEW HENRYAvalanche-|work=lubbockonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Texas Legislature formally established the Texas Tech University System, consisting of the same two institutions, overseen by the board of regents, and the newly created position of chancellor to provide leadership and support for both Texas Tech University, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

In 2007, [[Angelo State University]] left the [[Texas State University System]] and joined the Texas Tech System. On May 18, 2013, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso]] was established as a separate university in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]].

The government, control, and direction of the Texas Tech University System is vested in a nine-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature.  Each Regent serves a six-year term, and appointments are staggered so that three members of the Board's terms expire in odd-numbered years. In addition to the nine members, there also is a student regent who is appointed by the governor to serve a one-year term that begins on June 1 of each year.

In 1923, Governor [[Pat Neff]] appointed the first members of the Board of Directors of Texas Technological College (as the council was known until 1969). When the name of Texas Technological College was changed in 1969, so did the council to: Board of Regents of Texas Tech University.&lt;ref&gt;Rushing &amp; Nall Pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The council has been known by its current name, [[Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System]], after the Texas Tech University System was established in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7291">'''The Songs of the Jewish Shtetle''' is a cultural musical project aimed at preserving the [[Jewish]] cultural heritage. The project has gathered songs in [[Yiddish]], a [[language]] put on the Red List of Threatened Languages by [[UNESCO]]. Before World War II the number of native Yiddish speakers amounted to 11 million people. During [[Holocaust]] 6 million Jewish people were killed, thus the number of Yiddish speakers halved. The language continued in literature, oral speech, Ashkenazi folklore, and in songs. These songs reflect habits and ways, language and music, the soul of the Jewish people. The attitude to parents, children, neighbours, religion, work, native home, the world around and themselves, to life and death – all this is expressed in the art of singing, and each of the Songs of Jewish Shtetle becomes a little music play. The project is unique as the Jewish songs in Yiddish, which had been persecuted for centuries, the songs that had only been played by small klezmer ensembles before, were for the first time performed with all the vivacity of a big symphony orchestra.

[[Efim Alexandrov]], the author, art director and soloist of the project, Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation, singer and custodian of Yiddish song tradition, was awarded for his cultural activities including this project, with the Russian National Award “Person of the Year” in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoiswho.ru/yearman/yearmen2001/|title=Russian National Prize "Person of the year"-2001|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Russian Biographic Institute|accessdate=2011-06-21|language=ru| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/69qCzsl04 | archivedate = 2012-08-11| deadurl=no}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the “Person of the Year – 5764” Award of the [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feor.ru/yearman/?year=2004&amp;id=71|title=Person of the Year Award/2004/"Music"|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia|accessdate=2011-06-21|language=ru| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/69qD1CugI | archivedate = 2012-08-11| deadurl=no}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At "The Golden Nine" annual ceremony, where those who contributed most to all the spheres of Israeli society are rewarded, Efim Alexandrov was awarded by Israel television channel [[Israel Plus]] the special prize of "The Golden Nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9.zahav.ru/golden/2005/|title=The Golden Nine - Person of the Year|author=|date=2005-11-16|work=|publisher=Zahav.ru|accessdate=2011-06-21|language=ru| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/69qD3L9er | archivedate = 2012-08-11| deadurl=no}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his contribution to the world Jewish culture.

In 2001 the first night of The Songs of Jewish Shtetle was held at the Novaya Opera theatre in [[Moscow]] under the patronage of the International Charity Fund of Yuri Bashmet.

The concert program included not only the songs created in Jewish shtetles in the Yiddish language, but also those that were written by people who left the shtetles after the Pale of Settlement had been abolished. In the 10 years that the project exists several concert programs have been created, and over 150 The Songs of Jewish Shtetle concerts have been played in the USA, Canada, Germany, Israel, Australia, Russia, and CIS countries. Efim Alexandrov is engaged in continuous research to restore the Yiddish musical culture. Together with the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra conducted by Sergey Skripka they recorded several CDs of songs from Jewish shtetles of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Two concerts, one at the Novaya Opera theatre in Moscow, the other at the State Central Concert Hall “Rossiya”, were filmed and later broadcast in many countries.
The project presents traditional Jewish folk songs, as well as songs composed by S. Kemelmakher, E.Alexandrov, V.Shainsky, I.Lyublinsky, lyrics by S.Kemelmakher, B.Zitserman, M.Tanich, I.Kerler and others. Since 2001 several concert programs were created.

The first concert program of The Songs of Jewish Shtetle featured songs that were included in "The Songs of Jewish Shtetle" music album:
* Lechaim ({{lang-yi|לעכײַם}})
* Kinder yorn ({{lang-yi|קינדער יאָרן}})

'''Álvaro Joaquim de Melo Siza Vieira''', {{small|[[Order of St. James of the Sword|GOSE]], [[Order of Infante D. Henrique|GCIH]], [[Order of Public Instruction (Portugal)|GCIP]]}} (born 25 June 1933), is a Portuguese [[architect]], and [[architectural educator]]. He is internationally known as '''Alvaro Siza''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈaɫvɐɾu ˈsizɐ}}) and in Portugal as '''Siza Vieira''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈsizɐ ˈvjejɾɐ}}).

==Life and career==
Siza was born in [[Matosinhos]], a small coastal town near [[Porto]].  He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the [[University of Porto]], the current [[Porto School of Architecture|FAUP]] &amp;ndash; ''Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto''. He completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Siza Vieira taught at the school from 1966 to 1969, returning in 1976. In addition to his teaching there, he has been a visiting professor at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design, Harvard University]]; the [[University of Pennsylvania]]; Los Andes University of Bogota; and the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]].&lt;ref name="Pritzker"&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/1992/bio.html Pritzker Architecture Prize: Alvaro Siza Vieira] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222001519/http://pritzkerprize.com/laureates/1992/bio.html |date=22 December 2010 }}, retrieved 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Fernando Távora]], he is one of the references of the [[Porto School of Architecture]] where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], e.g. on Portugal's [[Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98|flagship pavilions]] at [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon and [[Expo 2000]] in Hannover, as well as on the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Pavillon]] 2005. Siza's work is often described as "poetic [[modernism]]";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/08/alvaro.siza.riba.prize Jonathan Glancey: ''A Gold Medal for Siza? About time''] in ''The Guardian'', 8 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; he himself has contributed to publications on [[Luis Barragán]].

Among Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named [[Piscinas de Marés]]) he created in the 1960s for Leça da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/arts/a-portuguese-wins-pritzker-award.html |title= A Portuguese Wins Pritzker Award |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= 27 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of [[Évora]] commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (''Serviço de Apoio Ambulatório Local''), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards.&lt;ref name="Pritzker"/&gt; He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.

Most of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the [[FAUP|Faculty of Architecture]] (1987–93), and the [[Serralves Foundation|Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art]] (1997). Since the mid-1970s, Siza has been involved in numerous designs for public housing, public pools,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Lynch (23 October 2008), [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/lvaro-siza-swimming-pools-with-depth/1904917.article Álvaro Siza: swimming pools with depth] ''The Architect's Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt; and universities. Between 1995 and 2009, Siza has been working on an architecture museum on Hombroich island, completed in collaboration with Rudolf Finsterwalder.&lt;ref&gt;Kieran Long (1 August 2009), [http://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/pavilion-by-lvaro-siza-and-rudolf-finsterwalder-insel-hombroich-foundation-ruhr-valley-germany/8600969.article Pavilion by Álvaro Siza and Rudolf Finsterwalder, Insel Hombroich Foundation, Ruhr Valley, Germany] ''The Architectural Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he started coordinating the rehabilitation of the monuments and architectonic heritage of [[Cidade Velha]] (Old Village) in Santiago, an island of Cape Verde.

Commissioned after winning an international competition in 2010, Siza and Granada-based Juan Domingo Santos unveiled designs for a new entrance and visitors center at the [[Alhambra]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Karissa Rosenfield (March 11, 2014), [http://www.archdaily.com/485230/alvaro-siza-juan-domingo-santos-design-new-gate-of-alhambra/ Álvaro Siza + Juan Domingo Santos Design “New Gate of Alhambra”] ''ArchDaily''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 Siza announced his decision to donate the large part of his architectural archive to the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] (CCA) in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada, in order to make his materials "accessible alongside the work of other modern and contemporary architects",&lt;ref&gt;Siza, Álvaro (23 July 2014), [http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/2459 "Álvaro Siza's Archive"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] (CCA)''.&lt;/ref&gt; while also giving specific project archives to the [[Fundação Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]] and [[Fundação de Serralves]] in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Luís Miguel |last= Qeuirós |date= 9 July 2015 |url=http://www.publico.pt/culturaipsilon/noticia/alvaro-siza-doa-40-projectos-a-serralves-1701463 |title=Álvaro Siza doa 40 projectos a Serralves |newspaper= [[Público (Portugal)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
