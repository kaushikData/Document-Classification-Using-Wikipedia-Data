'''Proposition 227'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[California ballot proposition]] passed on the June 2, 1998, ballot. Proposition 227 was repealed by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] on November 8, 2016.

According to [[Ballotpedia]], "Proposition 227 changed the way that "Limited English Proficient" (LEP) students are taught in [[California]]. Specifically, it
*Required [[California public schools]] to teach LEP students in special classes that are taught nearly all in English. This provision had the effect of eliminating "bilingual" classes in most cases.
*Shortened the time that most LEP students stayed in special classes.
*Eliminated most programs in the state that provided multi-year special classes to LEP students by requiring that (1) LEP students move from special classes to regular classes when they had acquired a good working knowledge of English and (2) these special classes not normally last longer than one year.
*Required the state government to provide $50 million every year for ten years for English classes for adults who promised to tutor LEP students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_%281998%29#cite_note-city-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill's intention was to educate [[Limited English proficiency]] students in a rapid, one-year program. It was sponsored by [[Ron Unz]], the runner-up candidate in the 1994 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial primary. The proposition was controversial because of its close proximity to heated political issues including [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]]. The methods of education enacted by the proposition reflected the electorate's support of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] over [[multiculturalism]]. It passed with a margin of 61% to 39%.

On September 28, 2014, the state legislature passed, and Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed, Senate Bill 1174, which added [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] to the November 2016 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1174 | title=Senate Bill No. 1174, Chapter 753 | work = [[California Legislature]] | accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 58, which repealed most of Proposition 227, passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ulloa |first=Jazmine |title=California will bring back bilingual education as Proposition 58 cruises to victory |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-58-bilingual-1478220414-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of bilingual credentials fell after Proposition 227's passage. A [[California Department of Education]] spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers after the passage of Proposition 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renee |first=Alexa |title=Prop 58: Higher demand for bilingual teachers not helping teacher shortage |work=ABC 10 |location=Sacramento |date=November 9, 2016 |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/california/prop-58-higher-demand-for-bilingual-teachers-not-helping-teacher-shortage/350584412 |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}
An '''academic honor code''' or [[honor system]] is a set of rules or [[ethical]] principles governing an academic community based on [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]] that define what constitutes [[Honour|honorable]] behaviour within that community.  The use of an honor code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] to act honorably.  Those who are in violation of the honor code can be subject to various [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from the institution.  Honor codes are used to deter [[academic dishonesty]] and should be taken seriously at all times.

==History==
The documented history of an academic honor code dates back to 1736 at [[The College of William and Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324161444/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the oldest honor code in the United States. Still a tradition, students administer the honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the College. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs. The College of William and Mary founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=History &amp; Traditions - William &amp; Mary|author=|date=|website=www.wm.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203155247/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|archivedate=December 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon the premise that honor is one's most cherished attribute.

In a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor among individuals must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony among its members. An honor system is an ideal mechanism to ensure such a state of affairs. With it, students and faculty are afforded a freedom that otherwise may not be available. With that freedom comes each individual's responsibility to conduct oneself in such a way that the spirit of mutual trust which sustains the system is not compromised.

The Honor Code applies to alleged acts of lying, stealing or cheating that adversely affect the College community committed by a student on campus or elsewhere.

==US military service academies==
Presently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the [[United States Military Academy]] (see [[Cadet Honor Code]]), [[Virginia Military Institute]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]], and the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. The [[United States Naval Academy]] has an "[[Honor Concept]]," which is similar in scope to the honor codes at the other academies.

The military academy honor codes not only govern the [[Officer cadet|cadets']] and [[midshipman|midshipmen's]] lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes' ethical standards at all times.  The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at [[Virginia Military Institute]], which features a "drum out" ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal. Outside of the military, [[Washington and Lee University]] and the [[University of Virginia]] also have single sanction codes.

At three of the service academies and at Virginia Military Institute, anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|title=VMI Honor System History - VMI Archives - Virginia Military Institute|author=|date=|website=www.vmi.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803180952/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|archivedate=August 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to do so is considered "toleration," which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as [[Norwich University]], [[Texas A&amp;M]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not "tolerate those who do." It is notable that the three [[Senior Military Colleges]] have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203841/http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archivedate=September 14, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920090937/http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen.  A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one's true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies' honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |title=DoD Directive 1332.23, "Service Academy Disenrollment", February 19, 1988 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133445/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions. The all-male [[Hampden–Sydney College]] is reputed for an honor code system on a par with military systems,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} which extends to all student activities both on and off campus (off-campus violations can be prosecuted), and also like the military system, it considers tolerance of a violation itself a violation. Like the Naval Academy, however, those who witness a violation are encouraged to confront the violator and convince them to turn themselves in before resorting to reporting the violation. Another school with a very strict honor code is [[Brigham Young University]]. The university not only mandates honest behavior but also incorporates various aspects of [[Mormon]] religious law: drinking, smoking, drug use, and premarital sex are all banned. Also, the code includes standards for dress and grooming. Men must be clean-shaven, and men and women cannot wear short shorts or other revealing clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php#HCOfficeInvovement|title= Honor Code Statement|publisher= Brigham Young University|accessdate= 2011-04-07|work= Honour Code Office|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414163048/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php#HCOfficeInvovement|archivedate= April 14, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences between the honor codes of different universities. 
*The [[University of Virginia]] opts for a system run by elected students and involving randomly chosen students. 
*[[Bryn Mawr College]] holds its students to a high degree of trust with their Honor Code which is revised yearly and ruled by the Honor Board.
*[[Connecticut College]] students uphold academic excellence and high community standards by practicing responsible citizenship that protects the core principles of the College. With the privilege of having a diverse student body, students should be able to interact and learn from each other in ways that uphold community respect and personal freedom. The honor system at Connecticut College is unique in that it is upheld and presided over by a student-governed judicial process. Because the Honor Code is taken very seriously by students, there is a strong trust between students, faculty and administration. The Honor Code sets the tone for campus life and acts as a philosophy to live by through demonstrating a commitment to personal participation in improving the quality of life in our community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/honor-code-shared-governance/the-honor-code/ |title=The Honour Code |publisher=Connecticut College |accessdate=2013-04-22 |work=Connecticut College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509053109/http://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/honor-code-shared-governance/the-honor-code/ |archivedate=May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Haverford College]] holds an honor code which is ratified by students yearly and run by an elected body, the Honor Council. This code is concerned with an academic as well as a social component, demanding equal respect among students, in contrast to the military academies' focus on hierarchy. 
*[[Davidson College]] also holds a dual honor code. According to a legend surrounding the Davidson code, a student was put on trial for not reporting an extra can of soda dispensed by a vending machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 
*[[Princeton University]] has maintained a student-run Honor Code for over one hundred years, a unique policy compared to those of other Ivy League schools. 
*[[Vanderbilt University]] has also been governed by an Honor Code since its founding. [[First year]] students attend an honor code ceremony to protect the traditions and [[academic integrity]] of the university. A plaque of the honor code is engraved in the student life center with a quote by once-Chancellor Madison Sarratt, "Today I give you two examinations, one in [[trigonometry]] and one in [[honesty]]. I hope you pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry for there are many good men in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good men in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty." 
*[[The University of Texas School of Law]] sets its Honor Code as a first step in the obligation of its students to the legal profession: "All law students are harmed by unethical behaviour by any student. A student who deals dishonestly with fellow law students may be dishonest in the future and harm both future clients and the legal profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|title= School of Law Honour Code|publisher= University of Texas|accessdate= 2008-03-05|work= Office of the Registrar|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220085948/http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|archivedate= February 20, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this approach to the honor code in the grand scheme of the legal profession, honor code violations are reported to the State Bar of Texas and the violator's home state bar, thus creating an impediment to licensure. UT Law School is unique in that regard. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 
*[[James Madison University]] holds its students to an Honor Code overseen by the Honor Council.  The honor code at JMU was founded in 1909 and the Honor Council is an organisation run by students.  A student who violates the code, if found "responsible", may receive anywhere from a letter grade reduction to expulsion from the university for a first time offense, while second time offenders are either suspended from the university for a semester or expelled. "The Honor Council at James Madison University is committed to instilling, promoting, and upholding individual and collective academic integrity.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|title= James Madison University Honor Code|publisher= JMU|accessdate= 2010-06-28|work= JMU Honour Council|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100951/http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|archivedate= May 28, 2010|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[Meredith College]], an all-women's institution, all first year students attend an Honor Code ceremony, where they sign a statement promising to uphold the values of the Code.  The Code places a high emphasis on integrity and good judgement.  Meredith College is unique in the fact that its judicial board (the Honor Council) is primarily governed by students, including the Chair who also sits on the Student Government Association executive board, and the Solicitor General, who facilitates and investigates all incoming reports.&lt;ref name="Meredith College Student Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meredith College Student Handbook|url=http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|website=Meredith College|publisher=Meredith College|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193843/http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|archivedate=April 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors about the Honor Code at Meredith include that students are not allowed to walk on the grass and must remain on the sidewalks.  Male visitation hours, or "boy hours," are a common violation at a school that does not allow men to stay overnight in the residence halls.  However criticized it may be for being outdated, Meredith's Honor Code has evolved with the times and can be seen in the school's archives. 
*[[Washington and Lee University]] and its [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Law School]] feature an honor system in which all students are expected to act as gentlemen and women. The system governs both academic and social aspects of the university and is administered by the Executive Committee which includes the student body president. The honor system has a single penalty—expulsion. If allegations surface of a student violating the honor system they are given the right to a trial and appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/honor-and-testing-at-a-virginia-university/2012/12/12/bc9bfa6a-43ca-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html |title=Honour and testing at a Virginia university |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=2012-12-13 |work=Washington and Lee honour system |first=Nick |last=Anderson |date=December 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525085542/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/honor-and-testing-at-a-virginia-university/2012/12/12/bc9bfa6a-43ca-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html |archivedate=May 25, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexander Technique''', named after its creator [[Frederick Matthias Alexander]], is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that [[Poor posture|poor habits in posture]] and movement damaged spatial [[self-awareness]] as well as health, and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;{{rp|221}}

Alexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rootberg | first = Ruth | title = Voice and Gender and other contemporary issues in professional voice and speech training | journal =  Voice and Speech Review | pages = 164–170 |date=September 2007 | issue = 1 | doi =  | volume = 35 | editor= Mandy Rees}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to address [[voice loss]] during public speaking.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;{{rp|34–35}} He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in [[Shakespearean]] theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harer |first1=John B. |last2=Munden |first2=Sharon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8RlC8aE5foC&amp;dq |title=The Alexander Technique Resource Book: A Reference Guide |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2008 |pages= xii - xiii |isbn=978-0810863927 |accessdate=2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors but there is little evidence to support these claims.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; As of 2015 there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for long-term [[back pain]], long-term [[neck pain]], and may help people cope with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NHS |title=Alexander Technique - NHS Choices |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alexander-technique/Pages/Introduction.aspx|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955) was a Shakespearean [[orator]] from [[Tasmania]], who developed voice loss during his unamplified performances. After doctors found no physical cause, Alexander reasoned that he was inadvertently damaging himself while speaking. He observed himself in multiple mirrors and saw that he was contracting his posture in preparation for any speech. He hypothesized that a habitual conditioned pattern (of pulling his head backwards and downwards) needlessly was disrupting the normal working of his total postural, breathing, and vocal processes.

With experimentation, Alexander developed the ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, displacement of his head, and shortening of his stature. As he became practised at speaking without these interferences, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss was resolved. While on a recital tour in [[New Zealand]] (1895), he came to believe in the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning although evidence from his own publications appears to indicate it happened less systematically and over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;{{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Michael | title = F.M. : the life of Frederick Matthias Alexander : founder of the Alexander technique | publisher = Little, Brown | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-316-86048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

===Influence===

The American [[philosopher]] and [[educator]] [[John Dewey]] became impressed with the Alexander Technique after his [[headache]]s, [[neck pain]]s, [[blurred vision]], and [[Psychological stress|stress]] symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's advice to change his posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, Alan |title=John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=187–188 |isbn=0-393-31550-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Dewey wrote the introduction to Alexander's ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual''.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander, ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923, {{ISBN|0-913111-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldous Huxley]] had transformative lessons with Alexander, and continued doing so with other teachers after moving to the US. He rated Alexander's work highly enough to base the character of the doctor who saves the protagonist in '[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]' (an experimental form of autobiographical work) on F.M. Alexander, putting many of his phrases into the character's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Eyeless in Gaza'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1936 {{ISBN|978-0-06172-489-3}} F. M. Alexander is named in the last section of Chapter 2.  Miller, the character whose description immediately resembles Alexander, appears at the beginning of Chapter 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's work 'The Art of Seeing' also discusses his views on the technique.

Sir [[Stafford Cripps]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Henry Irving]] and other stage grandees, [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] and other eminent people of the era also wrote positive appreciations of his work after taking lessons with Alexander.

Since Alexander's work in the field came at the start of the 20th century, his ideas influenced many originators in the field of mind-body improvement. [[Fritz Perls]], who originated [[Gestalt&amp;nbsp;therapy]], credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mitzvah Technique]] was influenced by the Alexander Technique; as was the [[Feldenkrais Method]] - who expanded on the one exercise in Alexander Technique called "The Whispered Ah."

==Process==

Alexander's approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action, (which could be now called '[[Mindfulness|mindful]]' action, though in his four books he did not use that term.)

Actions such as sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student that is tailored to their interests or work activities: hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or artistic performance or practice, sports, speech or horseback riding. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment-to-moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with a highly skilled light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the student into a more coordinated state in movement and at rest during in-person lessons. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific, as everyone starts out with slightly different habits.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1997"&gt;{{cite web | last = Arnold | first = Joan |author2=Hope Gillerman | title =  Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = American Society for the Alexander Technique | year = 1997 | url = http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html | accessdate =2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a "correct" position. There are only two specific procedures that are practiced by the student; the first is lying [[Supine position#Semi-supine|semi-supine]]. Resting in this way uses "mechanical advantage" as a means of redirecting long-term and short-term accumulated muscular tension into a more integrated and balanced state. This position is sometimes referred to as "constructive rest", or "the balanced resting state". It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of [[conscious]] "directing" without "doing". The second exercise is the "Whispered Ah", which is used to co-ordinate freer breathing and vocal production.

Freedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual conclusions about the nature of training and experimentation. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient, or not in keeping with best "use" of themselves as a whole. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.&lt;ref name="ptjournal.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacciatore | first1 = W | title = Improvement in Automatic Postural Coordination Following Alexander Technique Lessons in a Person With Low Back Pain | url = http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | page = 565 | display-authors = etal | access-date = 15 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029170552/http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | archive-date = 29 October 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This specialized hands-on skill also allows Alexander teachers to bring about a balanced working of the student's supportive musculature as it relates to gravity's downward pull from moment to moment. Often, students require a great deal of hands-on work in order to first gain an experience of a fully poised relation to gravity and themselves. The hands-on skill requires Alexander teachers to maintain in themselves from moment-to-moment their own improved psycho-physical co-ordination that the teacher is [[communicating]] to the student.&lt;ref name="ptjournal.org"/&gt;

[[File:POSITION OF SKELETON IN GOOD AND POOR POSTURE - NARA - 515194.tif|thumb|An illustration of alignment.]]

Alexander developed terminology to describe his methods, outlined in his four books that explain the experience of learning and substituting new improvements.

;Constructive Conscious Control
:Alexander insisted on the need for strategic reasoning because [[kinesthetic]] and [[proprioceptive]] sensory awareness are relative senses, not truthful indicators of a person's factual relationships within him/herself or within the environment. A person's habitual neuro-muscular relation to gravity is habitually sensed internally as "normal," despite being inefficient. Alexander's term, "debauched sensory appreciation" describes how the [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] of an action or response encourages the formation of habits as a person adapts to various circumstances or builds skills. Once trained and forgotten, completed habits may be used without feedback sensations that these habits are in effect, (even when only thinking about the situations that elicit them.)&lt;ref&gt;''Body_Learning – An_Introduction to the Alexander Technique'', Macmillan, 1996 {{ISBN|0805042067}}, quote p. 74, an article in New Scientist by Professor John Basmajian entitled "Conscious Control of Single Nerve Cells"&lt;/ref&gt; Short-sighted habits are capable of becoming harmfully exaggerated over time, such as restricted breathing or other habitually assumed adaptations to past circumstances. Even exaggerated habits will stop after learning to perceive and prevent them.

;End-gaining
:Another example is the term "end-gaining". This term means to focus on a goal so as to lose sight of the "means-whereby"&lt;ref&gt;The subject of "Means whereby, rather than the end, to be considered" is discussed many times in ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'', typically Chapter VI, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; the goal could be most appropriately achieved. According to Alexander teachers, "end-gaining" increases the likelihood of automatically selecting older or multiple conflicting coping strategies. End-gaining is usually carried out because an imperative priority of impatience or frustration justifies it. Excessive speed in thinking and acting often facilitates end-gaining. Going slowly is a strategy to undo "end-gaining."

;Inhibition
:In the Alexander Technique lexicon, the principle of "inhibition" is considered by teachers to be the most important to gaining improved "use." F.M. Alexander's selection of this word predates the meaning of the word originated by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition, or 'intentional inhibition'. It is the act of refraining from responding in one's habitual manner - in particular, imposed tension in neck muscles (see Primary Control). Inhibition describes a moment of conscious awareness of a choice to interrupt, stop or entirely prevent an unnecessary habitual "misuse". As unnecessary habits are prevented or interrupted, a freer capacity and range of motion resumes and a more spontaneous choice of action or behavior can be discovered, which is experienced by the student as a state of "non-doing" or "allowing."

;Primary control
:How the eyes and head initiate movement governs the training of ourselves in relationship to gravity. Our responses are influenced for good or ill by the qualities of head and eye direction at the inception of any reaction. The qualities and direction of our "primary control" occur in every waking moment in response to the stimulus to 'do" - everything. A person can learn to influence their primary control, improving effortlessness. This influence involves the education of a particular quality of head, neck, torso, and limb relationship that works as we move and respond. A student learns to pay attention during action, without imposing expectations.

;Directions
:To continue to select and reinforce the often less dominant new ways, it is recommended to repeatedly suggest, by thinking to oneself, a particular series of "Orders" or "Directions." "Giving Directions" is the expression used for thinking and projecting the positive aspect of how one's self might be used in the most unified psycho-physical way as conveyed by the teacher's hands during a lesson. 
"Directing" serves to counteract the common backward and downward pull and shortening in stature that can be detected at the beginning of every movement - particularly addressing a startle pattern of "fight, flight or freeze." A mere thought, as a projection of intention, shapes preparatory movement below the level of sensing it. Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: "The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen."  Some teachers have shortened this to a suggestion of, "Freer?" Negative directions (that use Alexander's other preventive principle of "inhibition") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.
Whichever is used, all "Directing" is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to "Directing" often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. 
Teacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.

;Psycho-physical unity
:Global concepts such as "Psycho-physical Unity" and "Use" describe how thinking strategies and attention work together during preparation for an action or for withholding one. They connote the general sequence of how intention joins together with execution to directly affect the perception of events and the outcome of intended results.&lt;ref name=actor&gt;{{cite book|title=The Actor and the Alexander Technique|pages=14|isbn=0-312-29515-4|first=Kelly|last= McEvenue|location=New York|publisher= Macmillan|year= 2002|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixvTPRlcSMoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The Alexander Technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons. Its advocates state that it allows for a balanced use of all aspects of the vocal tract by consciously increasing air-flow, allowing improved vocal skill and tone.  The method is said by actors to reduce [[stage fright]] and to increase spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = AE | title = Clinical Voice Disorders: An Interdisciplinary Approach, | year = 1990 | publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers | isbn=0-86577-337-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexander Technique is a frequent component in acting training, because it can assist the actor in being more natural in performance.&lt;ref name=actor/&gt;

According to Alexander Technique instructor [[Michael J. Gelb]], people tend to study the Alexander Technique for reasons of personal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelb|first=Michael J.|title=Body learning : an introduction to the Alexander Technique|year=1995|publisher=Holt|location=New York|isbn=0805042067|pages=3–4|edition=2nd Owl Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The Alexander Technique is most commonly taught privately in a series of 10 to 40 private lessons which may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Students are often performers, such as actors, dancers, musicians, athletes and public speakers, people who work on computers, or  those who are in frequent pain for other reasons. Instructors observe their students, then show them how to move with better poise and less strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodenburg|first=Kelly McEvenue |chapter= Foreword by Patsy|title=The actor and the Alexander Technique|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave, Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0312295154|pages=3|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions include chair work - often in front of a mirror, during which the instructor and the student will stand, sit and lie down, moving efficiently while maintaining a comfortable relationship between the head, neck and spine, and table work or physical manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jain,|first=Sanjiv|author2=Kristy Janssen |author3= Sharon DeCelle|journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America|year=2004|volume=15|pages=811–825|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2004.04.005|pmid=15458754|title=Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais method: A critical overview|issue=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.611.4183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as a teacher of Alexander Technique, instructors are required to complete 1,600 hours, spanning three years, of supervised teacher training. The result must be satisfactory to qualified peers to gain membership in professional societies.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=P.|author2=Lewith, G.|author3= Webley, F. |author4=Evans, M. |author5=Beattie, A. |author6=Middleton, K. |author7=Barnett, J. |author8=Ballard, K. |author9=Oxford, F. |author10=Smith, P. |author11=Yardley, L. |author12=Hollinghurst, S. |author13=Sharp, D.|title=Randomised controlled trial of Alexander Technique lessons, exercise, and massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent back pain|journal=BMJ|date=19 August 2008|volume=337|issue=aug19 2|pages=a884–a884|doi=10.1136/bmj.a884|pmid=18713809|pmc=3272681|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a884.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
Some advocates for the Alexander technique have claimed it can help people with many kinds of health conditions.&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;

One example is a claim that it can benefit people with [[asthma]]. A 2012 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] found that there is no conclusive evidence that the Alexander technique is effective for treating asthma, and randomized clinical trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this type of treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cates|first2=CJ|date=12 September 2012|title=Alexander technique for chronic asthma.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD000995|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000995.pub2|pmid=22972048|last1=Dennis|first1=JA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by [[Aetna]] last updated in 2016 stated: "Aetna considers the following alternative medicine interventions experimental and investigational, because there is inadequate evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature of their effectiveness." Included is Alexander technique in that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine - Number 0388|url=http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0388.html|publisher=Aetna|accessdate=19 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919012537/http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0388.html|archivedate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review published in 2015 and conducted for the Australia Department of Health in order to determine what services the Australian government should pay for, reviewed clinical trials published to date and found that: "Overall, the evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the intervention arms, wide confidence intervals or a lack of replication of results."   It concluded that: "The Alexander technique may improve short-term pain and disability in people with low back pain, but the longer-term effects remain uncertain. For all other clinical conditions, the effectiveness of Alexander technique was deemed to be uncertain, due to insufficient evidence."  It also noted that: "Evidence for the safety of
Alexander technique was lacking, with most trials not reporting on this outcome.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 2017 the Australian government named the Alexander Technique as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |date=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of evidence for Alexander Technique for various health conditions provided by UK [[National Health Service (England)#Internet information service|NHS Choices]] last updated in July 2015 found that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with:
* long-term back pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more
* long-term neck pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more
* Parkinson's disease – lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''NHS Choices'' also states that "some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed.

A review published in ''[[BioMed Central#Journals|BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]'' in 2014 focused on "the evidence for the effectiveness of AT sessions on musicians' performance, anxiety, respiratory function and posture" concluded that: "Evidence from RCTs and CTs suggests that AT sessions may improve performance anxiety in musicians. Effects on music performance, respiratory function and posture yet remain inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=SD|last2=Bayard|first2=C|last3=Wolf|first3=U|title=The Alexander Technique and musicians: a systematic review of controlled trials.|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=24 October 2014|volume=14|pages=414|pmid=25344325|pmc=4287507|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-14-414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review published in the ''[[International Journal of Clinical Practice]]'' in 2012 found: "Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in Parkinson’s-associated disability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6919">An '''atmospheric sounding''' is a measurement of vertical distribution of physical properties of the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] column such as [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]], [[temperature]], [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]] (thus deriving [[wind shear]]), liquid water content, [[ozone]] concentration, pollution, and other properties. Such measurements are performed in a variety of ways including [[remote sensing]] and [[in situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|in situ]] observations.

The most common in situ sounding is a [[radiosonde]], which usually is a [[weather balloon]], but can also be a [[rocketsonde]].

Remote sensing soundings generally use passive [[infrared]] and [[microwave]] [[radiometer]]s:
* airborne instruments
* surface stations
* Earth-observing satellite instruments such as [[Atmospheric Infrared Sounder|AIRS]] and [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]]
* observation of atmospheres on different planets, such as the [[Mars climate sounder]] on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]

==Direct methods==

Sensors that measure atmospheric constituents directly, such as thermometers, barometers, and humidity sensors, can be sent aloft on balloons, rockets or [[dropsonde]]s. They can also be carried on the outer hulls of ships and aircraft or even mounted on towers. In this case, all that is needed to capture the measurements are storage devices and/or [[transponder]]s.

==Indirect methods==

The more challenging case involves sensors, primarily satellite-mounted, such as [[radiometers]], optical sensors, [[radar]], [[lidar]] and [[ceilometer]] as well as [[sodar]] since these cannot measure the quantity of interest, such as temperature, pressure, humidity etc., directly. By understanding emission and absorption processes, we can figure out what the instrument is looking at between the layers of atmosphere.
While this type of instrument can also be operated from ground stations or vehicles—optical methods can also be used inside in situ instruments—satellite instruments are particularly important because of their extensive, regular coverage. The [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]] instruments on three [[NOAA]] and two [[EUMETSAT]] satellites, for instance, can sample the entire globe at better than one degree resolution in less than a day.

We can distinguish between two broad classes of sensor: ''active'', such as [[radar]], that have their own source, and ''passive'' that only detect what is already there. There can be a variety of sources for a passive instrument, including scattered radiation, light emitted directly from the sun, moon or stars—both more appropriate in the visual or ultra-violet range—as well light emitted from warm objects, which is more appropriate in the microwave and infrared.

===Viewing geometry===
A limb sounder looks at the edge of the atmosphere where it is visible above the Earth.  It does this in one of two ways: either it tracks the sun, moon, a star, or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets [[occultation|occultated]] behind the Earth, or it looks towards empty space, collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources. In contrast, a [[nadir]]-looking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface. The [[SCIAMACHY]] instrument operates in all three of these modes.

==Atmospheric inverse problem==

===Statement of the problem===

The following applies mainly to passive sensors, but has some applicability to active sensors.

Typically, there is a vector of values of the quantity to be retrieved, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''state vector''' and a vector of measurements, &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt;. The state vector could be temperatures, ozone number densities, humidities etc. The measurement vector is typically counts, radiances or brightness temperatures from a radiometer or similar detector but could include any other quantity germain to the problem.
The '''forward model''' maps the state vector to the measurement vector:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec y = \vec f (\vec x)
&lt;/math&gt;

Usually the mapping, &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt;, is known from physical first principles, but this may not always be the case. Instead, it may only be known [[empirical]]ly, by matching actual measurements with actual states. Satellite and many other [[remote sensing]] instruments do not measure the relevant physical properties, that is the state, but rather the amount of radiation  emitted in a particular direction, at a particular frequency. It is usually easy to go from the state space to the measurement space—for instance with [[Beer's law]] or [[radiative transfer]]—but not the other way around, therefore we need some method of [[inverse problem|inverting]] &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt; or of finding the '''inverse model''', &lt;math&gt;\vec f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Methods of solution===

If the problem is [[linear]] we can use some type of matrix inverse method—often the problem is [[ill-posed]] or [[Numerical instability|unstable]] so we will need to [[regularization (mathematics)|regularize]] it: good, simple methods include the [[normal equation]] or [[singular value decomposition]]. If the problem is weakly nonlinear, an iterative method such [[Newton-Raphson]] may be appropriate.

Sometimes the physics is too complicated to model accurately or the forward model too slow to be used effectively in the inverse method. In this case, [[statistical]] or [[machine learning]] methods such as [[linear regression]], [[neural networks]], [[statistical classification]], [[kernel estimation]], etc. can be used to form an inverse model based on a collection of ordered pairs of samples mapping the state space to the measurement space, that is, &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \vec x: \vec y \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;. These can be generated either from models—e.g. state vectors from dynamical models and measurement vectors from radiative transfer or similar forward models—or from direct, empirical measurement. Other times when a statistical method might be more appropriate include highly [[nonlinear]] problems.

In [[pollution abatement]], the '''best available technology''' (or '''BAT''') is the technology approved for limiting pollutant discharges with regard to an abatement strategy. Similar terms are ''best available techniques'', ''best practicable means'' or ''best practicable environmental option''. BAT is a moving target on practices, since developing societal values and advancing techniques may change what is currently regarded as "reasonably achievable", "best practicable" and "best available".

A literal understanding will connect it with a "spare no expense" [[doctrine]] which prescribes the acquisition of the best state of the art [[technology]] available, without regard for traditional [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uci.edu/lawreview/vol4/no4/Sinden.pdf |title=Cost-Benefit Analysis, Ben Franklin, and the Supreme Court  |last1=Sinden |first1=Amy |date=2014 |website=UC Irvine Law Review |publisher=University of California, Irvine School of Law |access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical use, the cost aspect is also taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorrell |first=Steve |title=The Meaning of BATNEEC: Interpreting Excessive Costs in UK Industrial Pollution Regulation |publisher=sussex.ac.uk |date=2001-02-19 |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp61/sewp61.html |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See also discussions on the topic of the [[precautionary principle]] which, along with considerations of ''best available technologies'' and ''cost-benefit analyses'', is also involved in discussions leading to formulation of environmental policies and regulations (or opposition to same).]

''Best practicable means'' was used for the first time in UK national primary legislation in section 5 of the Salmon Fishery Act 1861&lt;ref name="BestPracticableMeans" /&gt; and another early use was found in the [[Alkali Act]] Amendment Act 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Bob |title=BPM/BPEO vs BAT - A personal view |publisher=bnes.com |date=n.d. |url=http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202060742/http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-date=2004-02-02 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but before that appeared in the Leeds Act of 1848.

The ''BAT'' concept was first time used in the 1992 [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic for all types of industrial installations (for instance, [[chemical plant|chemical plants]]).

Some doctrine deem it already acquired the status of [[customary law]].

In the [[United States]], BAT or similar terminology is used in the [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]].

==European Union directives==

''Best available techniques not entailing excessive costs (BATNEEC)'', sometimes referred to as ''best available technology'', was introduced in 1984 with Directive 84/360/EEC and applied to air pollution emissions from large industrial installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31984L0360&amp;from=EN Council Directive 84/360/EEC] (PDF; 496&amp;nbsp;kB) of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Directive 84/360/EEC was superseded by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|Integrated pollution prevention and control directive]] (IPPC), 96/61/EC, which applied the framework concept of ''Best Available Techniques'' (BAT) to the integrated control of pollution to the three media air, water and soil. The concept is also part of the directive's recast in 2008 (2008/1/EC) and its successor directive, the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] 2010/75/EU published in 2010.

According to article 15(2) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures in permits shall be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0075&amp;from=EN Directive 2010/75/EU] (PDF; 2.78&amp;nbsp;MB) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control).&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive includes a definition of best available techniques in article 3(10):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"best available techniques" means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole:
:    - "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;
:    - "available" means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;
:    - "best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BAT for a given industrial sector are described in BAT reference documents (BREFs) as defined in article 3(11) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]]. BREFs are the result of an exchange of information between [[European Union]] Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the [[European Commission]] pursuant to article 13 of the directive. This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies]] of the European Commissions' [[Joint Research Centre]], which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012D0119&amp;from=EN Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU] (PDF; 1.54&amp;nbsp;MB) of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important chapter of the BREFs, the BAT conclusions, are published as implementing decisions of the [[European Commission]] in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]]. According to article 14(3) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], the BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting permit conditions of large industrial installations.

==United States environmental law==
===Clean Air Act===
The [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] requires that certain facilities employ [[Best Available Control Technology]] to control [[air pollution|emissions]].
: ...an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act of 1990, section 169(3), {{USC|42|7479(3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean Water Act===
The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires issuance of national [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] discharge regulations (called "[[effluent guidelines]]"), which are based on BAT and several related standards.
: ...effluent limitations for categories and classes of point sources,... which (i) shall require application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class, which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 301(b), {{USC|33|1311(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ...Factors relating to the assessment of best available technology shall take into account the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of the effluent standards, the BAT concept is a "model" technology rather than a specific regulatory requirement. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) identifies a particular model technology for an industry, and then writes a regulatory performance standard based on the model. The performance standard is typically expressed as a numeric effluent limit measured at the discharge point. The industrial facility may use any technology that meets the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related CWA provision for [[water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] intake structures requires standards based on "best technology available."
: ...the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 316(b), {{USC|33|1326(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conventions==

The concept of BAT is also used in a number of international conventions such as the [[Minamata Convention]] on Mercury, the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, or the [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic.

'''Blažej Baláž''' (born 29 October 1958 in [[Nevoľné]], [[Slovakia]], former Czechoslovakia) is a contemporary Slovak artist. His practise as an artist is usually associated with political art, environmental, activist, mail-art and neo-conceptualism. After 1988 he began working with text as art, neo-conceptual and [[post-conceptual]] texts (intext, outtext).

==Life and work==
Baláž studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Bratislava and his Magister of Fine Arts degree received in 1983. Baláž has been the Head of Department of Fine Arts Education at the [[University of Trnava]] since 1999. He was a founder member of the artists group East of Eden (1998). Since 1979, he has been married to the artist [[Maria Balazova]].
He lives and works in [[Trnava]].

He has worked in the areas of political, environmental, activist and neo-conceptual art. His practice also comprises media painting, works on paper, performances, drawing, object, mail art and printmaking.

He has shown work internationally in exhibitions including the Drawing 1990, Provo, USA (1990), Vth International Drawing Triennale, [[Wrocław]] (1992), 12th International Biennale of Small Sculpture, [[Murska Sobota]] (1995), International Biennale of Graphic Arts, [[Ljubljana]] (1989, 1995, 1999), Object / Object.

==Cycle Treptomachia==
Baláž's works brings the new possibilities at the field of post-conceptual and neo-conceptual text. The exhibition is divided in three segments, all of them are connected by the specific and authentic search of the possibilities in the conceptual Macaronic language.
The first is created from the neo-conceptual horizontal/vertical texts, a part of Treptomachia, (WARTEZEIT, 2006, WARTERAUM, 2006 and How to domesticate the English language, 2006). The internal orientation of artworks, the search of art itself, the search of language and text brings the cracking of syntactic/semantic wholeness of graphems. The metatexts of initial prototext are distinguished by the colors (oil on canvas, 300 x 200&amp;nbsp;cm).
In this regard Baláž's eff ort culminates by the diptych TREPTOMACHIA.EN-A / How to domesticate the English language and TREPTOMACHIA.DE-B / How to domesticate the German language (2006). Both are depicted on big-size canvas, within which the only dominating word with partial messages is replaced with newly defined optical language with tens of words. The colour decomposition of the grapheme creates a symptomatic background for language overlapping and the contamination, which creates the supreme moment of the author's Babylonian crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blazej.bbalaz.sk/p/user_exhibitions/list/S&amp;View=9]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, the second segment, black and white acryl-paintings enriches the former one, the artworks are created on principle of the structuralist analysis of text. It is a variant, which is called and named by author and curator the intext. By the segmentation of text the author discovers several lexis. These have a different lexical origin, five West-European, five East-European, and „dead“ language of Medieval Esperanto – Latin. Despite the cold artificiality of works, this segment has also the hidden sociocritical context, which is oscillated between phenomenons West and East, art and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blazej.bbalaz.sk/p/user_exhibitions/list/S&amp;View=9]&lt;/ref&gt;
The third segment is the most open and subjective. These horizontal texts are named by its author as the simultaneous texts. It is a different alternative in the post-conceptual Makaronian text, the melange is created by harmony of the initial and derivative text. Its ironic and attacking character replaces a cold aspect of the first two segments. Vajanský's Suchá ratolesť (an ironic parallel of failing elits) is floundered by streams, the subject is named by the author as east rat in the age of 20-years of wandering a la democrazy, with a more complicated ambivalent reading. The fragility of ground – paper [four artworks, width 10 m] raises the openness of statement, ODRBMADEMOKRATICKY, 2008 [screw me over democratically], is predominative.

[[File:Busybody.PNG|thumb|right|upright|A busybody caricatured by [[Isaac Taylor]] in the 19th century to illustrate the [[character sketch]] by [[Theophrastus]]]]
A '''busybody''', '''do-gooder''', '''meddler''', or '''marplot''' is someone who meddles in the affairs of others.

An early study of the type was made by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Theophrastus]] in his typology, ''Characters'', "In the proffered services of the busybody there is much of the affectation of kind-heartedness, and little efficient aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Theophrastus]] translated by [[Isaac Taylor]] |title=The Characters of Theophrastus |year=1831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Just a Busybody? A Look at the Greco-Roman Topos of Meddling for Defining Hebrew in 1 Peter 4:15 |author=Jeannine K. Brown |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=125 |number=3 |year=2006 |pages=549–568 |jstor=27638379 |doi=10.2307/27638379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=202 |title=Scripture as Communication |author=Jeannine K. Brown |year=2007 |isbn=9781585583133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ancient Thoughts on Peacekeepers and Other Busybodies |author=[[Leo Groarke]] |pages=127–140 |year=2000 |isbn=9789042015524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susanna Centlivre]] wrote a successful play, ''The Busie Body'', which was first performed in 1709 and has been revived repeatedly since.  It is a farce in which Marplot interferes in the romantic affairs of his friends and, despite being well-meaning, frustrates them.  The characterisation of Marplot as a busybody whose "chief pleasure is knowing everybody's business" was so popular that they appeared as the title character in a sequel, ''Marplot''.  The name is a [[pun]] — [[wikt:mar|mar]] / plot — and passed into the language as an [[eponym]] or personification of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Busy Bodies: The plots of Susanna Centlivre |author=John O'Brien |title=Eighteenth-Century Genre and Culture  |publisher=University of Delaware Press |year=2001 |pages=165–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=51 |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers |author=Alan Hager |year=2009 |isbn=9781438108698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English law, the doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'' requires that a [[plaintiff]] have some connection with the matter being contested.  In two cases in 1957 and 1996, [[Lord Denning]] ruled that "The court will not listen to a busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him..."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Public Interest Litigation |author=Basant Lal Wadehra |page=146 |isbn=9788175347984 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Discipline of Law |page=117 |author=Baron Alfred Thompson Denning |year=1979 | isbn=9780406176042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, there is a long-standing rule that a person must have an [[insurable interest]] in a property or person that they wish to insure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Insurance Law's Hapless Busybody |author=Jacob Loshin |journal=The Yale Law Journal |volume=117 |number=3 |year=2007 |pages=474–509 |jstor=20455799 |doi=10.2307/20455799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5811">'''Car donation''' is the practice of giving away no-longer-wanted [[automobile]]s or other vehicles to [[charitable organization]]s.  In the United States, these donations can provide a [[tax]] benefit.

==In the United States==
Some critics have claimed that car donations are essentially a [[tax shelter]].  However, non-profit organizations in the US have come to rely increasingly upon the revenue from car donations. This type of donation has become increasingly widespread; in 2000, 733,000 U.S. taxpayers reduced their taxes by $654 million.

Although advertised as an easy way to dispose of an old car, donors need to fulfill certain post-donation requirements to qualify for the tax deduction,&lt;ref name="IRS4303"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4303.pdf Internal Revenue Service Publication 4303, A Donor's Guide to Vehicle Donations]&lt;/ref&gt; such as obtaining a written acknowledgment of the car's subsequent sale by the charity,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and [[itemized deduction|itemizing]] tax returns instead of taking the [[standard deduction]].

For vehicles valued at less than [[U.S. dollar|$]]500, the deduction amount comes from the donor's own estimate of the car's value, even if the charity receives less money from its sale.  Deductions greater than [[U.S. dollar|$]]500 are limited to the proceeds of selling the vehicle, usually at [[auction]].  The U.S Internal Revenue Service advises that starting in 2005:

{{quote|The rules for determining the amount that a donor may deduct for a charitable contribution of a qualified vehicle, including an automobile, with a claimed value of more than $500 changed at the beginning of 2005 as a result of the  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In general, that Act limits a donor's deduction to the amount of the gross proceeds from the charity's sale of the vehicle.

For vehicles valued at over $500, taxpayers are required to attach the charity's written acknowledgment to their tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/Help-&amp;-Resources/Tools-&amp;-FAQs/FAQs-for-Individuals/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&amp;-Answers/Itemized-Deductions,-Standard-Deduction/Gifts-&amp;-Charitable-Contributions/Gifts-&amp;-Charitable-Contributions | title=Gifts &amp; Charitable Contributions | publisher=IRS | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==In the United Kingdom==
Car donation schemes in the UK are slightly different from those operating in the United States and only established themselves as a valued source of income for UK charities in January 2010, led by Giveacar – a non-profit organisation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/14/giveacar-scraps-sells-cars-for-charity&lt;/ref&gt; Operating as a non-profit organisation allows charities to avoid the large overheads created by profit-making car donation companies. In addition, whereas car donation in the US has been incentivised through tax breaks, in the UK there are no such tax benefits to donating your car.

==Practices==
Vehicle donations in America are operated in a wide variety of plans, ranging from highly organized and professional-grade not-for-profit, national, or local [[Charitable organization|charities]] to [[scrap yards]], [[hauler]]s, [[Tow-truck company|tow-truck companies]] and [[salvager]]s who establish programs that may support a charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cardonors.org/benefits-of-donating/ |title=Car Donation |publisher=CarDonors.org |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014007/http://cardonors.org/benefits-of-donating/ |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charity Navigator, the guidance of the rating agencies concerning car donation programs, where the charity receives a flat fee for the use of their name by a third party, versus program management by a third party,there are some questionable companies who contract to use a nonprofit's agencies name and logo to raise funds and then just give them a flat fee unrelated to income or performance. This is frowned upon by rating agencies and the government. However, a percentage return program is viewed positively if the nonprofit receives more than 50% of the generated income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=158|title=Guide To Donating Your Car|publisher=Charity Navigator|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that engage a third party, but with a "cost maximum cap" involved, such as with national charities like the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], performance in this area is exemplary, with 70-80% on average being returned to the nonprofit.

==Benefit to charities==
Many charities run donation programs which accept car donations, such as Goodwill, Salvation Army and even the American Cancer Society. Many charities will use your car donation directly to transport volunteers and supplies to areas that need help. Some even have their own car lots which sell the donated cars but many have their donations processed through auto auction companies. Many processing companies also collect and sell donated cars and distribute the money to a charity the donor indicates. The processing company typically takes a percentage of the sale value of the car,  but these programs allow charities without their own facilities or staff dedicated to fund raising to benefit from vehicle donation programs.

Ideally, donors should also investigate how much money from the sale of the car goes to the auction processor and how much actually benefits the charity's programs, as opposed to its administrative overhead.&lt;ref name="IRS4303" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5001">'''Clinamen''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|aɪ|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|ən}}; plural ''clinamina'', derived from ''clīnāre'', to incline) is the [[Latin language|Latin]] name [[Lucretius]] gave to the unpredictable swerve of [[ancient atom|atom]]s, in order to defend the [[atomism|atomistic]] doctrine of [[Epicurus]]. In modern English it has come more generally to mean an inclination or a bias.

==Epicureanism==
According to Lucretius, the unpredictable swerve occurs "at no fixed place or time":
&lt;blockquote&gt;When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops  of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'' ii. 216–224. Translation from Brad Inwood, L. P. Gerson, (1994), ''The Epicurus Reader'', page 66. Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This swerving, according to Lucretius, provides the "[[Hylozoism|free will which living things]] throughout the world have".&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ii. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretius never gives the primary cause of the deflections. 

==Modern usage==
In modern English clinamen is defined as an inclination or a bias. It implies that one is inclined or biased towards introducing a plausible but unprovable ''clinamen'' when a specific mechanism cannot be found to refute a credible argument against one's hypothesis or theory. The [[OED]] gives its first recorded use in English by [[Jonathan Swift]] in his 1704 ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' ix.166, satirizing the atomistic theory of [[Epicurus]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epicurus modestly hoped that one time or other, a certain fortuitous concourse of all men's opinions—after perpetual justlings, the sharp with the smooth, the light and the heavy, the round and the square—would, by certain clinamina, unite in the notions of atoms and void, as these did in the originals of all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Swift|title=A Tale of a Tub|date=1704|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_2/A_Tale_of_a_Tub/Section_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term has been taken up by [[Harold Bloom]] to describe the inclinations of writers to "swerve" from the influence of their predecessors; it is the first of his "Ratios of Revision" as described in ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;in "[[The Anxiety of Influence]]: A Theory of Poetry" (1973), Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA; 2 edition (April 10, 1997) {{ISBN|0-19-511221-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', [[Gilles Deleuze]] employs the term in his description of "multiplicities".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Paul Patton, (1994), ''Difference and repetition'', page 232&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, other French writers such as [[Simone de Beauvoir]],&lt;ref&gt;in "The Ethics of Ambiguity" (1948), trans. Bernard Frechtman; Publisher: Citadel Press, {{ISBN|0-8065-0160-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]],&lt;ref&gt;in "The four fundamental concepts of psycho-analysis" (1973), Publisher: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. (April 17, 1998), {{ISBN|0-393-31775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Derrida]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Jean-Luc Nancy]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Alain Badiou]],&lt;ref&gt;in "Theory of the Subject" (1982), trans. Bruno Bosteels; (New York: Continuum, 2009): {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9673-7}} (hardcover)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Serres]]&lt;ref name="berressem"&gt;Hanjo Berressem in Abbas, N. (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AD7w2L8EOv0C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=the+birth+of+physics+michel+serres+clinamen&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rfZixqhJE_&amp;sig=VyrhqbVTFuR_LIujJKuBE1Xym_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA53,M1 ''Mapping Michel Serres'', page 53] University of Michigan Press&lt;/ref&gt; have made extensive use of the word 'clinamen' in their writings, albeit with very different meanings.

Lucretius' concept is central to the book ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', written by [[Stephen Greenblatt]].

"Clinamen" is defined by [[Alfred Jarry]] in Chapter 33 of his ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician]]''.  The notion later figured{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} in the imaginary science of the Jarry-inspired College of [[Pataphysics]] and the experimental literature of [[OuLiPo]].

{{about|computer science|the use of this term in medicine and anaesthesia|coinduction (anaesthetics)}}

In [[computer science]], '''coinduction''' is a technique for defining and proving properties of systems of concurrent interacting [[object (computing)|object]]s.

Coinduction is the [[mathematic]]al [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[structural induction]].  Coinductively defined types are known as '''codata''' and are typically [[Infinity|infinite]] [[data structures]], such as [[stream (computing)|streams]].

As a definition or [[specification (computing)|specification]], coinduction describes how an object may be "observed", "broken down" or "destructed" into simpler objects. As a [[proof (math)|proof]] technique, it may be used to show that an equation is satisfied by all possible [[implementation (computing)|implementation]]s of such a specification.

To generate and manipulate codata, one typically uses [[corecursion|corecursive]] functions, in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]].  Informally, rather than defining a function by pattern-matching on each of the inductive constructors, one defines each of the "destructors" or "observers" over the function result.

In programming, co-logic programming (co-LP for brevity) "is a natural generalization of logic programming and coinductive logic programming, which in turn generalizes other extensions of logic programming, such as infinite trees, lazy predicates, and concurrent communicating predicates. Co-LP has applications to rational trees, verifying infinitary properties, lazy evaluation, concurrent logic programming, model checking, bisimilarity proofs, etc."&lt;ref&gt;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2513&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental implementations of co-LP are available from [[The University of Texas at Dallas]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Logtalk]] (for examples see  &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/coinduction&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[SWI-Prolog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">==What is a conservation community?==
A conservation community is a group of individuals and families living in a community who are committed to saving large parcels of land from ecological degradation. This land can be [[forest]]ed land, [[agriculture|agricultural]] land, [[ranch]] land, or any other type of land that needs protecting from high-impact development.

Conservation communities are models of sustainable community development, a new approach to development which provides alternatives to conventional forms of development.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Fraser University, Centre for Sustainable Community Development, https://www.sfu.ca/cscd/&lt;/ref&gt; They are adaptable to the needs of different regions and they use small-scale residential development to fund [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], eliminating the need to depend on funding from private [[Donation|donor]]s or [[government]]s. This land development model is important to the environmental movements towards [[sustainable development]], Green homebuilding, local [[food security]], and responsible management of [[natural resource]]s.

Some of the tools used to create conservation communities are conservation covenants, [[ecoforestry]] covenants, and other forms of covenant registered to the title of the land. Covenants are a legal contract used to protect the integrity of land. Covenants help protect the ecological health of [[drainage basin|watersheds]] (which are damaged by increased development),&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University, College of Engineering, "Watershed Protection", https://engineering.purdue.edu/SafeWater/watershed/&lt;/ref&gt; maintain long-term access to natural resources and associated [[value added|value-added]] opportunities, protect [[native plant]] and animal species, and prevent [[climate change]] impacts of intense development practices. Conservation communities are developed under a standard of performance that not only minimizes their [[ecological footprint]] on the Earth but also ensures that the development improves (or at the very least does not diminish) the existing ecological system’s performance.

The planning basis for the residential community focuses around maintaining and enhancing the ecological integrity of the land. The community, therefore, sits on the least sensitive part of the land from an ecological point of view, and is often built using low-impact infrastructure such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-targeted housing.

==The economy==
Conservation communities can also offer the opportunity for other eco-compatible uses such as sustainable resource extraction, value-added manufacturing opportunities, [[organic horticulture]], [[mixed-use development|live/work enterprises]], [[ecotourism]], recreational and ecological educational opportunities.

Conservation communities can create sustainable employment opportunities for those living in the communities as well as the surrounding region. Ecotourism promotes environmental protection and support for the well-being of local community members by bringing visitors into the conservation community for educational and recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, A. (1987). Resource economics, Second Edition. New York, USA: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
Conservation communities can be designed to strengthen the connections between neighbors and communities. Kim Davis, of the Vancouver Sun newspaper notes that "while hardship, economic or otherwise, is not something most people desire, let alone seek, adversity does have a way of inspiring collaboration, creativity and innovation."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Kim, "Hard Times Can Increase Innovation and Collaboration",(December 13, 2008), ''Vancouver Sun'', Westcoast Homes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
A '''constitutional convention''' is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states that follow the [[Westminster system]] and whose political systems derive from [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional law]], most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the [[head of state]] that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the [[head of government]].

Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

==Definitions==
The term was first used by British legal scholar [[A. V. Dicey]] in his 1883 book, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''. Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:

{{cquote|The one set of rules are in the strictest sense "laws", since they are rules which (whether written or unwritten, whether enacted by statute or derived from the mass of custom, tradition, or judge-made maxims {{sic|?|know}} as the common law) are enforced by the courts....

The other set of rules consist of conventions, understandings, habits, or practices that&amp;mdash;though they may regulate the conduct of the several members of the sovereign power, the Ministry, or other officials&amp;mdash;are not really laws, since they are not enforced by the courts. This portion of constitutional law may, for the sake of distinction, be termed the "conventions of the constitution", or constitutional morality.&lt;ref&gt;AV Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', 10th edition, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A century later, Canadian scholar [[Peter Hogg]] wrote,

{{cquote|Conventions are rules of the constitution which are not enforced by the law courts. Because they are not enforced by the law courts they are best regarded as non-legal rules, but because they do in fact regulate the working of the constitution they are an important concern of the constitutional lawyer. What conventions do is to prescribe the way in which legal powers shall be exercised. Some conventions have the effect of transferring effective power from the legal holder to another official or institution. Other conventions limit an apparently broad power, or even prescribe that a legal power shall not be exercised at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

Constitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of [[Robert Peel]] to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in [[First Peel ministry|1834&amp;ndash;1835]].

==Enforceability in the courts==

Constitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in its 1981 [[Patriation Reference]], is that, "They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, ''Attorney General of Manitoba et al. v. Attorney General of Canada et al.'' (September 28, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can "crystallize" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1982/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.

Some conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).

However, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said {{By whom|date=May 2016}} that "conventions are not worth the paper they are written on", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Examples==

===Australia===
* Whoever can command a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled to be asked by the Governor-General to form a government, and take the title Prime Minister.
* Governors-General always act on the advice of their Prime Minister or other relevant minister in regard to particular powers they may exercise.
* An incumbent Prime Minister who loses an election will advise the Governor-General to appoint the leader of the larger party as Prime Minister so the Governor-General does not need to act alone.
* State Premiers tender advice to State Governors for Federal Senate elections, in response to the Prime Minister's advice to the Governor-General to call a Federal House of Representatives election.
* State Governors are given a [[dormant commission]] to administer the Commonwealth if the Governor-General is unable to.
* Vice-regal officers act in a politically neutral way.

No convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]].

Ignoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010]], the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* The six members of the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that are chosen by the Parliaments of entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], should be chosen in a way as to establish the national balance, of "constituent peoples", in the Court (two [[Bosniaks]], two [[Croats|Croatian]]s and two [[Serb]]s), although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement.
* The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] should be of different nationality in every new term (establishing the "rotation"), although this is not formally regulated.
* The government of an [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] should inform the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|government of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] of its intention to establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states, including negotiations. Also, the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] should be notified of any such intent, especially if there is a document that should be signed between parties, although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement (also for first example).

===Canada===
* Previously the Senate would not defeat a bill passed by the House of Commons, it was broken in 1989 when the Senate defeated a bill regulating abortions. It was broken again for a bill that would have ratified a [[free trade agreement]] between Canada and the United States.
* The Prime Minister will request the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to call an election upon the defeat of the government in a confidence or money vote. This convention was broken in 1968 when the ruling [[minority government]] unexpectedly lost a money vote. All the parties in Parliament, who were not prepared for a snap election, agreed to pass a resolution retroactively declaring the lost money vote was not a matter of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGregor |first=Janyce |title=Feeling confident about the budget vote? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=12 May 2013 |date=11 June 2012 |quote=In 1968, Lester Pearson was prime minister, presiding over a minority Liberal government. Pearson governed largely with the support of the NDP, but in February the Liberals unexpectedly lost a final Commons vote over an amendment to the Income Tax Act. A strict reading of parliamentary convention would have suggested that vote was enough to trigger an election, because the change constituted a "money bill." But the Liberals were in the process of selecting a new leader, and Pearson gambled that no one really wanted an election right away. Pearson went on television and told Canadians that his government would put a second vote before the House of Commons specifically asking whether or not his government continued to command the confidence of the House of Commons, rather than the merits or demerits of a tax change. His gamble worked: his party won the second, more specific vote and carried on governing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417044908/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |archivedate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Though it is mentioned in various constitutional documents, the precise nature of the office of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] operates mostly according to understood, uncodified British conventions.
* The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is, by statute (the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]''), composed of three justices from [[Quebec]] and six from anywhere in Canada (including Quebec).  This is because Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the common law system used elsewhere in Canada; it is necessary to have a panel of at least three judges to hear civil law cases.  By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate amongst themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.  The appointment of the most senior puisne justice to chief justice is a convention that has recently fallen into disuse. There is also an attempt to appoint at least one justice straight from legal practice without having previously been a judge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Commonwealth Realms===
* The [[Governor-General]] is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, is a resident of the country he or she will represent, and can be dismissed immediately on the advice of the Prime Minister (exceptions are [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], where the Governor-General is elected by Parliament and then formally appointed by the Queen, and the United Kingdom, which has no vice-regal office). However, in Canada, provincial lieutenant-governors are appointed on the advice of the federal prime minister, not the provincial premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=V.58| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=15 January 2009| ref=CITEREF_Victoria_1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will participate in the political process unless there is an extreme circumstance that merits the use of [[reserve powers]], or when the advice tendered is contrary to established convention.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will make [[Partisan (political)|partisan speech]]es or state partisan opinions. This convention was broken in 1975 by [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], the [[Governor of Queensland]], who called for the defeat of the [[Whitlam Government]]. The Queen, on Whitlam's advice, revoked Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to act as [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] later refused the [[Premier of Queensland]]'s request that they advise the Queen to appoint Hannah to a second term as Governor (in 1975, Australian State Governors were still appointed on the advice of UK ministers)

===Denmark===
* The [[Danish Constitution]] makes reference to the King in great detail. Apart from the fact that this is understood to include a [[Queen regnant]] as well, references to the King acting in a political capacity are understood to mean the Prime Minister, as the Constitution stipulates that the King exercises his powers through the Cabinet.
* According to the Constitution, any public expenditure must be provided for in the annual [[money bill]] or provisional money bills. However, although not provided for in the Constitution, according to constitutional custom, the Parliamentary Budgetary Committee has the power to authorise provisional expenditure, regardless of the fact that such expenditure is not formally included in the budget (such grants are however then marked for adoption in the next forthcoming money bill).

===France===
* If the [[President of France|President]] of the Republic and the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] are [[Cohabitation (government)|not from the same party]], foreign affairs and defense are conducted by the President.
* If the president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the president of the [[French Senate|Senate]] or 60 deputies or 60 senators claim that a just-voted [[statute]] is unconstitutional, the President of the Republic does not sign the law and instead waits for a petition to be sent to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].

===Lebanon===
* The Lebanese constitution states that the [[President of Lebanon]] is elected by a simple majority of the [[Parliament of Lebanon]].  However, due to the country's delicate ethnic balance, the Parliament's various factions usually try to agree on a consensus candidate.
* Under the unwritten [[National Pact]], the president must always be a [[Maronite Christian]]; the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon|prime minister]] a [[Sunni Muslim]]; the speaker of Parliament a [[Shia Muslim]]; and the deputy speaker [[Greek Orthodox]].

===Malaysia===
* At the federal level, the [[King of Malaysia|King]] acts on the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]'s advice, except on certain cases. At the state level, the respective ruler or governor acts on his Chief Minister's advice.
* At the federal level, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] is the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] (House of Representatives) and therefore most likely to command the support of the [[Dewan Rakyat]]; and likewise a Chief Minister, the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in a State Legislature and therefore most likely to command the support of such State Legislature. 
* The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] should be a member of the [[Dewan Rakyat]].
* The [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]] chairs the Joint Session of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], where the King addresses both [[Dewan Negara]] (Senate) and [[Dewan Rakyat]].

===New Zealand===
There is a convention that the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain [[confidence and supply]].{{clarify|date=August 2011}} By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:
*[[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951 general election]]: [[Sidney Holland]] called the election to get a mandate to face down a [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|dockworks dispute]]. The government was returned to power with an increased majority; by this time the dispute had been resolved.
*[[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]]: [[Robert Muldoon]]'s government held a narrow four-seat majority in Parliament. Muldoon hoped to strengthen his leadership, as two backbenchers ([[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]]) were threatening to rebel against the government in an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. However, Waring and Minogue had not threatened to block confidence and supply. The election was a decisive defeat for the government.
*[[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 general election]]: [[Helen Clark]] called the election after the collapse of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], her coalition partners. Some critics argued that the government could still maintain confidence and supply and therefore the early election was not necessary. The Labour Party remained in power with two different coalition partners.

===Norway===
Because of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian political system]] are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.
* Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must maintain the support of parliament (an absence of mistrust) but it need not have its express support.
* All new laws are passed and all new cabinets are therefore formed in a de jure fashion by the King, although not necessarily in a de facto sense.
* According to the written constitution, the cabinet (council of ministers) are appointed by the King. The appointment of new cabinets by the King is a formality, and the king has not directly exercised executive powers since 1905.

===Spain===
Much of Spain's political framework is codified in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]], the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the "arbitrator and moderator of the institutions" of government.

* The King nominates a candidate to stand for the [[Spanish Prime Minister|Presidency of the Government of Spain]], sometimes known in English as 'prime minister'. The nominee then stands before the Congress of Deputies and presents his political agenda for the upcoming legislative term, followed by a [[Indirect election|vote of confidence]] in the nominee and his agenda. The 1978 constitution allows the King to nominate anyone he sees fit to stand for the vote of confidence so long as the King has met with the political party leaders represented in the Congress beforehand. However, King Juan Carlos I has consistently nominated the political party leader who commands a plurality of seats in the Congress of Deputies.
* The Spanish public perception that the monarchy be politically non-partisan in its adherence to constitutional protocol and convention, yet while protecting the public expression of personal political views by members of the royal family. Expressions of personal political views expressed in public include when the Prince of Asturias and his sisters protested against terrorism following the 2004 Madrid bombings, or when the Queen gave controversial political viewpoints during an informal interview.
* Constitutionally, the King appoints the twenty members to the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain. However, when a vacancy is observed the King's appointment has been customarily on the advice of the government of the day. Additionally, the King appoints the President of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain.
* According to the 1978 constitution, grandee and nobility titles, and civil and military decorations, are awarded by the King as head of state. However, in most cases since 1978, the King's appointment of nobility titles have been countersigned by the President of the Government of Spain, with civil awards having been nominated by the President and military awards having been nominated by the military.

=== Switzerland ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Politics of Switzerland]] --&gt;
The following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of [[Switzerland]]. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of [[majority rule]] with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.
* The government is a body of equals composed in [[Concordance system|political proportion]] to the weight of the various factions in [[Parliament]]; this creates a permanent [[grand coalition]].
* Members of a collective body, including the [[Swiss Federal Council|federal government]], observe [[collegiality]] at all times, that is, they do not publicly criticise one another. They also publicly support all decisions of the collective, even against their own opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained at the federal level, at least after the 2003 elections to the [[Swiss Federal Council]].
* The [[President|presidency]] of a collective body, particularly a government, rotates yearly; the president is a [[primus inter pares]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of [[legal instrument]]s that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.

As part of this uncodified British [[constitution]], constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:

* The texts of most international treaties are laid before Parliament at least twenty one days before ratification (the '[[Ponsonby Rule]]' of 1924).
* The monarch will accept and act on the advice of their ministers, who are responsible to Parliament for that advice; the monarch does not ignore that advice, except when exercising [[Reserve powers]].
* The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) with an absolute majority of seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and therefore most likely to command the support of the House of Commons.
* All [[money bills]] must originate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].
* The monarch grants the [[Royal Assent]] to all legislation – sometimes characterised as all legislation passed in good faith. It is possible that ministers could advise against giving consent, as happens with the [[Crown dependencies]] (convention since the early 18th century – previously monarchs did refuse or withhold the Royal Assent).
* The Prime Minister should be a member of either House of Parliament (between the 18th century - 1963).
** In 1963 it was amended to the effect that no Prime Minister should come from the House of Lords. When the last Prime Minister peer, the Earl of Home, took office he renounced his peerage, and as Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became an MP.
** The Prime Minister can hold office temporarily whilst not a Member of Parliament, for example during a general election or in the case of Douglas-Home, between resigning from the Lords and being elected to the Commons in a by-election.
* All Cabinet members must be members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], since the cabinet is a committee of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow cabinet members are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them "on Privy Council terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf Parliamentary briefing – the Privy Council], accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* The House of Lords should not reject a budget passed by the House of Commons. This was broken controversially in 1909 by the House of Lords, which argued that the Convention was linked to another Convention that the Commons would not introduce a Bill that 'attacked' peers and their wealth. The Lords claimed that the Commons broke this Convention in [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s budget, justifying the Lords' rejection of the budget. The Commons disputed the existence of a linked convention. As a consequence, the Lords' powers over budgets were greatly lessened by the [[Parliament Act 1911]].
* During a [[Uk general election|General Election]], no major party shall put up an opponent against a [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker seeking re-election]]. This convention was not respected during the 1987 General Election, when both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] fielded candidates against the Conservative Speaker, [[Bernard Weatherill]], who was MP for [[Croydon North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North East]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) does stand against the Speaker if he or she represents a [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Scottish constituency]], as was the case with [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], Speaker from 2000 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/flash_map/html/map05.stm BBC NEWS | Election 2005 | Election Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Westminster Parliament]] will only legislate on [[reserved matters]]. It will not legislate on non-reserved matters ('[[devolved]] matters') without first seeking the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] (since 1999, the [[Sewel motion|Sewel convention]], later renamed to [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s).
* The House of Lords shall not oppose legislation from the House of Commons that was a part of the government's [[manifesto]] (the [[Salisbury Convention]]).

=== United States ===
*The [[President of the United States]] will give his [[State of the Union address]] annually and in person, before a joint session of Congress. This practice was followed by George Washington and John Adams but abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not resumed until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his State of the Union address in person.  The constitution requires the President give an update on the state of the union "from time to time", but no specifics are outlined. Speeches have been broadcast on radio since 1923 and 1947; the last State of the Union message delivered only in writing was in 1981.*
*Much of how the [[United States Cabinet]] operates is dictated by convention; its operations are only vaguely alluded to in the US constitution.
*While members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are only required to live in the state they represent, it has generally been expected that they live in the district they represent as well, though there are some exceptions; [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] was elected in 2010 representing a district adjacent to the one he resided in.
*The [[President of the United States]] will obtain the [[Senatorial courtesy|consent of both Senators from a state]] before appointing a [[United States Attorney]], [[United States district court|federal district judge]], or [[federal marshal]] with jurisdiction in that state.
*Cabinet officials and other major executive officers resign and are replaced when a new President takes office, unless explicitly asked to stay on by the new President.
*The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] is always the Representative who leads the ruling party, even though the Constitution does not specify that the Speaker must be a member of the chamber.  Also by custom the Speaker does not vote (except to break a tie).
*The [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] will be the most senior Senator of the ruling party.
*Members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] are pledged to vote for a particular Presidential candidate, and are chosen by popular vote with the name of the candidate, and not necessarily the elector, on the ballot.
*Senate rules require a majority of 60 votes to invoke [[cloture]], that is, to break off debate on a bill and force a vote. The Senate could revise its rules at any time, but it doesn't, leaving the [[filibuster]] available as a tool for a large-enough minority to indefinitely block any measure it finds objectionable enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9851">'''Countercontrol''' is a term used by Dr. [[B.F. Skinner]] in 1953 as a functional class in the analysis of [[social behavior]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0143034305060801 |title=Countercontrol: What Do The Children Say?|year=2005|last1=Carey|first1=T. A.|journal=School Psychology International|volume=26|issue=5|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition or resistance to intervention defines countercountrol, however little systematic research has been conducted to document its occurrence.

==Behavior==
Counter control can embedded itself in both passive and active behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seay|first=Mary|author2=Robert Suppa |author3=Sharon Schoen |author4= Suzanne Roberts |title=Countercontrol: an issue in intervention|journal=Remedial and Special Education|date=January 1984|volume=5|series=1|page=38|doi=10.1177/074193258400500108}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may not respond to the demanding interventionist or may completely withdraw from the situation passively.&lt;ref name="Seay 1984 38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seay|first=Mary|author2=Robert Suppa |author3=Sharon Schoen |author4= Suzanne Roberts |title=Countercontrol: an issue in intervention|journal=Remedial and Special Education|date=January 1984|volume=5|series=1|page=38|doi=10.1177/074193258400500108}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for countercontrol is that human behavior is both a function of the environment and a source of control over it. Counter control originates from the essential behavior-analytic position which states that behavior is always caused or controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delprato|first=Dennis.J|title=Countercontrol in behaviour analysis|year=2002|pages=193|pmc=2731607|pmid=22478386|volume=25|issue=2|journal=Behav Anal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental==
Control is fundamental in conceptual, experimental and [[applied behavior analysis]], as it is fundamental in all experimental science. To study functional relations in behavior and environment, one must manipulate (control) environmental variables to study their effect in behavior. Countercontrol can be defined as human operant behavior as a response to social aversive control. The individual that is exposed to aversive control may try to oppose controlling attempts through the process of negative reinforcement, such as by escaping, attacking, or passively resisting.

Countercontrol is a way in which individuals regain behavioral freedom when faced with aversive controlling attempts of others.

==Types==
There are two types of countercontrol:

*'''[[Counterattack]]''' or '''[[aggression]]'''
*'''[[Nonviolent resistance]]''' or '''escape'''

Countercontrol is mostly avoidance or escape behavior, thus, this behavior class is only unique insofar as the behaver is (a) confronted with some form of aversive interpersonal or social controlling stimulation and (b) responds to oppose control rather than to reinforce it by "giving in”.

From the principle of consequential causality or selection by consequences, responses occur and are then met by environmental consequences that control the situations of similar responses in future events. Skinner (1953, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1978) found that countercontrol was important in understanding human behavior because of the prevalence of aversive control in human relations. According to Michael (1982, 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1333126|pmid=7057126|author=Michael, J.|title=Distinguishing between discriminative and motivational functions of stimuli|year=1982|volume=37|series=1|pages=149–55|doi=10.1901/jeab.1982.37-149|journal=Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2733648|pmid=22478146|author=Michael, J.|title=Establishing operations|year=1993|volume=16|issue=2|pages=191–206|journal=The Behavior analyst / MABA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countercontrol can occur at two levels. At one level, countercontrolling behavior results in avoidance or escape from a short-term problem along with non-reinforcement or counter measure from the controlee. For example, a teacher threatens a student with detention and in response the student threatens the teacher with a serious allegation and in turn the teacher withdraws.  At another level, individuals may avoid or escape specific short-term consequences contingent on the result that occurs but also avoid or escape long standing aversion contingencies in which those consequences participate.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2731607|pmid=22478386|year=2002|last1=Delprato|first1=DJ|title=Countercontrol in behavior analysis|volume=25|issue=2|pages=191–200|journal=The Behavior analyst / MABA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple components of behaviour changes which may occur in countercontrol such being nontargeted responses which fits well with increasing emphasis on the ecological-systems considerations in behaviour analysis.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Countercontrol is also present when adults use modeling to influence the behavior of children. For instance, the adult exhibits appropriate behavior and directs the children to reproduce the same. However, resistance will often occur in the form of disobedience, negativism, opposition, and uncooperativeness thus reducing the probability of the child replicating the desired skill or behavior demonstrated by the adult.&lt;ref name="Seay 1984 38"/&gt;

A series of responses by the child may result by this resistance:
*ignore the model and refuse to respond
*perform some other, non-modeled behavior
*execute desire response in the absence of the model&lt;ref name="Seay 1984 38"/&gt;

==Variables precipitating countercontrol==
*Prior exposure to contingencies: A high rate of reinforcement over a long period of time may promote an overdependence to stimulate performance. When extended reinforcement is removed, countercontrol may take place.&lt;ref name="Seay, Mary B. 1984"&gt;Seay, Mary B.; Robert, Suppa J.; Sharon, Schoen F.; Roberts, Suzanne R (1984). "Countercontrol: An issue in Intervention". ''Rase''. 5:38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intrusiveness: Intrusiveness may strongly affect the individual's willingness to comply. Unneeded intrusive or directive procedures may cause resistance.&lt;ref name="Seay, Mary B. 1984"/&gt;
*Subject briefing: The subject's experience from previous interventions can affect the extent to which the subject cooperates.&lt;ref name="Seay, Mary B. 1984"/&gt;
*Freedom of choice: The subject's view on intervention can also influence the occurrence of countercontrol.&lt;ref name="Seay, Mary B. 1984"/&gt;

==Implications and importance==
Countercontrol can have an effect on intervention strategies by minimizing instructional time while increasing program expense. 
Mary B.; Robert, Suppa J.; Sharon, Schoen F.; Roberts, Suzanne R (1984). "Countercontrol: An issue in Intervention". ''Rase''. 5:38-40. 
* Human freedom or [[free will]]; Countercontrolling behavior as a marker of freedom (Elimination of aversive behavior is a measure of human freedom, hence reduced occurrence of countercontrol is, to an extent, a measure of freedom).
* [[Social Control]]: Importance of avenues of effective countercontrol since institutions of social control such as religion, government, and education rely heavily on aversive control. These avenues will be available if control is conspicuous and if there is a balance between control and countercontrol. Understanding countercontrol in a classroom setting and implementing cooperation among students and teachers might be helpful to the classroom environment and countercontrol may help in understanding chronic behavior problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey/Bourbon|first=Timothy A/W Thomas|title=Is Countercontrol the Key to Understanding Chronic Behavior Problems?|journal=Intervention in School and Clinic|date=September 2006|volume=42|issue=1|pages=5–13|doi=10.1177/10534512060420010201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control of environment countercontrol provides a way to analyze how behavers control the environment. (The foundation for countercontrol is that human behavior is both a function of the environment and a source of control over it.)
* [[Bullying]]: Countercontrol can help to direct efforts to the specific sources of socially mediated aversive control. With countercontrol, behavior analysts can also highlight positive contributions of a behavioral approach by recognizing that everyone has the potential to overcome socially based aversive attempts at control.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;
* Teaching and parenting: In cases involving noncompliance, malicious destruction, and opposition, countercontrol can identify sources of aversive control (e.g. Students who countercontrol teachers or children who countercontrol parents).
* Design of cultures: Institutions of social control such as religion, government and education rely heavily on aversive control. This accounts for many of the unfavorable countercontrolling reactions individuals and groups have had to aspects of their culture.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com/hww/results/external_link_maincontentframe.jhtml?_DARGS=/hww/results/results_common.jhtml.44|title=''Countercontrol: A New Look at Some Old Problems'' by Carey, Timothy A.; Bourbon, W. Thomas|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documenting previous interventions is a good practice as it may uncover patterns of student response such as the preferred mode of instruction or the effective reinforcers. Such information can help plan an intervention that will minimize countercontrol.&lt;ref name="Seay, Mary B. 1984"/&gt;

The key to reducing the occurrence of countercontrol is to work hard at reducing the degree to which we try to control students' actions.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

Countercontrol is mentioned in ''About Behaviorism''. It is also mentioned in Skinner's ''Technology of Teacher''.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27187">{{Tort law}}
A '''duty to rescue''' is a concept in [[tort law]] that arises in a number of cases, describing a circumstance in which a [[party (law)|party]] can be held liable for failing to come to the rescue of another party in who could face potential injury or death without being rescued.  In [[common law]] systems, it is rarely formalized in statutes which would bring the penalty of law down upon those who fail to rescue.  This does not necessarily obviate a moral [[duty]] to rescue: though law is binding and carries government-authorized sanctions and awarded civil penalties, there are also separate ethical arguments for a duty to rescue that may prevail even where law does not punish failure to rescue.

==Common law system==
In the [[common law]] of most [[English-speaking countries]], there is no general duty to come to the rescue of another.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Moral Justice |last=Rosenbaum |first=Thane |year=2004 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=978-0-06-018816-0 |pages=247–248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt2FMMu4JakC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=duty+to+rescue+spouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5QsbxTo_Fi&amp;sig=MpS0Ys_Wh1qXpgn24LewAKkjRtU&amp;hl=en#PPA248,M1 |accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a person cannot be held liable for doing nothing while another person is in peril.&lt;ref&gt;See Yania v. Bigan 155 A.2d 343 (Penn. 1959). Bigan and Yania were [[Surface mining#Strip mining|strip mining]] [[Coal mining|coal]]. Bigan was working next to an 18' deep pit with water in it. He asked Yania and Ross to help him with a pump. Bigan and Ross told Yania to jump over the pit. He did, fell in, and drowned. Yania's widow had argued that Bigan and Ross had a legal obligation to assist Yania to prevent his drowning. However, the Appellate Court found that the law imposes no duty to rescue.[http://www.invispress.com/law/torts/yania.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.missouri.edu/peters/t2syllabus.html |title=Torts II syllabus |last=Peters |date=January 2001 |publisher=University of Missouri-Columbia school of Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211145958/http://law.missouri.edu/peters/t2syllabus.html |archivedate=2012-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a duty may arise in two situations:

* A duty to rescue arises where a person creates a hazardous situation. If another person then falls into peril because of this hazardous situation, the creator of the hazard{{spaced ndash}}who may not necessarily have been a negligent [[tortfeasor]]{{spaced ndash}}has a duty to rescue the individual in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Issues in the Law of Tort |last=Bayles |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Bruce Chapman |year=1983 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=90-277-1639-0 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Such a duty may also arise where a "special relationship" exists. For example:
** Parents have a duty to rescue their [[Minor (law)|minor]] children. This duty also applies to those acting ''[[in loco parentis]]'', such as schools or babysitters.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.tvw.org/modules/opinions/767238_o.htm Aba Sheikh v. Choe], 156 Wn.2d 441, 457, 128 P.3d 574 (Wash. 2006), which discusses [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] sec. 315 and 319, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;As a general rule, our common law imposes no duty to prevent a third person from causing physical injury to another... Additionally, under the public duty doctrine, the State is not liable for its negligent conduct even where a duty does exist unless the duty was owed to the injured person and not merely the public in general... However, this court recognizes an exception to both these general rules. [A] duty arises where 'a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct.'  [Therefore,] we have adopted one class of these 'special relation' cases as described in section 319:  "One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm."&lt;/blockquote&gt;(links added, citations removed)&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Common carriers]] have a duty to rescue their patrons.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''De Vera v. Long Beach Public Transportation Co.'' 180 Cal. App. 3d 782, 225 Cal. Rptr. 789&lt;/ref&gt;
** Employers have an obligation to rescue employees, under an implied contract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2168&amp;context=wmlr] p425&lt;/ref&gt;
** In some U.S. jurisdictions, real property owners have a duty to rescue [[invitees]] but not trespassers from all reasonably foreseeable dangers on the property.  Other jurisdictions, such as California, extend the duty to rescue to all persons who enter upon real property regardless whether they are classified as invitees, social guests or trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13675261667224866941&amp;q=rowland+v.+christian&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1 | title=Rowland v.

Ann. § 940.34&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are also referred to as Good Samaritan laws, despite their difference from [[Good Samaritan law|laws of the same name]] that protect individuals who try to help another person.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt;  These laws are rarely applied, and are generally ignored by citizens and lawmakers.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt;

Where a duty to rescue arises, the rescuer must generally act with [[reasonable care]], and can be held liable for injuries caused by a reckless rescue attempt. However, many states have [[Good Samaritan law|limited or removed liability from rescuers]] in such circumstances, particularly where the rescuer is an emergency worker. Furthermore, the rescuers need not endanger themselves in conducting the rescue.

== Civil law system ==
Many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, which are common in Continental Europe, Latin America and much of Africa, impose a far more extensive duty to rescue.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;  The duty is usually limited to doing what is “reasonable”. In particular, a helper does not have to substantially endanger themselves.&lt;ref name="323cStGB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2779 |title=German Criminal Code, Section 323c Omission to effect an easy rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can mean that anyone who finds someone in need of medical help must take all reasonable steps to seek medical care and render best-effort first aid. Commonly, the situation arises on an event of a traffic accident: other drivers and passers-by must take an action to help the injured without regard to possible personal reasons not to help (e.g. having no time, being in a hurry) or ascertain that help has been requested from officials. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In practice however, almost all cases of compulsory rescue simply require the rescuer to alert the relevant entity (police, fire brigade, ambulance) with a phone call.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Regulations by country==
In some countries, there exists a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, unless doing so would put themselves or others in harm's way. Citizens are often required to, at minimum, call the local [[emergency telephone number|emergency number]], unless doing so would be harmful, in which case the authorities should be contacted when the harmful situation has been removed. {{As of|2012}}, there were such laws in several countries, including&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt; [[Albania]], [[Andorra]],&lt;ref&gt;articles 199, 278, 279, 310 of Andorran Criminal Code&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/penal-especial/penal-especial2.shtml Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Criminal Code § 95 StGB&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;Croatian Criminal Code art. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120052016002 Estonian Criminal Code] §124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finland]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;French Criminal Code §63(2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;German Criminal Code §323c&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;Greek Criminal Code Article 288 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;Polish Criminal Code §162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Tunisia]].

===Argentina===
Argentina has legislation on "abandonment of persons", Articles 106-108 of the [[Argentine Penal Code]], which includes the provision in Article 106 that "a person who endangers the life or health of another, either by putting a person in jeopardy or {{em|abandoning to their fate a person unable to cope alone who must be cared for}} ... will be imprisoned for between 2 and 6 years" [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/penal-especial/penal-especial2.shtml Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person] {{es icon}} Original of text translated in the article: "el que pusiere en peligro la vida o la salud de otro, sea colocándolo en situación de desamparo, sea abandonando a su suerte a una persona incapaz de valerse y a la que deba mantener o cuidar o a la que el mismo autor haya incapacitado, será reprimido con prisión de 2 a 6 años".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In [[Quebec]], which makes use of civil law, there is a general duty to rescue in its [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]]: "Every human being whose life is in peril has a right to assistance...Every person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, by giving him the necessary and immediate physical assistance, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/qc/legis/loi/c-12/20050513/tout.html Charte des droits et libertés de la personne, L.R.Q. c. C-12]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criminal law in Canada]] is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, so failure to comply with an article of the Charter in Quebec does not constitute a criminal offence except if by doing so a party also violates the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].

Other provinces follow common law.

In Canadian air law, it is mandatory to make oneself and one's aircraft available to aid search-and-rescue efforts if the aircraft is in the immediate area and a distress signal is received. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== Denmark ===

Under the [[Danish penal code]], all persons must provide aid to the best of their ability to any person who appears to be lifeless or in mortal danger (§ 253), must alert authorities or take similar steps to prevent impending disasters that could cause loss of life (§ 185), must comply with all reasonable requests of assistance by a public authority when a person's life, health or well-being is at stake (§ 142), and must, if they learn of a planned crime against the state, human life or well-being, or significant public goods, do everything in their power to prevent or mitigate the crime, including but not limited to reporting it to authorities (§ 141), in all cases provided that acting would not incur particular danger or personal sacrifice.
Violations are punishable by up to three months (§ 142), two years (§ 185 and § 253) or three years (§ 141) in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== France ===
Anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Laur Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft Med Leg J March 2013 81:31—35 http://mlj.rsmjournals.com/content/81/1/31.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographers at the scene of [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the fatal car collision of Diana, Princess of Wales]], were investigated for violation of the French law of "non-assistance à personne en danger" (failing to provide assistance to a person in danger), which can be punished by up to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to €75,000.

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], ''unterlassene Hilfeleistung'' (failure to provide assistance) is a [[crime]] under section 323(c)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__323c.html&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German Criminal Code]]: any citizen is obligated to provide assistance in case of an accident or general danger if necessary, and is normally&lt;!-- normally, as interpretation of the law is always up to the courts, and you know: two judges, three opinions... --&gt; immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith and following the [[reasonable person]]'s (aka ordinary prudent person's) understanding of required measures turns out to be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__34.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__17.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the rescuer or responder may not be held liable if the action they should take in order to help is unacceptable for them and they are unable to act (for example when unable to act at the sight of blood). In Germany, knowledge of basic emergency measures and first aid and CPR certification is a prerequisite for the granting of a driving license.

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]], a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone who asks for it in case of a tragedy or public danger, as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. According to article 288 of the criminal code, not providing help in those cases can impose a prison sentence of up to 6 months.

=== Israel ===
In 1998, [[Israel]] enacted the “Stand-not-idly-by-thy-neighbor’s-blood Law”, taking its name from [[Leviticus 19|Leviticus 19:16]]. It requires one to render assistance whenever one is in the presence of a person who, due to some sudden occurrence, is in severe and immediate danger to life, limb or health, provided that one can do so without placing oneself or a third party in danger. Notifying the authorities (e.g. the police or fire department, as relevant) or calling on others who can render assistance for aid is considered “rendering assistance” under the law. A person obliged to render assistance who fails to do so can be fined.

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], Article 125 of the criminal code prohibits knowingly abandoning people who are in life- or health-threatening situations when said people can't help themselves. However it binds only those who are either legally obligated to care for said people or who themselves have put said people into life or health threatening situation. The maximum penalty is 1 year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zakonrf.info/uk/125/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serbia ===
In [[Serbia]], a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone in need (after for example a major car accident) as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Serbian criminal code Articles 126 and 127 state that should one abandon a helpless person and/or not provide aid to a person in need, one could receive a prison sentence of up to one year. If the person dies of injuries due to no aid having been provided by the bystander, a sentence up to 8 years in prison can be imposed.

=== Spain ===
In [[Spain]], a citizen is required by law to '''provide or seek''' help to anyone in need as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Not doing so is a criminal offence under Article 195 of the Spanish Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo10-1995.l2t9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical justifications ==
Legal requirements for a duty to rescue do not pertain in all nations, states, or localities.  However, a moral or ethical duty to rescue may exist even where there is no legal duty to rescue.  There are a number of potential justifications for such a duty.

One sort of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships (doctor to patient; firefighter to citizen, etc.).  Under this general justification, persons have a duty to rescue other persons in distress by virtue of their common humanity, regardless of the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress.

These would justify cases of rescue and in fact make such rescue a duty even between strangers.  They explain why [[philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]] suggests that if one saw a child drowning and could intervene to save him, they should do so, if the cost is moderate to themselves. Damage to their clothing or shoes or how late it might make them for a meeting would be insufficient excuse to avoid assistance.  Singer goes on to say that one should also attempt to rescue distant strangers, not just nearby children, because globalization has made it possible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, "The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle", ''New Internationalist'', April, 1997; http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Such general arguments for a duty to rescue also explain why after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Haitians were digging family members, friends, and strangers out of the rubble with their bare hands and carrying injured persons to whatever medical care was available.&lt;ref&gt;David Gardner and Liz Hazelton, "Haiti earthquake: Bodies piled up on the streets as disaster leaves 'thousands' dead", ''The Guardian'', January 14, 2010, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1242885/Haiti-earthquake-Victims-forced-dig-rubble-bare-hands-free-surivors.html&lt;/ref&gt;  They also explain why, while covering that same earthquake, journalist and physician Sanjay Gupta and a number of other MD-journalists began acting as physicians to treat injuries rather than remaining uninvolved in their journalistic roles. Similarly, they justify journalist Anderson Cooper's attempt to shepherd an injured young boy away from some "toughs" nearby in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;David Folkenflik, "Reporters Who Are MDs Find Lines Blurred in Haiti", National Public Radio, January 20, 2010, https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122784322&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific arguments for such a duty to rescue include, but are not limited to:
* The [[Golden Rule]]: treat others as one would wish to be treated.  This assumes that all persons would wish to be rescued if they were in distress, and so they should in turn rescue those in distress to the best of their abilities. What counts as distress requiring rescue may, of course, differ from person to person, but being trapped or at risk of drowning are emergency situations which this position assumes all humans would wish to be rescued from.
* [[Utilitarianism]]: utilitarianism posits that those actions are right which best maximize happiness and reduce suffering ("maximize the good").&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' available from many publishers and on-line, first published in 1863&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilitarian reasoning generally supports acts of rescue which contribute to overall happiness and reduced suffering.  Rule utilitarianism would look not just at whether individual acts of rescue maximize the good, but whether certain types of acts do so. It then becomes one's duty to perform those types of actions. Generally, having strangers rescue those in distress maximizes good so long as the rescue attempt does not make things worse, so one has a duty to rescue to the best of her or his ability as long as doing so will not make things worse.
* Humanity: the rules of humanity advise that the essence of morality and right behavior is tending to human relationships. Therefore, [[virtues]] (desirable character traits) such as compassion, sympathy, honesty, and fidelity are to be admired and developed.&lt;ref&gt;page 19-20 in Tom L. Beauchamp, LeRoy Walters, Jeffrey P. Kahn, and Anna C. Mastroianni, ''Contemporary Issues in Bioethics, 7th edition'', Wadsworth: Belmont, CA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Acting out of compassion and sympathy will often require rescue where someone is in need. Indeed, it would not be compassionate to ignore someone's need, though the way one fulfills that need may vary. In cases of emergency, rescue would be the most compassionate act compared with allowing a person to remain trapped in rubble.

There are also ethical justifications for role-specific or skill-specific duties of rescue such as those described above under the discussion of U.S. Common Law. Generally, these justifications are rooted in the idea that the ''best'' rescues, the most effective rescues, are done by those with special skills. Such persons, when available to rescue, are thus even more required to do so ethically than regular persons who might simply make things worse (for a utilitarian, rescue by a skilled professional in a relevant field would maximize the good even better than rescue by a regular stranger). This particular ethical argument makes sense when considering the ability firefighters to get both themselves and victims safely out of a burning building, or of health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, physician's assistants, and EMTs to provide medical rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Williams, "Medical Samaritans: Is There A Duty To Treat?", ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' 21(3): 393-413. 2001.  Williams argues that medical personnel have a duty of medical rescue even when there is no prior patient-provider relationship, as when a provider happens to pass an accident site with no EMTs to hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are some of the ethical justifications for a duty to rescue, and they may hold true for both regular citizens and skilled professionals even in the absence of legal requirements to render aid.

In an 1898 case, Buch v. Amory Mfg. Co., 69 N.H. 257, 44 A. 809, 1897 N.H. LEXIS 49 (N.H. 1898), the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] unanimously held that after an eight-year-old boy negligently placed his hand in the defendant's machinery, the boy had no right to be rescued by the defendant. Beyond that, the trespassing boy could be held liable for damages to the defendant's machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Buch v. Amory Mfg. Co.'', 69 N. H. 257, 44 A. 809 (1898), p, 262., cited at [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9833.1995.tb00055.x/abstract ''An Argument Against a Legal Duty to Rescue'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1907 case [[People v. Beardsley]], Beardsley's mistress, Blanche Burns, passed out after overdosing on morphine. Rather than seek medical attention, Beardsley instead had a friend hide her in the basement, and Burns died a few hours later. Beardsley was tried and convicted of manslaughter for his negligence. However, his conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court of Michigan saying that Beardsley had no legal obligation to her.

===Germany===
In 2016, a 83-year-old man collapsed in a bank lobby in [[Essen]] and later died. Several customers stepped over him without providing assistance. With the help of security camera footage, these customers were identified and sentenced to fines of several thousand euros each for failing to provide assistance. A customer who phoned emergency services was not indicted, as he was considered to have provided sufficient assistance.&lt;ref name="spiegel-bank"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/rentner-in-bank-gericht-verhaengt-geldstrafen-wegen-unterlassener-hilfeleistung-a-1168518.html |title=Unterlassene Hilfeleistung für Rentner in Bank - Angeklagte müssen Geldstrafen zahlen  |date=2017-09-18 |language=de |trans-title=Failure to provide assistance to pensioner in bank - suspects must pay fines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Duncan Montgomery''' (March 19, 1835 – April 17, 1911) was a [[Scottish-American]] [[philosopher]], [[scientist]] and [[physician]]. He was the husband of [[German-American]] [[sculptor]] [[Elisabet Ney]]

==Early life==

Montgomery was born on the 19th of March, 1835, in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]].  His parentage is unknown, but the [[Elisabet Ney Museum]] relates the possibility that he was the son of Isabella Davidson (or Montgomery) and a prominent Scottish jurist, [[Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay]]. He and his mother lived in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]], supplemented by a trust fund for him.&lt;ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/montgomery_biography.html|publisher=Elisabet Ney Museum|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he entered his teens, he began to be interested in the [[philosophical]] works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].  While still living in Frankfurt and only 13 years old, he participated in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

==Education==

In 1852, Montgomery majored in medicine at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he did lab work under [[Robert Bunsen]] and came under the influence of Christian Kapp, [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]] and [[Jacob Moleschott]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;  He later attended lectures by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during his 1855–1856 enrollment.  While studying in  [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]]  1856–1857, he attended influential lectures of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

==Medical practice==

Montgomery received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree from the [[University of Würzburg]] on February 18, 1858.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

Montgomery interned at [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]]. He served his residency at the [[German Hospital, Dalston]] ([[London]]) and Bermondsay Dispensary.  While doing biological research, he became [[Curator]] of the [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keeton|first=Morris T|title=Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism|jstor=2707145|work=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=8|pages=309–341|doi=10.2307/2707145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians of London]] in 1862.

After being diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863, Montgomery left the Royal College of Physicians of London and established medical practices on the resort island of [[Madeira]] (1863–1865), in [[Menton]] (1866) on the [[French Riviera]], and also in [[Rome]] (1867) and [[Munich]] (1868), while continuing to do his research. A [[life annuity]] allowed him to retire from medical practice in 1869, and devote the rest of his life to philosophy, scientific research, and writing.&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers"/&gt;

==Medicine==

Montgomery's work in medicine included the study of [[cell theory]].

==Philosophy==

Montgomery's study of philosophy complemented his work as a physical scientist. He saw life as the ability of certain chemical compounds to resist damage. He commented on conceptions of knowledge and [[self (philosophy)|self]] in over sixty journal articles and five books. He was an advocate of [[humanitarianism]] and a "religion of life," focusing on the idea that man must not ignore the potential of his own yet-to-be-completed evolutionary process.

The two most significant papers written by Montgomery were his ''Refutation of Kant From the Standpoint of the Empirical'' (1870) and ''The Revelation of Present Experience ''(1910).&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"/&gt;

In the former, Montgomery convincingly refutes Immanuel Kant's a priori, the lynchpin of Kant's system, and in the latter, he insists that all knowledge (no exceptions) is based on the evidence provided by the senses.

Montgomery was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and [[organicism]]. He was also cited as a defender of [[vitalism]]. He authored ''The Vitality and Organization of Protoplasm'' (1904) and ''Philosophical Problems in the Light of Vital Organization''.&lt;ref&gt;Driesch, Hans. (1914).

Prentice-Hall. p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a pioneer of organicism.&lt;ref&gt;Keeton, Morris T. (1947). ''Edmund Montgomery--Pioneer of Organicism''.

''[[Southwest Review]]'' 16 (2): 200-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

While a student at the University of Heidelberg in 1853, Montgomery began a courtship with sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]], who was visiting friends in the city.  They were married at the [[British consulate]] in Madeira on November 7, 1863.&lt;ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ledbetter|first=Suzann|title=Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women|year=2006|publisher=Forge Books|isbn=978-0-7653-0827-6|pages=179–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863.  By 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] had begun. In the autumn of that year, Ney became pregnant with their first child.  Montgomery received a letter from his friend, Baron Carl Vicco Otto Friedrich Constantin von Stralendorff of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], who had moved to [[Thomasville, Georgia]] with his new wife, Margaret Elizabeth Russell of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], declaring the location "Earth's paradise."&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871–1873|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/emigration.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 1871, Ney and Montgomery, accompanied by their housekeeper, Cenci, emigrated to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to a colony promoted as a resort for [[tuberculosis|consumptives]]. Their first son, Arthur (1871–1873) was born there, and second son, Lorne (1872–1913), was born in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], during one of their travels.&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873"/&gt;  Baron and Baroness von Stralendorff returned to [[Wismar, Germany]], where he died on July 1, 1872.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00145/smu-00145.html|title=Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers|publisher=SMU|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New England Historical and Genealogical Register"&gt;{{cite book|last=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|title=The New England Historical and Genealogical Register|year=1873|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Ira Kendrick|title=The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo|year=1951|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Ney traveled alone to Texas. With the help of German Consul Julius Runge in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], Ney was shown [[Liendo Plantation]] near [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]] in [[Waller County, Texas|Waller County]].  On March 4, 1873, Montgomery and the rest of the family arrived, and he purchased it. While he tended to his research, Ney ran it for the next twenty years. Their son, Arthur, died of [[diphtheria]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873-1891"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873–1891|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/liendo.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From Jamestown to Texas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meischen|first=Betty Smith|title=From Jamestown to Texas|year=2002|publisher=IUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24223-8|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was involved in an advisory capacity in the founding of [[Prairie View A&amp;M]], originally called Prairie View Normal School.&lt;ref name="Edmund Montromery"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=I K|title=Edmund Montromery|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmo10|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Montgomery became a naturalized United States citizen, and thereafter became active in local politics and events. He served two terms as Waller County Road Commissioner and oversaw the building of an iron bridge across the [[Brazos River]].  In 1903, he was elected president of the Texas Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Texas Academy of Science 1892-1913"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward-McLemore|first=Ethel|title=Texas Academy of Science 1892–1913 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/snt01|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Montgomery died on April 17, 1911 after suffering a number of strokes and is buried next to Ney at Liendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|50606132|Edmund Duncan Montgomery|accessdate={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9718">'''Feature integration theory''' is a theory of [[attention]] developed in 1980 by [[Anne Treisman]] and [[Garry Gelade]] that suggests that when perceiving a stimulus, features are "registered early, automatically, and in parallel, while objects are identified separately" and at a later stage in processing. The theory has been one of the most influential [[cognitive model|psychological model]]s of human visual [[attention]]. 

==Stages==
According to Treisman, the first stage of the feature integration theory is the preattentive stage.  During this stage, different parts of the brain automatically gather information about basic features (colors, shape, movement) that are found in the visual field. The idea that features are automatically separated appears to be counterintuitive; however, we are not aware of this process because it occurs early in perceptual processing, before we become conscious of the object.

The second stage of the feature integration theory is the focused attention stage, where the individual features of an object combine in order to perceive the whole object. In order to combine the individual features of an object, attention is required and selection of that object occurs within a "master map" of locations. The master map of locations contains all of the locations in which features have been detected, with each location in the master map having access to the multiple feature maps. When attention is focused at a particular location on the map, the features currently in that position are attended to and are stored in "object files". If the object is familiar, associations are made between the object and prior knowledge, which results in identification of that object. In support of this stage, researchers often refer to patients suffering from [[Balint's syndrome]]. Due to damage in the parietal lobe, these people are unable to focus attention on individual objects. Given a stimulus that requires combining features, people suffering from Balint's syndrome are unable to focus attention long enough to combine the features, providing support for this stage of the theory. 

[[File:FITstages.png|alt=The stages of feature integration theory|thumb|300px|The stages of feature integration theory]]

Treisman distinguishes between two kinds of visual search tasks, "feature search" and "conjunction search". Feature searches can be performed fast and pre-attentively for targets defined by only one feature, such as color, shape, perceived direction of lighting, movement, or orientation. Features should "pop out" during search and should be able to form [[illusory conjunctions]]. Conversely, conjunction searches occur with the combination of two or more features and are identified serially. Conjunction search is much slower than feature search and requires conscious attention and effort. In multiple experiments, some referenced in this article, Treisman concluded that [[color]], [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], and [[intensity (disambiguation)|intensity]] are features for which feature searches may be performed.

As a reaction to the feature integration theory, Wolfe (1994) proposed the Guided Search Model 2.0. According to this model, attention is directed to an object or location through a preattentive process. The preattentive process, as Wolfe explains, directs attention in both a bottom-up and top-down way. Information acquired through both bottom-up and top-down processing is ranked according to priority. The priority ranking ''guides'' visual search and makes the search more efficient. Whether the Guided Search Model 2.0 or the feature integration theory are "correct" theories of visual search is still a hotly debated topic.

==Experiments==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:fourshapesexp.png|thumb|alt=An example of four colored shapes and two black letters.|An example of the stimuli found in Treisman et al. (1982).]] --&gt;In order to test the notion that attention plays a vital role in visual perception, Treisman and Schmidt (1982) designed an experiment to show that features may exist independently of one another early in processing. Participants were shown a picture involving four objects hidden by two black numbers. The display was flashed for one-fifth of a second followed by a random-dot masking field that appeared on screen to eliminate "any residual perception that might remain after the stimuli were turned off".&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were to report the black numbers they saw at each location where the shapes had previously been. The results of this experiment verified Treisman and Schmidt's hypothesis. In 18% of trials, participants reported seeing shapes "made up of a combination of features from two different stimuli",&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; even when the stimuli had great differences; this is often referred to as an [[illusory conjunction]]. Specifically, illusory conjunctions occur in various situations. For example, you may identify a passing person wearing a red shirt and yellow hat and very quickly transform him or her into one wearing a yellow shirt and red hat. The feature integration theory provides explanation for illusory conjunctions; because features exist independently of one another during early processing and are not associated with a specific object, they can easily be incorrectly combined both in laboratory settings, as well as in real life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. Cognitive Psychology 12, 97-136 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As previously mentioned, Balint's syndrome patients have provided support for the feature integration theory. Particularly, Research participant R.M., a [[Bálint's syndrome]] sufferer who was unable to focus attention on individual objects, experiences illusory conjunctions when presented with simple stimuli such as a "blue O" or a "red T." In 23% of trials, even when able to view the stimulus for as long as 10 seconds, R.M. reported seeing a "red O" or a "blue T".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman-Hill et al., 1995; Robertson et al., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in accordance with feature integration theory's prediction of how one with a lack of focused attention would erroneously combine features.

[[File:treismanshapes.png|thumb|alt=The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively.|The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively. Treisman et al.(1986).]]

If people use their prior knowledge or experience to perceive an object, they are less likely to make mistakes, or illusory conjunctions. In order to explain this phenomenon, Treisman and Souther (1986) conducted an experiment in which they presented three shapes to participants where illusory conjunctions could exist. Surprisingly, when she told participants that they were being shown a carrot, lake, and tire (in place of the orange triangle, blue oval, and black circle, respectively), illusory conjunctions did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Illusory words: The roles of attention and of top–down constraints in conjoining letters to form words.
By Treisman, Anne; Souther, Janet. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 12(1), Feb 1986, 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman maintained that prior-knowledge played an important role in proper perception. Normally, bottom-up processing is used for identifying novel objects; but, once we recall prior knowledge, top-down processing is used. This explains why people are good at identifying familiar objects rather than unfamiliar.

==Reading==
When identifying letters while reading, not only are their shapes picked up but also other features like their colors and surrounding elements. Individual letters are processed serially when spatially conjoined with another letter. The locations of each feature of a letter are not known in advance, even while the letter is in front of the reader. Since the location of the letter's features and/or the location of the letter is unknown, feature interchanges can occur if one is not attentively focused. This is known as [[lateral masking]], which in this case, refers to a difficulty in separating a letter from the background.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade (1980).

'''Ferdinand Lee Barnett''' (February 18, 1852 – March 11, 1936) was an African-American journalist, lawyer, and civil rights activist in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in the late Reconstruction era and after. He was a founding editor of ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'' monthly in 1878. He was the third black person to be admitted to the Illinois bar and became a successful lawyer.

In 1895, he married [[Ida B. Wells]], a journalist and anti-lynching activist. In 1896, he became Illinois' first black assistant state's attorney. He was active in anti-lynching and civil rights and was called "one of the foremost citizens Chicago has ever had" by the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"&gt;Finkelman, Paul, ed. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 137&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ferdinand Lee Barnett was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His mother was a freewoman,&lt;ref name="judgeship"&gt;Negro Elected to Judgeship, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (San Francisco, California) December 17, 1906, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653448//&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Brooks, born about 1825. His father, also named Ferdinand Lee Barnett, was born in Nashville about 1810 and worked as a blacksmith. He purchased his family's freedom the year Ferdinand was born. They lived in Nashville until about 1859, when they left the United States and moved to [[Windsor, Ontario]], across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref name="goldenwedding"&gt;Golden Wedding of Colored Couple, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois), June 28, 1897, p. 5, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080536/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653492/golden_wedding_of_colored_couple/&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to get beyond the reach of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850, which had created incentives for slave catchers to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery.

The Barnett family returned to the US in 1869 after the American Civil War and the end of slavery, settling in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Ferdinand was educated in Chicago schools,&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; first attending the old Jones school at Clark and Harrison. He entered [[Chicago High School|Central High School]],&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt; graduating in 1874. After high school he taught in the southern United States for two years before returning to Chicago to attend Union College of Law, later a part of [[Northwestern Law School]]. Barnett graduated from law school and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1878.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was the third black person to pass the Illinois bar, following [[Lloyd G. Wheeler]] and Richard A. Dawson.&lt;ref&gt;McCaul, Robert L. ''The Black Struggle for Public Schooling in Nineteenth-Century Illinois''. SIU Press, 2009. p100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbered among his cousins were [[Ferdinand L. Barnett (Omaha)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]] and his brother [[Alfred S. Barnett]]. They were also journalists and lived in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Des Moines, Iowa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Alfreda Duster (1904–1983), Chicago, Illinois. Interviewed by: Marcia McAdoo Greenlee, March 8 and 9, 1978. Library, Harvard University, p 20 Accessed March 7, 2016 at http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/45168262?n=32&amp;printThumbnails=no&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnett's father died in early February 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Death of F. L. Barnett St, ''The Appeal'' (Saint Paul, Minnesota) February 5, 1898, p. 4, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654458/death_of_f_l_barnett_st_the_appeal/&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died November 11, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] ''The New York Age'' (New York, New York) November 19, 1908, p. 5, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653846/no_headline_the_new_york_age_new/&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Conservator'' and early activism ==
In December 1877, Barnett, along with co-editors Abram T. Hall, Jr. and James E. Henderson, organized the semi-monthly newspaper, the ''Conservator'', the first edition appearing on January 1, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois) December 10, 1877, page 9, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917123353/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645582/no_headline_chicago_daily_tribune/&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the editors and stakeholders was Iowan [[Alexander Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. ''Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.'' GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p1100&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Chicago in 1884, where he served as an editor on the paper. (Clark was appointed as US ambassador to Liberia in 1891.)&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;[http://muscatinejournal.com/news/local/black-history-pioneer-alexander-clark-became-prominent-achiever-while-residing/article_66625acb-5714-519f-b6ee-96a031c5af75.html Connie Street, "Black history pioneer: Alexander Clark became prominent achiever while residing in Muscatine"], ''Muscatine Journal'', 24 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Conservator'' was a radical journal that focused on justice and equal rights, and Barnett was soon recognized as a local black leader. He was selected as a delegate to the [[Colored Conventions Movement|May 1879 National Conference of Colored Men]] in Nashville, where he gave a noted speech calling for unity and education.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was a delegate to the 1884 Inter-State Conference of Colored Men in [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;The Colored Men, ''Detroit Free Press'' (Detroit, Michigan), April 30, 1884, page 2, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645642/the_colored_men_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt; and the national convention of the [[Timothy Thomas Fortune]] led [[National Afro-American League|Afro-American League]] in Chicago in 1890 where he was named secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Afro-Americans, ''The Ottawa Daily Republic'' (Ottawa, Kansas) January 16, 1890, page 1, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645673/afroamericans_the_ottawa_daily/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and political career ==
Barnett started practicing law around 1883.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His prominence grew quickly and in 1888 he was considered for a Republican nomination for [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Cook County Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Inter Ocean'' (Chicago, Illinois), September 12, 1888, page 4, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645703/no_headline_the_inter_ocean/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he started a law partnership with [[S. Laing Williams]]. The pair split over Williams' affiliation with [[Booker T. Washington]], whom Barnett frequently opposed.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Ida B. Wells ===
[[File:Cover Southern horrors.png|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'']]
In 1892, three men, including a friend of Ida B. Wells, were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry and Barnett took part in meetings in Chicago called to organize reaction. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; Gaines substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Barnett closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

The event inspired Wells, who began to research and speak out against lynchings. In 1893, Wells sued the ''[[The Commercial Appeal|Memphis Commercial]]'' for libel when the journal attacked Wells over her reports on the racism and injustice of lynching. It had been claimed that lynching, while not legal, was a natural result of the need for revenge of a community against perpetrators of violent crime and did not single out blacks. Wells' work showed the falseness of this narrative. Wells asked lawyer and activist [[Albion W. Tourgee]] to represent her on the case, but Tourgee refused, having largely retired from law (with the exception of his ongoing support of the case which would become [[Plessy v Fergusson]]). Tourgee recommended Wells contact Barnett, and Barnett agreed to take the case. This may have been Barnett's introduction to Wells, whom he would marry two years later, and Barnett was taken with Wells. However, Barnett came to agree with the advice of Tourgee that the case could not be won, as a black woman would never win such a case heard by a white, male jury, and the case was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Karcher, Carolyn L. ''A Refugee from His Race: Albion W. Tourgée and His Fight Against White Supremacy''. UNC Press Books, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World's Fair ===
In 1893, Barnett coauthored a pamphlet entitled "The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] – The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature". The exposition, held in Chicago, refused to include an African American exhibit. The pamphlet was another early example of Barnett's personal and professional relationship with Wells.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; The pamphlet was published by Barnett, Wells, abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]], and educator [[Irvine Garland Penn]]. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor [[Edmonia Lewis]], a painting exhibit by scientist [[George Washington Carver]], and a statistical exhibit by [[John Imogen Howard]]. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as [[Nancy Green]]'s portrayal of the character, "Aunt Jemima" for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction of 2013 edition of Rydell, Robert W. ''All the world's a fair: Visions of empire at American international expositions, 1876–1916''. University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages and family ==
[[File:Ida Wells-Ferdinand Barnett and family.png|thumb|Photo of the Wells-Barnett Family from 1917&lt;ref name="hometies"/&gt;]]
Barnett's first wife was Molly Henrietta Graham Barnett, who was the first black woman to graduate from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Bay2009"&gt;Bay, Mia. ''To Tell the Truth Freely: The Life of Ida B. Wells''. Macmillan, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Molly and Ferdinand had two children, Ferdinand L. and Albert Graham Barnett. Molly died in 1888&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; of heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwell, James B, "The Colored Bar of Chicago," ''Chicago Legal News'' (Chicago, Illinois), Vol XXIX, No. 10, October 31, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Ferdinand Barnett served as [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eighth Regiment]] supply sergeant in World War I.&lt;ref name="hometies"&gt;"Breaking Home Ties", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) December 22, 1917, p. 14, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653602/breaking_home_ties_the_broad_ax_salt/&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Barnett became the city editor of the ''Defender'' in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Pittsburgh Courier'' (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), December 3, 1932, page 17, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653821/no_headline_the_pittsburgh_courier/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells remained in Chicago after the [[Columbian Exposition]]. In June 1895, she and Barnett married. The couple had four children, Charles Aked (1896), Herman Kohlsaat (1897), Ida B. (1901) and Alfreda M. Barnett (1904). Charles was named for the English anti-lynching activist, [[Charles Aked]], and Herman was named for the owner of the ''Chicago Inter Ocean'', [[H. H. Kohlsaat|Herman Kohlsaat]], who supported the ''Conservator''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; Barnett's attraction to Wells included his recognition of the mutual support for each other's careers that the relationship would bring. Shortly before their marriage, Wells purchased Barnett's stake in the ''Conservator'' and became the paper's manager and co-editor, while Barnett focused on his legal career.&lt;ref name="Bay2009"/&gt; Reverend [[Richard DeBaptiste]], founder of Olivet Baptist Church, was co-editor after Barnett.&lt;ref&gt;Dolinar, Brian, ed. ''The Negro in Illinois: The WPA Papers''. University of Illinois Press, 2013. p113&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
[[File:20070601 Wells House (2).JPG|thumb|left|From 1919–1930, Barnett and Wells lived in the [[Ida B. Wells-Barnett House]], now a [[List of Chicago Landmarks|Chicago landmark]] and [[National Historic Landmark]]]]
Barnett was an active Republican, and his support for the party put him in line for public office. In 1896, he was put in charge of the bureau of information and education for blacks by the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Allison Says Iowa is Safe", ''The New York Times'' (New York, New York) August 18, 1896, page 3, accessed September, 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645724/allison_says_iowa_is_safe_the_new_york/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Barnett became the first black assistant state's attorney in Illinois, appointed by the state's attorney [[Charles S. Deneen]] upon the recommendation of the Cook County Commissioner [[Edward H. Wright]].&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; As assistant state's attorney, Barnett worked in the juvenile court, in antitrust cases, and in [[habeas corpus]] and extradition proceedings. He frequently appeared before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] and had a good record.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1902, Barnett made national news when he suggested that 10 million blacks would revolt against lynch law in the South at a gathering at Bethlehem Church in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;"Colored Race's Rights", ''Deseret Evening News'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) May 23, 1902, page 3, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645931/colored_races_rights_deseret_evening/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he was appointed as head of the Chicago branch of the Republican Party's Negro Bureau. This appointment was opposed by [[Booker T. Washington]], who preferred Barnett's former partner, S. Laing Williams.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Municipal court judgeship controversy ===
In 1906, Barnett was nominated as judge in the new municipal court in Chicago, the first black candidate for a judgeship in Illinois. Barnett lost the election by 304 votes due to a lack of support by white&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; and black Republicans. In the campaign for the position, Barnett did not gain the full support of black ministers, particularly [[Archibald J. Cary]]. They were angry that his wife Ida B. Wells supported gambling kingpin Bob Motts's Peking Theater – which was converted from a saloon. Barnett was initially declared winner, but the results were reviewed and Barnett became the only one of 27 Republican candidates rejected.&lt;ref name="Reed2014"&gt;Reed, Christopher Robert. ''Knock at the Door of Opportunity: Black Migration to Chicago, 1900–1919''. SIU Press, 2014. p191, 289&lt;/ref&gt; If he had been elected, Barnett would have been the second black judge in a court of record after [[Robert Heberton Terrell]] of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt;

=== Return to private practice and death ===
[[File:FL Barnett 1918.png|thumb|Photo of Barnett from ''The Broad Ax'' in 1918&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"&gt;Chicken Joe Campbell will not Hand for Governor Frank O Lowden has Commuted his Death Sentence to Life Imprisonment, ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) April 13, 1918, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653572//&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Barnett left the position of assistant state's attorney in 1910, turning to private practice where he advocated for African-American rights. He often worked ''pro bono'', focusing on employment discrimination and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1917 he was a candidate for [[Chicago City Council|alderman]] of the second ward in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Barnett, "Candidate for Alderman", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) February 24, 1917, page 4, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653894//&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous case was the defense with attorneys [[Robert M. McMurdy]] and Cowen of "Chicken Joe" Campbell. Although Campbell was convicted for the murder of Odelle B. Allen, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Governor [[Frank O. Lowden]] on April 12, 1918.&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"/&gt;

in the 1920s, Barnett and his wife supported [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].&lt;ref name="Reed2014"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, Barnett began to support the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

Barnett died March 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

[[File:Derek Parfit at Harvard-April 21, 2015-Effective Altruism (cropped).jpg|thumb|Derek Parfit influenced the psychological research on the future self.]]
Psychological research on the future self often attributes its theoretical foundations to the philosopher [[Derek Parfit]]. Parfit argued that people might differ in the extent they feel similar and connected to themselves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1093/019824908x.001.0001|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|date=1986-01-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198249085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parfit|first=Derek|date=1971|title=Personal Identity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2184309|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=80|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.2307/2184309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Parfit’s conceptualization, people act rationally by basing their concern for their future on the degree of connectedness between present and future selves. According to Parfit, it is rational for people that perceive very little connectedness with their future self to act in ways that neglect the future self (e.g., by smoking). 

The psychological work that followed did not similarly argue that people who feel disconnected from their future self ''should'' engage in short-sighted behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather, the psychology of the future self primarily addresses the descriptive validity of Parfit’s theory. 

== Psychological theory ==
Social psychological and neurological evidence suggests that people think about themselves in the future similar to how they think about other people.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|last2=Olivola|first2=Christopher Y.|last3=Kennedy|first3=Kathleen A.|date=2007-12-04|title=Doing Unto Future Selves As You Would Do Unto Others: Psychological Distance and Decision Making|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=224–236|doi=10.1177/0146167207310023|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ersner-Hershfield|first=Hal|last2=Wimmer|first2=G.

=== Measuring psychological connectedness ===
[[Shane Frederick]] initially tested whether the degree of connectedness with the future self is associated with less discounting of future benefits (in dollar amounts and time).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He measured connectedness by asking participants to rate how similar they expect to be with themselves 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 years in the future. He did not estimate a statistically significant relationship between the degree of connectedness and [[discounting]] of future benefits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Shane|date=2003|title=Time preference and personal identity|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.8534&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Time and decision|volume=|pages=89-113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, Hal Hershfield and colleagues introduced a new method for measuring psychological connectedness with the future self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ersner-Hershfield|first=Hal|last2=Garton|first2=M.

The more psychologically connectedness people feel between present and future selves, the more they care about the future, and the less they [[Discounting|discount]] future benefits.

=== Manipulating psychological connectedness ===
The research that followed showed systematic ways to enhance psychological connectedness. Experiments have manipulated connectedness by having participants:

# Interact with a visual depiction of their future self (increased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# List ways in which they expect to be similar to themselves in the future (increased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Expect an upcoming event (e.g., college graduation) to fundamentally change who they are (decreased connectedness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The randomized experiments revealed a causal relationship between feeling connected to one’s future self and subsequently making more patient long-term decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Policy applications ==

=== Finances ===
In one of the first experiments to enhance psychological connectedness with the future self, participants were given immersive [[virtual reality]] technology and instructed to look at themselves in a virtual mirror&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The experimenters randomized whether participants saw an age-progressed version of themselves (meant to look approximately 70 years old) or a current-aged self. Participants that interacted with their future self were more likely to delay present monetary rewards and indicated greater intentions to save for retirement. The effect of interacting with the future self on financial decisions was mediated by enhanced feelings of psychological connectedness. Leveraging the insights from this experiment, firms such as [[Merrill Lynch]] have since adopted web applications with age-progressing software in order to increase retirement savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/consumer-banking/new-merrill-edger-mobile-app-uses-3d-technology-put-retirement|title=New Merrill Edge Mobile App Uses 3D Technology to Put Retirement Planning in Your Hands|publisher=Bank of America|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finding has been conceptually replicated with multiple diverse samples. In one [[field experiment]], students from economically diverse backgrounds that had weekly interactions with an avatar of their future self demonstrated heightened performance during a [[financial education]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-23|title=CONNECTING TO YOUR FUTURE SELF: ENHANCING FINANCIAL PLANNING AMONG DIVERSE COMMUNITIES USING VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=55|issue=Suppl_2|pages=311–311|doi=10.1093/geront/gnv610.04|issn=0016-9013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of researchers, in collaboration with Ideas42, launched another replication with thousands of [[Mexicans|Mexican citizens]]. Before deciding whether to sign-up for an automatic savings account, the treatment group was asked to spend time vividly imagining their lives in the distant future. Compared to a 1% take up rate in the control condition, 3% of people in the treatment condition enrolled in the automatic savings account.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The effect of psychological connectedness on financial decision making is moderated by knowledge about future outcomes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When people are unaware of their future financial needs, regardless of how connected they feel, they are unlikely to save for the future. Similarly, people that have full information about the consequences of their financial actions will only save if they also feel connectedness with their future self. The researchers argue that policy makers who provide information to consumers on retirement savings should also consider simultaneously enhancing psychological connectedness. People are most likely to save rather than spend when they are knowledgeable about the outcomes of their decisions ''and'' feel connected to their future selves.

In 2017, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] included a measure of psychological connectedness to the future self in its first Financial Wellbeing Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/financial-well-being-survey-data/|title=Financial Well-Being Survey Data|publisher=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Health ===
Applying the existing theory, researchers hypothesized that increasing feelings of connectedness with the future self should cause people to make healthier [[dieting]] and [[Exercise|exercising]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutchick|first=Abraham M.|last2=Slepian|first2=Michael L.|last3=Reyes|first3=Monica O.|last4=Pleskus|first4=Lindsay N.|last5=Hershfield|first5=Hal E.|date=2018|title=Future self-continuity is associated with improved health and increases exercise behavior.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|volume=24|issue=1|pages=72–80|doi=10.1037/xap0000153|issn=1939-2192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correlational evidence suggests that feeling psychologically connected to the future self corresponds with greater self-reported health. In randomized experiments, people were prompted to write about a distant future self (in 20 years time) or a near future self (in 3 months). Participants that wrote about a distant future self were more likely to exercise in the days following the writing task compared to participants in the near future condition. 

=== Ethicality ===
People engage in ethically dubious behavior because they tend to neglect the potential future consequences of their behavior.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The more psychologically connected people feel to their future selves, however, the more they care about potential future consequences and avoid ethical transgressions in the present moment. Experiments have found that assigning participants to write about their future selves can decrease support for unethical [[negotiation]] strategies.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hershfield|first=Hal E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|last3=Thompson|first3=Leigh|date=2012|title=Short horizons and tempting situations: Lack of continuity to our future selves leads to unethical decision making and behavior|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=117|issue=2|pages=298–310|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.11.002|issn=0749-5978|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another set of experiments, after interacting with a 40-year old version of themselves in immersive virtual reality, college students were less likely to cheat on a following task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Gelder|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Hershfield|first2=Hal E.|last3=Nordgren|first3=Loran F.|date=2013-04-16|title=Vividness of the Future Self Predicts Delinquency|journal=Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=974–980|doi=10.1177/0956797612465197|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a field experiment, high schoolers in the [[Netherlands]] were randomly assigned to either receive texts from an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] of their future self in the treatment condition or texts from their current self in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VAN GELDER|first=JEAN-LOUIS|last2=LUCIANO|first2=EVA C.|last3=Weulen Kranenbarg|first3=Marleen|last4=Hershfield|first4=Hal E.|date=2015-03-05|title=Friends With My Future Self: Longitudinal Vividness Intervention Reduces Delinquency|journal=Criminology|volume=53|issue=2|pages=158–179|doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12064|issn=0011-1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a week, the high schoolers in the treatment condition received text messages prompting them to imagine their future circumstances. Following the intervention, high schoolers in the treatment condition were less likely to engage in delinquent and anti-social behavior compared to participants in the control condition.

[[File:Yoko Ono. Half-A-Room. 1967.jpg|thumb|''Half-A-Room'', MOMA, 1967.]]
'''''Half-A-Room''''' is a 1967 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work is made from various objects that have been cut in half and painted white. It was made with the help of Ono's second husband, [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], and some local art students. The piece was first displayed at Ono's 'Half-A-Wind' exhibition (also called 'Yoko Plus Me'&lt;ref name="Badman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Badman|title=The Beatles: Off the Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9YFvAv6GrwC|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-045-8|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in West London in 1967. At the Lisson Gallery show the objects were accompanied by a row of glass bottles on a shelf with each bottle containing the words "Half a X" for each cut up object to represent their respective missing halves. The names in bottles was suggested by [[John Lennon]], with Ono recognizing his contribution semi-anonymously with the inclusion of the label "J.L." underneath the bottles.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Half-a-Room'' was shown at Ono's exhibition from 10 November 2007 to 4 February 2008 at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in São Paulo .&lt;ref name='AIU'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-a-Room|url=http://www.a-i-u.net/art_news.html|publisher=AIU|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's 1967 ''Half-a-Wind'' exhibition at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in Paddington, London, from 11 October to 14 November 1967.&lt;ref name='LissonEx'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-A-Wind show|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/yoko-ono-half-a-wind-show|publisher=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the exhibition was underwritten by [[John Lennon]]. Ono had been to see Lennon's friend [[Pete Shotton]], who was working for [[The Beatles]] company [[Apple Corps]], and had asked to borrow a few thousand pounds to fund the exhibition. Shotton told Ono that he "really not authorised to hand out two thousand quid like that" but upon asking Lennon, Shotton said that he "merely grunted the affirmative without further comment". Lennon later described the exhibition as all "beautifully cut in half and painted white...That was our first public appearance, but I didn't even go and see the show, I was too uptight".&lt;ref name="Badman2009"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Half-A-Room'' has been described by Ono as a response to her feeling at the time that "there was a half empty space in my life" as a result of the increasing estrangement of her and her second husband, [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]]. Ono awoke one day and noticed that her Cox had not returned from a night out, and so the bed was half empty, and through this realised that there was "a half empty space in my life". The magazine ''[[Another Magazine]]'' wrote in 2015 that the piece "speaks to the pointlessness of material things without the human connection that gives them meaning; the result is a pure, painful representation of heartbreak that takes the breath away."&lt;ref name='AnOther15&gt;{{cite web|title=The Extraordinary Yoko Ono|url=http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/7473/the-extraordinary-yoko-ono|publisher=[[Another Magazine]]|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional impact of the end of her relationship with Cox subsequently inspired Ono to make her piece ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]''.&lt;ref name=Guard14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence|title=Yoko Ono show at Guggenheim shines light on pioneering conceptual artist|date=13 March 2014|author=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the accompanying exhibition text ''Some Notes on the Lisson Gallery Show'', Ono wrote that "I think of this show as an elephant's tail. ...Life is only half a game. Molecules are always at the verge of half disappearing and half emerging. Somebody said I should also put half-a-person in the show. But we are halves already. It is sad that the air is the only thing we share. No matter how close we get to each other, there is always air between us. It is also nice that we share the air. No matter how far apart we are, the air links us".&lt;ref name='LissonHalf'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-a-Room|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/50years/half-a-room-installation|publisher=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an audio guide recorded for Ono's 2015 retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, Ono said that "You see a room with little – a space between it.

'''Holy virility'''
or Holy virility: The [[Social construction|Social Construction]] of Masculinity &lt;ref&gt;Reynaud, Emmanuel. Trans Ros Schwartz. [[Holy virility]]. [[Pluto Press]]. New York. 1983 {{ISBN|0-86104-399-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by Emmanuel Reynaud.

First Published in France in 1981 as ''La Sainte Virilité''&lt;ref&gt;Reynaud, Emmanuel. La Sainte Virilité, Syros. Paris. 1981. {{ISBN|2-901968-51-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Holy virility explores how language and society place pressure upon men to behave in line with their socially gendered role.
Reynaud calls for men to fight for [[self-realization]] in order to emancipate themselves.
He states that association of power in [[Human male sexuality|male sexuality]] prevents men from enjoying sensual sex.&lt;ref name="newint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/issue158/power.htm|title=Power And Pleasure -- New Internationalist|publisher=newint.org|accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Wesler-Lang, in his article Déconstruire le masculin, problèmes épistémologiques, situates Reynauds thoughts within studies of masculinity and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnam.fr/psychanalyse/recherche/revue/textewelzer3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128135202/http://www.cnam.fr/psychanalyse/recherche/revue/textewelzer3.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Background on Holy Virility'''

Holy Virility observes the different aspects of male power that is perpetrated on women. The book The Social Construction of Masculinity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://keimena11.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/emmanuel-reynaud-holy-virility-the-social-construction-of-masculinity-1981.pdf|title = Holy Virility|date = 12/10/15|accessdate = 12/10/15|website = Holy Virility by Emmanuel Reynaud|publisher = |last = Reynaud|first = Emmanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains how Holy Virility and males are oppressed to measure up to the standards of being an identified male. The author Emmanuel Renaud argues that “It is within men’s grasp to reject power relations and begin to behave in a way that is neither hierarchical nor exploitative.” The author explores different dynamics and is active in finding knowledge to educate men and women.  The books main focus is on men’s biological makeup, sexuality, phallic orgasm, language, being a dad/rapist and being married. Emmanuel Reynaud explores and explains how men’s performance in society are supposed to be masculine. Emmanuel Reynaud born in France influences and educates the men’s movement in France. Today some of the concepts used in the book are seen in today’s society. Western and Eastern ideologies of being a man and women are different throughout history. Men abuse the power they have and seem hierarchal against women. Holy Virility is the social construction of masculinity. Men today are taught to act a certain way through gender, men for masculinity and female through acting feminine. Although, men and women can put on a performance of opposite genders. The Holy Virility explains the reasons why do men act the way they do and give concrete information about men's performance.

'''Hylomorphism''' (or '''hylemorphism''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory developed by [[Aristotle]], which conceives [[wiktionary:being|being]] ([[ousia]]) as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. The word is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Matter and form==
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle defines X's matter as "that out of which" X is made.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b23-24&lt;/ref&gt; For example, letters are the matter of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a16&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "matter" is a relative term:&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b9&lt;/ref&gt; an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas bricks are matter relative to a brick house.

Change is analyzed as a material transformation: matter is what undergoes a change of form.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a lump of bronze that's shaped into a statue. Bronze is the matter, and this matter loses one form (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue).&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1045a26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle's theory of [[perception]], we perceive an object by receiving its form with our sense organs.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 424a19&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, forms include complex ''[[qualia]]'' such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 418a11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substantial form, accidental form, and prime matter==
{{See also|Substantial form}}
Medieval philosophers who used Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between [[substantial form]]s and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a "substance" (''ousia'') is an individual thing—for example, an individual man or an individual horse.&lt;ref&gt;''Categories'' 2a12-14&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 34&lt;/ref&gt; the properties that S's matter needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 94&lt;/ref&gt; properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a substance's matter will itself be a substance. If substance A is made out of substance B, then substance B is the matter of substance A. However, what is the matter of a substance that is not made out of any other substance? According to Aristotelians, such a substance has only "prime matter" as its matter. Prime matter is matter with no substantial form of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Leftow 136-37&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can change into various kinds of substances without remaining any kind of substance all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body–soul hylomorphism==
===Basic theory===
{{See also|On the Soul|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism [[Aristotle's biology|to living things]]. He defines a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as that which makes a living thing alive.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413a20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 414a3-9&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412a20, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b5-7, 413a1-3, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape.&lt;ref&gt;412b5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of  a body with the property of life, which is its soul. On the basis of his hylomorphic theory, Aristotle rejects the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine of [[reincarnation]], ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 407b20-24, 414a22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Timothy Robinson, it is unclear whether Aristotle identifies the soul with the body's structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to another interpretation, the property of life—that is, the soul—is something in addition to the body's structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 47&lt;/ref&gt; John Vella uses [[Frankenstein]]'s monster to illustrate the second interpretation:&lt;ref&gt;Vella 92&lt;/ref&gt; the corpse lying on Frankenstein's table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.

===Living bodies===
Some scholars have pointed out a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 290-93&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul in order to be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 291&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b19-24&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive.&lt;ref&gt;412b15&lt;/ref&gt; But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.

One approach to resolving this problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 293&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old and the seventy-year-old bodies share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.

Another approach to resolving the problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "A Fundamental Problem"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a distinction between "proximate" and "non-proximate" matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word "body" to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this "body" remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word "body" to refer to the fully organized body.

===Intellect===
{{See also|Nous|Active intellect|Passive intellect}}
Aristotle says that the intellect (''[[nous]]''), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination).&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a26-27&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he says that it is not mixed with the body&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a24-25&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that it can exist apart from the body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413b24-26, 429b6&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to contradict Aristotle's claim that the soul is a form or property of the body. To complicate matters further, Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds, or two parts, of intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 15-25''&lt;/ref&gt; These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the "[[passive intellect]]" and the "[[active intellect|active (or agent) intellect]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 50&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, interpreters of Aristotle have faced the problem of explaining how the intellect fits into Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of the soul.

According to one interpretation, a person's ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; This would amount to a form of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Some Recent Approaches" 165&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the "mind-soul problem": if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?&lt;ref&gt;Pasnau 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the [[unmoved mover]], Aristotle's God.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 199&lt;/ref&gt;

A third interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal hylomorphism==
The [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol|Avicebron (''a.k.a.''Solomon Ibn Gabirol)]] proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Medieval modifications==
[[Medieval]] [[theology|theologians]], newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

===Plurality vs. unity of substantial form===
Many medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being's soul as that being's form—specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X's soul is X's ''only'' substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X's soul is X's only substantial form, responsible for all of the features of X's body.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms—(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.&lt;ref&gt;Cross 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomistic hylomorphism===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] claimed that X’s soul was X’s only [[substantial form]], although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X’s nonessential features.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is [[reason|rational capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;Leftow, "Soul, Mind, and Brain" 397&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 340&lt;/ref&gt; He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 341&lt;/ref&gt; So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eleonore Stump]] describes Aquinas' theory of the soul in terms of "configuration". The body is matter that is "configured", i.e. structured, while the soul is a "configured configurer". In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 514&lt;/ref&gt;  A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.

Aquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Stump,"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas’ attribution of rational capacity to the soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity, although he was adamant that such a state was unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleology and ethics==
{{See also|Nicomachean Ethics}}
Aristotle holds a [[teleology|teleological]] worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form,&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1050a15&lt;/ref&gt; and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake ''ought to'' slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.

Aristotle bases his [[ethics|ethical]] theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the best human life is a life lived rationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern physics==
The idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when [[Werner Heisenberg]] invented his duplex world of quantum mechanics. In his 1958 text ''Physics and Philosophy'', Heisenberg states:

{{quote|In the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But atoms and the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts ... The probability wave ... mean[s] tendency for something. It's a quantitative version of the old concept of potentia from Aristotle's philosophy. It introduces something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|title=Physics and Philosophy|year=1958|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=London|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An '''implementation intention''' (II) is a self-regulatory [[strategy]] in the form of an "[[Indicative conditional|if-then]] plan" that can lead to better [[goal]] attainment, as well as help in habit and [[behavior modification]]. It is subordinate to goal intentions as it specifies the ''when'', ''where'' and ''how'' portions of goal-directed behavior. The concept of implementation intentions was introduced in 1999 by [[psychologist]] [[Peter Gollwitzer]].&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted by Gollwitzer in 1997 and earlier show that the use of implementation intentions can result in a higher probability of successful [[goal]] attainment, by predetermining a specific and desired goal-directed behavior in response to a particular future event or cue.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M., &amp; Brandstaetter, V. (1997). Implementation intentions and effective goal pursuit. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 186-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of implementation intentions originated from research on goal striving throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. Developing research suggests that "the correlations between intentions and behavior are modest, in that intentions account for only 20% to 30% of the variance in behavior." &lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong intentions ("I strongly intend to do X") were observed to be more often realized than weak intentions. Past behavior still tended to be a better [[Dependent and independent variables|predictor]] for a person's future behavior when it was compared to goal intentions. The research also suggested that the weak intention-behavior relation is a result of people having good intentions, but failing to act on them.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt;

This inspired a growing body of research to help determine ways in which peoples' good intentions could be made more effective in accomplishing desired goals. Emerging research proposed the notion that successful goal attainment is in part attributable to the manner in which [[goal setting]] criteria are framed. For example, a person will perform better when set goals are challenging and specific as compared to goals that are challenging but vague (known as the goal-specificity effect).&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E. A., Latham, G. P., (1990). A theory of goal setting &amp; task performance. In: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, US: Prentice-Hall, Inc. (1990). xviii, 413 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging research also suggested a goal-proximity effect (wherein proximal goals lead to better performance than distal goals).&lt;ref&gt;Bandura A, &amp; Dale H. (1981), Cultivating competence, self-efficacy, and intrinsic interest through proximal self-motivation, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 41(3), Sep 1981, 586-598.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy of implementation intentions was developed on the basis of these findings.

==Concept==
People generally have positive [[intention]]s, but often fail to act on them.&lt;ref&gt;Orbell, S., &amp; Sheeran, P. (1998) Regulation of behaviour in pursuit of health goals: Commentary. Psychology and Health, 13, 753-758&lt;/ref&gt; The question is how to ensure that the set goal intentions will reliably lead to the desired goal-directed behaviors, and subsequent attainment of those goals. Implementation intentions offer a practical solution for such a problem.

Achieving one's goals requires that certain goal-directed [[behavior]]s be instituted, but people are often unsuccessful in either initiating or maintaining these behaviors. The problems of initiating and maintaining goal-directed behavior can be addressed by using the implementation intention process. This if-then plan is a very specific approach as compared to goal intentions. A goal intention may be phrased in the following way: "I want to reach X!" Implementation intentions on the other hand are much more specific and seek to connect a future critical situation (an opportunity for goal attainment) with a specific goal-directed behavior, thereby leading to what could be called automatization in goal attainment. They are often phrased in the following way: "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y!"&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Where goal intentions are more general and abstract, implementation intentions are much more concrete and procedural.

Having formed a concrete plan involving a specific situation, this situation then becomes mentally represented and activated, leading to better [[perception]], [[attention]] and [[memory]] concerning the critical situation. As a result, the chosen goal-directed behavior (the then-part of the plan) will be performed automatically and efficiently, without conscious effort. The automatization of the behavior in response to the future situation or cue, removes all hesitation and deliberation on the part of the decision maker when such a critical situation arises. This also has the effect of freeing cognitive resources for other mental processing tasks, and also for avoiding goal-threatening distractions or competing goals. It is also assumed that an implementation intention, once set, will continue operating non-consciously. This process is called strategic automaticity.

The strength of [[promise|commitment]] related to both the plan set and the goal is very important for the implementation intention to have an effect on people's behavior. Without commitment, an implementation intention will hardly have any effect on goal-directed behavior.

In the phase model of action, the use of implementation intention takes place in the post-decisional phase (implemental mindset, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is the driving force of action) which follows the predecisional phase (deliberative mindset, motivation is the driving force of setting goals).&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1990). Action phases and mind-sets. In E. T. Higgins &amp; R. M. Sorrentino (Eds.), The handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior (Vol. 2, pp. 53-92). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the implemental mindset, a person is already committed to a goal and an implementation intention can be a good strategy to reach this goal.

The basic structure of an implementation intention is as follows:

'''IF''' {situation} '''THEN''' I will {behaviour}

==Theory==

Actively prompting individuals to make plans increases their likelihood of following through. Effective planning prompts guide people to consider when, where, and how they can act upon their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitating plan creation helps to increase follow-through for several reasons. First, it helps people to consider logistic obstacles and develop specific tactics to navigate around them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., &amp; Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science &amp; Policy , 1(2) (December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the process helps to reduce the likelihood that someone will underestimate the time required by a task.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., &amp; Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science &amp; Policy , 1(2) (December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Third, plan creation helps people to remember to act.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., &amp; Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science &amp; Policy , 1(2) (December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the formation of an action plan serves as a commitment to act. Research shows that breaking commitments generates discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1984). Chapter 3: Commitment and consistency: hobgoblins of the mind. Influence: The psychology of persuasion. New York, NY: Harper Collins Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, plans are particularly effective when they are made as commitments to another person.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., &amp; Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science &amp; Policy , 1(2) (December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd Rogers, Katherine L. Milkman, Leslie K. John, and Michael I. Norton (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., &amp; Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science &amp; Policy , 1(2) (December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the following situations in which the use of planning prompts is most effective:

{{bulleted list |When strong intentions already exist |When these intentions are intrinsically motivated |When at least some obstacles exist |When no current plan exists |When the risk of forgetting to act is high |When the timeline for action is finite |When planning will induce people to consider specific barriers to action |When there is a specific future time for action |When people can think specifically about implementation details |When there are opportunities to share plans publicly |When planning for single rather than multiple goals |When there is a low likelihood that unanticipated moments for action will arise}}

==Empirical support==
Implementation intentions have been very successful in helping individuals achieve targeted and specific goals over the years, as indicated by a survey of the research.

===Voting plans===
Implementation intentions can help to increase voter turnout. A study by David W. Nickerson and Todd Rogers (2010) found that voters in a high-salience election were more likely to vote when they received an implementation intentions phone call facilitating the creation of a voting plan.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, D. W., &amp; Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Voters who were contacted with an implementation intentions phone script were asked three questions to facilitate plan-making: what time they would vote, where they would be going to the voting place from, and what they would be doing immediately prior to voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, D. W., &amp; Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Voters who were contacted via this phone script were 4.1 percentage points more likely to vote than those who did not receive a call.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, D. W., &amp; Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flu shots===
Planning prompts can also increase the likelihood that individuals will get flu shots. In a study conducted by Katherine L. Milkman, John Beshears, James J. Choi, David Laibson, and Brigitte C. Madrian (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L. Milkman ; John Beshears ; James J. Choi ; David Laibson ; Brigitte C. Madrian
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 28 June 2011, Vol.108(26), p.10415&lt;/ref&gt;, randomly assigned employees at a Midwestern company received a mailing that prompted them to write down the date and time that they would get their flu shot, while the remaining employees received a letter with only the clinic information. Those who received the plan-making letter were 4 percentage points more likely to get a flu shot.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L. Milkman ; John Beshears ; James J. Choi ; David Laibson ; Brigitte C. Madrian
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 28 June 2011, Vol.108(26), p.10415&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health goals===
Implementation intentions have been found to be particularly effective in unpleasant goal pursuits such as health-promotion (e.g. balanced and nutritious diet) and disease-prevention (e.g. daily exercise) behaviors, where there may be significant immediate costs and only long-term rewards. Of women who set themselves the goal of performing a breast self-examination over the next month, 100% actually did so if they were induced to form an implementation intention, compared to 53% of women who were not induced to form an implementation intention.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P.M. &amp; Oettingen, G. (1998), The emergence and implementation of health goals, Psychology &amp; Health, 13, 687-715&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2-month study investigating the effect of implementation intentions on weight loss, obese women between the ages of 18-76 were either instructed to create specific implementation intentions regarding their dieting and exercise (e.g. when, where, and what I will eat during the upcoming week; Where, when, how will I exercise during the upcoming week), or simply attend health, diet and stress-related group meetings. The women that were asked to create specific implementation intentions lost on average 4.2&amp;nbsp;kg, compared to those who only attended weekly group meetings, who on average lost only 2.1&amp;nbsp;kg over the 2-month period.&lt;ref&gt;Luszczynska, A., Sobczyk, A., Abraham, C.(2007), Health Psychology, 26, 507-512&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, a study sought to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables in a young-adult population. Participants who created "if-then" implementation intentions significantly increased reported fruit and vegetable intake by portions of 50% per day (over the course of one week), as compared to participants who made more global and less specific implementation intentions - reportedly consuming 31% more portions per day.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., Armitage, C. J., Norman, P. (2009), Psychology &amp; Health, 24, 317-332&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion regulation===
In 2009 Schweiger Gallo, Keil, Gollwitzer, Rockstroh and McCulloch published another study that was conducted to address the effectiveness of implementation intentions in regulating emotional [[Reactivity (psychology)|reactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Schweiger Gallo, I., Keil, A., McCulloch, K. C., Rockstroh, B., &amp; Gollwitzer, P. M. (2009). Strategic automation of emotion regulation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96, 11-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two studies required that disgust (in Study 1) and fear (in Study 2) eliciting [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] were viewed by participants subject to three different [[Self control|self-regulation]] instructions:

# The first group were given the simple goal intention to not experience fright or disgust, and were told to believe "I will not get frightened."
# The second group were given the first goal intention, with an additional implementation intention, and were told to believe "And if I see a spider, I will stay calm and relaxed."
# The third group were given no-self-regulation as the [[Treatment and control groups|control group]] and did not receive any instruction prior to the event.

Disgust was selected because it is almost universally considered to be a basic emotion in the applicable literature. Fear was selected because [[anxiety disorder]]s, such as panic disorders or phobias are common, and they affect the life of many people. The participants reported on the intensity of the elicited emotions by rating experienced arousal. Only group two, the implementation intention participants, succeeded in reducing their disgust and fear reactions compared to the other two groups.

These results support the idea that self-regulation by using simple goal intentions can run into problems when immediate and strong emotional reactivity has to be down-regulated, whereas implementation intentions appear to be an effective tool for [[Self control|self-regulation]].

Implementation intentions inhibit the automatic activation of stereotypical beliefs and prejudicial feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent study, the use of implementation intentions was applied to interactions with new acquaintances as well as interracial interactions. The notion is that interactions with new acquaintances can be laden with anxiety and also decrease interest and desire for long-term contact. The study found that implementation intentions actually increased interest in sustained contact during anxiety provoking interactions and also led to closer interpersonal distance in anticipation of interracial interactions. The results also suggest that anxiety itself was not reduced by means of implementation intentions, but rather, implementation intentions shielded individuals from the negative effects of anxiety during social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, C. &amp; West, T. V. (2014), Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,50,82-93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The earlier developments of the concept suggest that implementation intentions cause the mental representation of the anticipated situation to become highly activated and therefore easily accessible. The stronger the relationship between the cue or future situation and the predetermined behavior or response, the greater the success of initiating the desired goal-directed behavior. Since all components of the future behavior are predetermined (e.g. the when, where, and how), the association and relationship between said cue and behavior become automatic over time. That is, action initiation becomes immediate, efficient, and does not require conscious intent. In a more condensed explanation, implementation intentions automate action initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporary developments of the concept look not only at the initiatory aspects of implementation intentions, but look also at the longer-term phenomenon of behavior maintenance as it related to implementation intentions. The research suggests that implementation intentions result not only in an association between cue and behavior, but it's the act of planning into the future that actually serves as the foundation for this phenomenon. An experiment conducted by Papies et al., investigated the rate of goal completion by means of both implementation intentions and also the learning of cue-behavior association. Initially, both approaches led to the same rate of goal completion, but a week later, only the effect of implementation intentions was maintained. This lends evidence to the notion that implementation intentions rely on more complex mechanisms than simple cue-behavior associations, as was believed to be the case in earlier research.&lt;ref&gt;Papies, E. K., Aarts, H., de Vries, N. K. (2009), Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(5), 1148-1151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation Intentions and Goal Shielding==
A large amount of research has been conducted on implementation intentions to better understand the questions relating to the initiation of goal striving.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M., &amp; Sheeran, P. (2006). Implementation intentions and goal achievement: A meta-analysis of effects and processes. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38, 69-119&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the prior study of shielding of ongoing goal striving has been neglected in that research.

One study regarding this question was reported by Achtziger, Gollwitzer and Sheeran .&lt;ref&gt;Achtziger, A., Gollwitzer, P. M., &amp; Sheeran, P. (2008). Implementation intentions and shielding goal striving from unwanted thoughts and feelings. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 381-393.&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown in that study that implementation intentions can even assist people to shield goal striving from unwanted thoughts and feelings, such as [[Food craving|cravings]] for [[junk food]] and from distracting thoughts. Two [[field experiment]]s, concerning dieting (Study 1) and performance in sports (Study 2), have shown that there was a significant positive influence of implementation intentions on protecting ongoing goal striving. Participants who formed implementation intentions were more successful with long-term dieting, as well as concentration and performance in a tennis match. The focus on "If-then-plans" is the prevention of distracting thoughts and an efficient accomplishment of cognitive, motivational and emotional barriers of goal striving.

As these studies were run in "everyday" situations outside of an artificial laboratory, they possess a high external validity, and thus display the importance and meaningfulness of implementation intentions for everyday life.

==Limitations==
As reported by Theodore A. Powers and colleagues, implementation intentions seem to have a negative effect on the performance in people who score high on socially prescribed perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, T. A., Koestner, R.,&amp; Topciu, R. A. (2005). Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 31 (7): 902–912, {{doi|10.1177/0146167204272311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] to seek information when it does not affect action. People can often make better predictions or choices with less information: more information is not always better.  An example of information bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision, the better, even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision.&lt;ref name="Vaughan2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Michael|title=The Thinking Effect: Rethinking Thinking to Create Great Leaders and the New Value Worker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc95AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP29|year=2013|publisher=Nicholas Brealey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85788-933-8|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

In an experiment {{harv|Baron|Beattie|Hershey|1988}}, subjects considered this diagnostic problem involving fictitious diseases:&lt;ref name="Baron2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron|first=Jonathan|title=Thinking and Deciding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc5fQgAACAAJ|edition=4th|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-68043-1|page=177|chapter=Information bias and the value of information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female patient is presenting symptoms and a history which both suggest a diagnosis of globoma, with about 80% probability. If it isn't globoma, it's either popitis or flapemia. Each disease has its own treatment which is ineffective against the other two diseases. A test called the ET scan would certainly yield a positive result if the patient had popitis, and a negative result if she has flapemia. If the patient has globoma, a positive and negative result are equally likely. If the ET scan was the only test you could do, should you do it? Why or why not?

Many subjects answered that they would conduct the ET scan even if it were costly, and even if it were the only test that could be done. However, the test in question does not affect the course of action as to what treatment should be done. Because the probability of globoma is so high with a probability of 80%, the patient would be treated for globoma no matter what the test says. Globoma is the most probable disease before or after the ET scan.

In this example, we can calculate the value of the ET scan. Out of 100 patients, a total of 80 people will have globoma regardless of whether the ET scan is positive or negative. Since it is equally likely for a patient with globoma to have a positive or negative ET scan result, 40 people will have a positive ET scan and 40 people will have a negative ET scan, which totals to 80 people having globoma. This means that a total of 20 people will have either popitis or flapemia regardless of the result of the ET scan. The number of patients with globoma will always be greater than the number of patients with popitis or flapemia in either case of a positive or negative ET scan so the ET scan is useless in determining what disease to treat. The ET scan will indicate that globoma should be treated regardless of the result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20826">In [[business]] and [[accounting]], '''information technology controls''' (or '''IT controls''') are specific activities performed by persons or systems designed to ensure that business objectives are met.  They are a subset of an enterprise's [[internal control]].  IT control objectives relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and the overall management of the IT function of the business enterprise.  IT controls are often described in two categories:  IT general controls ([[ITGC]]) and IT application controls.  ITGC include controls over the [[Information Technology]] (IT) environment, computer operations, access to programs and data, program development and program changes.  IT application controls refer to transaction processing controls, sometimes called "input-processing-output" controls.  Information technology controls have been given increased prominence in corporations listed in the [[United States]] by the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].  The [[COBIT]] Framework (Control Objectives for Information Technology) is a widely used framework promulgated by the IT Governance Institute, which defines a variety of ITGC and application control objectives and recommended evaluation approaches.  IT departments in organizations are often led by a [[Chief Information Officer]] (CIO), who is responsible for ensuring effective information technology controls are utilized.

==IT General Controls (ITGC)==

ITGC represent the foundation of the IT control structure.  They help ensure the reliability of data generated by IT systems and support the assertion that systems operate as intended and that output is reliable.  ITGC usually include the following types of controls:

:* Control environment, or those controls designed to shape the corporate culture or "[[tone at the top]]."
:*[[Change management]] procedures - controls designed to ensure the changes meet business requirements and are authorized.
:*[[Source code]]/[[document]] [[version control]] procedures - controls designed to protect the integrity of program code
:*[[Software development life cycle]] standards - controls designed to ensure IT projects are effectively managed.
:*[[Logical access control|Logical access]] policies, standards and processes - controls designed to manage access based on business need.
:*[[Incident management]] policies and procedures - controls designed to address operational processing errors.
:*[[Problem management]] policies and procedures - controls designed to identify and address the root cause of incidents.
:*[[Technical support]] policies and procedures - policies to help users perform more efficiently and report problems.
:*[[computer hardware|Hardware]]/[[software]] configuration, installation, testing, management standards, policies and procedures.
:*[[Disaster recovery]]/[[Backup|backup and recovery]] procedures, to enable continued processing despite adverse conditions.
:*[[Physical security]] - controls to ensure the physical security of information technology from individuals and from environmental risks.

==IT application controls==

IT application or program controls are fully automated (i.e., performed automatically by the systems) designed to ensure the complete and accurate processing of data, from input through output. These controls vary based on the business purpose of the specific application.  These controls may also help ensure the privacy and security of data transmitted between applications.  Categories of IT application controls may include:

*Completeness checks - controls that ensure all records were processed from initiation to completion.
*Validity checks - controls that ensure only valid data is input or processed.
*Identification - controls that ensure all users are uniquely and irrefutably identified.
*Authentication - controls that provide an authentication mechanism in the application system.
*Authorization - controls that ensure only approved business users have access to the application system. 
*Input controls - controls that ensure data integrity fed from upstream sources into the application system.
*Forensic controls - control that ensure data is scientifically correct and mathematically correct based on inputs and outputs

== IT controls and the CIO/CISO ==

The organization's [[Chief Information Officer]] (CIO) or [[Chief Information Security Officer]] (CISO) is typically responsible for the [[security]], [[accuracy]] and the [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of the systems that manage and report the company's data, including financial data.  Financial accounting and [[enterprise resource planning]] systems are integrated in the initiating, authorizing, processing, and reporting of financial data and may be involved in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, to the extent they mitigate specific financial risks.

== Internal control frameworks ==

=== COBIT (Control Objectives for Information Technology) ===

[[COBIT]] is a widely utilized framework containing best practices for both ITGC and application controls. It consists of domains and processes.  The basic structure indicates that IT processes satisfy business requirements, which is enabled by specific IT control activities.  It also recommends best practices and methods of evaluation of an enterprise's IT controls.

=== COSO ===

The [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) identifies five components of internal control: '''[[control environment]]''', '''[[risk assessment]]''', '''control activities''', '''information and communication''' and '''monitoring''', that need to be in place to achieve [[financial reporting]] and disclosure objectives; [[COBIT]] provide a similar detailed guidance for IT, while the interrelated [[Val IT]] concentrates on higher-level IT governance and value-for-money issues.  The five components of COSO can be visualized as the horizontal layers of a three-dimensional cube, with the [[COBIT]] objective domains-applying to each individually and in aggregate.  The four [[COBIT]] major domains are: plan and organize, acquire and implement, deliver and support, and monitor and evaluate.

== IT controls and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) ==

SOX (part of [[United States federal law]]) requires the chief executive and chief financial officers of public companies to attest to the accuracy of financial reports (Section 302) and require public companies to establish adequate internal controls over financial reporting (Section 404). Passage of SOX resulted in an increased focus on IT controls, as these support financial processing and therefore fall into the scope of management's assessment of internal control under Section 404 of SOX.  

The COBIT framework may be used to assist with SOX compliance, although COBIT is considerably wider in scope.  The 2007 SOX guidance from the PCAOB&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/Auditing_Standard_5.aspx PCAOB Auditing Standard No 5]&lt;/ref&gt;  and SEC&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2007/33-8810.pdf SEC Interpretive Guidance]&lt;/ref&gt; state that IT controls should only be part of the SOX 404 assessment to the extent that specific financial risks are addressed, which significantly reduces the scope of IT controls required in the assessment. This scoping decision is part of the entity's [[SOX 404 top-down risk assessment]].  In addition, Statements on Auditing Standards No. 109 (SAS109)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/SAS109.PDF AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 109]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the IT risks and control objectives pertinent to a financial audit and is referenced by the SOX guidance.

IT controls that typically fall under the scope of a SOX 404 assessment may include:

*Specific application (transaction processing) control procedures that directly mitigate identified financial reporting risks.  There are typically a few such controls within major applications in each financial process, such as accounts payable, payroll, general ledger, etc.  The focus is on "key" controls (those that specifically address risks), not on the entire application.
*IT general controls that support the assertions that programs function as intended and that key financial reports are reliable, primarily change control and security controls;
*IT operations controls, which ensure that problems with processing are identified and corrected.

Specific activities that may occur to support the assessment of the key controls above include:

*Understanding the organization’s [[internal control]] program and its [[financial reporting]] processes.
*Identifying the IT systems involved in the initiation, authorization, processing, summarization and reporting of financial data;
*Identifying the key controls that address specific financial risks; 
*Designing and implementing controls designed to mitigate the identified risks and monitoring them for continued effectiveness;
*Documenting and testing IT controls;
*Ensuring that IT controls are updated and changed, as necessary, to correspond with changes in internal control or financial reporting processes; and 
*Monitoring IT controls for effective operation over time.

To comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, organizations must understand how the financial reporting process works and must be able to identify the areas where technology plays a critical part.  In considering which controls to include in the program, organizations should recognize that IT controls can have a direct or indirect impact on the financial reporting process.   For instance, IT application controls that ensure completeness of transactions can be directly related to financial assertions.  Access controls, on the other hand, exist within these applications or within their supporting systems, such as [[database]]s, [[Computer networking|network]]s and [[operating system]]s, are equally important, but do not directly align to a financial assertion.   Application controls are generally aligned with a [[business process]] that gives rise to financial reports.  While there are many IT systems operating within an organization, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance only focuses on those that are associated with a significant account or related business process and mitigate specific material financial risks.  This focus on risk enables management to significantly reduce the scope of IT general control testing in 2007 relative to prior years.

|}

=== Real-time disclosure ===
Section 409 requires public companies to disclose information about material changes in their financial condition or operations on a rapid basis.  Companies need to determine whether their existing financial systems, such as enterprise resource management applications are capable of providing data in real time, or if the organization will need to add such capabilities or use specialty software to access the data.  Companies must also account for changes that occur externally, such as changes by customers or business partners that could materially impact its own financial positioning (e.g. key customer/supplier bankruptcy and default).

To comply with Section 409, organizations should assess their technological capabilities in the following categories: 
:*'''Availability of internal and external portals''' - Portals help route and identify reporting issues and requirements to investors and other relevant parties.  These capabilities address the need for rapid disclosure.

:*'''Breadth and adequacy of financial triggers and alert''' - The organization sets the trip wires that will kick off a Section 409 disclosure event.

:*'''Adequacy of document repositories''' – Repositories play a critical role for event monitoring to assess disclosure needs and provide mechanism to audit disclosure adequacy.

:*'''Capacity to be an early adopter of [[XBRL|Extensible Business Reporting Language]] (XBRL)''' – XBRL will be a key tool to integrate and interface transactional systems, reporting and analytical tools, portals and repositories.

=== Section 802 &amp; Records retention ===
Section 802 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires public companies and their public accounting firms to maintain all audit or review work papers for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal period in which the audit or review was concluded.  This includes electronic records which are created, sent, or received in connection with an audit or review.  As [[external auditor]]s rely to a certain extent on the work of internal audit, it would imply that internal audit records must also comply with Section 802.

In conjunction with document retention, another issue is that of the security of storage media and how well electronic documents are protected for both current and future use.  The five-year record retention requirement means that current technology must be able to support what was stored five years ago.  Due to rapid changes in technology, some of today’s media might be outdated in the next three or five years.  Audit data retained today may not be retrievable not because of data degradation, but because of obsolete equipment and storage media.

Section 802 expects organizations to respond to questions on the management of SOX content.  IT-related issues include policy and standards on record retention, protection and destruction, online storage, audit trails, integration with an enterprise repository, market technology, SOX software and more. In addition, organizations should be prepared to defend the quality of their [[records management]] program (RM); comprehensiveness of RM (i.e. paper, electronic, transactional communications, which includes [[email]]s, [[instant message]]s, and [[spreadsheet]]s that are used to analyze financial results), adequacy of retention life cycle, immutability of RM practices, [[audit trail]]s and the accessibility and control of RM content.

=== End-user application / Spreadsheet controls ===

PC-based spreadsheets or databases are often used to provide critical data or calculations related to financial risk areas within the scope of a SOX 404 assessment.  Financial spreadsheets are often categorized as end-user computing (EUC) tools that have historically been absent traditional IT controls. They can support complex calculations and provide significant flexibility.  However, with flexibility and power comes the risk of errors, an increased potential for fraud, and misuse for critical spreadsheets not following the software development lifecycle (e.g. design, develop, test, validate, deploy). To remediate and control spreadsheets, public organizations may implement controls such as:

*Inventory and risk-rank spreadsheets that are related to critical financial risks identified as in-scope for SOX 404 assessment. These typically relate to the key estimates and judgments of the enterprise, where sophisticated calculations and assumptions are involved. Spreadsheets used merely to download and upload are less of a concern.
*Perform a risk based analysis to identify spreadsheet logic errors.  Automated tools exist for this purpose.
*Ensure the spreadsheet calculations are functioning as intended (i.e., "baseline" them).
*Ensure changes to key calculations are properly approved.

Responsibility for control over spreadsheets is a shared responsibility with the business users and IT.  The IT organization is typically concerned with providing a secure shared drive for storage of the spreadsheets and data backup.  The business personnel are responsible for the remainder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14473">'''Intertemporal choice''' is the process by which people make [[decision theory|decision]]s about what and how much to do at various points in time, when choices at one time influence the possibilities available at other points in time. These choices are influenced by the relative value people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. Most choices require decision-makers to trade off costs and benefits at different points in time. These decisions may be about saving, work effort, education, nutrition, exercise, health care and so forth. 

Since early in the twentieth century, [[economist]]s have analyzed intertemporal decisions using the [[discounted utility]]  model, which assumes that people evaluate the pleasures and pains resulting from a decision in much the same way that financial markets evaluate losses and gains, exponentially 'discounting' the value of outcomes according to how delayed they are in time. Discounted utility has been used to describe how people actually make intertemporal choices and it has been used as a tool for public policy. Policy decisions about how much to spend on research and development, health and education all depend on the [[Social discount rate|discount rate]] used to analyze the decision.&lt;ref name=Berns2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intertemporal choice – Toward an Integrative Framework |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=482 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.011 |pmid=17980645 |year=2007 |last1=Berns |first1=Gregory S. |last2=Laibson |first2=David |last3=Loewenstein |first3=George |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4554332/Laibson_IntertemporalChoice.pdf?sequence=2 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530144016/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4554332/Laibson_IntertemporalChoice.pdf?sequence=2 |archivedate=2016-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portfolio allocation==
{{Main|Intertemporal portfolio choice}}

Intertemporal portfolio choice is the allocation of funds to various assets repeatedly over time, with the amount of investable funds at any future time depending on the portfolio returns at any prior time. Thus the future decisions may depend on the results of current decisions. In general this  dependence on prior decisions implies that current decisions must take into account their probabilistic effect on future portfolio constraints. There are some exceptions to this, however: with a [[log utility|logarithmic utility]] function, or with a [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion|HARA utility]] function and [[serial correlation|serial independence]] of returns, it is optimal to act with (rational) myopia, ignoring the effects of current decisions on the future decisions.

==Consumption==
{{Main|Intertemporal consumption}}

The [[Keynesian consumption function]] was based on two major hypotheses. Firstly, the [[marginal propensity to consume]] lies between 0 and 1. Secondly, the average propensity to consume falls as income rises. Early empirical studies were consistent with these hypotheses. However, after World War II it was observed that saving did not rise as income rose. The Keynesian model therefore failed to explain the consumption phenomenon, and thus the theory of intertemporal choice was developed. The analysis of intertemporal choice was introduced by [[John Rae (economist)|John Rae]] in 1834 in the "Sociological Theory of Capital". Later, [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] in 1889 and [[Irving Fisher]] in 1930 elaborated on the model. A few other models based on intertemporal choice include the [[Life-cycle hypothesis|Life Cycle Income Hypothesis]] proposed by [[Franco Modigliani]] and the [[Permanent Income Hypothesis]] proposed by [[Milton Friedman]]. The concept of Walrasian equilibrium may also be extended to incorporate intertemporal choice. The Walrasian analysis of such an equilibrium introduces two "new" concepts of prices: futures prices and spot prices.

===Fisher's model of intertemporal consumption===
[[File:Budget constraint.jpg|thumb|left|Intertemporal budget constraint with consumption of period 1 and 2 on x-axis and y-axis respectively.]][[File:Intertemporal Choice.jpg|thumb|The figure depicts the intertemporal choice exercised by the consumer, given the utility preferences and the budget constraint.]]

Irving Fisher developed the theory of intertemporal choice in his book ''Theory of interest'' (1930). Contrary to Keynes, who related consumption to current income, Fisher's model showed how rational forward looking consumers choose consumption for the present and future to maximize their lifetime satisfaction.

According to Fisher, an individual's impatience depends on four characteristics of his income stream: the size, the time shape, the composition and risk. Besides this, foresight, self-control, habit, expectation of life, and bequest motive (or concern for lives of others) are the five personal factors that determine a person's impatience which in turn determines his time preference.&lt;ref name=Thaler1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thaler |first1=Richard H. |title=Irving Fisher: Modern Behavioral Economist |journal=The American Economic Review |date=1997 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=439–441 |jstor=2950963 |url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/IrvingFisher.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085631/http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/IrvingFisher.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the choice exercised by a consumer across different periods of time we take consumption in one period as a composite commodity. Suppose there is one consumer, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; commodities, and two periods. Preferences are given by &lt;math&gt;U(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_t = (x_{t1},\dots,x_{tN})&lt;/math&gt;. Income in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;Y_t&lt;/math&gt;. Savings in period 1 is &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt;, spending in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate. If the person is unable to borrow against future income in the first period, then he is subject to separate budget constraints in each period:

:&lt;math&gt;C_1 + S_1 \le Y_1,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1)

:&lt;math&gt;C_2 \le Y_2 + S_1(1 + r).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2)

On the other hand, if such borrowing is possible then the person is subject to a single [[intertemporal budget constraint]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C_1 + \frac{C_2}{1+r} = Y_1 + \frac{Y_2}{1+r}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3)

The left hand side shows the present value of expenditure and right hand side depicts the present value of income. Multiplying the equation by &lt;math&gt;(1+r)&lt;/math&gt; would give us the corresponding future values.

Now the consumer has to choose a &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; so as to
:Maximize
::&lt;math&gt;U(C_1,C_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:subject to
::&lt;math&gt;C_1+C_2/(1+r) = Y_1 + Y_2/(1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Saver.jpg|thumb|If the consumer is a net saver, an increase in interest rate will have an ambiguous effect on the current consumption.]][[File:Borrower.jpg|thumb|If the consumer is a net borrower, an increase in interest rate will reduce his current consumption.]]A consumer may be a net saver or a net borrower. If he's initially at a level of consumption where he's neither a net borrower nor a net saver, an increase in income may make him a net saver or a net borrower depending on his preferences.  An increase in current income or future income will increase current and future consumption(consumption smoothing motives).

Now, let us consider a scenario where the interest rates are increased. If the consumer is a net saver, he will save more in the current period due to the substitution effect and consume more in the current period due to the income effect. The net effect thus becomes ambiguous. If the consumer is a net borrower, however, he will tend to consume less in the current period due to the substitution effect and income effect thereby reducing his overall current consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varian | first = Hal | title = Intermediate Micro Economics | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modigliani's life cycle income hypothesis===
{{main article|Life-cycle hypothesis}}
The life cycle hypothesis is based on the following model:

:&lt;math&gt;\max U_t = \sum_t U(C_t)(1+\delta)^{-t}  &lt;/math&gt;

subject to

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_t C_t (1+r)^{-t}=\sum_t Y_t (1+r)^{-t} +W_0,&lt;/math&gt;
where

:''U''(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;) is satisfaction received from consumption in time period ''t'',

:''C''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the level of consumption at time ''t'',

:''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is income at time ''t'',

:''δ'' is the rate of [[time preference]] ( a measure of individual preference between present and future activity),

:''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial level of income producing assets.

[[File:Life Cycle Hypothesis.jpg|thumb|left|Life Cycle Hypothesis]]

Typically, a person's MPC ([[marginal propensity to consume]]) is relatively high during young adulthood, decreases during the middle-age years, and increases when the person is near or in retirement.  The Life Cycle Hypothesis(LCH) model defines individual behavior as an attempt to smooth out consumption patterns over one's lifetime somewhat independent of current levels of income. This model states that early in one's life consumption expenditure may very well exceed income as the individual may be making major purchases related to buying a new home, starting a family, and beginning a career. At this stage in life the individual will borrow from the future to support these expenditure needs. In mid-life however, these expenditure patterns begin to level off and are supported or perhaps exceeded by increases in income.
At this stage the individual repays any past borrowings and begins to save for her or his retirement.
Upon retirement, consumption expenditure may begin to decline however income usually declines dramatically. In this stage of life, the individual dis-saves or lives off past savings until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barro|first1=Robert J.|title=Macroeconomics|date=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262024365|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtV1DDXaSi4C|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mankiw2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mankiw|first1=N.

===Friedman's permanent income hypothesis===
{{main article|Permanent income hypothesis}}
After the Second World War, it was noticed that a model in which current consumption was just a function of current income clearly was too simplistic. It could not explain the fact that the long-run average propensity to consume seemed to be roughly constant despite the marginal propensity to consume being much lower. Thus [[Milton Friedman]]'s permanent income hypothesis is one of the models which seeks to explain this apparent contradiction.

According to the permanent income hypothesis, permanent consumption, ''C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;'', is proportional to permanent income, ''Y&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Permanent income is a subjective notion of likely average future income.  Permanent consumption is a similar notion of consumption.

Actual consumption, ''C'', and actual income, ''Y'', consist of these permanent components plus unanticipated transitory components, ''C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adaptive expectations: Friedman's permanent income hypothesis|url=http://salome.lse.ac.uk/courses/ec220/G/ieppt/series2/C11F07.ppsx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''C&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =β''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''Y&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

:''C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

:''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = Y&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + Y&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''

==Labor supply==
{{Main|Labor supply}}

The choice of an individual as to how much labor to currently supply involves a trade-off between current labor and leisure. The amount of labor currently supplied influences not only current consumption opportunities but also future ones, and in particular influences the future choice of when to retire and supply no more labor. Thus the current labor supply choice is an intertemporal choice.

==Fixed investment==
{{Main|Fixed investment}}

Fixed investment is the purchasing by firms of newly produced machinery, factories, and the like. The reason for such purchases is to increase the amount of output that can potentially be produced at various times in the future, so this is an intertemporal choice.

==Hyperbolic discounting==
{{main article|Hyperbolic discounting}}
The article so far has considered cases where individuals make intertemporal choices by considering the present discounted value of their consumption and income. Every period in the future is exponentially discounted with the same interest rate. A different class of economists, however, argue that individuals are often affected by what is called the temporal myopia. The consumer's typical response to uncertainty in this case is to sharply reduce the importance of the future of their decision making.This effect is called [[hyperbolic discounting]]. In the common tongue it reflects the sentiment “Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellows|first=Alan|title=Hyperbolic Discounting|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/hyperbolic-discounting/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, it may be represented as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f_H(D)=\frac{1}{1+kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''f''(''D'') is the [[discount factor]],
:''D'' is the delay in the reward, and
:''k'' is a parameter governing the degree of discounting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyperbolic discounting]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When choosing between $100 or $110 a day later, individuals may impatiently choose the immediate $100 rather than wait for tomorrow for an extra $10. Yet, when choosing between $100 in a month or $110 in a month and a day, many of these people will reverse their preferences and now patiently choose to wait the additional day for the extra $10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=P. Redden|first=Joseph|title=Hyperbolic Discounting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering, '''iso-elastic''' refers to a system of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] parts (springs and pulleys) which are arranged in a configuration which serves to isolate physical motion at one end from affecting the same motion at the other end.
This type of device must be able to maintain angular direction and load-bearing over a large range of motion.

The most prominent use of an iso-elastic system is in the supporting armature of a [[Steadicam]].
The Steadicam arm is used to isolate a film or video camera from the operator's movements. 
Steadicam arms all work in a fashion similar to a [[Luxo L1|spring lamp]] since each arm has 2 sections (similar to and labelled like a human arm), both the upper and fore-arm sections consist of a [[parallelogram]] with diagonal iso-elastic cable-pulley-spring system. The iso-elastic system is tensioned to counteract the weight of the camera and [[steadicam]] sled. This tensioning allows the camera and operator to move vertically and independently of each other. For example, as the operator runs, the bouncing of his body is absorbed by the springs, keeping the camera steady. The arm also has unsprung [[hinge]]s at both ends of each arm allowing it to bend in the horizontal plane (just like your elbow, not like a spring lamp).

To understand how an iso-elastic system works, we must first understand how springs work.  The [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (elastic force) in a spring is proportional to its extension according to [[Hooke's law]].  This means that if a weight is hung on a spring it will oscillate with [[simple harmonic motion]].  This is because when the weight is above the balance point, the spring's tension is reduced so the weight falls due to gravity, and when the weight is below the balance point the spring's tension will pull it back upwards.

If a simple spring system were used in a steadicam, then if the operator moved vertically, the camera would execute simple harmonic motion, and bounce up and down.  Instead, an iso-elastic system is employed.

The springs used are large, stiff springs with a high [[modulus of elasticity]], and they are highly tensioned.  A [[pulley|compound pulley]] system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided by a factor of (say) five. The cable exiting the pulley system will have a moderate tension on it, but most importantly, when the cable is drawn in or out, and the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much.  The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.

The almost constant force exerted by an iso-elastic system is employed in the armature of a steadicam, to counteract the constant force of [[gravity]] on the camera's and mount's [[mass]].  The result is that the [[weight]] of the camera is almost exactly balanced by the tension force throughout the entire range of vertical movement, so even when the operator jumps vertically, the camera will retain its vertical position due to [[inertia]], but remain balanced, just with the armature at a different angle.

As a result, the camera doesn't bounce up to the 'balanced' position after a move, for example when the operator steps up onto a curb from the road. This allows the camera to be more isolated and independent of the operator's moves. The operator can of course deliberately move the camera up or down, if desired. In reality however camera operators find it preferable for the arm to not be perfectly iso-elastic so that the camera will naturally rise to a comfortable operating height. Though the springs will be tensioned so this only happens very slowly and without bouncing up and down so as to maintain the smoothness of the camera's motion."&lt;ref name="Adustable, iso-elastic support apparatus

{{Saivism}}
'''Kaula''', also known as '''Kula''', '''{{IPA|Kulamārga}}''' ("the Kula practice") and '''{{IPA|Kaulācāra}}''' ("the Kaula conduct"), is a religious tradition in [[Shaktism]] and [[tantra|tantric]] [[Shaivism]] characterised by distinctive rituals and symbolism connected with the worship of [[Shakti]]. It flourished in India primarily in the first millennium AD.

Kaula preserves some of the distinctive features of the [[Kāpālika]] tradition, from which it is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp.4-5, 11, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It is subdivided into four subcategories  of texts based on the goddesses Kuleśvarī, Kubjikā, [[Kālī]] and [[Tripura Sundari|Tripurasundarī]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 57-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Trika]] texts are closely related to the Kuleśvarī texts and can be considered as part of the Kulamārga.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 59-60, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later [[Hatha Yoga]], the Kaula visualization of Kuṇḍalini rising through a system of [[chakra]]s is overlaid onto the earlier [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]-oriented system.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[[James Mallinson (author)|Mallinson, James]] (2011). [https://www.academia.edu/1317005/Ha_ha_Yoga ''Hatha Yoga''] Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism Vol. 3 (pp. 770-781). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|770, 774}}

==''Kaula'' and ''Kula''==

The translation of the term ''Kula'' in English is considered difficult and has raised some problems for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The basic meaning is "family", "group" or "self-contained unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by Flood as referring to the retinues of minor goddesses depicted in the schools' literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically the term is said to represent a unifying connectedness, beneath the various objects, processes and living entities of this world, which may be identified with these goddesses as aspects of the supreme deity, in some regions the god Shiva, elsewhere a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Another meaning sometimes given to the term ''kaula'' is that of a "group of people" engaged together in the practice of spiritual discipline.

Kaula practices are based on [[tantra]], closely related to the siddha tradition and shaktism. Kaula sects are noted for their extreme exponents who recommend the flouting of taboos and social mores as a means of liberation. Such practices were often later toned down to appeal to ordinary householders, as in [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Kaśmiri Śaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts==
The concepts of purity, sacrifice, freedom, the spiritual master (''guru'') and ''the heart'' are core concepts of the Kaula tradition.

===Purity and impurity===
{{quote|In this sacrifice, the wise man should use the very ingredient which is forbidden in the series of scriptures. It is immersed in the nectar-of-the-left. ([[Tantrāloka]])&lt;ref&gt;Tantrāloka, Chapter 29, śl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Actions or objects are not seen impure in themselves, rather the attitude is the determinant factor. Spiritual ignorance is the only impurity and knowledge is pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; As long as one is identified with the supreme consciousness, there is nothing impure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The adept is unaffected by any external impurity&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and makes use of what is reprehensible to attain transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Here arises the antinomian and asocial character of Kaula and the left-handed forms of Tantra.

===Sacrifice===
{{main article|Sacrifice}}
''Kaula'' sacrifice (''[[yajna]]'') is defined primarily as an inward act. Any action performed with the purpose of evoking the supreme reality is said to be sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; However, if sacrifice were performed only interiorly, there would be a lack of externality and therefore limitation and dualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; That is why ''Kaula'' adepts also perform symbolic external sacrifices making use of a sacred place and various rituals.

There are six main types of sacrifice according to the "six supports"; external reality, the couple, the body, the central channel of the subtle breath ([[susumna]]), the mind and ''Shakti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom===
''Kaula'' stresses the language of self-sufficiency, liberation and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Socially the ''Kaula'' may be viewed as an alternative society, complete in itself, which supports the freedom of the devotee from interior mental and egotistic limitations and from exterior social and cultural preconceptions.

At a social level deconditioning is realized by detaching from traditional restrictions with regard to what is considered pure and impure and through the adoption of the spiritual family of the guru. At the mental level freedom is attained by the awakening of ''Kundalini'' through ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', ''[[mudra]]'' or ''[[mantras]]'', the amplification and sublimation of the vital and mental energy and the elevation of consciousness. The culmination of this process is spiritual illumination.

Absolute freedom is to be found only in the revelation of the unity of the spirit with God, a state described as ''Atma-vyapti'' or re-absorption into the true Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') or ''Shiva-vyapti'': re-absorption into the supreme consciousness of ''Shiva''.&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, the Energy of the Depths, Lilian Silburn&lt;/ref&gt; To be free is to be absolved from the necessity of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] conditioned by [[Karma|karmic]] restraints. Consciousness expands into the so-called [[The 36 tattvas#Śuddha tattvas|pure reality]], a level that is considered to exist beyond time and space, where the powers of knowledge and action are unfettered, there are no conditioning desires or needs to be fulfilled and bliss is directly present in consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lakshmanjoo|1988}}, p. 3, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaula's'' basic method is the experience of the freedom of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; in the heart, ultimately reflected in the center of the being as ''Kechari Mudra''. This mudra (attitude) means "the ability of consciousness to freely move (''charati'') about in the space (''kha'') of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Khe carati iti kechar[ii], {{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The disciple learns to recognize Śiva as the ultimate reality. The practices pertaining to consciousness are explained in such texts as ''Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra'', ''Spanda Kārikās'' and ''Śiva Sūtras''.

Kashmiri Shaivism describes freedom as ''svātantrya'' - the freedom to create, maintain and destroy the universe pertaining to Śiva himself. It is considered that Śiva, above any restriction or conditioning, creates the universe of his free will as a playful expression of his spirit ([[lila (Hinduism)|lila]]). Here the kaulas are unlike [[Advaita]] and [[Veda]], where there is the conception that [[maya (illusion)|maya]] (cosmic illusion) is superimposed upon the [[brahman]] (absolute), inducing a sort of illusory creation. Here, creation is considered real, and the will to create is considered free and unfettered. ''Svatantrya'' is identical to [[Ananda]] (bliss) and ''vimarśa'' (reflexive consciousness/auto-consciousness).

===Guru===
{{main article|Guru}}
"Guru is the path" (''{{IAST|gurur upāyaḥ}}'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta|Śiva Sutras]] of Vasugupta, Cap II, Verse 5&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from the most revered sacred text of Kashmir Shaivism, the ''Śiva Sutras'', summarizes the school's conception of the guru-disciple relationship. ''Kaula'' functions as a form of [[guru yoga]], where the disciple's only essential practice is to surrender himself to his guru, accepting the spiritual impulse bestowed upon him by his master. Disciples eminently open towards their guru's spiritual influence are named ''spiritual sons'' and held to know the highest state of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; by their direct link to their guru's illuminated heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The guru is considered to form a single Self (atman) with his disciples. As such, he leads the disciples to the discovery of their own ''Atman'' with his own consciousness, exalted into the supreme state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Like fire kindled from a candle to another candle, the revelation of the self is passed from master to disciple directly, not through words or exterior practices, but mediated by the direct transfer of ''śakti''.&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Heart===
[[Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)|Aham]], the heart or "subjective I", is a central concept in ''Kaula'' ideology, conceived of as the most sacred reality, home of consciousness (''Cit'') and bliss (''Ananda''), place of union of the cosmic couple Shiva and [[Shakti]]. The term ''Aham'' refers to the same reality as other terms like ''anuttara'' (unsurpassed), ''Akula'' (beyond the group), ''Shiva'' (The Lord), ''Cit'' (supreme consciousness) as well as "feminine" aspects as Ananda and ''Shakti''. Each term brings a specific viewpoint, but none of them can fully describe the Supreme Reality.

On the individual level, the heart is the binding force of all conscious experiences&amp;nbsp;– the individual being is considered a ''Kula'' composed of eight elements: five senses, ego (''ahamkar''), the mind and the intellect. These eight are not disconnected, unrelated processes but rather a unified, interrelated family ("kaula") based on consciousness as the common substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaula'' prescribes practices that reintegrate the eight "rays" of the soul into the supreme consciousness.

On the cosmic level, the "Heart of the Lord" (''aham'') is the substrate of the family of [[The 36 tattvas|36 elements]] forming all manifestation. The concept of "Spiritual Heart" is so important that even the supreme realization in Kashmir Shaivism is described in relation to it. The so-called ''Kechari Mudra'' is an attitude described as "the ability of consciousness to freely move (''charati'') about in the space (''kha'') of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Khe carati iti kechar[ii], {{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; ("kha"+"charati" forming "kechari")

==Practices==
Similarly to other [[tantra|tantric]] schools, ''Kaula'' chooses a positive (affirmative) approach: instead of prescribing self-limitations and condemning various actions, it embraces such actions in a spiritual light.&lt;ref&gt;Touched By Fire, The Ongoing Journey Of A Spiritual Seeker, Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Ph.D., Rajmani Tigunait, page 188&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sexuality, love, social life and artistic pursuits are considered vectors of spiritual evolution. The main focus in ''Kaula'' is on practical methods for attaining [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; rather than engaging in complex philosophical debate. Whatever is pleasant and positive can be integrated in its practice.

The principal means employed in the ''Kaula'' practice are the spiritual family, the practice of initiation rituals, the couple (sexual rituals such as [[maithuna]]), the body (spiritual alchemy inside one's own body), the energy (shakti) (controlled especially through the use of mantras and mystical phonemes) and the consciousness (seen as the epitome of one's whole being and of the universe itself).&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, Energy of the depths, p177-178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p.s 58, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of development is linked to the attainment of a state of [[non-duality]] described as an "absorption into the spiritual heart", ''[[nirvikalpa samadhi]]'' or experiencing the "[[Prakasa|uncreated light]]" of consciousness (''prakāśa'')&lt;ref&gt;The Cultural Heritage of India, {{IAST|Haridāsa Bhaṭṭācāryya}}, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Page 521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tantra: The Supreme Understanding: Discourses on the Tantric Way of Tilopa's, Osho, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; (read [[Prakasa#Subjective experiences of prakāśa|a number of subjective accounts]] of this experience).

===Group practice===
Group practices, which are restricted to the members of a ''kaula'' (family),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; include rituals, festivities, initiations and the secretive tantric sexual union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The purposes of this practice are the initiation of novices, the expansion of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and expression of the bliss already attained as participants become more and more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to the effectiveness of group practice is held to reside in the harmony of minds and hearts of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra: Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, translation by Raniero Gnoli&lt;/ref&gt; When a compatible spiritual group is created, it can greatly accelerate the spiritual evolution of its members. [[Abhinavagupta]] declares that such a group can enter a state of oneness and universal consciousness without effort.&lt;ref&gt;Tantraloka by Abhinavagupta Cap28.v373–v380&lt;/ref&gt; He explains this by the notion of reflection (''pratibimba''), a process of unification, an effortless overflow of spiritual energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between a ''Kaula's'' parts is realized through mutual reflection. Reflection (''pratibimba'') is used here in the sense of "containing an image of the other objects inside", a concept similar to that of the hologram. The number of possible interactions and reflections between the members of a ''Kaula'' is much larger than the number of elements it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lakshmanjoo|1988}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmir Shaivism declares that each part is in fact ''Akula'' (Shiva) in essence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; thus there is a connection between the parts through their common ''Akula'' substrate. As each part contains ''Akula'', in its essence, it automatically contains everything,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; this is how the mutual reflection is said to be realized.

Almost half of the Tantraloka is dedicated to rituals, usually evoking the union of complementary sets such as man and woman, a faculty and its object or inhalation and exhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of ritual may involve the construction of a [[mandala]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; visualization of a goddess or group of goddesses (''Śakti''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; recitation ([[japa]]), performed in a state of "rest inside the creative awareness" (''camatkāra''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; oblation into fire and its internalized version&amp;nbsp;– the burning of the objects and means of knowledge into the "fire" of non-dual consciousness (''parāmarśa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of a ritual lies in its repetition. A pure disciple will attain the supreme state even by simply staying for a short time in presence of a guru without any instruction, but less prepared ones need reinforcement and gradual accumulation.

===Physical practices===
''Kaula'' puts a special emphasis on the physical body in spiritual practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; "as a vessel of the Supreme" and, as such, not an obstacle tortured in ascetic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated submergence into the state of non-duality is supposed to induce secondary effects on the physical body due to the activity of the spiritual energy (''śakti'') and may be called [[Alchemy in history#Indian alchemy|tantric body alchemy]] (see [[internal alchemy]]). Starting from the expanded consciousness of the self (''atman''), the body (and in the end, the exterior reality too) is infused with the experience of non-duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-dual, experienced initially only in consciousness, is extended to the whole body. The ''kaula'' adept will discover ''kaulika''&amp;nbsp;– the power (''[[siddhi]]'') of identification with the Universal Consciousness experienced in the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; generated spontaneously, without any effort (formal meditation, postures&amp;nbsp;– ''asana'', concentration ''[[Dharana]]'' and other forms of exertion in yoga).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; This process is described as the descent of the energy of the non-dual consciousness into the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Then consciousness manifests as a free force, entering the senses and producing extroverted ''[[samādhi]]''. At this point, consciousness, mind, senses and physical body are "dissolved" into oneness, expanded into the spiritual light of consciousness.

As a consequence, any perception of the exterior reality becomes nondual. It becomes possible to live submerged in a continuous state of union with Shiva even while performing regular day-to-day activities. This form of extroverted, all inclusive ''samādhi'' is the pinnacle of spiritual evolution, ''bhairavi mudra'', ''jagadananda'' or ''bhava samadhi''. The yogi experiences everything as pure light and ecstasy (''cit-ananda'') and does not feel any difference between interior and exterior any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yamala – the tantric couple====
Abhinavagupta: "The couple (''yamala'') is consciousness itself, the unifying emission and the stable abode. It is the absolute, the noble cosmic bliss consisting of both Shiva and Shakti. It is the supreme secret of ''Kula''; neither quiescent nor emergent, it is the flowing font of both quiescence and emergence." (Tantraloka)&lt;ref&gt;Tantraloka by Abhinavagupta Cap. 29 Verse. 116-117a&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual practices of the ''Kaula'' schools, also known as "the secret ritual", are performed with a so-called "external Shakti" (sexual partner)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the purely meditative practices which involve only one's own spiritual energies (the "interior Shakti"). The role of the sexual ''Kaula'' ritual is to unite the couple, [[yogini]] (initiated woman) and siddha (initiated man), and induce one in the other a state of permanent awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, energy of the depths, Lilian Silburn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement is made possible by the intensity of their love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In their exalted state, the two become absorbed into the consciousness of the Self. Becoming united on all the levels, physical, astral, mental and even in their consciousness, they reconstitute the supreme couple of Shiva and Shakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kaula'' sacrifice is reserved for the few, the elite who can maintain a state of ''Bhairava'' (spiritual illumination) in sexual union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Other couples, even if they reproduce the ritual to the letter (as perceived from outside), if they do not attain ''Bhairava'' consciousness, are merely engaging in a sexual act.

"Initiation by the mouth of the yogini (''yoginī-vaktra'')", is a method by which the adept unites with a purified ''yoginī'' and receives the unique experience of the illuminated consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; He is to see her as both his lover and guru.

The energy generated during the tantric sexual act is considered a form of "subtle emission", while the act of ejaculation is considered a form of physical emission.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sexual sublimation]], [[Ojas]] and [[Visarga]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Kashmir Shaivism, the energy of emission (''visarga śakti'') is considered to be a form of ''ānanda'' (bliss).

Depending on the orientation of one's consciousness, introverted or extroverted, emission can be of two kinds: rested and risen. In ''Śānta'', the rested form of emission, focus is absorbed just on one's own Self in an act of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Udita'', the risen form, the focus is projected on the Self (''atman'') of one's lover&amp;nbsp;– a state associated with immanence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

''Santodita'' (beyond ''udita'' and ''śānta'') is the uniting form, cause of both ''śānta'' and ''udita'' emissions. ''Santodita'' is described as universal bliss (''cidānanda''), undivided consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 261,263&lt;/ref&gt; ''kaula'' (the group of two as one)&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, energy of the depths, Lilian Silburn, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; and an "outflow of the pulsation of Shiva and Shakti".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of translation from the physical act to the mental and to consciousness itself is a characteristic of the tantric world view.

===Mantra practice===
Mantric meditation is the most common form of tantric practice. In the ''Kaula'' system, this practice is associated especially with the group of [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 phonemes (''varṇa'') of the [[Sanskrit]] alphabet are used as "seed" mantras denoting various aspects of consciousness (''cit'') and energy (''śakti''). The group (''kula'') of Sanskrit phonemes form a complete description of reality, from the lowest ("earth") to the highest (Śiva consciousness) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual "setting out" of the phonemes imitates the emanation of the cosmos from the supreme I-consciousness of Śiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In another ritual, the phonemes are identified with specific zones of the body through the practice of ''nyāsa'', infusing the body with spiritual energy. This mystical state of culminates in the ''kaula'' of the body (perfection of the ensemble of organs, senses and mind) and such a being is known as a siddha (accomplished one).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The adept attains a form of bodily enlightenment where, through the power of mantras, he comes to recognize the divinities within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiation into mantric practice is based on a transfer of power and the link (lineage) of the heart. The word or phoneme is not useful in itself, as it does not have efficiency unless the disciple received his initiation from an authentic master.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of the term==
While the manifest reality is described as ''Kula'' (a variant form of the term ''Kaula''), the unifying factor, the Deity, is termed ''Akula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; "A" means "beyond", or "non", thus "Akula" is "beyond kula". As the substrate of all manifestation is ''Akula'', such is also the basis of any ''Kula''. So ''Kula'' families are united by a common substrate, the transcendent ''Akula''.

In every one of its instances, on various levels of the universe, ''Kula'' is a contraction (''saṃkoca'') of totality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; thus in each ''Kula'' there is a contracted form of the universe, a contracted form of Shiva (''Akula'') himself. Such an affirmation has been popularized under slogans like "Consciousness is Everything" in some recent Kashmir Shaivism related publications for the public.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism, Consciousness is Everything, [[Swami Shankarananda (Shiva Yoga)|Swami Shankarananda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often at the highest level of reality Shiva and Shakti form the supreme couple, or the ultimate ''Kula'' (family).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pandit|2003}}, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva, under various names (''anuttara'' - absolute, ''prakāśa'' - uncreated light, ''cit'' - supreme consciousness, ''Akula'' - beyond the groups of manifestation) and ''Shakti'', under a similar plethora or names (''Vimarsa'' - reflection in consciousness, ''Visarga'' - creative energy that emits the Universe, ''Kundalini'' - fundamental energy of the body, ''spanda'' - atemporal vibration, ''Kauliki'' - that which is "sprung" in ''Kula''). The two are always in indissoluble union in a perfect state of bliss. Ultimately there is no difference between Shiva and Shakti, they are different aspects of the same reality. The supreme "family" by definition spans both manifestation and transcendence.

In Kashmir Shaivism, Supreme Consciousness (''Cit'', identical to ''Akula'') is considered to be the substrate of manifestation. Consciousness is the ultimate principle, the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]] of the universe, always present as substrate in every external object, be it gross (physical), subtle (mental) or subtlest (relating to the causal body or soul). Thus external world, body, mind and soul are considered kindred parts of the whole, concretisation of the supreme ''consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 5, 31&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, ''Kula'' is the totality of manifestation, in gross, subtle and supreme form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Even if ''Cit'' is not directly involved in the process of manifestation (as it is said to be unmanifest),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; it is always present in every possible facet of manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, it is said to be the substantial cause of manifestation (manifestation is made of ''Cit'', "like pots are made of clay") and also the efficient cause ("like the potter is the efficient cause in the activity of creating pots").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related concept is ''Kaulika'', the binding force of the ''Kula''. The term literally means "sprung in ''Kula''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaulika'' is another name for ''Shakti'', the spiritual energy. ''Shakti'', as described in Kashmir Shaivism, does a paradoxical thing&amp;nbsp;– she creates the universe, with all its diversity and at the same time remains identical to ''Shiva'', the absolute transcendent. Thus, ''Kaulika'' is an energy both of spirit and matter. Bridging the two, ''Kaulika'' creates the path of evolution for consciousness from ego to spirit.

The manifestation of ''Kaulika'' proceeds from the absolute (''anuttara'') in the process of cosmic creation (''mahasristi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''Kaulika'' should not be seen as mere energy, or just the link between matter and spirit, but also identical to the absolute. Even if she is the dynamic aspect of the absolute, she does not rank lower than Shiva, her divine consort.

==Texts==

'''Kashmiri School of Kaula'''

While Kaula is primarily an oral tradition and does not place a high value on the creation of texts, there are some texts associated with the tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33362">[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|300px|The [[temperature]] of an ideal [[monatomic]] [[gas]] is proportional to the average [[kinetic energy]] of its atoms. The [[Bohr radius|size]] of [[helium]] atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure. The atoms have a certain, average speed, slowed down here two [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] fold from room temperature.]]

The '''kinetic theory of gases''' describes a [[gas]] as a large number of submicroscopic [[particle]]s ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, rapid, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The randomness arises from the particles' many collisions with each other and with the walls of the container.

Kinetic theory of gases explains the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, [[thermal conductivity]], and volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion. The theory posits that gas pressure results from particles' collisions with the walls of a container at different velocities.

Kinetic molecular theory defines temperature in its own way, in contrast with the [[temperature|thermodynamic definition]].&lt;ref name="C &amp; C"/&gt;

Under an [[optical microscope]], the molecules making up a liquid are too small to be visible. However, the jittery motion of pollen grains or dust particles in liquid are visible. Known as [[Brownian motion]], the motion of the pollen or dust results from their collisions with the liquid's molecules.

==History==

In approximately 50 [[before common era|BCE]], the     Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J. C.|year=1867|title=On the Dynamical Theory of Gases|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=157|pages=49|doi=10.1098/rstl.1867.0004|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries, when [[Aristotle]]an ideas were dominant.

[[Image:HYDRODYNAMICA, Danielis Bernoulli.png|thumb|upright|Hydrodynamica front cover]]

In 1738 [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases.  In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the [[kinetic energy]] of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.&lt;ref name="PonomarevKurchatov1993"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quantum Dice|author1=L.I Ponomarev|author2=I.V Kurchatov|date=1 January 1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36–37}}

Other pioneers of the kinetic theory (which were neglected by their contemporaries) were [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1747),&lt;ref&gt;Lomonosov 1758&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (ca. 1780, published 1818),&lt;ref&gt;Le Sage 1780/1818&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Herapath]] (1816)&lt;ref&gt;Herapath 1816, 1821&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John James Waterston]] (1843),&lt;ref&gt;Waterston 1843&lt;/ref&gt; which connected their research with the development of [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]]. In 1856 [[August Krönig]] (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;Krönig 1856&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 [[Rudolf Clausius]], according to his own words independently of Krönig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Krönig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of [[mean free path]] of a particle.
&lt;ref&gt;Clausius 1857&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by [[Rudolf Clausius]], Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In 1871, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.

In the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)&lt;ref&gt;Smoluchowski 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
papers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.

==Assumptions==
The theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:

* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].
* These particles have the same [[mass]].
* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.

* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.
* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) 
:This implies:
::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.
::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].
::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.

* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.
* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.
* There are negligible gravitational force on molecules.

More modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.

An important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].&lt;ref name="C &amp; C"&gt;[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).&lt;/ref&gt; An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman–Enskog theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232–235.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.&lt;ref&gt;Grad 1949&lt;/ref&gt;
In the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].

==Equilibrium properties==
=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] --&gt;
In kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).

The particle impacts one specific side wall once every

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{2L}{v_x},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.

The [[force]] due to this particle is

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{m v_x^2}{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total force on the wall is

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Nm\overline{v_x^2}}{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.

Since the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v_x^2} = \overline{v_y^2} = \overline{v_z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} + \overline{v_y^2} + \overline{v_z^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2} = 3\overline{v_x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v_x^2} = \frac{\overline{v^2}}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

and the force can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3L}.&lt;/math&gt;

This force is exerted on an area ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{L^2} = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3V},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the volume of the box.

In terms of the kinetic energy of the gas ''K'':

:&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{2}{3} \times{K}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the  (translational) [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules &lt;math&gt;N\frac{1}{2} m\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[microscopic]] property.

===Temperature and kinetic energy===

Rewriting the above result for the pressure as &lt;math&gt;PV = {Nm\overline{v^2}\over 3} &lt;/math&gt;, 
we may combine it with the [[ideal gas law]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle PV = N k_B T ,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T&lt;/math&gt; the
[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]] defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;k_B T  =   {m\overline{v^2}\over 3} &lt;/math&gt;,

which leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,&lt;ref&gt;The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity - [http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Gases/Kinetic/Gases08.htm Kinetic Molecular Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle     \frac {1} {2} m\overline{v^2} =  \frac {3} {2}  k_B T&lt;/math&gt;.

The kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely &lt;math&gt; K= \frac {1} {2} N m \overline{v^2} &lt;/math&gt;.
Then the temperature &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T&lt;/math&gt; takes the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle    T   =   {m\overline{v^2}\over 3 k_B}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

which becomes

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle    T   =   \frac   {2}   {3}   \frac   {K}   {N k_B}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
Eq.({{EquationNote|3}})
is one important result of the kinetic
theory:
''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature''.
From Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and
Eq.({{EquationNote|3}}),
we have
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   PV 
   =
   \frac
   {2}
   {3}
   K.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
Thus, the product of pressure and
volume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average
(translational) molecular kinetic energy.

Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and Eq.({{EquationNote|4}})
are called the "classical results",
which could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]];
for more details, see:&lt;ref&gt;
[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 |date=2012-04-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 3N&lt;/math&gt;
[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in a monatomic-gas system with
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N&lt;/math&gt;
particles,
the kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \frac
   {K}
   {3 N}
   =
   \frac
   {k_B T}
   {2}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
In the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,
the constant of proportionality of temperature
is 1/2 times [[Boltzmann constant]] or R/2 per mole. In addition to this, the temperature will decrease when the pressure drops to a certain point.{{why?|date=June 2014}}
This result is related
to the [[equipartition theorem]].

As noted in the article on [[heat capacity]], diatomic
gases should have 7 degrees of freedom, but the lighter diatomic gases act
as if they have only 5. Monatomic gases have 3 degrees of freedom.

Thus the kinetic energy per kelvin (monatomic [[ideal gas]]) is 3 [R/2] = 3R/2:
* per mole: 12.47 J
* per molecule: 20.7 yJ = 129 μeV.

At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature]] (273.15 K), we get:
* per mole: 3406 J
* per molecule: 5.65 zJ = 35.2

===Collisions with container===
One can calculate the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time.

Assuming an ideal gas, a derivation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/collsurf/collsurf.html Collisions With a Surface&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; results in an equation for total number of collisions per unit time per area:

:&lt;math&gt;N^* = \frac{1}{4}\frac{N}{V} v_\text{avg} = \frac{n}{4} \sqrt{\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\pi m}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is also known as the "impingement rate" in vacuum physics.

===Speed of molecules===
From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{p} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \bar v = \frac {2}{\sqrt{\pi}} v_p = \sqrt{\frac {8}{\pi} \cdot \frac{k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} v_p = \sqrt{{3} \cdot \frac {k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is in m/s, ''T'' is in kelvins, and ''m'' is the mass of one molecule of gas. The most probable (or mode) speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is 81.6% of the rms speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{rms}&lt;/math&gt;, and the mean (arithmetic mean, or average) speed &lt;math&gt;\bar v&lt;/math&gt; is 92.1% of the rms speed ([[isotropy|isotropic]] [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution of speeds|distribution of speeds]]).

==Transport properties==

The kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means considering what are known as "transport properties", such a viscosity and thermal conductivity.

===Viscosity and kinetic momentum===
In books on elementary kinetic 
theory&lt;ref name="Sears1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=F.W.|last2=Salinger|first2=G.L.|year=1975|title=Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Thermodynamics|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.|location= Reading, Massachusetts, USA |edition=3|chapter=10|pages=286–291|isbn=978-0201068948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use. 
Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a [[Couette flow]] where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; which increase uniformly with distance &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions.

Let &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; be the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among gas particles|cross section]] of one molecule colliding with another. The number density &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume &lt;math&gt; C = N/V &lt;/math&gt;. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is &lt;math&gt; C \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|mean free path]] &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; by 

&lt;math&gt; \quad l = \frac {1} {\sqrt{2} C \sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume &lt;math&gt; C \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.

Let &lt;math&gt; u_{0} &lt;/math&gt; be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. On the average, a molecule that crosses the surface makes its last collision before crossing at a distance equal to two-thirds of the mean free path (i.e. &lt;math&gt; 2l/3 &lt;/math&gt;) away from the surface. At this distance above and below the surface, the forward momentum of the molecule is respectively

&lt;math&gt; \quad p_{x}^{\pm} = m \left( u_{0} \pm \frac {2}{3} l {d u \over dy} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where m is the molecular mass. The molecular flux  &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; includes all molecules arriving at one side of an element of the surface within the gas layer. The incoming molecules are coming from all directions at the one side of the surface and with all speeds. This molecular flux (i.e. the number flux) is related to the average molecular speed &lt;math&gt; \bar v &lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt; \quad \Phi = \frac {1}{4} \bar v C &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the forward velocity gradient &lt;math&gt;du/dy&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. Next we multiply by the total flux to get the change of momentum per unit time and per unit area, that is carried by the molecules crossing from either above or below the surface area. This gives the equation

&lt;math&gt; \quad \Phi p_{x}^{\pm} = \frac {1}{4} \bar v C \cdot m \left( u_{0} \pm \frac {2}{3} l {d u \over dy} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus

&lt;math&gt; \quad \tau = \Phi p_{x}^{+}  - \Phi p_{x}^{-} = \frac {1}{3} \bar v C m \cdot l {d u \over dy} &lt;/math&gt;

The defining equation for the (shear) viscosity &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; of the gas is

&lt;math&gt; \quad \frac {F} {A} = \eta {d u \over dy} &lt;/math&gt;

Combining the above kinetic equation with defining equation for (shear) viscosity by &lt;math&gt; \tau = F/A &lt;/math&gt; gives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted &lt;math&gt; \eta_{0} &lt;/math&gt; when it is a dilute gas:

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {1} {3} \bar v C m l &lt;/math&gt;

Combining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {1} {3 \sqrt{2} } \frac {m \cdot \bar v} {\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

From statistical thermodynamics for gases we have equations relating average molecular speed to most likely speed and further to temperature. These statistical results gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as

&lt;math&gt; \quad \bar v = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} v_{p} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \frac {k_{B}T}{m_{}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the most probable speed, &lt;math&gt; k_{B} &lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant. We note that

&lt;math&gt; \quad k_{B} \cdot N_{A} = R \quad \text{and} \quad M = m \cdot N_{A} &lt;/math&gt;

and insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for shear viscosity for dilute gases:

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {2} {3 \sqrt{\pi} } \cdot \frac {\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \sigma } 
= \frac {2} {3 \sqrt{\pi} } \cdot \frac {\sqrt{MRT}} { \sigma \cdot N_{A} } &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by

&lt;math&gt; \quad \sigma = \pi \left( 2 r \right)^2 = \pi d^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.

The '''law of continuity''' is a heuristic principle introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] based on earlier work by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. It is the principle that "whatever succeeds for the finite, also succeeds for the infinite".&lt;ref&gt;Karin Usadi Katz and [[Mikhail Katz|Mikhail G. Katz]] (2011) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tj7j2810n8223p43/ A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography]. [[Foundations of Science]]. {{doi|10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1}} See [https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0375 arxiv]&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler used The Law of Continuity to calculate the area of the circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon with infinitesimal sides, and adding the areas of infinitely-many triangles with infinitesimal bases. Leibniz used the principle to extend concepts such as arithmetic operations, from ordinary numbers to [[infinitesimal]]s, laying the groundwork for [[infinitesimal calculus]]. A mathematical implementation of the law of continuity is provided by the [[transfer principle]] in the context of the [[hyperreal number]]s.

A related law of continuity concerning [[intersection number]]s in geometry was promoted by [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] in his "Traité des propriétés projectives des figures". &lt;ref&gt;Poncelet, Jean Victor. [https://archive.org/details/traitdespropri01poncuoft Traité des propriétés projectives des figures]: T. 1. Ouvrage utile à ceux qui s' occupent des applications de la géométrie descriptive et d'opérations géométriques sur le terrain." (1865), pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, William. Introduction to intersection theory in algebraic geometry. No. 54. American Mathematical Soc., 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;


==Leibniz's formulation==
Leibniz expressed the law in the following terms in 1701:
:In any supposed continuous transition, ending in any terminus, it is permissible to institute a general reasoning, in which the final terminus may also be included (''Cum Prodiisset'').&lt;ref&gt;Child, J. M. (ed.): ''The early mathematical manuscripts of Leibniz''. Translated from the Latin texts published by Carl Immanuel Gerhardt with critical and historical notes by J. M. Child. Chicago-London: The Open Court Publishing Co., 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1702 letter to French mathematician [[Pierre Varignon]] subtitled “Justification of the Infinitesimal Calculus by that of Ordinary Algebra," Leibniz adequately summed up the true meaning of his law, stating that "the rules of the finite are found to succeed in the infinite."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm, and Leroy E. Loemker. Philosophical Papers and Letters. 2d ed. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1970, p. 544 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Law of Continuity became important to Leibniz's justification and conceptualization of the infinitesimal calculus.

As the positive [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes larger and larger, the value &lt;math&gt;n\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{n}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. We say that "the limit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;n\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{n}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;."
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''limit of a sequence''' is the value that the terms of a [[sequence]] "tend to".&lt;ref name="Courant (1961), p. 29"&gt;Courant (1961), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  If such a limit exists, the sequence is called '''convergent'''. A sequence which does not converge is said to be '''divergent'''.&lt;ref&gt;Courant (1961), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] ultimately rests.&lt;ref name="Courant (1961), p. 29"/&gt;

Limits can be defined in any [[metric space|metric]] or [[topological space]], but are usually first encountered in the [[real number]]s.

==History==
The Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] is famous for formulating [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes that involve limiting processes]].

[[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archimedes]] developed the [[method of exhaustion]], which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a [[geometric series]].

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] dealt with series in his works on ''Analysis with infinite series'' (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), ''Method of fluxions and infinite series'' (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and ''Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum'' (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his ''Optiks''). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''o'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which he then linearizes by ''taking limits'' (letting ''o''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0).

In the 18th century, [[mathematician]]s such as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] succeeded in summing some ''divergent'' series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in his ''Théorie des fonctions analytiques'' (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in his etude of [[hypergeometric series]] (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.

The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index ''N'' so that ...) was given by [[Bernhard Bolzano]] (''Der binomische Lehrsatz'', Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in the 1870s.

==Real numbers==
[[File:Converging Sequence example.svg|320px|thumb|The plot of a convergent sequence {''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is shown in blue. Visually we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit 0 as ''n'' increases.]]

In the [[real numbers]], a number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the '''limit''' of the [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; if the numbers in the sequence become closer and closer to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and not to any other number.

===Examples===
*If &lt;math&gt;x_n = c&lt;/math&gt; for constant ''c'', then &lt;math&gt;x_n \to c&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=proof&gt;''Proof'': choose &lt;math&gt;N = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|x_n - c| = 0 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac1{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=proof&gt;''Proof'': choose &lt;math&gt;N = \left\lfloor\frac1{\epsilon}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; + 1 (the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]]). For every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|x_n - 0| \le x_N = \frac1{\lfloor1/\epsilon\rfloor + 1} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;x_n = 1/n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, and &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac1{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd, then &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. (The fact that &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} &gt; x_n&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd is irrelevant.)
*Given any real number, one may easily construct a sequence that converges to that number by taking decimal approximations. For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, ...&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the [[decimal representation]] &lt;math&gt;0.3333...&lt;/math&gt; is the ''limit'' of the previous sequence, defined by
:&lt;math&gt; 0.3333...\triangleq\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{3}{10^i}&lt;/math&gt;.

*Finding the limit of a sequence is not always obvious. Two examples are &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac1{n}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt; (the limit of which is the [[e (mathematical constant)|number ''e'']]) and the [[Arithmetic–geometric mean]].   The [[squeeze theorem]] is often useful in such cases.

===Formal definition===
We call &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit''' of the [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; if the following condition holds:
:*For each [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every natural number &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, for every measure of closeness &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence's terms are eventually that close to the limit.  The sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''converge to''' or '''tend to''' the limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = x&lt;/math&gt;.

Symbolically, this is:
:* &lt;math&gt;\forall \varepsilon &gt; 0(\exists N \in \mathbb{N}(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}(n \geq N \implies |x_n - x| &lt; \varepsilon ))). &lt;/math&gt;

If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''; otherwise it is '''divergent'''.

=== Illustration ===
&lt;gallery widths="350" heights="200"&gt;
File:Folgenglieder im KOSY.svg|Example of a sequence which converges to the limit &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
File:Epsilonschlauch.svg|Regardless which &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; we have, there is an index &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, so that the sequence lies afterwards completely in the epsilon tube &lt;math&gt;(a-\varepsilon,a+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.
File:Epsilonschlauch klein.svg|There is also for a smaller &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; an index &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the sequence is afterwards inside the epsilon tube &lt;math&gt;(a-\varepsilon_1,a+\varepsilon_1)&lt;/math&gt;.
File:Epsilonschlauch2.svg|For each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there are only finitely many sequence members outside the epsilon tube.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Properties===
Limits of sequences behave well with respect to the usual [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|arithmetic operations]].  If &lt;math&gt;a_n \to a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n \to b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a_n+b_n \to a+b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_n\cdot b_n \to ab&lt;/math&gt; and, if neither ''b'' nor any &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt; is zero, &lt;math&gt;\frac{a_n}{b_n} \to \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any [[continuous function]] ''f'', if &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, any real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences (though this is not necessarily true when using more general notions of continuity).

Some other important properties of limits of real sequences include the following (provided, in each equation below, that the limits on the right exist).

*The limit of a sequence is unique.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n \pm b_n) =  \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \pm \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c a_n =  c \cdot \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n \cdot b_n) =  (\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n)\cdot( \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{a_n}{b_n}\right) = \frac{\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} a_n}{\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} b_n}&lt;/math&gt; provided &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n^p =  \left[ \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \right]^p&lt;/math&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;a_n \leq b_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; greater than some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \leq \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt;
*([[Squeeze theorem]]) If &lt;math&gt;a_n \leq c_n \leq b_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = L&lt;/math&gt;, {{pad|.5em}} then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n = L&lt;/math&gt;.
*If a sequence is [[#Bounded|bounded]] and [[#Increasing and decreasing|monotonic]] then it is convergent.
*A sequence is convergent if and only if every subsequence is convergent.

These properties are extensively used to prove limits without the need to directly use the cumbersome formal definition. Once proven that 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; it becomes easy to show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\frac{c}{n}} \to \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, (&lt;math&gt;b \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;), using the properties above.

===Infinite limits===

A sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''tend to infinity''', written &lt;math&gt;x_n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = \infty&lt;/math&gt;  if, for every ''K'', there is an ''N'' such that, for every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n &gt; K&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the sequence terms are eventually larger than any fixed ''K''.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;x_n \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt; if, for every ''K'', there is an ''N'' such that, for every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n &lt; K&lt;/math&gt;. If a sequence tends to infinity, or to minus infinity, then it is divergent  (however, a divergent sequence need not tend to plus or minus infinity: take for example &lt;math&gt;x_n=(-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;).

==Metric spaces==

===Definition===

A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''limit''' of the [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  This coincides with the definition given for real numbers when &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = |x-y|&lt;/math&gt;.

===Properties===

For any [[continuous function]] ''f'', if &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences.

Limits of sequences are unique when they exist, as distinct points are separated by some positive distance, so for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; less than half this distance, sequence terms cannot be within a distance &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of both points.

==Topological spaces==

===Definition===

A point ''x'' of the topological space (''X'', &amp;tau;) is a '''limit''' of the [[sequence]] (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') if, for every [[topological neighbourhood|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''x'', there is an ''N'' such that, for every &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n \in U&lt;/math&gt;.  This coincides with the definition given for metric spaces if (''X'',''d'') is a metric space and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the topology generated by ''d''.

A limit of a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;\left(x_n:n\in \mathbb{N}\right)\;&lt;/math&gt; in a topological space ''T'' is a special case of a [[Limit of a function#Functions on topological spaces|limit of a function]]: the domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace +\infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; with the [[induced topology]] of the [[affinely extended real number system]], the range is ''T'', and the function argument ''n'' tends to +∞, which in this space is a [[limit point]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Properties===

If ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space]] then limits of sequences are unique where they exist. Note that this need not be the case in general; in particular, if two points ''x'' and ''y'' are [[topologically indistinguishable]], any sequence that converges to ''x'' must converge to ''y'' and vice versa.

==Cauchy sequences==
{{main|Cauchy sequence}}

[[File:Cauchy sequence illustration.svg|350px|thumb| The plot of a Cauchy sequence (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), shown in blue, as ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' versus ''n''. Visually, we see that the sequence appears to be converging to a limit point as the terms in the sequence become closer together as ''n'' increases. In the [[real numbers]] every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.]]

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms ultimately become arbitrarily close together, after sufficiently many initial terms have been discarded. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [[metric spaces]], and, in particular, in [[real analysis]]. One particularly important result in real analysis is the ''Cauchy criterion for convergence of sequences'': A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. This remains true in other [[complete metric space|complete metric spaces]].

==Definition in hyperreal numbers==
The definition of the limit using the [[hyperreal numbers]] formalizes the intuition that for a "very large" value of the index, the corresponding term is "very close" to the limit.  More precisely, a real sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; tends to ''L'' if for every infinite [[hypernatural]] ''H'', the term ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; is infinitely close to ''L'', i.e., the difference  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''L'' is [[infinitesimal]].  Equivalently, ''L'' is the [[Standard part function|standard part]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = {\rm st}(x_H).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the limit can be defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n= {\rm st}(x_H),&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit exists if and only if the righthand side is independent of the choice of an infinite ''H''.

==Origin of the term==
The expression "love bombing" was coined by members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/mdtaskforce/loomis_testimony.htm| title=1999 Testimony of Ronald N. Loomis to the Maryland Cult Task Force| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818214228/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/mdtaskforce/loomis_testimony.htm| archivedate=2004-08-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also used by members of the [[Family International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/688317.stm| title=Eyewitness: Why people join cults | work=BBC News | date=March 24, 2000 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.exfamily.org/art/exmem/debdavis/debdavis07.shtml| title=The Children of God: The Inside Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1978 [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder and then leader of the Unification Church, said:
:Unification Church members are smiling all of the time, even at four in the morning. The man who is full of love must live that way. When you go out witnessing you can caress the wall and say that it can expect you to witness well and be smiling when you return. What face could better represent love than a smiling face? This is why we talk about love bomb; Moonies have that kind of happy problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unification.net/1978/780723.html| title=Sun Myung Moon (1978) "We Who Have Been Called To Do God's Work" Speech in London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology]] professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/ggalant/ [[California State University]] profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020617171034/http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/ggalant/ |date=2002-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geri-Ann Galanti writes: 
:A basic human need is for self-esteem.... Basically [love bombing] consists of giving someone a lot of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Langone|Langone, Michael]], ''[[Recovery from Cults]]'', 1995, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], {{ISBN|0-393-31321-2}}, Chapter 3 - Reflections on "Brainwashing", Geri-Ann Galanti&lt;/ref&gt;

==Margaret Singer==
Psychology professor [[Margaret Singer]] popularized the concept.&lt;ref name = Richardson2004&gt;
{{cite book|title=Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe|first=James T.|last=Richardson|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-47887-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306478870&amp;id=BhscdzDrCfQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA479&amp;lpg=RA1-PA479&amp;ots=6UklwjTgL4&amp;sig=3rVP7IlUYiV5ka-m8neGZmRmdfA p. 479]&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1996 book, ''[[Cults in Our Midst]],'' she writes:
:As soon as any interest is shown by the recruits, they may be ''love bombed'' by the recruiter or other cult members. This process of feigning friendship and interest in the recruit was originally associated with one of the early youth cults, but soon it was taken up by a number of groups as part of their program for luring people in. Love bombing is a coordinated effort, usually under the direction of leadership, that involves long-term members' flooding recruits and newer members with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark. Love bombing - or the offer of instant companionship - is a deceptive ploy accounting for many successful recruitment drives.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Margaret (1996; 2003) ''Cults in Our Midst.'' Revised edition, 2003. Wiley. {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abusive relationships==
The expression has also been used to describe the tactics used by [[pimps]] and [[Gang|gang members]] to [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims,&lt;ref&gt;''Gangs and Girls: Understanding Juvenile Prostitution'', Michel Dorais, Patrice Corriveau, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Jan 1, 2009, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to describe the behavior of an abusive [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]] who tries to win the confidence of a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ Red Flag of a Narcissist #1: Love Bombing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823040834/http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ |date=2015-08-23 }}; [https://www.firstwivesworld.com/index.php/my-narcissistic-ex-husband/item/8959-what-is-love-bombing?

One of the signs of love bombing in the start of a relationship is much attention in short time, and pressure for very rapid commitment.&lt;ref name = “Businessinsider”&gt;Lindsay Dodgson, [http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-love-bombing-2017-7 what is love bombing?], [[Business Insider]], July 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often the first sign of narcissism, and if successful turns to control and degradation.&lt;ref name =  “wong”&gt;Brittany Wong, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/sorry-youre-in-love-with-a-narcissist-_n_6956408.html Nine signs you are in love with a narcisist], [[Huffington Post]], March 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychologist [[Dale Archer]] identifies "The Phases of Love Bombing:  [[Idealization and devaluation|Idealization, Devaluation]], Discard (Repeat)."  He advises: "Stop, Look, and Listen" to avoid love bombing and to break off contact with the abuser, if possible, and seek support from family and friends.&lt;ref name = “archer”/&gt;

==Benign occurrences==
Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse.  Archer explains: 
:The key to understanding how love bombing differs from romantic courtship is to look at what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it’s probably not love bombing. That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.&lt;ref name = “archer”&gt;[[Dale Archer]], [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201703/the-manipulative-partners-most-devious-tactic The manipulative partner’s most devious tactic], [[Psychology Today]], March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, “dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/love-bombing-kids-to-get-happy-results/story-fn6b3v4f-1226009612216 Love bombing kids to get happy results], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/over-to-you-kid/story-e6frg8h6-1226585874865# 'Love bombing' reminds parents how much fun it is to be with kids], ''[[The Australian]]'', March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for ''[[The Daily Express]]'' tried the technique with her son and reported:
:It’s not rocket science that showering a child with affection will impact positively on their behaviour but what surprised me was how much my behaviour changed. Love bombing enabled me to see my child through a fresh lens, my disposition towards him softened and he seemed to bask in the glow of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/255817/It-took-one-day-to-change-my-son-s-bad-behaviour It took one day to change my son’s bad behaviour], ''[[The Daily Express]]'', June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[general relativity]], the '''magnetogravitic tensor''' is one of the three pieces appearing in the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].

The magnetogravitic [[tensor]] can be interpreted physically as a specifying possible [[spin-spin force]]s on spinning bits of matter, such as spinning [[test particle]]s.

The '''Mahavakyas''' (''sing.:'' mahāvākyam, महावाक्यम्; ''plural:'' mahāvākyāni, महावाक्यानि) are "The Great Sayings" of the [[Upanishads]], as characterized by the [[Advaita]] school of [[Vedanta]].

Most commonly, ''Mahavakyas'' are considered four in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1441|title=Meditation on Mahavakyas|website=www.sivanandaonline.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swamij.com/mahavakyas.htm|title=Mahavakyas: Great Contemplations of Advaita Vedanta|website=www.swamij.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Prajnanam Brahma (प्रज्ञानम् ब्रह्म)''  
# [[Aham Brahmasmi|''Aham Brahma Asmi'']] ''(अहम् ब्रह्म अस्मि)''
# ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]'' ''(तत् त्वम् असि)''
# ''Ayam Atma Brahma (अयम् आत्मा ब्रह्म)''

==The four principal Mahavakyas==
Though there are many Mahavakyas, four of them, one from each of the four [[Vedas]], are often mentioned as "the Mahavakyas".{{sfn|Saraswati|1995|p=4}} According to the Vedanta-tradition, the subject matter and the essence of all Upanishads is the same, and all the Upanishadic Mahavakyas express this one universal message in the form of terse and concise statements.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In later Sanskrit usage, the term ''mahāvākya'' came to mean "discourse", and specifically, discourse on a philosophically lofty topic.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.lisindia.net/Sanskrit/Sanskrit_struct.html Sanskrit Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition the four  Upanishadic statements indicate the ultimate [[unio mystica|unity]] of the individual ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) with Supreme ([[Brahman]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The Mahavakyas are:
#'''prajñānam brahma''' - "Prajñāna{{refn|group=note|"Consciousness",{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=234}}&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu"&gt;[http://www.jiddu-krishnamurti.net/en/1969/1969-07-26-jiddu-krishnamurti-can-one-experience-the-infinite Jiddu Krishnamurti, ''Saanen 2nd Conversation with Swami Venkatesananda 26th July 1969'']&lt;/ref&gt; "intelligence",{{sfn|Sivaraman|1973|p=146}}{{sfn|Braue|1984|p=80}} "wisdom"&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy" /&gt;}} is Brahman"{{refn|group=note|"The Absolute",{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=234}}&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt; "infinite",&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt; "the Highest truth"&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt;}}, or "Brahman is [[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajñāna]]"&lt;ref group=web name="Encyclopedy"&gt;[http://hinduism.enacademic.com/479/mahavakyas Encyclopedy of Hinduism, ''Mahavakyas'']&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 of the [[Rig Veda]])
#'''ayam ātmā brahma''' - "This Self (Atman) is Brahman" ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 1.2 of the [[Atharva Veda]])
#'''[[Tat Tvam Asi|tat tvam asi]]''' - "Thou art That" ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] 6.8.7 of the [[Sama Veda]])
#'''[[Aham Brahman Asmi|aham brahmāsmi]]''' - "I am Brahman", or "I am Divine"{{sfn|Baue|1984|p=80}} ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 1.4.10 of the [[Yajur Veda]])

People who are initiated into [[sannyasa]] in [[Advaita Vedanta]] are being taught the four [principal] mahavakyas as four mantras, "to attain this highest of states in which the individual self dissolves inseparably in [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part5/chap30.htm kamakoti.org, ''The Upanisads'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Mahavakyas===
* '''brahma satyam jagan mithyā'''  -  Brahman is real; the world is illusory   -   [[Vivekachudamani]]
* '''ekam evadvitiyam brahma'''    -   Brahman is one, without a second       -   [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]]
* '''[[Soham (Sanskrit)|so 'ham]]'''                     -   He am I                                -   [[Isha Upanishad]]
* '''sarvam khalvidam brahma'''    -   All of this is brahman                 -   [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]] 3.14.1

Several translations, and word-orders of these translations, are possible:

'''Prajñānam''':
* ''jñā'' can be translated as "consciousness", "knowledge", or "understanding."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "j&amp;ntilde;a," p. 425 (retrieved 14 Aug. 2012 from "Cologne U." at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prajñānam'' as a whole means:

Related terms are ''[[jnana|jñāna]]'', ''prajñā'' and ''prajñam'', "pure consciousness".{{sfn|Raṅganāthānanda|1991|p=109}} Although the common translation of ''jñānam''{{sfn|Raṅganāthānanda|1991|p=109}} is "consciousness", the term has a broader meaning of "knowing"; "becoming acquainted with",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam"&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+jnanam&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary, ''jnanam'']&lt;/ref&gt; "knowledge about anything",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt; "awareness",&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt; "higher knowledge".&lt;ref group=web name="SDjnanam" /&gt;

* "Infinite"&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt;
* "The Highest truth"&lt;ref group=web name="Jiddu" /&gt;

Sahu explains:
{{quote|''Prajnanam iti Brahman'' - wisdom is the soul/spirit. ''Prajnanam'' refers to the intuitive truth which can be verified/tested by reason. It is a higher function of the intellect that ascertains the ''Sat'' or Truth in the ''Sat-Chit-Ananda'' or truth-consciousness-bliss, i.e. the ''Brahman/Atman/Self''/person [...] A truly wise person [...] is known as ''Prajna'' - who has attained ''Brahman''hood itself; thus, testifying to the ''Vedic'' ''Maha Vakya'' (great saying or words of wisdom): ''Prajnanam iti Brahman''.{{sfn|Sahu|2004|p=41}}}}

And according to David Loy, 
{{quote|The knowledge of Brahman [...] is not intuition ''of'' Brahman but itself ''is'' Brahman.{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=62}}}}

'''Manorialism''' was an essential element of [[feudalism|feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;"Feudal Society", in its modern sense was coined in [[Marc Bloch]]'s 1939–40 books of the same name. Bloch (''Feudal Society'' tr. L.A. Masnyon, 1965, vol. II p. 442) emphasised the distinction between economic manorialism which preceded feudalism and survived it, and political and social feudalism, or ''seigneurialism''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the [[Roman villa]] system of the [[Late Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sarris, "The Origins of the Manorial Economy: New Insights from Late Antiquity", ''The English Historical Review'' '''119''' (April 2004:279–311).&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely practiced in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] western and parts of central Europe as well as China. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based [[market economy]] and new forms of [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] contract.

Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a [[Lord of the Manor]], supported economically from his own direct landholding in a [[manor]] (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the [[peasant]] population under the jurisdiction of himself and his [[manorial court]]. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor (the French term ''[[corvée]]'' is conventionally applied), in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin.

In examining the origins of the monastic [[cloister]], [[Walter Horn]] found that "as a manorial entity the [[Carolingian]] [[monastery]]&amp;nbsp;... differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate, save that the corporate community of men for whose sustenance this organization was maintained consisted of monks who served God in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing."&lt;ref&gt;Horn, "On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister" ''Gesta'' ''' 12'''.1/2 (1973:13–52), quote p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manorialism died slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the [[open field system]]. It outlasted [[serfdom]] as it outlasted feudalism: "primarily an economic organization, it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a [[capitalist]] landlord. It could be self-sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment" ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''32'''.4 (December 1972:938–944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, "The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''31''' (December 1971:777–803).&lt;/ref&gt; The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the [[French Revolution]]. In parts of eastern Germany, the ''Rittergut'' manors of [[Junker]]s remained until [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwin Spenkuch, "Herrenhaus und Rittergut: Die Erste Kammer des Landtags und der preußische  Adel von 1854 bis 1918 aus sozialgeschichtlicher Sicht" ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft'', '''25'''.3 (July&amp;nbsp;– September 1999):375–403).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Quebec, the last feudal rents were paid in 1970 under the modified provisions of the ''[[Seigneurial system of New France#Abolition|Seigniorial Dues Abolition Act]]'' of 1935.

==Historical and geographical distribution==
[[Image:The Hall at Penshurst Place from Ancestral Homes of Noted Americans by Anne Hollingsworth Wharton (1915).jpg|thumb|300px|The great hall at [[Penshurst Place]], [[Kent]], built in the mid 14th century. The hall was of central importance to every [[manor]], being the place where the lord and his family ate, received guests, and conferred with dependents.]]
The term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later [[Roman Empire]] ([[Dominate]]). With a declining birthrate and population, labor was the key [[factor of production]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Herreld, (2016) An Economic History of the World Since 1400. The Great Courses. P. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade, councilors were forbidden to resign, and ''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'', the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Whittaker, "Circe's pigs: from slavery to serfdom in the later Roman world", ''Slavery and Abolition'' '''8''' (1987:87–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such ''coloni'': it was possible to be described as ''servus et colonus'', "both slave and ''colonus''".&lt;ref&gt;Averil Cameron, ''The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity AD 395–600'', 1993:86.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws of [[Constantine I]] around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the ''coloni'' and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' promulgated under [[Theodosius II]] extended these restrictions. The legal status of ''adscripti'', "bound to the soil",&lt;ref&gt;Cameron 1993:86 instances ''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' XI. 48.21.1; 50,2.3; 52.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasted with barbarian ''foederati'', who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law.

As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations.

The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was disrupted. The thesis put forward by [[Henri Pirenne]] supposes that the [[Arab]] conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==History==
The word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as '''[[manor]]s''' or '''seigneuries'''; each manor being subject to a [[Lord of the manor|lord]] (French ''seigneur''), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see [[Feudalism]]). The lord held a [[manorial court]], governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations.

By extension, the word ''manor'' is sometimes used in England to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559330/Terror-raids-on-homes-of-uranium-ex-employee.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Terror raids on homes of uranium ex-employee | first=Stewart | last=Payne | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonslang.com/db/m/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208090911/http://www.londonslang.com/db/m/ |archivedate=2009-02-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In the generic plan of a medieval manor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd_1911/shepherd-c-104.jpg|title=Plan of Medieval Manor by William R.

In this plan, the [[manor house]] is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at [[Petworth House]]. As concerns for privacy{{dubious|date=March 2014}} increased in the 18th century,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} [[manor house]]s were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of [[Harlaxton Manor]], Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land ''"[[allodial]]ly"'' in full outright ownership. The other was a use of ''precaria'' or [[benefice]]s, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word "precarious").

To these two systems, the [[Carolingian]] monarchs added a third, the ''aprisio'', which linked manorialism with [[feudalism]]. The ''aprisio'' made its first appearance in [[Charlemagne]]'s province of [[Septimania]] in the south of [[France]], when Charlemagne had to settle the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his [[Zaragoza]] expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting "desert" tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal ''[[fisc]]'' under direct control of the emperor. These holdings ''aprisio'' entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific ''aprisio'' grant that has been identified was at [[Fontjoncouse]], near [[Narbonne]] (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of [[villa]]s, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world.

==Common features==
[[Image:Plan mediaeval manor.jpg|thumb|300px|Generic map of a medieval manor.&lt;br&gt;The mustard-colored areas are part of the '''[[demesne]]''', the [[hatching|hatched]] areas part of the '''[[glebe]]'''.&lt;br /&gt;William R. Shepherd, ''Historical Atlas'', 1923]]
Manors each consisted of up to three classes of land:
#'''[[Demesne]]''', the part directly controlled by the lord and used for the benefit of his household and dependents;
#'''Dependent''' ('''[[serf]]''' or '''[[villein]]''') holdings carrying the obligation that the peasant household supply the lord with specified labour services or a part of its output (or cash in lieu thereof), subject to the custom attached to the holding; and
#'''Free peasant land''', without such obligation but otherwise subject to manorial jurisdiction and custom, and owing money rent fixed at the time of the lease.

Additional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill, bakery or wine-press, or for the right to hunt or to [[Grazing rights#Pigs|let pigs feed]] in his woodland, as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses, perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein [[Land tenure|tenure]].{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}

Dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant, but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord's permission, and the customary payment.

Although not free, villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law subject to court charges, which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century.

This description of a manor house at [[Chingford]], Essex in England was recorded in a document for the Chapter of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] when it was granted to Robert Le Moyne in 1265:
:He received also a sufficient and handsome hall well ceiled with oak. On the western side is a worthy bed, on the ground, a stone chimney, a wardrobe and a certain other small chamber; at the eastern end is a pantry and a buttery. Between the hall and the chapel is a sideroom. There is a decent chapel covered with tiles, a portable altar, and a small cross. In the hall are four tables on trestles. There are likewise a good kitchen covered with tiles, with a furnace and ovens, one large, the other small, for cakes, two tables, and alongside the kitchen a small house for baking. Also a new granary covered with oak shingles, and a building in which the dairy is contained, though it is divided. Likewise a chamber suited for clergymen and a necessary chamber. Also a hen-house. These are within the inner gate. Likewise outside of that gate are an old house for the servants, a good table, long and divided, and to the east of the principal building, beyond the smaller stable, a solar for the use of the servants. Also a building in which is contained a bed, also two barns, one for wheat and one for oats. These buildings are enclosed with a moat, a wall, and a hedge. Also beyond the middle gate is a good barn, and a stable of cows, and another for oxen, these old and ruinous. Also beyond the outer gate is a pigstye.&lt;ref&gt;From J.H. Robinson, trans., ''University of Pennsylvania Translations and Reprints'' (1897) in ''Middle Ages, Volume I'': pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation among manors==
Like [[feudalism]] which, together with manorialism, formed the legal and organizational framework of feudal society, manorial structures were not uniform or coordinated. In the later Middle Ages, areas of incomplete or non-existent manorialization persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development with changing economic conditions.

Not all manors contained all three classes of land.  Typically, [[demesne]] accounted for roughly a third of the arable area, and [[villein]] holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. The proportion of unfree and free tenures could likewise vary greatly, with more or less reliance on wage labour for agricultural work on the demesne.

The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors, while the share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord of the latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors.

Manors varied similarly in their geographical arrangement: most did not coincide with a single village, but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages, most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor. This situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments or their equivalents in kind of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living furthest from the lord's estate.

As with peasant plots, the demesne was not a single territorial unit, but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings, plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and villein ones: in addition, the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce.

Nor were manors held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service (or again, cash in lieu) to their superior: a substantial share (estimated by value at 17% in [[Domesday Book|England in 1086]]) belonged directly to the king, and a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by [[Diocese|bishoprics]] and [[monastery|monasteries]]. [[Ecclesiastical]] manors tended to be larger, with a significantly greater villein area than neighbouring lay manors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions tended to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry in particular being less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some upland areas of Europe showed some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.

Similarly, the spread of [[money]] [[economy]] stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">A '''marginal value''' is
#a [[Value (mathematics)|value]] that holds true given particular constraints,
#the ''change'' in a value associated with a specific change in some [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]], whether it be of that variable or of a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]], or
#[when underlying values are quantified] the ''[[ratio]]'' of the change of a dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
(This third case is actually a special case of the second).

In the case of [[Differentiability#Continuity and differentiability|differentiability]], at the limit, a marginal change is a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|mathematical differential]], or the corresponding [[Derivative (calculus)|mathematical derivative]].

These uses of the term “marginal” are especially common in [[economics]], and result from conceptualizing constraints as ''borders'' or as ''margins''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910),] Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorts of marginal values most common to economic analysis are those associated with ''unit'' changes of resources and, in [[mainstream economics]], those associated with ''infinitesimal'' changes.  Marginal values associated with units are considered because many decisions are made by unit, and [[marginalism]] explains ''unit price'' in terms of such marginal values.  Mainstream economics uses infinitesimal values in much of its analysis for reasons of mathematical tractability.

== Quantified conception ==

Assume a functional relationship
:&lt;math&gt;y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discrete change ===
If the value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is ''discretely'' changed from &lt;math&gt;x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_{i,1}&lt;/math&gt; while other independent variables remain unchanged, then the marginal value of the change in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i =x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt;
and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)}{x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
If an individual saw her income increase from $50000 to $55000 per annum, and part of her response was to increase yearly purchases of [[amontillado]] from 2 casks to three casks, then
*the marginal increase in her income was $5000
*the marginal effect on her purchase of amontillado was an increase of 1 cask, or of 1 cask per $5000.

=== Infinitesimal margins ===
If ''infinitesimal'' values are considered, then a marginal value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would typically refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}=\frac{\partial f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

(For a linear functional relationship &lt;math&gt;y = a + b\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will simply be the co-efficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (in this case, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) and this will not change as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes. However, in the case where the functional relationship is non-linear, say &lt;math&gt;y = a\cdot b^x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will be different for different values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Example ====
Assume that, in some economy, aggregate consumption is well-approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;C=C\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Measures of national income and output|aggregate income]].
Then the ''[[marginal propensity to consume]]'' is
:&lt;math&gt;MPC=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''one-electron universe''' postulate, proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in a telephone call to [[Richard Feynman]] in the spring of 1940, hypothesises that all [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. According to Feynman:

{{cquote|I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"&lt;ref name=Feynman1965&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html | title= Nobel Lecture |date= 11 December 1965 | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|author=Richard Feynman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
The idea is based on the [[world line]]s traced out across [[spacetime]] by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment.

At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the [[antiparticle]] to the electron, the positron.

Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;

Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech:

{{cquote|I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from [Wheeler] as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole!&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;}}

Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper "The Theory of Positrons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=6 |date=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749–759|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |date=1950|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N |doi=10.1143/PTP.5.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[esoteric cosmology]], a '''plane''' is conceived as a subtle state, level, or region of reality, each plane corresponding to some type, kind, or category of [[being]].

The concept may be found in [[religious]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] teachings—''e.g.'' [[Vedanta]] ([[Advaita Vedanta]]), [[Ayyavazhi]], [[shamanism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Sant Mat]]/[[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Druze]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rosicrucianism]] ([[Esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]]), [[Eckankar]], [[Ascended Master Teachings]], etc.—which propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical [[planet]] in which we live, the [[planetary system|solar systems]], and all the physical structures of the universe. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated through a series of steadily denser stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

The [[emanationism|emanation]] is conceived, according to esoteric teachings, to have originated, at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, in ''[[Great Architect of the Universe|The Supreme Being]]'' who sent out—from the unmanifested ''[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]'' beyond comprehension—the dynamic force of creative energy, as ''sound-vibration'' ("the Word"), into the abyss of space. Alternatively, it states that this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.

==Origins of the concept==
The concept of planes of existence might be seen as deriving from shamanic and traditional mythological ideas of a vertical world-axis&amp;mdash;for example a cosmic [[mountain]], [[tree]], or pole (such as [[Yggdrasil]] or [[Mount Meru]])&amp;mdash;or a philosophical conception of a [[Great Chain of Being]], arranged metaphorically from [[God]] down to inanimate matter.

However the original source of the word ''plane'' in this context is the late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[Proclus]], who refers to ''to platos'', "breadth", which was the equivalent of the 19th-century theosophical use. An example is the phrase ''en to psychiko platei''.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, cited in Poortman, 1978, vol II, p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions in ancient traditions==
Directly equivalent concepts in Indian thought are [[loka]]s and bhuvanas. In [[Hindu]] cosmology, there are many lokas or worlds, that are identified with both traditional cosmology and states of [[meditation]].

Planes of existence may have been referred to by the use of the term corresponding to the word "egg" in English. For example, the Sanskrit term [[Brahmanda]] translates to "The entire creation" as opposed to the lazy inference "The Egg of Creation". Certain Puranic accounts posit that the Brahmanda is the superset of a set of fractal smaller Eggs, as is seen in the assertion of the equivalence of the Brahmanda and the [[Pinda (riceball)|Pinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, Subhash: ''The Architecture of Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Norse mythology gave the name "[[Ginnungagap]]" to the primordial "Chaos," which was bounded upon the northern side by the cold and foggy "[[Niflheim]]"—the land of mist and fog—and upon the south side by the fire "[[Muspelheim]]." When heat and cold entered into space which was occupied by Chaos or Ginnungagap, they caused the crystallization of the visible universe.

In the medieval West and Middle East, one finds reference to four worlds (''olam'') in [[Kabbalah]], or five in [[Sufism]] (where they are also called ''[[tanazzulat]]''; "descents"), and also in [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]]. In Kabbalah, each of the four or five worlds are themselves divided into ten [[Sephirah|sefirot]], or else divided in other ways.

==Esoteric conceptions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles Leadbeater Planes.jpg|thumb|300px|right| The planes according to [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]].]] --&gt;
The [[alchemy|alchemists]] of the [[Middle Ages]] proposed ideas about the constitution of the universe through a [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] language full of esoteric words, phrases, and signs designed to cloak their meaning from those not initiated into the ways of alchemy. In his "Physica" (1633), the Rosicrucian alchemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], wrote: "Ad huc spiritum incognitum Gas voco" q.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas." Further on in the same work he says, "This vapor which I have called Gas is not far removed from the [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] the ancients spoke of." Later on, similar ideas would evolve around the idea of aether.

In the late 19th century, the metaphysical term "planes" was popularised by the theosophy of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], who in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and other writings propounded a complex cosmology consisting of seven planes and subplanes, based on a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas. From theosophy the term made its way to later esoteric systems such as that of [[Alice Bailey]], who was very influential in shaping the worldview of the [[New Age]] movement. The term is also found in some Eastern teachings that have some Western influence, such as the cosmology of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and some of the later [[Sant Mat]], and also in some descriptions of Buddhist cosmology. The teachings of [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] also include several planes of the creation within both the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], including the Bramanda egg contained within the Sach Khand egg. [[Max Theon]] used the word "States" (French ''Etat'') rather than "Planes", in his [[cosmic philosophy]], but the meaning is the same.

The planes in Theosophy were further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]].

In the early 20th century, [[Max Heindel]] presented in ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' a cosmology related to the scheme of evolution in general and the evolution of the [[solar system]] and the [[Earth]] in particular, according to the Rosicrucians. He establishes, through the conceptions presented, a bridge between modern [[science]] (currently starting research into the subtler [[Etheric plane|''etheric'']] plane of existence behind the physical) and [[religion]], in order that this last one may be able to address man's ''[[spirituality|inner]]'' questions raised by scientific advancement.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] proposed that there are six planes of consciousness that must be experienced before one can attain [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]] on the seventh plane: "Each definite stage of advancement represents a state of consciousness, and advancement from one state of consciousness to another proceeds side by side with crossing the inner planes. Thus six intermediate planes and states of consciousness have to be experienced before reaching the seventh plane which is the end of the journey and where there is final realisation of the God-state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emanation vs. Big Bang==
{{further|Emanationism}}
Most cosmologists today believe that the [[universe]] expanded from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in [[esoteric cosmology]] expansion refers to the [[emanation]] or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit, what Greek philosophy called ''[[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]]'', until the lowest and most material world is reached.
	 
According to [[Rosicrucian]]s, another difference is that there is no such thing as empty or void space. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The space is Spirit in its attenuated form; while matter is crystallized space or Spirit. Spirit in manifestation is dual, that which we see as Form is the negative manifestation of Spirit--crystallized and inert. The positive pole of Spirit manifests as Life, galvanizing the negative Form into action, but both Life and Form originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos! On the other hand, Chaos is not a state which has existed in the past and has now entirely disappeared. It is all around us at the present moment. Were it not that old forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being resolved back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms, there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation would prevent the possibility of advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' (Chapter XI: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng11.htm The Genesis and Evolution of our Solar System]), 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The planes==
In occult teachings and as held by psychics and other esoteric authors there are seven planes of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetadnaactivation.com/medical2.html Seven Planes of Existence - Theta Medical Intuition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult and esoteric teachings are in agreement that seven planes of existence exist; however, many different occult and metaphysical schools label the planes of existence with different terminology.

===Physical plane===
The '''physical plane''' or '''physical universe''', in [[emanation]]ist metaphysics taught in [[Neoplatonism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], refers to the visible [[reality]] of [[space]] and [[time]], [[energy]] and [[matter]]: the physical universe in [[Occultism]] and [[esoteric cosmology]] is the lowest or [[density|densest]] of a series of planes of existence.

According to Theosophists, after the physical plane is the '''etheric plane''' and both of these planes are connected to make up the first plane.&lt;ref&gt;John Friedlander, Gloria Hemsher ''Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships'' 2011, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when the [[physical body]] dies the [[etheric body]] is left behind and the [[soul]] forms into an [[astral body]] on the astral plane.&lt;ref&gt;Norman C. McClelland ''Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma'' 2010, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[F. W. H. Myers]] proposed the existence of a “[[metetherial world]]”, which he wrote to be a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F. H. W. (1903). Human personality and its survival of death. London: Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astral plane===
[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The astral spheres were thought to be planes of angelic existence intermediate between Earth and [[heaven]]'']]
The '''[[astral plane]]''', also known as the '''emotional plane''' is where consciousness goes after physical death. According to [[occult]] philosophy man possesses an [[astral body]]. The astral plane (also known as the astral world) was postulated by classical (particularly [[neo-Platonic|neoplatonic]]), medieval, oriental, and [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies and [[mystery cult|mystery religions]].&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919"&gt;G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world of the [[celestial spheres|planetary spheres]], crossed by the soul in its [[astral body]] on the way to being born and [[afterlife|after death]], and generally said to be populated by [[angel]]s, spirits, or other immaterial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-[[Rosicrucianism]].

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], philosophers, [[Paracelsus|Paracelsians]], [[Rosicrucians]] and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between Earth and the divine. The ''[[Barzakh]]'', ''olam mithal'' or intermediate world in [[Islam]] and the "World of ''[[Yetzirah]]''" in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] are related concepts.

According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]], [[near death experience|near-death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theosophist]] author [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote: "When a person dies, they become fully conscious in the astral body. After a certain time, the astral body disintegrates, and the person then becomes conscious on the mental plane." &lt;ref&gt;First Principles of Theosophy, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Occultist [[George Arundale]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the astral world exist temporarily all those physical entities, men and animals, for whom sleep involves a separation of the physical body for a time from the higher bodies. While we "sleep", we live in our astral bodies, either fully conscious and active, or partly conscious and semi-dormant, as the case may be, according to our evolutionary growth; when we "wake", the physical and the higher bodies are interlocked again, and we cease to be inhabitants of the astral world.” &lt;ref&gt;Curuppumullagē Jinarājadāsa ''First Principles of Theosophy'' Theosophical Publishing House, 1922, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some writers have claimed the astral plane can be reached by [[dream]]ing. [[Sylvan Muldoon]] and psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] in their book ''The Projection of the Astral Body'' (1929) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you are dreaming you are not really in the same world as when you are conscious – in the physical – although the two worlds merge into one another. While dreaming, you really are in the astral plane, and usually your astral body is in the zone of quietude."&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan J. Muldoon and Hereward Carrington ''Projection of the Astral Body'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Astral projection]] author Robert Bruce describes the astral as seven planes that take the form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured "buffer zones".  These planes are endlessly repeating ruled [[Cartesian coordinate system]] grids, tiled with a single signature pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.

In his book ''[[wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi|Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', [[Paramhansa Yogananda]] provides details about the astral planes learned from his resurrected guru [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]].&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN6fdZR6rXkC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400|title=Autobiography of a Yogi (Google books)|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda reveals that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past [[karma (Hinduism)|karma]] through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of [[nirvikalpa|nirvikalpa samadhi]] in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the "illumined astral planet" of Hiranyaloka.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"/&gt; After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many incarnations allow them to further refine until [[Satcitananda|final unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/yogananda/chapter_43.htm|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental plane===
The '''mental plane''', also known as the '''causal plane''' is the third lowest plane according to Theosophy. The mental plane is divided into seven sub-planes.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mental world one formulates a thought and it is instantly transmitted to the mind of another without any expression in the form of words. Therefore on that plane language does not matter in the least; but helpers working in the astral world, who have not yet the power to use the mental vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater, The Inner Life, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] wrote that "The mental plane, as its name implies, is that which belongs to consciousness working as thought; not of the mind as it works through the brain, but as it works through its own world, unencumbered with physical spirit-matter.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant ''The Ancient Wisdom: An Outline of Theosophical Teachings'' 1939, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the mental plane, along with the mental body, is provided by [[Arthur E. Powell]], who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

According to [[Hindu]] occultism the mental plane consists of two divisions, the lower division is known as heaven (''swarglok'') and the upper division is known as the causal plane (''maharlok'').&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar, Jytte Larsen ''The Kundalini book of living and dying: gateways to a higher consciousness'' 2004, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] wrote:

:''"The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form--radiant bodies of centillions of quantum light particles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], ''Dancing With Siva : Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism'', 1996, xxxv, 1008 p., ill., Sixth Edition, First Printing, 2003 Himalayan Academy [http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;''

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and [[Max Théon]] ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Theon's student in occultism for two years).  In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk.1 ch.27)  The Aurobindonian Mind or Mental Plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of sheer mind or thought.

===Buddhic plane (also known as unity plane)===
The ''buddhic plane'' is described as a realm of pure [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophy the buddhic plane exists to develop buddhic consciousness which means to become unselfish and solve any problems with the ego.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''Inner Life'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Leadbeater]] wrote that in the buddhic plane man casts off the delusion of the self and enters a realization of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''The Masters and the Path'' 2007, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] defined the buddhic plane as

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness of the buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which is the outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the man shifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bailey ''The Rays and the Initiations'' 1971, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the level above the mental plane the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Madis Senner ''The Way Home: Making Heaven on Earth'' 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual plane===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[George Winslow Plummer]] wrote that the ''spiritual plane'' is split into many sub-planes and that on these planes live spiritual beings who are more advanced in development and status than ordinary man.&lt;ref&gt;George Winslow Plummer ''Mercury: An Official Organ of the Societas Rosicruciana in America 1916-1921'' Kessinger reprint edition, 1998, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] teachings the goal of the spiritual plane is to gain spiritual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Kranyak ''Metaphysical Secrets for Health and Success in Life'' 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine plane===
According to some occult teachings, all [[souls]] are born on the ''divine plane'' and then descend down through the lower planes; however souls will work their way back to the divine plane.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Poinsot ''Complete Book of the Occult and Fortune Telling'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of occult sciences'', R. M. McBride and company, 1939, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; On the divine plane souls can be opened to conscious communication with the sphere of the divine known as the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and receive knowledge about the nature of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamlin Dewey ''New Testament of Occultism'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosicrucianism]] teaches that the divine plane is where [[Jesus]] dwelt in [[Christ consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Digest September 1932, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logoic plane (also known as monadic plane)===
The ''logoic plane'' is the highest plane, it has been described as a plane of total oneness, the "I AM Presence". [[Joshua David Stone]] describes the plane as complete unity with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley Parker ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''monadic plane (hyperplane)'' or continuum/universe, enclosing and interpenetrating grosser hyperplanes, respectively is the plane in which the monad or holy spirit or oversoul is said to exist.

==31 planes==
{{main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In Buddhism, the world is made up of 31 planes of existence that one can be reborn into, separated into 3 realms.

==The Summerland==
{{main|The Summerland}}
The Summerland is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], [[Spiritualists]], [[Wicca]]ns, and some earth-based [[paganism (contemporary)|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of existence on a plane in an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativespirit.net/spiritworld/ The Spirit World Descriptions by Early Spiritualists by Barbara N. Starr]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'' to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or ''sphere'', of the afterlife we can hope to enter. The common portrayal of the Summerland is as a place of rest for souls after or between their earthly incarnations. Some believe [[spirits]] will stay in the Summerland for an eternal afterlife, though others believe after an amount of time some spirits will [[reincarnate]]. The Summerland is also envisioned as a place for recollection and reunion with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fst.org/sptwld1.htm Life in the Spirit World: Part One General Introduction By Rev. Simeon Stefanidakis]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, it is often imagined as a place of beauty and peace, where everything people hold close to their hearts is preserved in its fullest beauty for eternity. It is envisioned as containing wide (possibly eternal) fields  of rolling green hills and lush grass. In many ways, this ideology is similar to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] view of [[Annwn]] as an afterlife realm. The Summerland is also viewed as the place where one goes in the afterlife in traditions of [[Spiritualism]] and Theosophy, which is where Wicca got the term.

In Theosophy, the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Those who have been bad go to [[Hell]], which is believed to be located below the surface of the Earth and is on the astral plane and is composed of the densest astral matter; the Spiritual Hierarchy functioning within Earth functions on the etheric plane below the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that most people (those at high levels of initiation) go to a specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion. For example, [[Christians]] go to a Christian heaven, [[Jews]] go to a Jewish heaven, [[Muslims]] go to a Muslim heaven, [[Hindus]] goes to a Hindu heaven, Theosophists go to a Theosophical heaven, and so forth, each heaven being like that described in the [[scripture]]s of that religion. There is also a generic Summerland for those who were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]]s in their previous lives. People who belong to religions that don't believe in [[reincarnation]] are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within a few dozen to a few hundred years. Each heaven is believed to be an extensive structure composed of astral matter located on the astral plane about three or four miles (5–6&amp;nbsp;km) above the surface of Earth, above that part of the world where the particular religion that the heaven is meant for is most predominant.

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations—only those souls that are more highly developed [[spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation. Devachan is several miles (around 10&amp;nbsp;km) higher above the surface of Earth than Summerland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this Round is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm Various Levels of the Afterlife in Theosophy:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101232/http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to go to Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the fourth level of initiation or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

==Inhabitants of the various planes==
Occult writers such as [[Geoffrey Hodson]], Mellie Uyldert, and [[Dora van Gelder]] had attempted to classify different spiritual beings into a hierarchy based on their assumed place and function on the planes of existence.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] fundamentally described and incorporated his comprehension of intangible beings for Theosophy. Along with him there are various planes intertwined with the quotidian human world and are all inhabited by multitudes of entities. Each plane is purported as composed of discrete density of ''[[etheric plane|astral or ethereal matter]]'' and frequently the denizens of a plane have no discernment of other ones. Other Theosophical writers such as [[Alice Bailey]], a contemporary of Leadbeater, also gave continuousness to Theosophical concepts of ethereal beings and her works had a great impact over [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Laderman, Luis D. León; ''Religion and American cultures: an encyclopedia of traditions, diversity, and popular expressions'' - Volume 3, 2003; p. 236. {{ISBN|1-57607-238-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael York, ''The emerging network: a sociology of the New Age and neo-pagan movements'', 1995; p. 66. {{ISBN|0-8476-8001-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She puts the nature spirits and devas as ethereal beings immersed in macro divisions of an interwoven threefold universe, usually they belong to the etheric, astral, or mental planes. The ethereal entities of the four kingdoms, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, are forces of nature.

The Dutch writer [[Mellie Uyldert]], self-proclaimed clairvoyant, characterized the semblance and behavior of ethereal entities on the etheric plane, which, she said, hover above plants and transfer energy for vitalizing the plant, then nourishing themselves on rays of sunlight. She depicted them as asexual gender, and composed of [[etheric body|''etheric'' matter]].
They fly three meters over the ground, some have wings like butterflies while others only have a small face and an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] waving graciously. Some are huge while others may have the size of one inch.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Uyldert ''The psychic garden: Plants and their esoteric relationship with man'' Thorsons, 1980 {{ISBN|0-7225-0548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Les princesses combinées''''' ("the combined princesses") was a group of French aristocrats during the reign of [[Louis XVI of France]].
Some authors named two, three or four members of the [[clique|coterie]].
They were:
* [[Adelaïde-Felicité-Henriette d'Hénin]], [[princess of Hénin]] (1750-1820?)
* [[Anne Louise Marie de Beauvau]], [[princess of Poix]]
* the [[duchess of Lauzun]], later [[duchess of Biron]]
* the [[princess of Bouillon]]
* the [[countess of Simiane]]

They were close friends since childhood.
They followed [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]] and the [[Encyclopedistes]], supported each other and were discreet in their love affairs, contrasting with other ladies of the court.
Their social circle included the [[De Lameth]] brothers, the [[duke of Guines]] and [[Henriette-Lucy, Marquise de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet]].

Maintaining the status quo would involve intervening to prevent the firm from dumping toxic chemicals in the lake. Conversely, inertia would involve not intervening in the course of events that will change the lake.

In mathematics, the '''reach''' of a [[subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[real number]] that roughly describes how curved the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the set is.

== Definition ==
Let ''X'' be a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then reach of ''X'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;\text{reach}(X) := 
    \sup \{r \in \mathbb{R}: 
             \forall  x \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus X\text{ with }{\rm dist}(x,X) &lt; r \text{ exists a unique closest point }y \in X\text{ such that }{\rm dist}(x,y)= {\rm dist}(x,X)\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Shapes that have reach infinity include
* a single point,
* a straight line,
* a full square, and
* any [[convex set]].

The graph of ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''| has reach zero.

A circle of radius ''r'' has reach&amp;nbsp;''r''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16033">'''Safe mode''' is an operating mode of a modern [[spacecraft]] during which all non-essential systems are shut down and only essential functions such as [[Thermal management of spacecraft|thermal management]], radio reception and [[attitude control]] are active.&lt;ref name=primary&gt;{{cite journal

 |format  = PDF
}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triggering events==
Safe mode is entered automatically upon the detection of a predefined operating condition or event that may indicate loss of control or damage to the spacecraft. Usually the trigger event is a system failure or detection of operating conditions considered dangerously out of the normal range. [[Cosmic ray]]s penetrating spacecraft electrical systems can create false signals or commands and thus cause a trigger event. The [[Cosmic_ray#Effect_on_electronics|central processor electronics]] are especially prone to such events.&lt;ref name="planning"/&gt;
Another trigger is the lack of a received command within a given time window. Lack of received commands can be caused by hardware failures or mis-programming of the spacecraft, as in the case of the [[Viking 1]] lander.

==Entry==
The process of entering safe mode, sometimes referred to as ''safing'',&lt;ref name="cassini" /&gt; involves a number of immediate physical actions taken to prevent damage or complete loss. Power is removed from non-essential subsystems. Regaining attitude control, if lost, is the highest priority because it is necessary to maintain thermal balance and proper illumination of the solar panels.&lt;ref name=primary /&gt; A tumbling or cartwheeling spacecraft can quickly roast, freeze or exhaust its battery power and be lost forever.&lt;ref name=SOHO /&gt;

==In safe mode==
While in safe mode the preservation of the spacecraft is the highest priority. Typically all non-essential systems, such as science instruments, are shut down. The spacecraft attempts to maintain orientation with respect to the [[Sun]] for illumination of [[solar panels]] and for thermal management. The spacecraft then awaits radio commands from its [[Mission Control Center|mission control center]] monitoring for signals on its low-gain [[omnidirectional antenna]]. Exactly what happens while in safe mode is dependent on the spacecraft design and its mission.&lt;ref name="planning"&gt;{{cite journal

 |format  = PDF
}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery==
Recovery from safe mode involves reestablishing communication between the spacecraft and mission control, downloading any diagnostic data and sequencing power back on to the various subsystems to resume the mission. The recovery time can be anywhere from a few hours to days or weeks depending on the difficulty in reestablishing communications, conditions found on the spacecraft, distance to the spacecraft and the nature of the mission.&lt;ref name=NH20070327 /&gt;

==Suppression==
A spacecraft's ability to enter safe mode may be suppressed during crucial spacecraft operations (such as the [[orbit insertion]] maneuver of the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]] at [[Saturn]]), during which – if a critical failure were to occur – most, if not all, of the mission objectives would be lost anyway.&lt;ref name="cassini"&gt;[http://cassini-huygens.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/ops/anomsafe.shtml Cassini Spacecraft Safing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709171549/http://cassini-huygens.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/ops/anomsafe.shtml |date=2009-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manual entry==
On occasion, a spacecraft is placed in safe mode deliberately by mission control, as the [[Spirit rover]] was on [[Timekeeping on Mars|sol]] 451.&lt;ref name=spirit05 /&gt;

==Modern incidents==
;2005
* [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'' rover]] had several incidents with safe mode.&lt;ref name=spirit05&gt;{{ cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28267">In [[psychology]], '''schizotypy''' is a theoretical concept that posits a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[personality psychology|personality]] characteristics and experiences, ranging from normal dissociative, imaginative states to extreme states of mind related to [[psychosis]], especially [[schizophrenia]]. The continuum of personality proposed in schizotypy is in contrast to a categorical view of psychosis, wherein psychosis is considered a particular (usually pathological) state of mind, which the person either has or does not have.

==Development of the concept==

The categorical view of psychosis is most associated with [[Emil Kraepelin]], who created criteria for the [[medical diagnosis]] and classification of different forms of psychotic illness. Particularly, he made the distinction between [[dementia praecox]] (now called schizophrenia), [[manic depression|manic depressive insanity]] and non-psychotic states. Modern diagnostic systems used in [[psychiatry]] (such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) maintain this categorical view.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (1994).  ''DSM IV: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition''. Washington: APA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] did not believe there was a clear separation between [[sanity]] and [[Insanity|madness]], believing instead that psychosis was simply an extreme expression of thoughts and behaviours that could be present to varying degrees throughout the population.&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"&gt;Bleuler, E. (1911). ''Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias''. Translated by J. Zinkin. New York: International Universities Press, Inc. (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of psychosis as a spectrum was further developed by [[psychologist]]s such as [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Gordon Claridge]], who sought to understand unusual variations in thought and behaviour in terms of personality theory. Eysenck conceptualised cognitive and behavioral variations as all together forming a single personality trait, ''[[psychoticism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Eysenck, H.J. (1992). The Definition and Meaning of Psychoticism. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 13, 757-785.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claridge named his concept ''schizotypy,'' and through examination of unusual experiences in the general population and clustering of [[symptom]]s in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, the work of Claridge suggested that this personality trait was more complex than had been previously thought and could be broken down into four factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall, R.P., Claridge, G. and Slade, P.D. (1989).  The multi dimensional nature of schizotypal traits: a factor analytic study with normal subjects.  ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', 28, 363-375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClaridgeMcCreery"&gt;Claridge, G., McCreery, C., Mason, O., Bentall, R., Boyle, G., Slade, P., &amp; Popplewell, D. (1996). The factor structure of 'schizotypal' traits: A large replication study. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'',  '''35''', 103-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Unusual experiences'': The disposition to have unusual [[perception|perceptual]] and other cognitive experiences, such as [[hallucination]]s, magical or superstitious belief and interpretation of events (see also [[delusion]]s).
# ''Cognitive disorganization'': A tendency for thoughts to become derailed, disorganised or tangential (see also [[formal thought disorder]]).
# ''Introverted [[anhedonia]]'': A tendency to introverted, emotionally flat and asocial behaviour, associated with a deficiency in the ability to feel pleasure from social and physical stimulation.
# ''Impulsive nonconformity'': The disposition to unstable mood and behaviour particularly with regard to rules and social conventions.

==The relationship between schizotypy, mental health and mental illness==

Although aiming to reflect some of the features present in diagnosable mental illness, schizotypy does not necessarily imply that someone who is more schizotypal than someone else is more ill. For example, certain aspects of schizotypy may be beneficial. Both the ''unusual experiences'' and ''cognitive disorganisation'' aspects have been linked to [[creativity]] and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2006"&gt;Nettle, D. (2006). Schizotypy and mental health amongst poets, visual artist, and mathematicians. ''Journal of Research in Personality'', '''40''', 876-890. Also available online: [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/jrp.pdf Nettle, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (1997). Benign schizotypy? The case of religious experience. In G. Claridge, ed., ''Schizotypy, implications for illness and health''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Pp. 227-250&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the concept of ‘benign schizotypy’ in relation to certain classes of religious experience, which he suggested might be regarded as a form of problem-solving and therefore of adaptive value. The link between positive schizotypy and certain facets of creativity&lt;ref&gt;^ Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Claridge, G. (2005). More words, less words: Verbal fluency as a function of 'positive' and 'negative' schizotypy. ''Personality and Individual Differences,'' 39, 705-713&lt;/ref&gt;  is consistent with the notion of a "healthy schizotypy", which may account for the persistence of schizophrenia-related genes in the population despite their many dysfunctional aspects.

However, the exact nature of the relationship between schizotypy and diagnosable psychotic illness is still controversial. One of the key concerns that researchers have had is that questionnaire-based measures of schizotypy, when analysed using [[factor analysis]], do not suggest that schizotypy is a unified, homogeneous concept. The three main approaches have been labelled as 'quasi-dimensional', ‘dimensional’ and ‘fully dimensional’.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of these three variant models, see McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each approach is sometimes used to imply that schizotypy reflects a [[cognitive]] or [[biological process|biological]] vulnerability to psychosis, although this may remain dormant and never express itself, unless triggered by appropriate environmental events or conditions (such as certain doses of drugs or high levels of stress).

===Quasi-dimensional approach===

The quasi-dimensional model may be traced back to Bleuler&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"/&gt; (the inventor of the term ‘schizophrenia’), who commented on two types of continuity between normality and psychosis: that between the schizophrenic and his or her relatives, and that between the patient’s [[premorbid]] and post-morbid personalities (i.e. their personality before and after the onset of overt psychosis).

On the first score he commented: ‘If one observes the relatives of our patients, one often finds in them peculiarities which are qualitatively identical with those of the patients themselves, so that the disease appears to be only a quantitative increase of the anomalies seen in the parents and siblings.’&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911 p. 238"&gt;Bleuler, E. (1911). ''Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias''. Translated by J. Zinkin. New York: International Universities Press, Inc. (1950), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second point, Bleuler discusses in a number of places whether peculiarities displayed by the patient before admission to hospital should be regarded as premonitory ''symptoms'' of the disease or merely indications of a ''predisposition'' to develop it.

Despite these observations of continuity Bleuler himself remained an advocate of the disease model of schizophrenia.  To this end he invoked a concept of ''latent schizophrenia'', writing: ‘In [the latent] form, we can see ''in nuce'' [in a nutshell] all the symptoms and all the combinations of symptoms which are present in the manifest types of the disease.’&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911 p. 238"/&gt;

Later advocates of the quasi-dimensional view of schizotypy are [[Sandor Rado|Rado]]&lt;ref&gt;Rado, S. (1953).  Dynamics and classification of disordered behaviour. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', '''110''', 406 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and Meehl,&lt;ref&gt;Meehl, P.E. (1962). Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia.'' American Psychologist'', '''17''', 827 838.
&lt;/ref&gt; according to both of whom schizotypal symptoms merely represent less explicitly expressed manifestations of the underlying disease process which is schizophrenia.  Rado proposed the term ‘schizotype’ to describe the person whose genetic make-up gave him or her a lifelong predisposition to schizophrenia.

The quasi-dimensional model is so called because the only dimension it postulates is that of gradations of severity or explicitness in relation to the symptoms of a disease process: namely schizophrenia.

===Dimensional approach===

The dimensional approach, influenced by personality theory, argues that full blown psychotic illness is just the most extreme end of the schizotypy spectrum and there is a natural continuum between people with low and high levels of schizotypy. This model is most closely associated with the work of Hans Eysenck, who regarded the person exhibiting the full-blown manifestations of psychosis as simply someone occupying the extreme upper end of his ‘psychoticism’ dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H.J. (1960). Classification and the problems of diagnosis. In H.J. Eysenck, ed., ''Handbook of Abnormal Psychology''. London: Pitman. Pp.1-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the dimensional model comes from the fact that high-scorers on measures of schizotypy may meet, or partially fulfill, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder]]. Similarly, when analyzed, schizotypy traits often break down into similar groups as do symptoms from schizophrenia&lt;ref&gt;Liddle, P.F. (1987). The symptoms of chronic schizophrenia: A re-examination of the positive negative dichotomy. ''British Journal of Psychology'', 151, 145 151.&lt;/ref&gt; (although they are typically present in much less intense forms).

===Fully dimensional approach===

Claridge calls the latest version of his model ‘the fully dimensional approach’.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Claridge, G. and Beech, T. (1995). Fully and quasi-dimensional constructions of schizotypy. In Raine,  A.,  Lencz, T.,  and Mednick,  S.A., ''Schizotypal Personality''.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it might also be  characterised as the ''hybrid'' or ''composite'' approach, as it incorporates elements of both the disease model and the dimensional one.

On this latest Claridge model, schizotypy is regarded as a dimension of personality, normally distributed throughout the population, as in the Eysenck model. However, schizophrenia itself is regarded as a breakdown process, quite distinct from the continuously distributed trait of schizotypy, and forming a second, graded continuum, ranging from schizotypal personality disorder to full-blown schizophrenic psychosis.

The model is characterised as fully dimensional because, not only is the personality trait of schizotypy continuously graded, but the independent continuum of the breakdown processes is also graded rather than categorical.

The fully dimensional approach argues that full blown psychosis is not just high schizotypy, but must involve other factors that make it qualitatively different and pathological.

== Relationship to personality traits ==
Many research studies have examined the relationship between schizotypy and various standard models of personality, such as the [[Five factor model]]. &lt;ref name=hierarchic&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2009.07.018|title=The hierarchic structure in schizotypy and the five-factor model of personality|year=2011|last1=Asai|first1=Tomohisa|last2=Sugimori|first2=Eriko|last3=Bando|first3=Naoko|last4=Tanno|first4=Yoshihiko|journal=Psychiatry Research|volume=185|pages=78–83|pmid=20537405|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has linked the unusual experiences factor to high [[neuroticism]] and [[openness to experience]]. The introvertive anhedonia factor has been linked to high neuroticism and low [[extraversion]]. The cognitive disorganisation factor has been linked to low [[conscientiousness]]. It has been argued that these findings provide evidence for a fully dimensional model of schizotypy and that there is a continuum between normal personality and schizotypy.&lt;ref name=hierarchic/&gt; 

Relationships between schizotypy and the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]] have also been examined.&lt;ref name=laidlaw&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.025|title=Low self-directedness (TCI), mood, schizotypy and hypnotic susceptibility|year=2005|last1=Laidlaw|first1=Tannis M.|last2=Dwivedi|first2=Prabudha|last3=Naito|first3=Akira|last4=Gruzelier|first4=John H.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=2|pages=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-transcendence]], a trait associated with openness to "spiritual" ideas and experiences, has moderate positive associations with schizotypy, particularly with unusual experiences.

==Possible biological bases of schizotypy==

===Anhedonia===
[[Anhedonia]], or a reduced ability to experience pleasure, is a feature of full-blown schizophrenia that was commented on by both Kraepelin&lt;ref&gt;Kraepelin, E. (1913). ''Dementia Praecox and Paraphrenia''. Translated by R.M. Barclay. Edinburgh: Livingston, (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; and Bleuler.&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"/&gt;  However, they regarded it as just one among a number of features that tended to characterise the ‘deterioration’, as they saw it, of the schizophrenic’s emotional life.  In other words, it was an effect, rather than a cause, of the disease process.

[[Sandor Rado|Rado]]&lt;ref&gt;Rado, S. (1953).  Dynamics and classification of disordered behaviour. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 110, 406 416.&lt;/ref&gt; reversed this way of thinking, and ascribed anhedonia a causal role. He considered that the crucial neural deficit in the schizotype was an ‘integrative pleasure deficiency’, i.e. an innate deficiency in the ability to experience pleasure.  Meehl&lt;ref&gt;Meehl, P.E. (1962). Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia. ''American Psychologist,'' 17, 827 838.&lt;/ref&gt; took on this view, and attempted to relate this deficiency to abnormality in the [[dopamine]] system in the brain, which is implicated in the human [[reward system]].

Questionnaire research on schizotypy in normal subjects is ambiguous with regard to the causal role, if any, of anhedonia.  Nettle&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2006"/&gt; and McCreery and Claridge&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; found that high schizotypes as measured by factor 1 ([[Schizotypy#Development of the concept|above]]) scored lower than controls on the introverted anhedonia factor, as if they were particularly enjoying life.

Various writers, including Kelley and Coursey&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M.P. and Coursey, R.D. (1992).  Factor structure of schizotypy scales.  ''Personality and Invividual Differences'', 13, 723-731.&lt;/ref&gt; and L.J. and J.P. Chapman&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P., Kwapil, T.R, Eckblad, M., &amp; Zinser, M.C. (1994). Putatively psychosis-prone subjects 10 years later. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 103, 171 183.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that anhedonia, if present as a pre-existent trait in a person, may act as a potentiating factor, whereas a high capacity for hedonic enjoyment might act as a protecting one.

===Weakness of inhibitory mechanisms===

====Negative priming====

A number of studies have found that high schizotypes, as measured by questionnaire, show less [[negative priming]] than controls.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Beech, A.R. and Claridge, G.S. (1987).  Individual differences in negative priming: Relations with schizotypal personality traits.  ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', 78, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative priming is said to occur when a person reacts more slowly than usual to a stimulus which has previously been presented as a distractor and which has therefore had to be ignored. Beech interprets the relative weakness of the negative priming effect in schizotypes as a sign that ‘inhibition of distracting information is reduced in schizophrenia and high schizotypes’.&lt;ref&gt;Beech, A.R. (1987).  ''Cognitive Differences and Schizophrenia''.  Unpublished DPhil thesis, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduced negative priming shown by high schizotypes has the interesting effect that they actually perform better on certain tasks (those that require them to respond to previously ignored stimuli) than low schizotypes.  This phenomenon may be of significance in the relation to the question of why schizotypy, and indeed schizophrenia itself, is not progressively ‘weeded out’ by the process of [[natural selection]].

====SAWCI====

The phenomenon of [[semantic]] activation without conscious identification (SAWCI) is said to be displayed when a person shows a priming effect from the processing of consciously undetectable words. For example, a person who has just been shown the word ‘giraffe’, but at a speed at which he or she was not able consciously to report what it was, may nevertheless identify more quickly than usual another animal word on the next trial. Evans&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J.L. (1992). ''Schizotypy and Preconscious Processing''.  Unpublished D.Phil. thesis, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; found that high schizotypes showed a greater priming effect than controls in such a situation.  She argued that this could be accounted for by a relative weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in the semantic networks of high schizotypes.

====Attention, working memory, and executive functions====

Schizotypy symptoms have been related to deficits in [[executive functions]], which entails the psychological processes that supersede habitual inclinations with novel responses and behaviors to fulfill important goals. In particular, when schizotypy is elevated, the ability to filter out task-irrelevant stimuli may be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Shrira, A. &amp; Tsakanikos, E. (2009). Latent inhibition as a function of schizotypal symptoms: evidence for a bi-directional model. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 47, 922-927.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, participants who score highly on schizotypy  tend to fail to  ignore a previously preexposed, non-reinforced stimulus as compared to a non-preexposed, novel and potentially important event.

Enhanced performance on [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] has been associated with high levels of positive schizotypy, i.e. increased reports of hallucination-like experiences, delusional ideation, and perceptual aberrations. However, decreased performance was associated with negative schizotypy{{clarify|date=June 2018}}, such as anhedonia&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Claridge, G. (2005). Less words, more words: psychometric schizotypy and verbal fluency. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39, 705-713.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
Many studies have also shown that individuals who exhibit schizotypy features demonstrate deficits in [[Attention]] and [[Working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;^ Beech, A.R. and Claridge, G.S. (1987). Individual differences in negative priming: Relations with schizotypal personality traits. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 78, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2004). Logical reasoning in schizotypal personality. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 37, 1717-1726.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E., &amp; Reed, P. (2003). Visuo-spatial processing and dimensions of schizotypy: figure-ground segregation as a function of psychotic-like features. Personality and Individual Differences, 35, 703-712.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Reed, P. (2005). Dimensional approaches to experimental psychopathology: shift learning and schizotypic traits in college students. ''Journal of Behavior Therapy &amp; Experimental Psychiatry'', 36, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abnormalities of arousal===

Claridge&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. (1967). ''Personality and Arousal''. Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that one consequence of a weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in high schizotypes and schizophrenics might be a relative failure of [[homeostasis]] in the central nervous system.  This, it was proposed, could lead, both to [[lability]] of [[arousal]], and to dissociation of arousal in different parts of the nervous system.

====Dissociation of different arousal systems====

Claridge and co-workers&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. and Clark, K.H. (1982). Covariation between two flash threshold and skin conductance level in first breakdown schizophrenics: Relationships in drug free patients and effects of treatment. ''Psychiatry Research'', 6, 371 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. and Birchall, P.M.A. (1978). Bishop, Eysenck, Block and psychoticism. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 87, 664 668.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S., Robinson, D.L. and Birchall, P.M.A. (1985). Psychophysiological evidence of `psychoticism' in schizophrenics' relatives. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 6, 1 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have found various types of abnormal co-variation between different [[psychophysiological]] variables in schizotypes, including between measures of cortical and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] arousal.

McCreery and Claridge&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C., and Claridge, G. (1996). ‘A study of hallucination in normal subjects – II. Electrophysiological data’. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 21, 749-758.&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of a relative activation of the right [[cerebral hemisphere]] as compared with the left in high schizotypes attempting to induce a hallucinatory episode in the laboratory. This suggested a relative [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociation]] of arousal between the two hemispheres in such people as compared with controls.

====Hyperarousal====

A failure of homeostasis in the central nervous system could lead to episodes of hyper-arousal. Oswald&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, I. (1962). ''Sleeping and Waking: Physiology and Psychology.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that extreme stress and hyper-arousal can lead to sleep as a provoked reaction.  McCreery&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (1997). Hallucinations and arousability: pointers to a theory of psychosis. In Claridge, G. (ed.): ''Schizotypy, Implications for Illness and Health''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2008). Dreams and psychosis: a new look at an old hypothesis. ''Psychological Paper No. 2008-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Also available online: [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/dreams-and-psychosis.pdf McCreery 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that this could account for the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] similarities between Stage 1 sleep and psychosis, which include hallucinations, delusions, and flattened or inappropriate affect (emotions). On this model, high schizotypes and schizophrenics are people who are liable to what Oswald calls ‘micro-sleeps’, or intrusions of Stage 1 [[sleep]] phenomena into waking consciousness, on account of their tendency to high arousal.

In support of this view McCreery points to the high correlation that has been found to exist&lt;ref name="ClaridgeMcCreery" /&gt; between scores on the Chapmans’ Perceptual Aberration scale,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P. and Raulin, M.L. (1978). Body image aberration in schizophrenia. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'',''' 87''', 399 407.&lt;/ref&gt; which measures proneness to perceptual anomalies such as hallucinations, and the Chapmans’ Hypomania scale,&lt;ref&gt;Eckblad, M. and Chapman, L.J. (1986). Development and validation of a scale for hypomanic personality. ''Journal of Abnormal Personality'', '''95''', 217 233.&lt;/ref&gt; which measures a tendency to episodes of heightened arousal. This correlation is found despite the fact that there is no overlap of item content between the two scales.

In the clinical field there is also the paradoxical finding of Stevens and Darbyshire,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, J.M. and Darbyshire, A.J. (1958).  Shifts along the alert-repose continuum during remission of catatonic `stupor' with amobarbitol.  ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 20, 99-107.&lt;/ref&gt; that schizophrenic patients exhibiting the symptom of [[catatonia]] can be aroused from their apparent stupor by the administration of sedative rather than stimulant drugs.  They wrote: ‘The psychic state in catatonic schizophrenia can be described as one of great excitement (i.e., hyperalertness)[…] The inhibition of activity apparently does not alter the inner seething excitement.'

It is argued that such a view would be consistent with the model that suggests schizophrenics and high schizotypes are people with a tendency to hyper-arousal.

====Aberrant salience hypothesis====

Kapur (2003) proposed that a hyperdopaminergic state, at a "brain" level of description, leads to an aberrant assignment of salience to the elements of one’s experience, at a "mind" level.&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, S. (2003). Psychosis as a state of aberrant salience: a framework linking biology, phenomenology, and pharmacology in schizophrenia. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'',160, 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine mediates the conversion of the neural representation of an external stimulus from a neutral bit of information into an attractive or aversive entity, i.e. a salient event. Symptoms of  schizophrenia and schizotypy  may arise out of ‘the aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal representations’; and antipsychotic medications may reduce positive symptoms by attenuating aberrant motivational salience, via blockade of the Dopamine D2 receptors (Kapur, 2003). There is no evidence however on a link between attentional irregularities and enhanced stimulus salience in schizotypy.&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2004). Latent inhibition, visual pop-out and schizotypy: is disruption of latent inhibition due to  enhanced stimulus salience?''Personality and Individual Differences'', 37, 1347-1358.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seasonal subseries plots''' are a graphical tool to visualize and detect [[seasonality]] in a [[time series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal Subseries Plot|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc4431.htm|website=NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal subseries plots involves the extraction of the seasons from a time series into a subseries. Based on a selected periodicity, it is an alternative plot that emphasizes the seasonal patterns are where the data for each season are collected together in separate mini time plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1|title=2.1 Graphics {{!}} OTexts|website=www.otexts.org|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal subseries plots enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly, and also shows the changes in seasonality over time. Especially, it allows to detect changes between different seasons, changes within a particular season over time.

However, this plot is only useful if the [[Periodic point|period]] of the seasonality is already known. In many cases, this will in fact be known. For example, monthly data typically has a period of 12. If the period is not known, an [[autocorrelation plot]] or [[spectral plot]] can be used to determine it. If there is a large number of observations, then a [[box plot]] may be preferable.

==Definition==
Seasonal sub-series plots are formed by
* Vertical axis: [[response variable]]
* Horizontal axis: seasons in chronological order. For example, with monthly data, all the January values are plotted (in chronological order), then all the February values, and so on.

The horizontal line displays the mean value for each month over the time series.

The analyst must specify the length of the seasonal pattern before generating this plot. In most cases, the analyst will know this from the context of the problem and data collection.

==Importance==
It is important to know when analyzing a time series if there is a significant seasonality effect. The seasonal subseries plot is an excellent tool for determining if there is a seasonal pattern. The seasonal subseries plot can provide answers to the following questions:
* Do the data exhibit a seasonal pattern?
* What is the nature of the seasonality?
* Is there a within-group pattern (e.g., do January and July exhibit similar patterns)?
* Are there any [[outlier]]s once seasonality has been accounted for?
* Is the [[seasonality]] changing over time?&lt;ref&gt;https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1&lt;/ref&gt;
Practically, seasonal subseries plots are often inspected as a preliminary screening tool. They allow visual inferences to be drawn from data prior to modelling and forecasting.

==Related techniques==
* [[Autocorrelation plot]]
* [[Box plot]]
* [[Recurrence plot]]
* [[Run sequence plot]]
* [[Time series]]
* Seasonal plot

==Software==
Seasonal subseries plots can be implemented in the [[R (programming language)|R]] programming language using function monthplot().

'''Example'''

The following R code results in the above seasonal deviation plot of ''antidiabetic drug sales'';

&gt; monthplot(a10, ylab= "$ million" , xlab= "Month", xaxt= "n", main= "Seasonal deviation plot: antidiabetic drug sales")

&gt; axis(1, at=1:12, labels=month.abb, cex=0.8)

It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain.  The communication within and among these specialized areas of the brain is known as functional integration.&lt;ref name="Macaluso 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso E, Driver J |title=Multisensory spatial interactions: a window onto functional integration in the human brain |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=264–271 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15866201 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.03.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todman D. 2008 1104-1105"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Todman D. | title = Wilder Penfield (1891-1976) | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 255 | pages = 1104–1105 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-008-0915-6 | pmid = 18500490 | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Harrison BJ, Pujol J, Lopez-Sola M, Hernandez-Ribas R, Deus J, etal | title = Consistency and functional specialization in the default mode brain network | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 |  pages = 9781–9786 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711791105 | pmid = 18621692 | issue = 28 | pmc = 2474491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer research has shown that these different regions of the brain may not be solely responsible for only one sensory modality, but could use multiple inputs to perceive what the body senses about its environment. [[Multisensory integration]] is necessary for almost every activity that we perform because the combination of multiple sensory inputs is essential for us to comprehend our surroundings.

==Overview==
It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain, relating to [[systems neuroscience]]. Using functional neuroimaging, it can be seen that sensory-specific cortices are activated by different inputs. For example, regions in the [[occipital cortex]] are tied to vision and those on the [[superior temporal gyrus]] are recipients of auditory inputs. There exist studies suggesting deeper multisensory convergences than those at the sensory-specific cortices, which were listed earlier. This convergence of multiple sensory modalities is known as multisensory integration.

Sensory processing deals with how the brain processes sensory input from multiple sensory modalities.  These include the five classic senses of [[Visual perception|vision]] (sight), [[audition]] (hearing), tactile stimulation ([[touch]]), [[olfaction]] (smell), and [[gustation]] (taste).  Other sensory modalities exist, for example the [[vestibular]] sense (balance and the sense of movement) and [[proprioception]] (the sense of knowing one's position in space) Along with [[Time]] (The sense of knowing where one is in time or activities).  It is important that the information of these different sensory modalities must be relatable.

The different senses were always thought to be controlled by separate lobes of the brain,&lt;ref name="Pirotte 2008"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pirotte B, Voordecker P, Neugroschl C, etal |title=Combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided neuronavigation and intraoperative cortical brain mapping improves targeting of motor cortex stimulation in neuropathic pain |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=62 |issue=6 Suppl 3 |pages=941–56 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18695580 |doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000333762.38500.ac |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[projection areas]]. The lobes of the brain are the classifications that divide the brain both anatomically and functionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hagmann P, Cammoun L, Gigandet X, Meuli R, Honey CJ, et al. .| title = Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral Cortex | journal = PLoS Biology  | volume = 6 |  pages = 1479–1493 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597554  |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159 | pmc=2443193 | editor1-last = Friston | editor1-first = Karl J. | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lobes are the Frontal lobe, responsible for conscious thought, Parietal lobe, responsible for visuospatial processing, the Occipital lobe, responsible for the sense of sight, and the temporal lobe, responsible for the senses of smell and sound.  From the earliest times of neurology, it has been thought that these lobes are solely responsible for their one sensory modality input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Marrelec G, Bellec P, Krainik A, Duffau H, Pelegrini-Isaac M, etal | title = Multisensory Regions, systems, and the brain: Hierarchical measures of functional integration in fMRI | journal = Medical Image Analysis | volume = 12 | pages = 484–496 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.media.2008.02.002 | pmid = 18396441 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research has shown that that may not entirely be the case.

===Problems===
{{Main|Sensory processing disorder}}

Sometimes there can be a problem with the encoding of the sensory information.  This disorder is known as [[Sensory processing disorder|Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]].  This disorder can be further classified into three main types.&lt;ref name="Miller Nielsen 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller LJ, Nielsen DM, Schoen SA, Brett-Green BA |title=Perspectives on sensory processing disorder: a call for translational research |journal=Front Integr Neurosci |volume=3 |issue= |pages=22 |year=2009 |pmid=19826493 |pmc=2759332 |doi=10.3389/neuro.07.022.2009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Sensory modulation disorder, in which patients seek sensory stimulation due to an over or under response to sensory stimuli.  
* Sensory based motor disorder.  Patients have incorrect processing of motor information that leads to poor motor skills.  
* Sensory processing disorder or sensory discrimination disorder, which is characterized by postural control problems, lack of attentiveness, and disorganization.  
There are several therapies used to treat SPD. [[A. Jean Ayres|Anna Jean Ayres]] claimed that a child needs a healthy "sensory diet," which is all of the activities that children engage in, that gives them the necessary sensory inputs that they need to get their brain into improving sensory processing.

==History==
In the 1930s, [[Wilder Penfield|Dr. Wilder Penfield]] was conducting a very bizarre operation at the Montreal Neurological Institute.&lt;ref name="isbn978-1-4000-6469-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sandra Blakeslee|Blakeslee, Sandra]]; Blakeslee, Matthew. |title=The Body has a Mind of its Own |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |pages=440 |isbn=978-1-4000-6469-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Penfield "pioneered the incorporation of neurophysiological principles in the practice of [[neurosurgery]].&lt;ref name="Todman D. 2008 1104-1105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang F, Kruggel F | title = Automatic segmentation of human brain sulci | journal = Medical Image Analysis| volume = 12 | pages = 442–451| year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.media.2008.01.003 | pmid = 18325826 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Penfield was interested in determining a solution to solve the epileptic [[seizure]] problems that his patients were having.   He used an electrode to stimulate different regions of the brain's cortex, and would ask his still conscious patient what he or she felt.  This process led to the publication of his book, The Cerebral Cortex of Man.  The "mapping" of the sensations his patients felt led Dr. Penfield to chart out the sensations that were triggered by stimulating different cortical regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seth AK, Dienes Z, Cleeremans A, Overgaard M, Pessoa L | title = Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | pages = 314–321 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2008.04.008 | pmid = 18606562 | issue = 8 | pmc = 2767381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. H. P. Cantlie was the artist Dr. Penfield hired to illustrate his findings.  The result was the conception of the first sensory [[cortical homunculus|Homunculus]].

The [[cortical homunculus|Homonculus]] is a visual representation of the intensity of sensations derived from different parts of the body.  Dr. Wilder Penfield and his colleague [[Herbert Jasper]] developed the [[Montreal procedure]] using an electrode to stimulate different parts of the brain to determine which parts were the cause of the epilepsy.  This part could then be surgically removed or altered in order to regain optimal brain performance.  While performing these tests, they discovered that the [[Wilder Penfield#Neural Stimulation|functional maps]] of the sensory and motor cortices were similar in all patients.  Because of their novelty at the time, these Homonculi were hailed as the "E=mc² of Neuroscience".&lt;ref name="isbn978-1-4000-6469-4"/&gt;

==Current research==
There are still no definitive answers to the questions regarding the relationship between functional and structural asymmetries in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name="Lin SY, Burdine RD. 2005 R343-R345"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin SY, Burdine RD | title = Brain asymmetry: Switching from left to right | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = R343–R345 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.026 | pmid = 15886094}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of asymmetries in the human brain including how language is processed mainly in the left [[lateralization of brain function|hemisphere of the brain]].  There have been some cases, however, in which individuals have comparable language skills to someone who uses his left hemisphere to process language, yet they mainly use their right or both hemispheres.  These cases pose the possibility that function may not follow structure in some cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Lin SY, Burdine RD. 2005 R343-R345"/&gt;  Current research in the fields of sensory processing and multisensory integration is aiming to hopefully unlock the mysteries behind the concept of [[brain lateralization]].

Research on sensory processing has much to offer towards understanding the function of the brain as a whole.  The primary task of multisensory integration is to figure out and sort out the vast quantities of sensory information in the body through multiple sensory modalities.  These modalities not only are not independent, but they are also quite complementary.  Where one sensory modality may give information on one part of a situation, another modality can pick up other necessary information.  Bringing this information together facilitates the better understanding of the physical world around us.

It may seem redundant that we are being provided with [[Multisensory integration|multiple sensory inputs]] about the same object, but that is not necessarily the case.  This so-called "redundant" information is in fact verification that what we are experiencing is in fact happening. [[Perception]]s of the world are based on models that we build of the world.  Sensory information informs these models, but this information can also confuse the models.  [[Illusion|Sensory illusions]] occur when these models do not match up.  For example, where our visual system may fool us in one case, our auditory system can bring us back to a ground reality.  This prevents sensory misrepresentations, because through the combination of multiple sensory modalities, the model that we create is much more robust and gives a better assessment of the situation.  Thinking about it logically, it is far easier to fool one sense than it is to simultaneously fool two or more senses.

==Examples==
One of the earliest sensations is the [[olfactory]] sensation.  Evolutionary, gustation and [[olfaction]] developed together.  This multisensory integration was necessary for early humans in order to ensure that they were receiving proper nutrition from their food, and also to make sure that they were not consuming poisonous materials.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  There are several other sensory integrations that developed early on in the human evolutionary time line.  The integration between vision and audition was necessary for spatial mapping.  Integration between vision and tactile sensations developed along with our finer motor skills including better hand-eye coordination.  While humans developed into [[bipedal]] organisms, balance became exponentially more essential to survival.  The [[multisensory integration]] between visual inputs, [[vestibular system|vestibular]] (balance) inputs, and [[proprioception]] inputs played an important role in our development into upright walkers.

===Audiovisual system===
Perhaps one of the most studied sensory integrations is the relationship between [[Visual system|vision]] and [[auditory system|audition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Witten IB, Knudsen EI | title = Why Seeing Is Believing: Merging Auditory and Visual Worlds | journal = Neuron | volume = 48 | pages = 489–496| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.020 | pmid = 16269365 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two senses perceive the same objects in the world in different ways, and by combining the two, they help us understand this information better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burr D |author2=Alais D |author3=S. Martinez-Conde | title = Chapter 14 Combining visual and auditory information | journal = In Progress in Brain Research | pages = 243–258 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision dominates our perception of the world around us.  This is because visual spatial information is one of the most reliable sensory modalities.  Visual stimuli are recorded directly onto the retina, and there are few, if any, external distortions that provide incorrect information to the brain about the true location of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huddleston WE, Lewis JW, Phinney RE, DeYoe EA | title = Mapping Auditory and visual attention-based apparent motion share functional parallels | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 70 |  pages = 1207–1216 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.3758/PP.70.7.1207 | pmid = 18927004 | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other spatial information is not as reliable as visual spatial information.  For example, consider auditory spatial input.  The location of an object can sometimes be determined solely on its sound, but the sensory input can easily be modified or altered, thus giving a less reliable spatial representation of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jaekl PM | title = Auditory-visual temporal integration measured by shifts in perceived temporal location | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 417 |  pages = 219–224 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2007.02.029 | pmid = 17428607 | last2 = Harris | first2 = LR | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory information therefore is not spatially represented unlike visual stimuli.  But once one has the spatial mapping from the visual information, multisensory integration helps bring the information from both the visual and auditory stimuli together to make a more robust mapping.

There have been studies done that show that a dynamic neural mechanism exists for matching the auditory and visual inputs from an event that stimulates multiple [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = King, AJ| title = Multisensory Integration: Strategies for Synchronization | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = R339–R341 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.022 | pmid = 15886092}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this that has been observed is how the brain compensates for target distance.  When you are speaking with someone or watching something happen, auditory and visual signals are not being processed concurrently, but they are perceived as being simultaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulkin DA, Groh JM | title = Seeing sounds: visual and auditory interactions in the brain | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 16 |  pages = 415–419 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2006.06.008 | pmid = 16837186 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of [[multisensory integration]] can lead to slight misperceptions in the visual-auditory system in the form of the ventriloquist effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alais D, Burr D | title = The ventriloquist effect results from near-optimal bimodal integration  | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 |  pages = 257–262 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14761661 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the ventriloquism effect is when a person on the television appears to have his voice coming from his mouth, rather than the television's speakers.  This occurs because of a pre-existing spatial representation within the brain which is programmed to think that voices come from another human's mouth.  This then makes it so the visual response to the audio input is spatially misrepresented, and therefore misaligned.

===Sensorimotor system===
Hand eye coordination is one example of sensory integration.  In this case, we require a tight integration of what we visually perceive about an object, and what we tactilely perceive about that same object.  If these two senses were not combined within the brain, then one would have less ability to manipulate an object.  Hand-eye coordination is the tactile sensation in the context of the visual system.  The visual system is very static, in that it doesn't move around much, but the hands and other parts used in tactile sensory collection can freely move around.  This movement of the hands must be included in the mapping of both the tactile and visual sensations, otherwise one would not be able to comprehend where they were moving their hands, and what they were touching and looking at.  An example of this happening is looking at an infant.  The infant picks up objects and puts them in his mouth, or touches them to his feet or face.  All of these actions are culminating to the formation of spatial maps in the brain and the realization that "Hey, that thing that's moving this object is actually a part of me."  Seeing the same thing that they are feeling is a major step in the mapping that is required for infants to begin to realize that they can move their arms and interact with an object.  This is the earliest and most explicit way of experiencing sensory integration.

==Further research==
In the future, research on sensory integration will be used to better understand how different sensory modalities are incorporated within the brain to help us perform even the simplest of tasks.  For example, we do not currently have the understanding needed to comprehend how neural circuits transform sensory cues into changes in motor activities.  More research done on the [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] system can help understand how these movements are controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samuel AD, Sengupta P | title = Sensorimotor integration: Locating locomotion in neural circuits | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | pages = R341–R353 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.021 | pmid = 15886093 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding can potentially be used to learn more about how to make better [[prosthetics]], and eventually help patients who have lost the use of a limb.  Also, by learning more about how different sensory inputs can combine can have profound effects on new engineering approaches using [[robotics]].  The robot's sensory devices may take in inputs of different modalities, but if we understand multisensory integration better, we might be able to program these robots to convey these data into a useful output to better serve our purposes.

{{Sociology}}
In any given society, a '''taboo''' is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/579821/taboo Taboo]." Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved 21 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 11th Edition. "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taboo Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt; Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by [[Custom (law)|custom]] or [[religion]] may be perfectly acceptable to another.

Whether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help utilize a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the [[community]]. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or [[tribe]] as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging".&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009" /&gt;

The meaning of the word "taboo" has been somewhat expanded in the [[social science]]s to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on [[Morality|moral judgment]], religious beliefs, or cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]].&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow| first= Victor Benno | title= Food taboos: their origins and purposes|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | date=2009| volume=5-18:|

==Etymology==
The term "taboo" comes from the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ''tabu'' ("prohibited", "disallowed", "forbidden"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; related among others to the [[Maori language|Maori]] ''tapu'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''kapu'', and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] ''fady''. Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer [[Captain James Cook|James Cook]] visited [[Tonga]], and referred to the [[Tongans]]' use of the term "taboo" for "any thing is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462 462]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
{{Quote|Not one of them would sit down, or eat a bit of any thing.... On expressing my surprise at this, they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive meaning; but, in general, signifies that a thing is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 348]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was translated to him as "consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cook|King|1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tabu'' itself has been derived from alleged Tongan [[Morpheme|morphemes]] ''ta'' ("mark") and ''bu'' ("especially"), but this may be a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] (Tongan does not actually have a [[phoneme]] /b/), and ''tapu'' is usually treated as a unitary, non-[[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word inherited from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''tapu'', in turn inherited from [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] *''tabu'', with the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning "sacred, forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=taboo&amp;searchmode=none Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of "Tonga" as ''Tongatapu'', here meaning "Sacred South" rather than "Forbidden South".

Common taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the [[taboo on the dead|dead]] and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and [[dietary laws]] such as [[vegetarianism]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and ''[[halal]]'') or religious ([[treif]] and [[haram]]). In [[Madagascar]], a strong code of taboos, known as ''[[fady (taboo)|fady]]'', constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own ''fady''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The word "taboo" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, [[John Merlin Powis Smith|J. M. Powis Smith]], in his book ''The American Bible'' (editor's preface 1927), used "taboo" occasionally in relation to Israel's [[Tabernacle]] and ceremonial laws, including {{Bibleverse|Exodus|30:36}}, {{Bibleverse|Exodus|29:37}}; {{Bibleverse|Numbers|16:37–38}}; {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|22:9}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|65:5}}, {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|44:19}} and {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|46:20}}.

[[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''African Notebook'' 1958. Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[Communist]] and [[materialist]] theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Marta Dyczok|author2=Oxana Gaman-Golutvina|title=Media, Democracy and Freedom: The Post-Communist Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-0343-0311-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC&amp;pg=PA209 209]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] particularly endeavored to explain taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |author=Marvin Harris |title=India's Sacred Cow |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221816/http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
Some argue that contemporary [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies have taboos against [[tribalism]]s (for example, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[nationalism]]) and [[prejudice]]s ([[racism]], [[sexism]], [[religious extremism]]).&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | author-link = Robert D.

'''[[Curvilinear coordinates]]''' can be formulated in [[tensor calculus]], with important applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], particularly for describing transportation of physical quantities and deformation of matter in [[fluid mechanics]] and [[continuum mechanics]].

==Vector and tensor algebra in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==
{{Einstein_summation_convention}}
Elementary vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates is used in some of the older scientific literature in [[mechanics]] and [[physics]] and can be indispensable to understanding work from the early and mid 1900s, for example the text by Green and Zerna.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book | last1=Green | first1=A. E. | last2=Zerna | first2=W. | year=1968 | title=Theoretical Elasticity | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853486-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some useful relations in the algebra of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.  The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,&lt;ref name=Ogden00/&gt; Naghdi,&lt;ref name=Naghdi&gt;{{cite book | first1=P. M. | last1=Naghdi | year=1972 | contribution=Theory of shells and plates | editor=S. Flügge | title=Handbook of Physics | volume=VIa/2 | pages=425–640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmonds,&lt;ref name=Simmonds&gt;{{cite book | last=Simmonds | first=J. G. | year=1994 | title=A brief on tensor analysis | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-387-90639-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green and Zerna,&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Basar and Weichert,&lt;ref name=Basar&gt;{{cite book | last1=Basar | first1=Y. | last2=Weichert | first2=D. | year=2000 | title=Numerical continuum mechanics of solids: fundamental concepts and perspectives | publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ciarlet.&lt;ref name=Ciarlet&gt;{{cite book | last=Ciarlet | first=P.

=== Coordinate transformations ===
Consider two coordinate systems with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;(Z^1 , Z^2 ,Z^3 )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} )&lt;/math&gt;,  which we shall represent in short as just &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively and always assume our index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; runs from 1 through 3. We shall assume that  these coordinates systems are embedded in the three-dimensional euclidean space. Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; may be used to explain each other, because as we move along the coordinate line in one coordinate system we can use the other to describe our position. In this way Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of each other

&lt;math&gt;Z^i= f^{i}(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} ) &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

&lt;math&gt;Z^i= Z^{i}(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} )= Z^{i}(Z^\acute{i}) &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt;.Let us denote this transformation by &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;. We will therefore represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; to the coordinate system with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;Z= T(\acute{z}) &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we can represent &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}= g^{\acute{i}}(Z^{1}, Z^{2} ,Z^{3} )  &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i}=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

similarly we can write the free equations more compactly as

&lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}= Z^\acute{i}(Z^{1} , Z^{2} ,Z^{3} )= Z^\acute{i}(Z^{i})  &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us denote this transformation by &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt;. We will represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; to the coordinate system with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;\acute{z}= S(z) &lt;/math&gt;

If the transformation &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is bijective then we call the image of the transformation,namely &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt;, a set of '''admissible coordinates for''' &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is linear the coordinate system &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; will be called an '''affine coordinate system''' ,otherwise &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''curvilinear coordinate system'''

==== The Jacobian ====
As we now see that the Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of each other, we can take the derivative of the coordinate variable &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the coordinate variable &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;

consider

&lt;math&gt;\partial{Z^i} \over \partial{Z^\acute{i}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_\acute{i}^i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;, these derivatives can be arranged in a matrix, say &lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt;,in which &lt;math&gt;J_\acute{i}^i &lt;/math&gt; is the element in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}  &lt;/math&gt;row and &lt;math&gt;\acute{i}^{th} &lt;/math&gt;column

&lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} J_\acute{1}^{1}  &amp; J_\acute{2}^{1} &amp; J_\acute{3}^{1} \\ J_\acute{1}^{2} &amp; J_\acute{2}^{2}&amp; J_\acute{3}^{2} \\ J_\acute{1}^{3}&amp; J_\acute{2}^{3}&amp; J_\acute{3}^{3}  \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}  {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}}\\ {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}}\\{\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}} \end{pmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

The resultant matrix is called the Jacobian matrix.

===Vectors in curvilinear coordinates===
Let ('''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be an arbitrary basis for three-dimensional Euclidean space.  In general, the basis vectors are '''neither unit vectors nor mutually orthogonal'''.  However, they are required to be linearly independent.  Then a vector '''v''' can be expressed as&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=27}}
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{v} = v^k\,\mathbf{b}_k
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''v&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the '''contravariant''' components of the vector '''v'''.

The '''reciprocal basis''' ('''b'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined by the relation &lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=28–29}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = \delta^i_j
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''δ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].

The vector '''v''' can also be expressed in terms of the reciprocal basis:
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{v} = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the '''covariant''' components of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates===
A second-order tensor can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{S} = S^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S^{i}_{~j}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = S_{i}^{~j}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''S&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are called the '''contravariant''' components, ''S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''mixed right-covariant''' components, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' the '''mixed left-covariant''' components, and ''S&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''covariant''' components of the second-order tensor.

====Metric tensor and relations between components====
The quantities ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are defined as&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=39}}

:&lt;math&gt;
    g_{ij} = \mathbf{b}_i \cdot \mathbf{b}_j = g_{ji} ~;~~ g^{ij} = \mathbf{b}^i \cdot \mathbf{b}^j = g^{ji}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the above equations we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   v^i = g^{ik}~v_k ~;~~ v_i = g_{ik}~v^k ~;~~ \mathbf{b}^i = g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_j ~;~~ \mathbf{b}_i = g_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;

The components of a vector are related by&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=30–32}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k~\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k~\delta^i_k = v^i &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k~\delta_i^k = v_i &lt;/math&gt;
Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v^k~\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = g_{ki}~v^k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = g^{ki}~v_k
 &lt;/math&gt;

The components of the second-order tensor are related by
:&lt;math&gt;
   S^{ij} = g^{ik}~S_k^{~j} = g^{jk}~S^i_{~k} = g^{ik}~g^{jl}~S_{kl}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===The alternating tensor===
In an orthonormal right-handed basis, the third-order [[Levi-Civita symbol|alternating tensor]] is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \varepsilon_{ijk}~\mathbf{e}^i\otimes\mathbf{e}^j\otimes\mathbf{e}^k
&lt;/math&gt;
In a general curvilinear basis the same tensor may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal{E}_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   = \mathcal{E}^{ijk}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}_k
&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}_{ijk} = \left[\mathbf{b}_i,\mathbf{b}_j,\mathbf{b}_k\right] =(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j)\cdot\mathbf{b}_k ~;~~
  \mathcal{E}^{ijk} = \left[\mathbf{b}^i,\mathbf{b}^j,\mathbf{b}^k\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j = J~\varepsilon_{ijp}~\mathbf{b}^p = \sqrt{g}~\varepsilon_{ijp}~\mathbf{b}^p
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}_{ijk} = J~\varepsilon_{ijk} = \sqrt{g}~\varepsilon_{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}^{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{J}~\varepsilon^{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\varepsilon^{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector operations===

#'''Identity map'''
#:The identity map '''I''' defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{I}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=39}}
#::&lt;math&gt;
   \mathsf{I} = g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = g_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = \mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^i = \mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
#'''Scalar (dot) product'''
#:The scalar product of two vectors in curvilinear coordinates is&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=32}}
#::&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v} = u^i~v_i = u_i~v^i = g_{ij}~u^i~v^j = g^{ij}~u_i~v_j
 &lt;/math&gt;
#'''Vector (cross) product'''
#:The [[cross product]] of two vectors is given by&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=32–34}}
#::&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v} = \varepsilon_{ijk}~{u}_j~{v}_k~\mathbf{e}_i
&lt;/math&gt;
#:where ε&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]] and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Cartesian basis vector.  In curvilinear coordinates, the equivalent expression is

 &lt;/math&gt;
#'''Action of a second-order tensor on a vector:'''

#'''[[Inner product]] of two second-order tensors:'''

 &lt;/math&gt;
#:Alternatively,
#::&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{U} = S^{ij}T^m_{.n}g_{jm}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^n = S^i_{.m}T^m_{.n}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^n
     = S^{ij}T_{jn}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^n
 &lt;/math&gt;

#:If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a second-order tensor, then the determinant is defined by the relation
#::&lt;math&gt;
   \left[\boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{v}, \boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{w}\right] = \det\boldsymbol{S}\left[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
#:where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary vectors and
#::&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right] := \mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w}).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relations between curvilinear and Cartesian basis vectors===
Let ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be the usual Cartesian basis vectors for the Euclidean space of interest and let
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i = \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_i
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a second-order transformation tensor that maps '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = (\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_i)\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = \boldsymbol{F}\cdot(\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i) = \boldsymbol{F}~.
&lt;/math&gt;
From this relation we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i = \boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{e}^i ~;~~ g^{ij} = [\boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{1}}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{T}}]_{ij} ~;~~ g_{ij} = [g^{ij}]^{-1} = [\boldsymbol{F}^{\rm{T}}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}]_{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;J := \det\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; be the Jacobian of the transformation.  Then, from the definition of the determinant,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\mathbf{b}_3\right] = \det\boldsymbol{F}\left[\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3\right] ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3\right] = 1 
&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  J = \det\boldsymbol{F} = \left[\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\mathbf{b}_3\right] = \mathbf{b}_1\cdot(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
A number of interesting results can be derived using the above relations.

First, consider
:&lt;math&gt;
   g := \det[g_{ij}]
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   g = \det[\boldsymbol{F}^{\rm{T}}]\cdot\det[\boldsymbol{F}] = J\cdot J = J^2
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \det[g^{ij}] = \cfrac{1}{J^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, using the fact that &lt;math&gt;[g^{ij}] = [g_{ij}]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}} = 2~J~\cfrac{\partial J}{\partial g_{ij}} = g~g^{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting relation is derived below.  Recall that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = \delta^i_j \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_1 = 1,~\mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_2=\mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_3=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{b}^1 = A~(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a, yet undetermined, constant.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_1 =  A~\mathbf{b}_1\cdot(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3) = AJ = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \cfrac{1}{J}
&lt;/math&gt;
This observation leads to the relations
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^1 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3) ~;~~
  \mathbf{b}^2 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_3\times\mathbf{b}_1) ~;~~
  \mathbf{b}^3 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_1\times\mathbf{b}_2)
&lt;/math&gt;
In index notation,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^k = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j) = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual [[permutation symbol]].

We have not identified an explicit expression for the transformation tensor '''''F''''' because an alternative form of the mapping between curvilinear and Cartesian bases is more useful.  Assuming a sufficient degree of smoothness in the mapping (and a bit of abuse of notation), we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_i = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i} =  \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial x_j}~\cfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial q^i} = \mathbf{e}_j~\cfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial q^i} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}_i = \mathbf{b}_j~\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial x_i}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From these results we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i = \mathbf{e}^k\cdot(\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^i) = \mathbf{e}^k
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^k = \frac{\partial q^k}{\partial x_i}~\mathbf{e}^i
&lt;/math&gt;

Some useful relations in the calculus of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.  The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,&lt;ref name=Ogden00/&gt; Simmonds,&lt;ref name=Simmonds /&gt; Green and Zerna,&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Basar and Weichert,&lt;ref name=Basar/&gt; and Ciarlet.&lt;ref name=Ciarlet/&gt;

===Basic definitions===
Let the position of a point in space be characterized by three coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;(q^1, q^2, q^3)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[coordinate curve]] ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; represents a curve on which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are constant.  Let '''x''' be the [[position vector]] of the point relative to some origin.  Then, assuming that such a mapping and its inverse exist and are continuous, we can write &lt;ref name=Ogden00&gt;{{cite book | last=Ogden | first=R. W. | year=2000 | title=Nonlinear elastic deformations | publisher=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=55}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1, q^2, q^3) ~;~~ q^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x}) = [\boldsymbol{\varphi}^{-1}(\mathbf{x})]^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
The fields ψ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''') are called the '''curvilinear coordinate functions''' of the '''curvilinear coordinate system''' '''ψ'''('''x''') = '''ψ'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''').

The ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' '''coordinate curves''' are defined by the one-parameter family of functions given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}_i(\alpha) = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\alpha, q^j, q^k) ~,~~ i\ne j \ne k
 &lt;/math&gt;
with ''q&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;, q&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' fixed.

===Tangent vector to coordinate curves===
The '''tangent vector''' to the curve '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; at the point '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(α) (or to the coordinate curve ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the point '''x''') is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\rm{d}\mathbf{x}_i}{\rm{d}\alpha} \equiv \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient===

====Scalar field====
Let ''f''('''x''') be a scalar field in space.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   f(\mathbf{x}) = f[\boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1,q^2,q^3)] = f_\varphi(q^1,q^2,q^3)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The gradient of the field ''f'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\rm{d}}{\rm{d}\alpha} f(\mathbf{x}+\alpha\mathbf{c})\biggr|_{\alpha=0}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''c''' is an arbitrary constant vector.  If we define the components ''c&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' of '''c''' are such that
:&lt;math&gt;
   q^i + \alpha~c^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x} + \alpha~\mathbf{c})
 &lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\rm{d}}{\rm{d}\alpha} f_\varphi(q^1 + \alpha~c^1, q^2 + \alpha~c^2, q^3 + \alpha~c^3)\biggr|_{\alpha=0} = \cfrac{\partial f_\varphi}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we set &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \psi^i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, then since &lt;math&gt;q^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi^i(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial q^j}~c^j = c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
which provides a means of extracting the contravariant component of a vector '''c'''.

If '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the covariant (or natural) basis at a point, and if '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the contravariant (or reciprocal) basis at that point, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \left(\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i\right)
   \left(c^i~\mathbf{b}_i\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x}) = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
A brief rationale for this choice of basis is given in the next section.

====Vector field====
A similar process can be used to arrive at the gradient of a vector field '''f'''('''x''').  The gradient is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial q^i}~c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we consider the gradient of the position vector field '''r'''('''x''') = '''x''', then we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \mathbf{b}_i(\mathbf{x})~c^i ~;~~ \mathbf{b}_i(\mathbf{x}) := \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The vector field '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is tangent to the ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' coordinate curve and forms a '''natural basis''' at each point on the curve.  This basis, as discussed at the beginning of this article, is also called the '''covariant''' curvilinear basis.  We can also define a '''reciprocal basis''', or '''contravariant''' curvilinear basis, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;.  All the algebraic relations between the basis vectors, as discussed in the section on tensor algebra, apply for the natural basis and its reciprocal at each point '''x'''.

Since '''c''' is arbitrary, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the contravariant basis vector '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is perpendicular to the surface of constant ψ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Christoffel symbols of the first kind====
The [[Christoffel symbols]] of the first kind are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_{i,j} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} := \Gamma_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^k \quad \Rightarrow \quad
   \mathbf{b}_{i,j} \cdot \mathbf{b}_l = \Gamma_{ijl}
&lt;/math&gt;
To express Γ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' we note that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     g_{ij,k} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k} = \mathbf{b}_{i,k}\cdot\mathbf{b}_j + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{j,k} 
        = \Gamma_{ikj} + \Gamma_{jki}\\
     g_{ik,j} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} = \mathbf{b}_{i,j}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,j} 
        = \Gamma_{ijk} + \Gamma_{kji}\\
     g_{jk,i} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} = \mathbf{b}_{j,i}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,i}
        = \Gamma_{jik} + \Gamma_{kij} 
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i,j''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j,i''&lt;/sub&gt; we have Γ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; = Γ&lt;sub&gt;''jik''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Using these to rearrange the above relations gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk} = \frac{1}{2}(g_{ik,j} + g_{jk,i} - g_{ij,k})
      = \frac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

====Christoffel symbols of the second kind====
The [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the second kind are defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{ij}^k = \Gamma_{ji}^k &lt;/math&gt;
in which

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} = \Gamma_{ij}^k~\mathbf{b}_k
 &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ij}^k = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j}\cdot\mathbf{b}^k = -\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^k}{\partial q^j}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Other relations that follow are
:&lt;math&gt;
     \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^i}{\partial q^j} = -\Gamma^i_{jk}~\mathbf{b}^k ~;~~
     \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}_i = \Gamma_{ij}^k~\mathbf{b}_k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j ~;~~
     \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}^i = -\Gamma_{jk}^i~\mathbf{b}^k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;

Another particularly useful relation, which shows that the Christoffel symbol depends only on the metric tensor and its derivatives, is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{g^{km}}{2}\left(\frac{\partial g_{mi}}{\partial q^j} + \frac{\partial g_{mj}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial q^m} \right)
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Explicit expression for the gradient of a vector field====
The following expressions for the gradient of a vector field in curvilinear coordinates are quite useful.
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{lk}~v^l\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
    &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~v_l\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Representing a physical vector field====
The vector field '''v''' can be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v} = v_i~\mathbf{b}^i = \hat{v}_i~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^i 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are the covariant components of the field, &lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the physical components, and (no [[Einstein notation|summation]])
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\mathbf{b}}^i = \cfrac{\mathbf{b}^i}{\sqrt{g^{ii}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
is the normalized contravariant basis vector.

===Second-order tensor field===
The gradient of a second order tensor field can similarly be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} = \cfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{S}}{\partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Explicit expressions for the gradient====
If we consider the expression for the tensor in terms of a contravariant basis, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} = \cfrac{\partial}{\partial q^k}[S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j]\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~S_{lj} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S_{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
 &lt;/math&gt;
We may also write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^{ij}}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{kl}~S^{lj} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S^{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^i_{~j}}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{kl}~S^l_{~j} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S^i_{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_i^{~j}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ik}~S_l^{~j} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S_i^{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Representing a physical second-order tensor field====
The physical components of a second-order tensor field can be obtained by using a normalized contravariant basis, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{S} = S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = \hat{S}_{ij}~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^i\otimes\hat{\mathbf{b}}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the hatted basis vectors have been normalized.  This implies that (again no summation)

:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{S}_{ij} = S_{ij}~\sqrt{g^{ii}~g^{jj}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===

====Vector field====
The [[divergence]] of a vector field (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;)is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \operatorname{div}~\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v})
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components with respect to a curvilinear basis
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \cfrac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{\ell i}~v^\ell
    = \left[\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial q^j} - \Gamma^\ell_{ji}~v_\ell\right]~g^{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative equation for the divergence of a vector field is frequently used.  To derive this relation recall that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma_{\ell i}^i~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \Gamma_{\ell i}^i = \Gamma_{i\ell}^i = \cfrac{g^{mi}}{2}\left[\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell} + 
    \frac{\partial g_{\ell m}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial g_{il}}{\partial q^m}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Noting that, due to the symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
  g^{mi}~\frac{\partial g_{\ell m}}{\partial q^i}  = g^{mi}~ \frac{\partial g_{i\ell}}{\partial q^m}
&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{g^{mi}}{2}~\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that if [''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''] is the matrix whose components are ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the inverse of the matrix is &lt;math&gt;[g_{ij}]^{-1} = [g^{ij}]&lt;/math&gt;.  The inverse of the matrix is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [g^{ij}] = [g_{ij}]^{-1} = \cfrac{A^{ij}}{g} ~;~~ g := \det([g_{ij}]) = \det\boldsymbol{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the [[Cofactor matrix]] of the components ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''.  From matrix algebra we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  g = \det([g_{ij}]) = \sum_i g_{ij}~A^{ij} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}} = A^{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   [g^{ij}] = \cfrac{1}{g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging this relation into the expression for the divergence gives
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{1}{2g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{mi}}~\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{1}{2g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
A little manipulation leads to the more compact form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}(v^i~\sqrt{g})
&lt;/math&gt;

====Second-order tensor field====

The [[divergence]] of a second-order tensor field is defined using
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{S})\cdot\mathbf{a} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot(\boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{a})
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''a''' is an arbitrary constant vector.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Elasticity/Tensors#The_divergence_of_a_tensor_field | publisher=[[Wikiversity]] | work=Introduction to Elasticity/Tensors | title=The divergence of a tensor field | accessdate=2010-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In curvilinear coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~S_{lj} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S_{il}\right]~g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}^j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^{ij}}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{il}~S^{lj} + \Gamma^j_{il}~S^{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}_j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^i_{~j}}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{il}~S^l_{~j} - \Gamma^l_{ij}~S^i_{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}^j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_i^{~j}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ik}~S_l^{~j} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S_i^{~l}\right]~g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}_j
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian ===

====Scalar field====
The Laplacian of a scalar field φ('''x''') is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi := \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi)
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the alternative expression for the divergence of a vector field gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}([\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi]^i~\sqrt{g})
&lt;/math&gt;
Now
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}~\mathbf{b}^l = g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}~\mathbf{b}_i
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  [\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi]^i = g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}
~\sqrt{g}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Curl of a vector field===
The curl of a vector field '''v''' in covariant curvilinear coordinates can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{v} = \mathcal{E}^{rst} v_{s|r}~ \mathbf{b}_t
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   v_{s|r} = v_{s,r} - \Gamma^i_{sr}~v_i
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates==
Assume, for the purposes of this section, that the curvilinear coordinate system is [[orthogonal]], i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = 
   \begin{cases} g_{ii} &amp; \text{if } i = j \\
                0 &amp; \text{if } i \ne j,
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}^j = 
   \begin{cases} g^{ii} &amp; \text{if } i = j \\
                0 &amp; \text{if } i \ne j,
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g^{ii} = g_{ii}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. As before, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{b}_j&lt;/math&gt; are covariant basis vectors and '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; are contravariant basis vectors.  Also, let ('''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) be a background, fixed, [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] basis.  A list of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is given below.

===Metric tensor in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates===
{{Main article|Metric tensor}}

Let '''r'''('''x''') be the [[position vector]] of the point '''x''' with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.  The notation can be simplified by noting that '''x''' = '''r'''('''x''').  At each point we can construct a small line element d'''x'''.  The square of the length of the line element is the scalar product d'''x''' • d'''x''' and is called the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of the [[space]].  Recall that the space of interest is assumed to be [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] when we talk of curvilinear coordinates. Let us express the position vector in terms of the background, fixed, Cartesian basis, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i~\mathbf{e}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[chain rule]], we can then express d'''x''' in terms of three-dimensional orthogonal curvilinear coordinates (''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \left(\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}~\mathbf{e}_i\right)\mathrm{d}q^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the metric is given by
:&lt;math&gt; 
  \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \sum_{k=1}^3 \cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}~\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^k}~\mathrm{d}q^j~\mathrm{d}q^k
 &lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric quantity
:&lt;math&gt;
  g_{ij}(q^i,q^j) = \sum_{k=1}^3 \cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i}~\cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^j} = \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j
&lt;/math&gt;
is called the [[metric tensor|fundamental (or metric) tensor]] of the [[Euclidean space]] in curvilinear coordinates.

Note also that
:&lt;math&gt;
   g_{ij} = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\cdot\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^j}
          = \left(\sum_{k} h_{ki}~\mathbf{e}_k\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{m} h_{mj}~\mathbf{e}_m\right)
          = \sum_{k} h_{ki}~h_{kj}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''h&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Lamé coefficients.

If we define the scale factors, ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',  using
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = g_{ii} = \sum_{k} h_{ki}^2 =: h_i^2
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left|\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\right| = \left|\mathbf{b}_i\right| = \sqrt{g_{ii}} = h_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
we get a relation between the fundamental tensor and the Lamé coefficients.

====Example: Polar coordinates====
If we consider polar coordinates for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, note that
: &lt;math&gt; (x, y)=(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
(r, θ) are the curvilinear coordinates, and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation (''r'',θ) → (''r'' cos θ, ''r'' sin θ) is ''r''.

The [[orthogonal]] basis vectors are '''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (cos θ, sin θ), '''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = (−''r'' sin θ, ''r'' cos θ).  The normalized basis vectors are '''''e'''''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (cos θ, sin θ), '''''e'''''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = (−sin θ, cos θ) and the scale factors are ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;= ''r''. The fundamental tensor is ''g''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; =1, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; =0.

===Line and surface integrals===
If we wish to use curvilinear coordinates for [[vector calculus]] calculations, adjustments need to be made in the calculation of line, surface and volume integrals.  For simplicity, we again restrict the discussion to three dimensions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.  However, the same arguments apply for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional problems though there are some additional terms in the expressions when the coordinate system is not orthogonal.

====Line integrals====
Normally in the calculation of [[line integral]]s we are interested in calculating
: &lt;math&gt; \int_C f \,ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{x}(t))\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right|\; dt&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''x'''''(''t'') parametrizes C in Cartesian coordinates.
In curvilinear coordinates, the term
: &lt;math&gt; \left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| = \left| \sum_{i=1}^3 {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial t}\right|&lt;/math&gt;
by the [[chain rule]].  And from the definition of the Lamé coefficients,
: &lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i} = \sum_{k} h_{ki}~ \mathbf{e}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;
and thus
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| &amp; = \left| \sum_k\left(\sum_i h_{ki}~\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)\mathbf{e}_k\right| \\[8pt]
&amp; = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_j\sum_k h_{ki}~h_{kj}\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial t}} = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_j g_{ij}~\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial t}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Now, since &lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; i \ne j &lt;/math&gt;, we have
: &lt;math&gt; 
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| =  \sqrt{\sum_i g_{ii}~\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_i h_{i}^2~\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and we can proceed normally.

====Surface integrals====
Likewise, if we are interested in a [[surface integral]], the relevant calculation, with the parameterization of the surface in Cartesian coordinates is:
: &lt;math&gt;\int_S f \,dS = \iint_T f(\mathbf{x}(s, t)) \left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| \, ds \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
Again, in curvilinear coordinates, we have
: &lt;math&gt;
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| = \left|\left(\sum_i {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right) \times \left(\sum_j {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^j}{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right)\right|
&lt;/math&gt;
and we make use of the definition of curvilinear coordinates again to yield
: &lt;math&gt;
{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial s} = \sum_k \left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right) \mathbf{e}_k ~;~~ 
{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^j}{\partial q^j \over \partial t} = \sum_m \left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right|
  &amp; = \left|
     \sum_k \sum_m \left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_k\times\mathbf{e}_m
    \right| \\[8pt]
  &amp; = \left|\sum_p \sum_k \sum_m \mathcal{E}_{kmp}\left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_p \right|
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]].

In determinant form,  the cross product in terms of curvilinear coordinates will be:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{e}_1                    &amp; \mathbf{e}_2                    &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 \\
 &amp;&amp; \\
\sum_i h_{1i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} &amp; \sum_i h_{2i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} &amp; \sum_i h_{3i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} \\
&amp;&amp; \\
\sum_j h_{1j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} &amp; \sum_j h_{2j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} &amp; \sum_j h_{3j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Grad, curl, div, Laplacian===

In [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] curvilinear coordinates of 3 dimensions, where
: &lt;math&gt;
        \mathbf{b}^i = \sum_k g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}_k ~;~~ g^{ii} = \cfrac{1}{g_{ii}} = \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
one can express the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] or [[vector field]] as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \nabla\varphi = \sum_{i} {\partial\varphi \over \partial q^i}~ \mathbf{b}^i = \sum_{i} \sum_j {\partial\varphi \over \partial q^i}~ g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_j = \sum_i \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}~{\partial f \over \partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}_i ~;~~
   \nabla\mathbf{v} = \sum_i \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}~{\partial \mathbf{v} \over \partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
For an orthogonal basis
:&lt;math&gt;
   g = g_{11}~g_{22}~g_{33} = h_1^2~h_2^2~h_3^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{g} = h_1 h_2 h_3
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[divergence]] of a vector field can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}(h_1 h_2 h_3~v^i)
&lt;/math&gt;
Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
  v^i = g^{ik}~v_k \quad \Rightarrow v^1 = g^{11}~v_1 = \cfrac{v_1}{h_1^2} ~;~~ v^2 = g^{22}~v_2  = \cfrac{v_2}{h_2^2}~;~~ v^3 = g^{33}~v_3 = \cfrac{v_3}{h_3^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\sum_i \frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(\cfrac{h_1 h_2 h_3}{h_i^2}~v_i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
We can get an expression for the [[Laplacian]] in a similar manner by noting that
:&lt;math&gt;
  g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l} = 
   \left\{ g^{11}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^1}, g^{22}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^2}, 
    g^{33}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^3} \right\} = 
   \left\{ \cfrac{1}{h_1^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^1}, \cfrac{1}{h_2^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^2}, 
    \cfrac{1}{h_3^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^3} \right\} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\sum_i\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(\cfrac{h_1 h_2 h_3}{h_i^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
The expressions for the gradient, divergence, and Laplacian can be directly extended to ''n''-dimensions.

The [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt; 
     \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{h_1h_2h_3} \sum_{i=1}^n  \mathbf{e}_i
\sum_{jk} \varepsilon_{ijk} h_i \frac{\partial (h_k v_k)}{\partial q^j}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ε&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].

==Example: Cylindrical polar coordinates==
For [[cylindrical coordinate]]s we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1, q^2, q^3) = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(r, \theta, z)
     = \{r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta, z\}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \{\psi^1(\mathbf{x}), \psi^2(\mathbf{x}), \psi^3(\mathbf{x})\} = (q^1, q^2, q^3) \equiv (r, \theta, z) 
   = \{ \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}, \tan^{-1}(x_2/x_1), x_3\}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; r &lt; \infty ~, ~~ 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 2\pi ~,~~ -\infty &lt; z &lt; \infty
 &lt;/math&gt;

Then the covariant and contravariant basis vectors are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{b}_1 &amp; = \mathbf{e}_r = \mathbf{b}^1 \\
  \mathbf{b}_2 &amp; = r~\mathbf{e}_\theta = r^2~\mathbf{b}^2 \\
  \mathbf{b}_3 &amp; = \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{b}^3
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_\theta, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; are the unit vectors in the &lt;math&gt;r, \theta, z&lt;/math&gt; directions.

Note that the components of the metric tensor are such that
:&lt;math&gt;
    g^{ij} = g_{ij} = 0 (i \ne j) ~;~~ \sqrt{g^{11}} = 1,~\sqrt{g^{22}} = \cfrac{1}{r},~\sqrt{g^{33}}=1
 &lt;/math&gt;
which shows that the basis is orthogonal.

The non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol of the second kind are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{12}^2 = \Gamma_{21}^2 = \cfrac{1}{r} ~;~~ \Gamma_{22}^1 = -r
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Representing a physical vector field===
The normalized contravariant basis vectors in cylindrical polar coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\mathbf{b}}^1 = \mathbf{e}_r ~;~~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^2 = \mathbf{e}_\theta ~;~~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^3 = \mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the physical components of a vector '''v''' are
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\hat{v}_1, \hat{v}_2, \hat{v}_3) = (v_1, v_2/r, v_3) =: (v_r, v_\theta, v_z)
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a scalar field===
The gradient of a scalar field, ''f''('''x'''), in cylindrical coordinates can now be computed from the general expression in curvilinear coordinates and has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}f = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta +  \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a vector field===
Similarly, the gradient of a vector field, '''v'''('''x'''), in cylindrical coordinates can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} - v_\theta\right)~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r \right)~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z
   \end{align} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence of a vector field===
Using the equation for the divergence of a vector field in curvilinear coordinates, the divergence in cylindrical coordinates can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r \right)
 + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}
   \end{align} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian of a scalar field===
The Laplacian is more easily computed by noting that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 f = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}f&lt;/math&gt;.  In cylindrical polar coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}f = \left[v_r~~ v_\theta~~ v_z\right] = \left[\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}~~  \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}~~ \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 f = \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2} + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial^2f}{\partial \theta^2} + \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)
 + \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
   = \cfrac{1}{r}\left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right)\right] + \cfrac{1}{r^2}\cfrac{\partial^2f}{\partial \theta^2} + \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Representing a physical second-order tensor field===
The physical components of a second-order tensor field are those obtained when the tensor is expressed in terms of a normalized contravariant basis.  In cylindrical polar coordinates these components are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \hat{S}_{11} &amp; = S_{11} =: S_{rr} ~;~~\hat{S}_{12} = \cfrac{S_{12}}{r} =: S_{r\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{13} &amp; = S_{13} =: S_{rz} \\
    \hat{S}_{21} &amp; = \cfrac{S_{11}}{r} =: S_{\theta r} ~;~~\hat{S}_{22} = \cfrac{S_{22}}{r^2} =: S_{\theta\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{23} &amp; = \cfrac{S_{23}}{r} =: S_{\theta z} \\
    \hat{S}_{31} &amp; = S_{31} =: S_{zr} ~;~~\hat{S}_{32} = \cfrac{S_{32}}{r} =: S_{z\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{33} &amp; = S_{33} =: S_{zz}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a second-order tensor field===
Using the above definitions we can show that the gradient of a second-order tensor field in cylindrical polar coordinates can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial \theta} - (S_{\theta r}+S_{r\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial \theta} -S_{\theta z}\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{r\theta}+S_{\theta r})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial \theta} + S_{rz}\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial \theta} - S_{z\theta}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial \theta} + S_{zr}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}~\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence of a second-order tensor field===
The divergence of a second-order tensor field in cylindrical polar coordinates can be obtained from the expression for the gradient by collecting terms where the scalar product of the two outer vectors in the dyadic products is nonzero.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r 
   + \frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta
   + \frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z  \\[8pt]
 &amp;  + \cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r  +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{r\theta}+S_{\theta r})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta   +\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial \theta} + S_{rz}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z  \\[8pt]
 &amp;  +
\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r +
\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

 IMHO by no means the material conditional may not be referred to or abbreviated as the adjective "truth functional", omitting a noun like "conditional" or "implication". Seems more like an internal link spamming rather than an appropriate dab hatnote. --Incnis Mrsi --&gt;
In [[logic]], a '''truth function'''&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 294: Truth Function. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that accepts [[Truth value|truth values]] as input and produces a truth value as output, i.e., the input and output are all truth values. The typical example is in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], wherein a compound statement is constructed by one or two statements connected by a [[logical connective]]; if the truth value of the compound statement is determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a '''truth function''', and the logical connective is said to be '''truth functional'''.&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 295: Truth Functional. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical logic|Classical propositional logic]] is a '''truth-functional propositional logic''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/prop-log/  Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Propositional Logic], by Kevin C. Klement&lt;/ref&gt; in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent [[truth table]]), thus every compound statement is a truth function.&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 47: Classical Logic. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, [[modal logic]] is non-truth-functional.

==Overview==
A [[logical connective]] is truth-functional if the truth-value of a compound sentence is a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.  A class of connectives is truth-functional if each of its members is. For example, the connective "''and''" is truth-functional since a sentence like "''Apples are fruits and carrots are vegetables''" is true ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' each of its sub-sentences "''apples are fruits''" and "''carrots are vegetables''" is true, and it is false otherwise.  Some connectives of a natural language, such as English, are not truth-functional.

Connectives of the form "x ''believes that'' ..." are typical examples of connectives that are not truth-functional.  If e.g. Mary mistakenly believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000, but she does not believe that the moon is made of green cheese, then the sentence

:"''Mary believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000''"

is true while

:"''Mary believes that the moon is made of green cheese''"

is false.  In both cases, each component sentence (i.e. "''Al Gore was president of the USA on April 20, 2000''" and "''the moon is made of green cheese''") is false, but each compound sentence formed by prefixing the phrase "''Mary believes that''" differs in truth-value.  That is, the truth-value of a sentence of the form "''Mary believes that...''" is not determined solely by the truth-value of its component sentence, and hence the (unary) [[Logical connective|connective]] (or simply ''operator'' since it is unary) is non-truth-functional.

The class of [[classical logic]] connectives (e.g. [[and (logic)|&amp;]], [[material conditional|→]]) used in the construction of formulas is truth-functional.  Their values for various truth-values as argument are usually given by [[truth table]]s. [[Truth-functional propositional calculus]] is a [[formal system]] whose formulae may be interpreted as either true or false.

== Table of binary truth functions ==

In two-valued logic, there are sixteen possible truth functions, also called [[Boolean function]]s, of two inputs ''P'' and ''Q''. Any of these functions corresponds to a truth table of a certain [[logical connective]] in classical logic, including several [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] cases such as a function not depending on one or both of its arguments. Truth and falsehood is denoted as 1 and 0 in the following truth tables, respectively, for sake of brevity.

==Functional completeness==
{{see also|Functional completeness}}

Because a function may be expressed as a [[composition of functions|composition]], a truth-functional logical calculus does not need to have dedicated symbols for all of the above-mentioned functions to be [[functional completeness|functionally complete]]. This is expressed in a [[propositional calculus]] as [[logical equivalence]] of certain compound statements. For example, classical logic has {{math|¬''P'' ∨ ''Q''}} equivalent to {{math|''P'' → ''Q''}}. The conditional operator "→" is therefore not necessary for a classical-based [[logical system]] if "¬" (not) and "∨" (or) are already in use.

A [[minimal element|minimal]] set of operators that can express every statement expressible in the [[propositional calculus]] is called a ''minimal functionally complete set''. A minimally complete set of operators is achieved by NAND alone {↑} and NOR alone {↓}.

The following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators whose arities do not exceed 2:&lt;ref name="Wernick"&gt;Wernick, William (1942) "Complete Sets of Logical Functions," ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 51'': 117&amp;ndash;32. In his list on the last page of the article, Wernick does not distinguish between ← and →, or between &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
;One element: {↑}, {↓}.
;Two elements: &lt;math&gt;\{\vee, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\wedge, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nleftarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nleftarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \leftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \leftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;.
;Three elements: &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \leftrightarrow, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \leftrightarrow, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \nleftrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \leftrightarrow, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \leftrightarrow, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \nleftrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Algebraic properties==
Some truth functions possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the corresponding connective. Some of those properties that a binary truth function (or a corresponding logical connective) may have are:

*'''[[associativity]]''': Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row, the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.
*'''[[commutativity]]''': The operands of the connective may be swapped without affecting the truth-value of the expression.
*'''[[distributivity]]''': A connective denoted by · distributes over another connective denoted by +, if ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') for all operands ''a'', ''b'', ''c''.
*'''[[idempotence]]''': Whenever the operands of the operation are the same, the connective gives the operand as the result. In other words, the operation is both truth-preserving and falsehood-preserving (see below).
*'''[[Absorption Law|absorption]]''': A pair of connectives &lt;math&gt;\land, \lor&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the absorption law if &lt;math&gt;a\land(a\lor b)=a&lt;/math&gt; for all operands ''a'', ''b''.

A set of truth functions is [[functional completeness|functionally complete]] if and only if for each of the following five properties it contains at least one member lacking it:
*'''[[monotonic]]''': If ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''f''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {0,1} such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \top, \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''[[affine transformation|affine]]''': For each variable, changing its value either always or never changes the truth-value of the operation, for all fixed values of all other variables. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\neg, \leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\not\leftrightarrow, \top, \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''self dual''': To read the truth-value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its [[truth table]] is the same as taking the complement of reading it from bottom to top; in other words, ''f''(¬''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ¬''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ¬''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). E.g., &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''truth-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of these operations. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \top, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow, \subset&lt;/math&gt;. (see [[Validity (logic)|validity]])
*'''falsehood-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false' as a result of these operations. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \nleftrightarrow, \bot, \not\subset, \not\supset&lt;/math&gt;. (see [[Validity (logic)|validity]])

===Arity===
{{see also|arity}}

A concrete function may be also referred to as an ''operator''. In two-valued logic there are 2 nullary operators (constants), 4 [[unary operation|unary operators]], 16 [[binary operation|binary operators]], 256 [[ternary operation|ternary operators]], and &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. In three-valued logic there are 3 nullary operators (constants), 27 [[unary operation|unary operators]], 19683 [[binary operation|binary operators]], 7625597484987 [[ternary operation|ternary operators]], and &lt;math&gt;3^{3^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. In ''k''-valued logic, there are ''k'' nullary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^k&lt;/math&gt; unary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^{k^2}&lt;/math&gt; binary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^{k^3}&lt;/math&gt; ternary operators, and &lt;math&gt;k^{k^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. An ''n''-ary operator in ''k''-valued logic is a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_k^n \to \mathbb{Z}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the number of such operators is &lt;math&gt;|\mathbb{Z}_k|^{|\mathbb{Z}_k^n|} = k^{k^n}&lt;/math&gt;, which is how the above numbers were derived.

However, some of the operators of a particular arity are actually degenerate forms that perform a lower-arity operation on some of the inputs and ignores the rest of the inputs. Out of the 256 ternary boolean operators cited above, &lt;math&gt;\binom{3}{2}\cdot 16 - \binom{3}{1}\cdot 4 + \binom{3}{0}\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; of them are such degenerate forms of binary or lower-arity operators, using the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]]. The ternary operator &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=\lnot x&lt;/math&gt; is one such operator which is actually a unary operator applied to one input, and ignoring the other two inputs.

[[Negation|"Not"]] is a [[unary operation|unary operator]], it takes a single term (¬''P''). The rest are [[binary operation|binary operators]], taking two terms to make a compound statement (''P'' &amp;and; ''Q'', ''P'' &amp;or; ''Q'', ''P'' → ''Q'', ''P'' ↔ ''Q'').

The set of logical operators {{math|&amp;Omega;}} may be [[Partition of a set|partition]]ed into disjoint subsets as follows:

::: &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \Omega_0 \cup \Omega_1 \cup \ldots \cup \Omega_j \cup \ldots \cup \Omega_m \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this partition, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_j&lt;/math&gt; is the set of operator symbols of ''[[arity]]'' {{mvar|j}}.

In the more familiar propositional calculi, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is typically partitioned as follows:

:::nullary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 = \{\bot, \top \} &lt;/math&gt;

:::unary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_1 = \{ \lnot \} &lt;/math&gt;

:::binary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_2 \subseteq \{ \land, \lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow \} &lt;/math&gt;

==Principle of compositionality==

Instead of using [[truth table]]s, logical connective symbols can be interpreted by means of an interpretation function and a functionally complete set of truth-functions (Gamut 1991), as detailed by the [[principle of compositionality]] of meaning.
Let ''I'' be an interpretation function, let ''Φ'', ''Ψ'' be any two sentences and let the truth function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt; be defined as:
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = F; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = T

Then, for convenience, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt; and so on are defined by means of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''x'')
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''))
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''))

or, alternatively ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt; and so on are defined directly:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = F; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(F) = T;
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = T; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = F
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = T; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = F

Then
{{Bulleted list|style=font-family: "Nimbus Roman No9 L", "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
| ''I''(~) {{=}} ''I''({{not}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(&amp;) {{=}} ''I''({{and}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(''v'') {{=}} ''I''({{or-}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(~''Φ'') {{=}} ''I''({{not}}''Φ'') {{=}} ''I''({{not}})(''I''(''Φ'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''Φ''))
| ''I''(''Φ''{{and}}''Ψ'') {{=}} ''I''({{and}})(''I''(''Φ''), ''I''(''Ψ'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''Φ''), ''I''(''Ψ''))
}}
etc.

Thus if ''S'' is a sentence that is a string of symbols consisting of logical symbols ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; representing logical connectives, and non-logical symbols ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then if and only if {{math|size=100%|''I''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)...''I''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} have been provided interpreting ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by means of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt; (or any other set of functional complete truth-functions) then the truth-value of {{tmath|I(s)}} is determined entirely by the truth-values of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. of {{math|size=100%|''I''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)...''I''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  In other words, as expected and required, ''S'' is true or false only under an interpretation of all its non-logical symbols.

==Computer science==
Logical operators are implemented as [[logic gate]]s in [[digital circuit]]s. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is [[DRAM]]) are built up from [[logical nand|NAND]], [[logical nor|NOR]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logic gate|transmission gate]]s. NAND and NOR gates with 3 or more inputs rather than the usual 2 inputs are fairly common, although they are logically equivalent to a cascade of 2-input gates. All other operators are implemented by breaking them down into a logically equivalent combination of 2 or more of the above logic gates.

The "logical equivalence" of "NAND alone", "NOR alone", and "NOT and AND" is similar to [[Turing equivalence (theory of computation)|Turing equivalence]].

The fact that all truth functions can be expressed with NOR alone is demonstrated by the [[Apollo guidance computer]].

A '''vocabulary''' is a set of familiar [[words]] within a person's [[language]]. A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for [[communication]] and [[learning|acquiring knowledge]]. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a [[second language]].

== Definition and usage ==

Vocabulary is commonly defined as "all the words known and used by a particular person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88554&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knowing'' a word, however, is not as simple as merely being able to recognize or use it. There are several aspects of word knowledge that are used to measure word knowledge.

=== Productive and receptive knowledge ===

The first major distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve) or receptive (also called receive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person's receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well-known to barely known (see [[Vocabulary#Degree of knowledge|degree of knowledge]] below). A person's receptive vocabulary is the larger of the two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed. In this case, the child's receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but his or her active vocabulary is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child's active vocabulary begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.

Productive vocabulary, therefore, generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary. Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.

=== Degree of knowledge ===
Within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as ''degree of knowledge''. This simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt. Roughly, these stages could be described as:

# Never encountered the word.
# Heard the word, but cannot define it.
# Recognize the word due to context or tone of voice.
# Able to use the word and understand the general and/or intended meaning, but cannot clearly explain it.
# Fluent with the word – its use and definition.

=== Depth of knowledge ===

The differing degrees of word knowledge imply a greater ''depth of knowledge'', but the process is more complex than that. There are many facets to knowing a word, some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by ''degree of knowledge''. Several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept. One such framework includes nine facets:

# [[orthography]] – written form
# [[phonology]] – spoken form
# [[Referent|reference]] – meaning
# [[semantics]] – concept and reference
# [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] – appropriacy of use or cash register
# [[collocation]] – lexical neighbours
# [[word association]]s
# [[syntax]] – grammatical function
# [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] – word parts

=== Definition of word ===
Words can be defined in various ways, and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. The most common definition is that of a lemma (the uninflected or dictionary form; this includes ''walk'', but not ''walks, walked or walking''). Most of the time lemmas do not include proper nouns (names of people, places, companies, etc). Another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family. These are all the words that can be derived from a ground word (e.g., the words ''effortless, effortlessly, effortful, effortfully'' are all part of the word family ''effort''). Estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand, depending on the definition used. &lt;ref&gt;Brysbaert M, Stevens M, Mandera P and Keuleers E (2016) How Many Words Do We Know? Practical Estimates of Vocabulary Size Dependent on Word Definition, the Degree of Language Input and the Participant’s Age. Front. Psychol. 7:1116. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01116 [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01116/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of vocabulary ==

''Listed in order of most ample to most limited:''&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, Clarence L. (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The World Book Dictionary''. Clarence L. Barnhart. 1968 Edition. Published by Thorndike-Barnhart, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reading vocabulary ===

A literate person's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading. This is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening.

=== Listening vocabulary ===

A person's [[listening]] vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech. People may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone, gestures, the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation.

=== Speaking vocabulary ===

A person's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in [[speech]]. It is likely to be a subset of the listening vocabulary. Due to the spontaneous nature of speech, words are often misused. This misuse, though slight and unintentional, may be compensated by facial expressions and tone of voice.

=== Writing vocabulary ===

Words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds. Many written words do not commonly appear in speech. Writers generally use a limited set of words when communicating.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} For example, if there are a number of synonyms, a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use, and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest.

== Focal vocabulary ==

Focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group: those with a particular focus of experience or activity. A lexicon, or vocabulary, is a language's dictionary: its set of names for things, events, and ideas. Some linguists believe that lexicon influences people's perception of things, the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. For example, the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] of Sudan have an elaborate vocabulary to describe cattle. The Nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle's particular histories, economies, and environments{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}. This kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy, as with the number of "[[Eskimo words for snow]]". English speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenkeit&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary growth ==
{{main|Vocabulary development}}
During its infancy, a child instinctively builds a vocabulary. [[Infant]]s imitate words that they hear and then associate those words with objects and actions. This is the [[Vocabulary#Listening vocabulary|listening vocabulary]]. The [[Vocabulary#Speaking vocabulary|speaking vocabulary]] follows, as a child's thoughts become more reliant on his/her ability to self-express without relying on gestures or babbling. Once the [[Vocabulary#Reading vocabulary|reading]] and [[Vocabulary#Writing vocabulary|writing vocabularies]] start to develop, through questions and [[education]], the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language.

In [[first grade]], a child who can read learns about twice as many words as one who cannot. Generally, this gap does not narrow later. This results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six, when an English-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words.&lt;ref&gt;"Vocabulary". Sebastian Wren, Ph.D. BalancedReading.com http://www.balancedreading.com/vocabulary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocabulary grows throughout our entire life. Between the ages of 20 and 60, people learn some 6,000 more lemmas, or one every other day.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; An average 20-year-old knows 42,000 words coming from 11,100 word families; an average 60-year-old knows 48,200 lemmas coming from 13,400 word families.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; People expand their vocabularies by e.g. reading, playing [[word game]]s, and participating in vocabulary-related programs. Exposure to traditional print media teaches correct spelling and vocabulary, while exposure to text messaging leads to more relaxed word acceptability constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type= M. A. |title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints |url=http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/48490/1/2011_Lee_MA.pdf |author=Joan H.

== Vocabulary size ==

=== Native-language vocabulary ===
Estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word, what is to know a word, what sample dictionaries were used, how tests were conducted, and so on.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nation|first1=I.

P.|title=Using dictionaries to estimate vocabulary size: essential, but rarely followed, procedures|journal=Language Testing|date=1993|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27–40|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1993-Vocab-size-dictionaries.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers' vocabularies also vary widely within a language, and are dependent on the level of the speaker's education.

As a result estimates vary from as little as 10,000 to as many as over 50,000 for young adult native speakers of English.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goulden|first1=Robin|last2=Nation|first2=Paul|last3=Read|first3=John|title=How Large Can a Receptive Vocabulary Be?|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=1 December 1990|volume=11|issue=4|pages=341–363|doi=10.1093/applin/11.4.341|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1990-Goulden-Voc-size.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Anna|first1=Catherine|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Eugene|last3=Hall|first3=James|title=Toward a meaningful definition of vocabulary size|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 March 1991|volume=23|issue=1|pages=109–122|doi=10.1080/10862969109547729|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969109547729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milton|first1=James|last2=Treffers-Daller|first2=Jeanine|title=Vocabulary size revisited: the link between vocabulary size and academic achievement|journal=Applied Linguistics Review|date=29 January 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=151-172|doi=10.1515/applirev-2013-0007|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/29879/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One most recent 2016 study shows that 20-year-old English native speakers recognize on average 42,000 [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]], ranging from 27,100 for the lowest 5% of the population to 51,700 lemmas for the highest 5%. These lemmas come from 6,100 word families in the lowest 5% of the population and 14,900 word families in the highest 5%. 60-year-olds know on average 6,000 lemmas more.

According to another, earlier 1995 study junior-high students would be able to recognize the meanings of about 10,000–12,000 words, whereas for college students this number grows up to about 12,000–17,000 and for elderly adults up to about 17,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zechmeister|first1=Eugene|last2=Chronis|first2=Andrea|last3=Cull|first3=William|last4=D'Anna|first4=Catherine|last5=Healy|first5=Noreen|title=Growth of a functionally important lexicon|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 June 1995|volume=27|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1080/10862969509547878|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969509547878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native speakers of German average absolute vocabulary sizes range from 5,900 lemmas in first grade to 73,000 for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segbers|first1=J.|last2=Schroeder|first2=S.|title=How many words do children know?

=== Foreign-language vocabulary ===

==== The effects of vocabulary size on language comprehension ====
The knowledge of the 3000 most frequent English word families or the 5000 most frequent words provides 95% vocabulary coverage of spoken discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adolphs|first1=Svenja|last2=Schmitt|first2=Norbert|title=Lexical Coverage of Spoken Discourse|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2003|volume=24|issue=4|pages=425-438|url=https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/applij/24/4/10.1093/applin/24.4.425/2/240425.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For minimal reading comprehension a threshold of 3,000 [[Word family|word families]] (5,000 lexical items) was suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|editor1-last=Bejoint|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Arnaud|editor2-first=P.|title=Vocabulary and Applied Linguistics|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|pages=126-132|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259810338_How_Much_Lexis_is_Necessary_for_Reading_Comprehension|chapter=How Much Lexis is Necessary for Reading Comprehension?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|last2=Ravenhorst-Kalovski|first2=Geke C.|title=Lexical threshold revisited: Lexical text coverage, learners’ vocabulary size and reading comprehension|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=April 2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–30|url=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/rfl/April2010/articles/laufer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for reading for pleasure 5,000 word families (8,000 lexical items) are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh|first1=D.|last2=Nation|first2=I.S.P.|title=What vocabulary size is needed to read unsimplified texts for pleasure?|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=1992|volume=8|issue=2|pages=689-696|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1992-Hirsh-Vocabulary-reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "optimal" threshold of 8,000 word families yields the coverage of 98% (including proper nouns).&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010" /&gt;

==== Second language vocabulary acquisition ====
Learning vocabulary is one of the first steps in learning a second language, but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition. Whether in one's native language or a second language, the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process. There are many techniques that help one acquire new vocabulary.

==== Memorization ====
Although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring, associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition. By the time students reach adulthood, they generally have gathered a number of personalized memorization methods. Although many argue that memorization does not typically require the complex cognitive processing that increases retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006),&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"&gt;Sagarra, Nuria and Alba, Matthew. (2006). "The Key Is in the Keyword: L2 Vocabulary Learning Methods With Beginning Learners of Spanish". ''The Modern Language Journal'', 90, ii. pp. 228–243.&lt;/ref&gt; it does typically require a large amount of repetition, and [[spaced repetition]] with [[flashcard]]s is an established method for memorization, particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in [[computer-assisted language learning]]. Other methods typically require more time and longer to recall.

Some words cannot be easily linked through association or other methods. When a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language, one often assumes they also share [[semantic similarity|similar meanings]]. Though this is frequently the case, it is not always true. When faced with a [[false friend]], memorization and repetition are the keys to mastery. If a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary, that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends. When large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time, when the learner needs to recall information quickly, when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image, or when discriminating between false friends, rote memorization is the method to use. A neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies, accounting for L1-specific memorization abilities of L2-learners has recently been introduced (Hadzibeganovic and Cannas, 2009).&lt;ref name="novel word learning"&gt;Hadzibeganovic Tarik and Cannas, Sergio A. (2009). "A Tsallis' statistics-based neural network model for novel word learning". ''Physica A'', 388, pp. 732–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Keyword Method ====
One useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method. If time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words, one can create mnemonic devices or word associations. Although these strategies tend to take longer to implement and may take longer in recollection, they create new or unusual connections that can increase retention. The keyword method requires deeper cognitive processing, thus increasing the likelihood of retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; This method uses fits within Paivio's (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, A. (1986). ''Mental Representations: A Dual Coding Approach''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dual coding theory because it uses both verbal and image memory systems. However, this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things. Abstract concepts or words that do not bring a distinct image to mind are difficult to associate. In addition, studies have shown that associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; Older students tend to rely less on creating word associations to remember vocabulary.

=== Word lists ===

Several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication. These include [[Basic English]] (850 words), [[Special English]] (1,500 words), [[General Service List]] (2,000 words), and [[Academic Word List]]. Some [[Advanced learner's dictionary|learner's dictionaries]] have developed [[Defining vocabulary|defining vocabularies]] which contain only most common and basic words. As a result word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaards|first1=Paul|title=The evolution of learners’ dictionaries and ''Merriam-Webster’s Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary''|journal=Kernerman Dictionary News|date=July 2010|issue=18|pages=6-15|url=http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000 Oxford 3000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/learn/clear-definitions.html The Macmillan Defining Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Some publishers produce dictionaries based on word frequency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Frequency-Dictionaries/book-series/RFD Routledge Frequency Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; or thematic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grundwortschatz Langenscheidt Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grund-und-Aufbauwortschatz Langenscheidt Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [https://shop.hueber.de/de/catalogsearch/result/?q=Grundwortschatz Hueber Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;
