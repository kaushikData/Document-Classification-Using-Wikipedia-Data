      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2918">[[Abortion]] '''in the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]],''' a [[United States]] [[territories of the United States|territory]], is illegal per 11 TTC § 51, which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every person who shall [[Crime|unlawfully]] cause the [[miscarriage]] or [[premature labour|premature delivery]] of a woman, with the intent to do so, shall be guilty of [[abortion]] and upon conviction thereof shall be imprisoned for a period of not more than five years.

In a 1971 case, ''[http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/ttr/vol5/5-TTR-549.pdf Trust Territory v. Tarkong]'', the [[Appellate Court]] of the [[Trust Territory]] (see also [[United States territorial court]]) held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as the woman herself is concerned, unless the abortion [[statute]] expressly makes her responsible, it is generally held, although the statute reads any "person", that she is not [[liable]] to any criminal prosecution, whether she [[Solicitation|solicits]] the act or performs it upon herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/ttr/dodvol5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Digest of Cases Reported |publisher=Cnmilaw.org |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tension has existed between [[Statutory interpretation|Interpretation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of [[U.S. federal law]] up against local [[Commonwealth]] law.  However, a recent governor has asserted that until either U.S. federal or [[District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands|local Commonwealth courts]] state otherwise, or unless the [[Northern Mariana Islands#Politics and government|Commonwealth government]] carves out any legal allowances, abortion remains illegal in all circumstances in the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/95ea6e82-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |title=Lang: Abortion is illegal in CNMI - Saipan News, Headlines, Events, Ads |publisher=Saipan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, abortions to save the life of the mother or when [[pregnancy from rape|pregnancy is the result of rape]] or [[incest]] occur without prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/95c9b96c-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |title=Legal opinion backs abortion - Saipan News, Headlines, Events, Ads |publisher=Saipan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Hondurans''' or '''Black Hondurans''', are [[Honduras|Hondurans]] of African descent. They descended from African slaves imported by the Spanish, [[Garifuna people|Garifunas]] and [[Creole peoples]]. The Creole people were originally from [[Jamaica]] and other Caribbean islands and arrived in Honduras between the nineteenth and early twentieth century to work on the export of bananas and in construction.

== Population ==
Afro-Honduran are Hondurans of African descent. They are estimated to be 3% population of the country. Those brought during colonial times mixed with Indians and Spanish, the Garifuna, and the Bay Island Creoles.
According to the CIA, the ethnic group makeup in Honduras are 90% mestizo, 7% Amerindian, 2% black, and 1% white.

== History ==
[[File:Pancarta Afro Hondureño por Richard Weiss.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Banner at Carnival de La Ceiba]]
One of the first African slaves who arrived in Honduras, Juan Bardales, participated in the Spanish conquest of the province, especially in [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]]. Shortly thereafter, Berdales was awarded with his freedom. In Honduras, slaves played an important role in the mining industry. Many of them came from Africa, from places like [[Angola]] or [[Senegambia]], while others came from the [[Caribbean]]. In 1542, 165 slaves came via Portugal and 150 from Santo Domingo.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"&gt;

By the mid-sixteenth century, between 1000 and 1500 enslaved blacks worked in the gold washings of [[Olancho]], slaves who possibly hailed from Africa. In Honduras, for 1590, arrived in Olancho and at [[Rio Guayape]] three hundred Africans for work in mining. A crew of Angolas worked in the mines and businesses in San Miguel. Although many mulattoes and browns also worked in [[Tegucigalpa]] for the same dates. Between 1750 and 1779, a larger group of African slaves, [[Carabali]] and  [[mondongo]]s (a [[Kongo people|Kongo]] tribe) people, were taken to Honduras to build the military fort [[San Fernando de Omoa]], the most important in the region.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

In 1796, approximately 300 "French black" from the French colony of [[Saint Domingue]] came to Trujillo, in the context of the conflict that gave rise to the independence of [[Haiti]]. In 1797, the British exported between 2,000 and 4,000 [[Black Caribs]] - mixture of Carib Indians and African Blacks - to the island o [[Roatán]] in Honduras, because they rebelled against them on the [[Saint Vincent (island)|island St. Vincent]]. After this, these Garifuna, as called themselves, migrated to Trujillo and from there, scattered along the coasts of all the Central American mainland until [[Costa Rica]] (without reaching this place), especially by the persecutions to which they were subjected by the Spanish authorities. Some of them were involved in the civil wars of the time.&lt;ref name="1schafferMan"/&gt;

In the late eighteenth century records tell of significant percentages of blacks and mulattoes in Tegucigalpa. But at the end of the colonial period, slaves were already mainly mulattoes. Between the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, the British introduced black slaves from [[Jamaica]], [[Cayman Island]] and [[Belize]] in Honduras.&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013042852/http://www.caratula.net/Archivo/N17-0407/Secciones/Critica/critica-negros%20o%20creoles%20en%20Honduras.html LOS NEGROS INGLESES, O CREOLES DE HONDURAS: ETNOHISTORIA, RACISMO, NACIONALISMO Y CONSTRUCCIÓN DE IMAGINARIOS NACIONALES EXCLUYENTES EN HONDURAS] (in Spanish: BLACKS English, or Creoles OF HONDURAS: ETHNOHISTORY, racism, nationalism and exclusionary national IMAGINARY CONSTRUCTION IN HONDURAS). Posted by Dr. Jorge Alberto Amaya. Retrieved January 30, 2013, to 14:20 pm.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luis Pedro Taracena, in these years, Tegucigalpa was populated by 80% [[mulatto]]es and this percentage was increasing over time, at least until 1815 (when they were 86% of the population). During the twentieth century, mulattoes and browns were progressively neutralized under the category of "[[Ladino people|Ladino]]". According to historian Marbin Barahona, racial mixture enters blacks with whites and [[Amerindians]] occurred since the 1520s, due to the decline of the indigenous population, the Spanish immigration scanty and meager arrival of African slaves. The recovery of the hegemony of silver and indigo, the prohibition of non-indigenous groups live in Indian villages and the population growth recorded in the same century, miscegenation, primarily among Amerindian and Spanish, not only increased significantly at this time but concentrated in certain regions, especially in the current [[Francisco Morazán Department]], and Chaluteca and Comayagua departments.

These departments attracted all kinds of mixed race ([[mestizo]], mulatto, [[pardo]], Ladino, etc.), unlike the indigenous concentration departments west. In 1775, lived in San Fernando de Omoa between 300 and 400 Africans and about 75 white families. They remained there until the early nineteenth century. So, in the late eighteenth century, the Spanish origin population would have been a minority compared to the racially mixed populations ("Ladino").

The Spanish Crown considered to Ladinos as those subjects of the Crown, originally non-Hispanics, and they learned the official languages of the empire or [[Vulgar Latin]]. In the Americas the Ladinos were often identified as those groups nonwhites who were Amerindian or Spanish - speaking (and most people who were not white or Amerindians in the Americas at the time were mestizos and Afro descendants), including possibilities such as "black ladino," "mulatto Ladin", etc. According to Barahona, Ladinos were the majority of the population in 1800 (60% of the population).

According to Linda Newton, if we use the census of 1804, the Indians were almost 50% of the population, making Ladinos in a group of between 40% and 45% of the population.

Because these days, most African - Hondurans were mulatto, sambo and browns. Although in the seventeenth century, had five categories in the census of Spanish America, "white", "Indians", "mestizos", "black" and "mulatto", already in the eighteenth century, the last three categories alone in a bind: "Ladino". During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Spanish authorities considered Honduran even entire regions populated mostly as mulatto, sambo or brown. Such is the case of places like Olancho, [[Yoro]], [[Colón Department (Honduras)|Colon]] and [[Atlántida, Honduras|Atlántida]], regions that eventually could have remixed with whites, Amerindians and mestizos.

It was in the early nineteenth century when slavery was abolished in Honduras and after 1820 the Afro-Hondurans were simply considered citizens and obtained the rights of any citizen to be excluded from the category of "free blacks" perhaps because the General [[Francisco Ferrera]], Honduran politician who was part of the government of Honduras at the time, had ancestors mulattoes. Anyway, he decreed the expulsion of the country's Garifuna (but ultimately this is not carried out).&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

The Honduran historian, Antonio Canelas Diaz says that by the year 1870, was organized in the city of [[La Ceiba]] - the point where, emerged on a large scale banana production in Honduras - a company called "New Orleans and Bay Island Company" whose executives, imported the first black Creoles hired by fruit, since they were a labor" [...] more qualified than the Honduran "in banana cultivation, and who had previously worked in their respective nations that sector. Other black anglophone contingents arrived in Honduras with the arrival of black workers from Jamaica and other English-speaking islands arrived to work for the banana transnationals.&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"/&gt;

In 1931, the Alfonso Guillen Zelaya Honduran intellectual, raised the huge black presence on the north coast and the fear that if increased which what he called the "black import" Honduras ended up being a country of mulatto, however, already then, the country was mostly mestizo and indigenous population had been growing over the years.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

== Demography ==
The African Cultural legacy is evident in some places of Honduras. In Trujillo held certain dance parties, whose dancers carry specific masks. Both the dance and the masks are of Mandinka kangkurao origin.&lt;ref name="1schafferMan"/&gt; In addition to the Afro-Hondurans that descended of slaves imported by the Spanish, there others two Afro communities in Honduras, also present en Nicaragua y Guatemala: Creoles and Garifuna.

=== Creoles ===
British blacks or Creoles arrived with the introduction of African slaves to Jamaica, Cayman and Belize by the British during the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, and by the immigration of black workers from Jamaica, Cayman island, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and other English-speaking islands, arrived in the early twentieth century to work in transnational banana companies, workers in the construction of railways, dockworkers and in some cases "scabs", are concentrated mainly in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]], especially the [[Roatan Island]] and [[Guanaja]] and some Caribbean coastal Honduran cities like [[Puerto Cortes]], [[Tela]] and [[La Ceiba]].&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"/&gt;

In the 2000s, some Creoles have migrated to the major cities of [[Tegucigalpa]], [[San Pedro Sula]] and other urban centers in the interior. Like the Garifuna, many work as sailors and emigrated to the United States or [[Grand Cayman Island]] with which there are strong trade and cultural relations. Over time, blacks brought by the British were learning the customs and the English language, which managed to keep up today. Like white citizens, long blacks were not considered as Hondurans. Although the Bay Islands were eventually recognized as Honduran territory by the British in 1861, by the Treaty "Wike-Cross", in 1904, people still continued to believe that these lands were English possessions.&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"/&gt;

Even in the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Gen. [[Tiburcio Carías Andino|Tiburcio Carias]] (1933-1949), many islanders be Honduran nationals refused, and still clinging to their English traditions, practicing the Protestant religion and speaking only English. As shown, this process represents the first contingent of blacks settled in British Honduras, which was a result of the transfer of slaves from the British to the Bay Islands and some places of the Honduran coast between the late eighteenth and mid-century.&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"/&gt;

Over time, the black English, originally came with the illusion of wealth and then return to their countries, they fell in Honduras and evidently were acquiring some Honduran customs, but in essence, they brought many manifestations of their lands, as religion, music, traditions and language in many cases, are still preserved and that makes therefore constitute a distinct ethnic group from the rest of the Honduran population, however, naturally feel today Hondurans and, in fact, a major instances by which have been "integrating" the Honduran has been through sport. Indeed, many black British have been in recent decades some major national athletes, especially in football clubs and the national team of Honduras, but also have excelled in other sports such as athletics, baseball and basketball. Finally, many black British, before the decline of the banana industry and the emergence of other productive sectors, were emigrating from the 1950s to the United States and enrolled as marine commercial fishing fleets throughout the Caribbean.
Currently, it is estimated that the number of black English or Creole is around 32,000 people.&lt;ref name="NEGROS INGLESES"/&gt;

=== Garifunas ===
In 1797, the British exported between 2,000 and 4,000 [[Black Caribs]] - mixture of Carib Indians and Black Africans - to the island of [[Roatán]] in Honduras, because they rebelled against them on the [[Saint Vincent (island)|island St. Vincent]]. While the British ships that carried to Black Caribes to the island addressed her, the Spanish captured one of the British ships, bringing it to [[Trujillo, Honduras]] where the Garifunas were released. In addition, the Spanish captured others 1,700 Garifunas on the island of Roatan and they taken him to Trujillo where they lacked manpower, the Garifuna people were regarded as skillful for crops, so they went to work and prospered enough in Trujillo, some of these were recruited by the Spanish army where they served with distinction. &lt;ref Name="sedinafroh"&gt;[http://sedinafroh.gob.hn/index.php/garifuna Secretaría de Estado en los despachos de pueblos indígenas y afrohondureños.

Government of the Republic of Honduras: cultural characterization of the Garifuna people)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Garifunas of Trujillo, especially due to the persecutions to which they were subjected by the Spanish authorities, emigrated and be scattered were them along the coasts of all the Central American mainland until [[Costa Rica]] (without reaching this place),&lt;ref name="1schafferMan"/&gt; More later, because to great resentment against the Spanish, others many Garifuna fled to the coast of [[Belize]] where already lived other Garifunas.&lt;ref Name="sedinafroh"/&gt; It is this migration that is celebrated annually on November 19 as Garifuna Settlement Day, and is the largest celebration of this community. Some of them were involved in the civil wars of the time.

During the twentieth century, some Garifuna have worked on American and British boats during [[World War II]] and traveled by the world. As a result of these trips, there are now Garifuna small communities in [[Los Angeles]], [[New Orleans]] and [[New York City]] who send monthly remittances to Honduras worth $360,000.

The Garifuna culture is very strong, with great emphasis on music, dance and history. They have their own religion, the Dugu, consisting of a mixture of Catholicism and African and Caribbean beliefs.

Today the Garifuna in Honduras struggling not to be deprived of their lands on the coast for tourism enterprises and try to keep their customs and culture at all costs. Garifuna music, [[Punta]] (tip), is a very rhythmic music, accompanied by fast-paced sensual dance with a lot of hip movement. This music has been released recently by bands mostly Hondurans, including the most famous: Kazabe, Garifuna Kids, [[Banda Blanca]], Silver Star and los Roland. Especially the song [[Sopa de Caracol]], of Kazabe has popularized this music internationally. Is difficult to determine the exact number of English-speaking black Garifunas because in the last decades the ethnic category has not been considered in national population censuses.&lt;ref Name="eripere"&gt;[http://www.eripere.com/html/garifuna.html Eripere: Garífunas]. Retrieved January 30, 2012, to 15:35pm&lt;/ref&gt; The Garifunas have formed 47 communities in the departments of [[Cortés, Honduras|Cortes]], Atlantis, Bay Islands, Colon and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias a Dios]].&lt;ref Name="sedinafroh"/&gt;
On April 12 of each year marks the day of Garifuna ethnic recalling his arrival in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rds.hn/index.php?documento=2295 Garífunas celebran hoy su llegada a Honduras] (in Spanish: Garifunas celebrate today his arrival in Honduras). Posted by Lisseth García&lt;/ref&gt;

====Naming controversy====
In March 2014, members of the Garifuna community made a formal complaint to the public prosecutor's office concerning the use of the term Afro when relating to members of the Garifuna community by the state of Honduras, claiming the term “afrohondureño” (Afro-Honduran in English) is incorrect because black people in Honduras were born there and are citizens of the country as much as members of other races. They claim such a term is being used to end the ethnic identity of the 46 communities which live along the Atlantic north coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tiempo.hn/portada/noticias/honduras-garifunas-se-quejan-contra-el-estado-por-llamarlos-%E2%80%9Cafro%E2%80%9D Honduras: Garífunas se quejan contra el Estado por llamarlos “afro”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306122224/http://tiempo.hn/portada/noticias/honduras-garifunas-se-quejan-contra-el-estado-por-llamarlos-%E2%80%9Cafro%E2%80%9D |date=March 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Akan''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|æ|n}}) are a [[meta-ethnicity]] predominantly speaking [[Central Tano languages]] and residing in the southern regions of the former [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast region]] in what is today the nation of [[Ghana]]. Akans who historically migrated from Ghana also make up a plurality of the populace in the [[Ivory Coast]]. They also live in smaller numbers across borders in the countries of Benin, Togo and Burkina Faso. The [[Akan language]] (also known as ''Twi/Fante'') is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the [[Potou–Tano languages|Potou–Tano subfamily]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]].&lt;ref&gt;Languages of the Akan area: papers in Western Kwa linguistics and on the linguistic geography of the area of ancient. Isaac K. Chinebuah, H. Max J. Trutenau, Linguistic Circle of Accra, Basler Afrika Bibliographien, 1976, pp. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgroups of the Akan proper include:
* [[Ashanti people|Asante]], Akuapem, Akwamu,  and [[Akyem]] (together known as [[Twi]]), [[Agona]], [[Kwahu]], [[Wassa]], [[Fante people|Fante]] (Fanti or Mfantse: Anomabo, Abura, Gomua) and [[Abron tribe|Bono]].
* Subgroups of the Bia-speaking groups include: the [[Anyi people|Anyin]], [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]], [[Chakosi people|Chakosi]] (Anufo), [[Sefwi people|Sefwi]] (Sehwi), [[Nzema people|Nzema]], [[Ahanta people|Ahanta]] and [[Jwira-Pepesa language|Jwira-Pepesa]]. The Akan subgroups have cultural attributes in common, notably the tracing of matrilineal descent, inheritance of property, and succession to high political office.

Akan culture can also be found in the New World. A number of Akans were taken as captives to the Americas. Roughly ten-percent of all slave ships embarked from the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]. The Akan's economy primary source of wealth was gold. However, as wars culminated in the region the capture and sale of Akan people into the slave trade peaked during the [[Fante Confederacy|Fante]] and [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] conflicts (as both sides sold a large number of their captives) as prisoners of war. Akan conflicts led to a high number of military captives being sold into slavery known then as "[[Coromantee]]". These soldiers and other Akan captives were notorious for a large number of slave revolts and plantation resistance tactics. These captives were feared throughout the Americas so much so that we can see their legacy within groups such as the Maroons of the Caribbean and South America.

==Origin and ethnogenesis==
{{Akans}}
Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa into the forest region around the 11th century, and many Akans tell their history as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akuapem.com/akwamu.html Akwamu]. akuapem.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Oral traditions of the ruling Abrade (Aduana) Clan relate that they originated from ancient [[Ghana]]. They migrated from the north, they went through Egypt and settled in Nubia (Sudan). Around 500AD (5th century), due to the pressure exerted on [[Nubia]] by the Axumite kingdom of Ethiopia, Nubia was shattered, and the Akan people moved west and established small trading kingdoms. These kingdoms grew, and around 750AD the [[Ghana Empire]] was formed. The Empire lasted from 750AD to 1200AD and collapsed as a result of the introduction of Islam in the Western Sudan, and the zeal of the Muslims to impose their religion, their ancestors eventually left for Kong (i.e. present day Ivory Coast). From Kong they moved to Wam and then to Dormaa (both located in present-day [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo region]]). The movement from Kong was necessitated by the desire of the people to find suitable [[savannah]] conditions since they were not used to [[forest]] life. Around the 14th century, they moved from [[Dormaa Municipal District|Dormaa]] South Eastwards to [[Twifo/Heman/Lower Denkyira District|Twifo-Hemang]], North West [[Cape Coast]]. This move was commercially motivated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://akuapem.com/akwamu.html Akwamu]. akuapem.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom of [[Bonoman]] (or [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]]) was established as early as the 12th century,.&lt;ref&gt;The Techiman-Bono of [[Ghana]]:an ethnography of an Akan society Kendall/Hunt Pub.

During different phases of the Kingdom of [[Bonoman]], groups of Akans migrated out of the area to create numerous states based predominantly on gold mining and trading of cash crops.&lt;ref&gt;Africa from the 12th to the 16th century Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Djibril Tamsir Niane, James Currey, 1997, 294 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indigenous medicine and knowledge in African society.

==History==
From the 15th century to the 19th century (and possibly even earlier) the Akan people dominated gold mining and trading in the region; from the 17th century on, they were among the most powerful groups in Africa.&lt;ref name="penn.museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/long-term-exhibits/259-african-gallery.html |title=Africa Gallery |publisher=Penn Museum |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The African heritage, Volume 3 Zimbabwe Pub. House, 1999 - History - 180 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Akan goldfields]], according to Peter Bakewell, were the "highly [[gold mining|auriferous]] area in the forest country between the [[Komoe River|Komoe]] and [[Volta River|Volta]] rivers.&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book| author=Wilks, Ivor.

[[File:Akan Gold Weight MHNT bovid head.jpg|thumb|Cast brass weights used to measure precise amounts of gold dust. Weights in this system were developed in the seventeenth century. These weights are from the nineteenth century.]]
This wealth in gold attracted European traders. Initially, the Europeans were Portuguese, soon joined by the Dutch and the British in their quest for Akan gold. Akan states waged wars on neighboring states in their geographic area to capture people and sell them as slaves to Europeans (Portuguese) who subsequently sold the enslaved people along with guns to Akan states in exchange for Akan gold.&lt;ref name="modernghana"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.modernghana.com/GhanaHome/ashanti/ashanti.asp?menu_id=6&amp;sub_menu_id=67&amp;gender=&amp;s=a|title=Asante (Ashanti) History Much of the modern nation of Ghana|work=modernghana.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akan gold was also used to purchase slaves from further up north via the Trans-Saharan route. The Akan purchased slaves in order to help clear the dense forests within [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]].&lt;ref name="modernghana"/&gt; About a third of the population of many Akan states were indentured servants ([[i.e.]] Non-Akan peoples). The Akans went from buyers of slaves to selling slaves as the dynamics in the Gold Coast and the [[New World]] changed. Thus, the Akan people played a role in supplying Europeans with indentured servants, who were later enslaved for the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp|author=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=Ending the Slavery Blame-Game|accessdate=2012-03-26 |archiveurl = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Ghana apologized to the descendants of slaves for the role some of its people may have played in the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/102692/1/ghana-apologizes-to-slaves-descendants.html|title=Ghana apologizes to slaves' descendants| work=modernghana.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akan people, especially the [[Ashanti people]], fought against European colonists and defeated them on several occasions to maintain autonomy. This occurred during the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]]: the [[war of the Golden Stool]], and other similar battles.&lt;ref name="penn.museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Non-western theories of development: regional norms versus global trends'', Harcourt Brace College Pub., 1999, 179 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1900s all of Ghana was a colony or protectorate of the British while the lands in the Ivory Coast were under the French. On 6 March 1957, following the decolonization from the British under the leadership of [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the Gold Coast was joined to [[British Togoland]], and the [[Northern Region, Ghana|Northern region]], [[Upper East Region|Upper East region]] and [[Upper West Region|Upper West region]] of the Gold Coast to form Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/holidays.shtml |title=United Nations member States - General Information |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory Coast gained independence on 7 August 1960.

==Akan polity==

The Akans consider themselves one nation. Akan means first, foremost, and references the enlightened and Civilized. While traditionally matrilineal; they are also united philosophically through 12 patrilineal spirit groups called the [[Ntoro]] or ''egya-bosom.'' Within this nation are branches based on many dialects, widest (and possibly the oldest) one used is Twi. Each branch subsequently holds a collection of states and stemming from city-states. The state or ''Aman'' is typically ruled by several kings known as ''Ahenfo''. The state is the basic unit of Akan polity. Several states and city-states can band together to form a Confederacy or an empire regardless of clan or [[abusua]] they belong to, while those outside of the Akan tribe or the abusua were usually conquered or annexed via war or mutual agreement. For example, the Guan state of Larteh and the Akyem state of Akropong joined together to form the Akwapim Kingdom to avoid the Akwamu, who the Guan deemed as oppressive. Under the State there are Divisions and under these Divisions are towns and villages.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanteman.org/amamere.html|title=Amamere|work=asanteman.org|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akan kings are ranked according to their jurisdiction. The head of an inter-clan Confederacy is usually considered a King, as in the Kings of Ashanti, Akyem and the Akwapim. Under these are the heads of the constituent states who equates an [[Emperor]] that only heads an [[Empire]] (for e.g. [[Asante Empire]] and the [[Denkyira Empire|Denkyira]]). In Asante's case, as an Empire the Asantehene reigned over non-Oyoko clan city states and ruled over the kings of those states as an Imperial head or Emperor (a hardly used but rightful equivalent term as Emperor literally mean ''king of kings''.) But right Next, there are divisional Chiefs, they are primarily arranged according to the five divisions of an Akan army. The Akan army or [[Asafo]] formation resembles a cross or an aeroplane. The battle formation has the Frontline, the West Flank, an East Flank, the main body and the Vanguard. There are therefore five divisional chiefs in each Paramountcy. These are followed in rank by the Kings of the city and then the Kings of the town and then king of the suburbs.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

The Akan tribe mostly have seven Abusua (matrilineal clans) in each state. They do not have the same names in each state but each has an equivalent clan (for e.g. in Fante areas along the coast, the Asante clan of Oyoko is referred to as Dehyena or Yokofo). The clans are assigned States which they rule by virtue of their status as founders of that jurisdiction. The Ashanti Kingdom is ruled by the Oyoko Clan. However the Bretuo or Twidanfo(in Fante) as well as other clans rule States, Divisions, Towns and Villages within the Kingdom. The Fante-speaking tribes usually have the Asona Clan ruling most of their States(like Mankessim). Certain sub-clans or lineages have exclusive rights to some stools within Akanland such as the lineage of Afia Kobi in the Oyoko Clan who alone sit on the Golden Stool of Asante.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

The Akans are traditionally a Matrilineal people of the African continent. Matrilineal inheritance makes it easier to trace the line of succession. Within each lineage or House are the branches. The chief of a family is called an ''Abusuapanin'' (or family-elder). Ranking above a family chief(a family's Abusuapanin) is the clan's chief(or clan's Abusuapanin). These branches are called Jaase or literally Kitchens. Each Kitchen takes its turn to present a candidate for the stool to the kingmakers of the lineage. Once accepted their candidate rules till death. This means until all the Jaase have presented their candidates they have to wait their turn.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

Akan Kings of whatever rank have other noblemen who serve them as Sub-Chiefs. These sub-chiefs do not have hereditary titles and therefore do not have black stools. In addition each King has a female co-ruler known as the [[Queen mothers (Africa)|Queenmother]]. The Queen-mother is more like a figurehead representing the King's or Emperor's eldest sister and hence the mother of the next King or Emperor, she could rule as a King if she wishes (e.g. queen-mothers mainly from the House of Asona clan: [[Nana (title)|Nana]] Abena Boaa who ruled Offinso 1610-1640, Nana Afia Dokuaa who ruled Akyem Abuakwa 1817-1835, and Nana [[Yaa Asantewaa]] who ruled Edweso 1896-1900) . They present the candidate for consideration as King. An assistant king does not have a Queenmother as his title is not hereditary.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

A Prince or Daakyehene (lit ''Future-king'') is any of the members of the lineage eligible to sit on a stool. However, not all the noblemen or noblewomen are Princes as some may be ineligible. A prince is not necessarily the son of a King but rather the former King's nephew on the mother's side. As such nobles strive to achieve the position of prince in their families or for their children.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

A sub-chief does not however need to be a nobleman. He only has to be suitable for the position he is to occupy. Some sub-chieftaincy positions can be abolished at will. They include the heads of the ruling house or Mankrado, the Linquist, the Chief Kingmaker or Jaasehene, the Supi or General of the Army, the Captains of the Army or Asafohene among others.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

The way Akans ruled their nation fascinated the tribes of other West African nations and as the Akans conquered or formed alliances with these nations parts of it was transmitted to them. The British particularly felt the Akan system was highly efficient and tried to establish it throughout their dominions in West Africa using the Indirect Rule System. The Ewes and the Ga-Adangmes with their close affinity to the Akans have modified certain aspects of it to fit their societies.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

In Ghana and other modern states where the Akan tribe is located the Kings, Assistant Kings, Princes and Noblemen of the Akans serve mostly a symbolic role. Modern politics has side-lined them in national politics although it is common to find that an elected or appointed official to be of Akan royalty. And, especially in the villages and poor areas, traditional Kings are still very important for organizing development, social services and keeping peace. Some Kings have decided to push ahead with the leadership of their Kingdoms and States in a non-political fashion. The Asantehene and Okyehene have emphasized Education and Environmental Sustainability respectively. Others push the national government and its agents to fulfill promises to their people.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

In modern Ghana a quasi-legislative/judicial body known as the House of "Chiefs"(a colonial term to belittle African Kings because of the racist belief to not equate an African king with a European king in rank) has been established to oversee "chieftaincy" and the Government of Ghana as the British Government once did certifies the Chiefs and gazettes them. Several Akan Kings sit at the various levels of the National House of "Chiefs". Each Paramountcy has a Traditional Council, then there is the Regional House of "Chiefs" and lastly the National House of "Chiefs". Akan Kings who once warred with each other and Kings of other nations within Ghana now sit with them to build peace and advocate development for their nations.&lt;ref name="asanteman.org"/&gt;

==Akan subgroups and meta-ethnic identity==

The Akan people comprise the following subgroups: [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] (the largest Akan [[ethnic group]]), [[Abinghi]], [[Abbé people|Abbe]], [[Abidji people|Abidji]], Aboure, Adjukru, [[Ahafo]], Ahanta, Akuapem, [[Akwamu]], [[Akye]], [[Akyem]], Alladian, [[Anyi people|Anyi]], [[Aowin]], [[Assin]], [[Attie]], [[Avatime people|Avatime]], [[Avikam people|Avikam]], [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]], [[Abron tribe|Abron]], [[Chakosi people|Chokosi]], [[Denkyira]], [[Ehotile]], [[Evalue people|Evalue]], [[Fante people|Fante]] (the second largest Akan [[ethnic group]]), [[Kwahu]], [[M'Bato]], [[Nzema people|Nzema]], Sefwi, [[Tchaman]], Twifu and [[Wassa]].&lt;ref name="factbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twi.bb/akan.php |title=Online Twi Dictionary - The Akan People |publisher=twi.bb |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of an Akan nation or meta-ethnicity is expressed by the term ''Akanman''.
The Akan word ''ɔman'' (''plural Aman'') which forms the second element in this expression has a meaning much of "community, town; nation, state". ''ɔman/Aman'' has been translated as "Akanland" ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTwuAQAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=The Society |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Akan face.jpg|thumb|17th Century Akan Terracotta – [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Akan culture is one of the traditional [[matrilineal]] cultures of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide'', Philip Briggs, Katherine Rushton Bradt Travel Guides, 2007, 416 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akan art]] is wide-ranging and renowned, [[Especially for Youth|especially]] for the tradition of crafting bronze goldweights, using the [[lost-wax casting]] method. The Akan culture reached South America, Caribbean, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;"Man Ray, African art, and the modernist lens", Wendy Grossman, Martha Ann Bari, Letty Bonnell, ''International Arts &amp; Artists'', 2009 - Photography, 183 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of their most important mythological stories are called ''anansesem'', literally meaning "the spider story", but in a figurative sense also meaning "traveler's tales". These "spider stories" are sometimes also referred to as ''nyankomsem'': "words of a sky god". The stories generally, but not always, revolve around [[Anansi|Kwaku Ananse]], a trickster spirit, often depicted as a spider, human, or a combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;''A Treasury of African Folklore: the oral literature, traditions, myths, legends, epics, tales, recollections, wisdom, sayings, and humor of Africa'', Crown Publishers, 1975, 617 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of Akan culture also include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;''Facets of Ghanaian culture'' African Studies, Jerry Bedu-Addo, 1989. 68 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Akan Weights and the Gold Trade'', Longman, 1980. 393 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sankofa:

==Concepts of Akan philosophy and inheritance==

These are the basic concepts of Akan philosophy and inheritance:

*''[[Abusua]]'' (''mogya'') – What an Akan inherits from his mother  
*''[[Ntoro]]'' – What an Akan gets from his father, but one does not belong to a ''Ntoro''; instead one belongs to one's ''Abusua'' 
*''[[Sunsum]]'' – What an Akan develops from interaction with the world
*''[[Kra (Mythology)|Kra]]'' – What an Akan gets from ''Onyame/Nyame'' (God)&lt;ref&gt;L'homme, Volume 7 École pratique des hautes études (France). Section des sciences économiques et sociales École pratique des hautes études, Section des sciences économiques et sociales, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matrilineality===
Many but not all of the Akan still&lt;ref name=2001book&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fmf5UqZzbvoC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Abusua&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iTRaTdj1N8P7lweKm7XfDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abusua&amp;f=false de Witte, Marleen (2001). ''Long Live the Dead!: changing funeral celebrations in Asante, Ghana''. Published by Het Spinhuis.] {{ISBN|90-5260-003-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; practice their traditional matrilineal customs, living in their traditional [[extended family]] households. The traditional Akan economic and political organization is based on matrilineal ''lineages'', which are the basis of inheritance and succession.  A ''lineage'' is defined as all those related by [[matrilineal descent]] from a particular ancestress. Several lineages are grouped into a political unit headed by a council of elders, each of whom is the elected head of a lineage – which itself may include multiple extended-family households.

Public offices are thus vested in the lineage, as are land tenure and other lineage property. In other words, lineage property is inherited only by matrilineal kin.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyBr&gt;Busia, Kofi Abrefa (1970). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1970. William Benton, publisher, The [[University of Chicago]]. {{ISBN|0-85229-135-3}}, Vol. 1, p. 477. (This Akan article was written by Kofi Abrefa Busia, formerly professor of Sociology and Culture of Africa at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]], Netherlands.)&lt;/ref&gt; Each lineage controls the lineage land farmed by its members, functions together in the veneration of its ancestors, supervises marriages of its members, and settles internal disputes among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Owusu-Ansah, David (Nov1994). http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+gh0048%29, "Ghana: The Akan Group". This source, "Ghana", is one of the Country Studies available from the US Library of Congress. Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/61M7J7JwT on 31Aug11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political units above are likewise grouped (into traditionally seven) but as of today eight larger groups called ''[[abusua]]'': Aduana, Agona, Asakyiri, Asenie, Asona, Bretuo, Ekuona and Oyoko. The members of each such ''abusua'' are united by their belief that they are all descended from the same ancient ancestress – so marriage between members of the same group (or ''abusua'') is forbidden, a taboo on marriage. One inherits, or is a lifelong member of, the lineage, the political unit and the ''abusua'' of one's mother, regardless of one's gender or marriage. Members and their spouses thus belong to different ''abusuas'', with mother and children living and working in one household, but their husband/father living and working in a different household.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyBr /&gt;

According to one source&lt;ref name="com.au"&gt;ashanti.com.au (before 2010). http://ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html, "Ashanti Home Page". Archived at WebCite https://www.webcitation.org/5xVwnX0ie?url=http://ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html on 28Mar11.&lt;/ref&gt; of information about the Akan, "A man is strongly related to his mother's brother (wɔfa) but only weakly related to his father's brother.  This must be viewed in the context of a [[polygamous]] society in which the mother/child bond is likely to be much stronger than the father/child bond. As a result, in inheritance, a man's nephew (his sister's son) (wɔfase) will have priority over his own son. Uncle-nephew relationships therefore assume a dominant position."&lt;ref name="com.au" /&gt;

"The principles governing inheritance, generation and age – that is to say, men come before women and seniors before juniors."... When a woman's brothers are available, a consideration of generational seniority stipulates that the line of brothers be exhausted before the right to inherit lineage property passes down to the next senior genealogical generation of sisters' sons. Finally, "it is when all possible male heirs have been exhausted that the females" may inherit.&lt;ref name="com.au" /&gt;

Certain other aspects of the Akan culture are determined [[patrilineally]] rather than matrilineally. There are ancestrally 12 patrilineal ''[[Ntoro]]'' (spirit) groups, and everyone belongs to his or her father's ''Ntoro'' group, but not to his family lineage and ''abusua''.  Each ''Ntoro'' group has its own surnames,&lt;ref&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 55 shows such surnames in a [[family tree]], which provides a useful example of names.&lt;/ref&gt; taboos, ritual purifications and forms of etiquette.&lt;ref name=encyBr /&gt;  A person thus inherits one's ''Ntoro'' from one's father, but does not belong to his family.

A recent (2001) book&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt; provides an update on the Akan, stating that some families are changing from the above ''abusua'' structure to the [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref name="de Witte 2001, p. 53"&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Housing, childcare, education, daily work, and elder care etc. are then handled by that individual family, rather than by the ''abusua'' or clan, especially in the city.&lt;ref&gt;de Witte (2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The above taboo on marriage within one's ''abusua'' is sometimes ignored, but "clan membership" is still important,&lt;ref name="de Witte 2001, p. 53"/&gt; with many people still living in the ''abusua'' framework presented above.&lt;ref name=2001book /&gt;

===Akan influence===
Elements of Akan culture can generally be seen in many geographic areas.
Specific elements of Akan culture are especially seen in neighboring African peoples and some Central African populations. Akan culture has also been historically important in the New World, where Akan names are or were common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newbooksinafroamstudies.com/2011/06/09/kwasi-konadu-the-akan-diaspora-in-the-americas-oxford-up-2010/ |title=Kwasi Konadu, "The Akan Diaspora in the Americas" (Oxford UP, 2010) |publisher=Newbooksinafroamstudies.com |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example among the [[Coromantins]] of Jamaica, South and North America, Barbados, and the [[1733 slave insurrection on St. John|descendants of the Akwamu in St. John]]. [[Cuffy (Guyanese rebel)|Kofi]], the leader of the 1763 [[slave revolt]] and [[Violent Revolution|violent revolt]] against the Dutch people in Guyana was an Akan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4048">'''Al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani''' (922? – July 11, 1003) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who briefly reestablished a comprehensive [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] realm in the years 999–1002.

==Early activities==

Al-Qasim bin Ali was a [[Sayyid]] from Tarj in the Khath'am region (present-day south-western [[Saudi Arabia]]). His year of birth is (doubtfully) given as 922 or 928. He was a great-great-grandson of al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860), a key figure in the emerging of the [[Zaydiyyah]] brand of [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;The line of descent is: al-Qasim ar-Rassi – Abu Abdallah Muhammad – Abdallah – Ali – al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a reputation for religious learning from early age. For decades, Zaidi figures from Yemen visited him and asked him to intervene in the Yemeni highland. After the death of the Zaidi imam [[An-Nasir Ahmad (Zaidi imam)|an-Nasir Ahmad]] in 934, political conditions had been unstable in the Zaydiyyah-influenced areas. In 993, al-Qasim proclaimed the imamate in [[Tihamah]], but his movement was defeated in the next year by the governor of [[Mecca]]. Still, the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]] treated al-Qasim with respect and courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VI, Leiden 1991, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imam in Yemen==

Al-Qasim invaded Yemen in 997 or 998 and appropriated [[Sa'dah]], the traditional capital of the Zaydiyyah domain. As imam he was known as al-Mansur a-Qasim. He subsequently returned to Tarj, and his power in Yemen immediately crumbled. He then returned again, permanently, in 999. This time he was able to extend his power over an extensive area from Bilad Khath to [[San'a]]. However, he could not secure an outlet to the sea, and the lowland of Yemen was subjected to the [[Ziyadid dynasty]] in [[Zabid]]. Al-Mansur al-Qasim resided in Iyyan (Ayyan), south-east of Sad'ah, and therefore became known as al-Iyyani. He called on certain tribes to perform military service. One of his adherents composed a poem which emphasized the enthusiastic response among the tribesmen, and the role of the imam as a restorer: "Rise and lead the people, and send them with justice; remove darkness and ignorance from them. Restore the religion of your ancestor after it had disappeared, and inflict death upon your opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Ella Landau-Tasseron, 'Zaydi Imams as Restorers of Religion; Ihya and Tajdid in Zaydi Literature', ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 49:3 1990, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication==

His position was nevertheless precarious, since other [[Rassids]] (descendants of al-Qasim ar-Rassi) claimed power over the Zaydiyyah community. After his failure to subdue the recalcitrant tribesmen of [[Banu Harith]] in [[Najran]], he faced opposition from al-Malih Ibrahim and the former imam [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]]. The governor in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], az-Zaidi, rebelled and captured the imam's son Ja'far. A reconciliation took place in 1002. Az-Zaidi offered al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani to retain power over [[Bakil]] and Wada. The imam, however, preferred to retire from governance altogether. He lived a private life in Madhab and Iyyan where he wrote a text to his defence. He died in the following year in Iyyan. As a religious scholar, he followed al-Qasim ar-Rassi and [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]] in the essentials, although he was also accused of theological deviations. After his death, the imamate was contested between his son [[al-Mahdi al-Husayn]] and the old imam ad-Da'i Yusuf.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VI, Leiden 1991, p. 435-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angela DeAngelis "General Gelina" Atwood''' (February 6, 1949 &amp;ndash; May 17, 1974) was a founding member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA), an American terrorist group which kidnapped [[Patricia Hearst]] and robbed banks. She died with five other SLA members in a nationally televised shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department.

==Background==
Angela DeAngelis grew up in the small [[New Jersey]] suburb of [[North Haledon, New Jersey|North Haledon]] near [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. The daughter of a local [[Teamsters]] official, DeAngelis was active in many student leadership groups and was captain of the cheerleading squad. She starred in many school musicals and quietly tutored and befriended classmates others ignored. She was voted Most School Spirit by her peers while attending Manchester Regional High School.&lt;ref name=eulogy/&gt; At the [[University of Indiana|Indiana University]] she met leftwing activist, theatre student and future husband Gary Atwood. While at school she sang in the Kappa Pickers (a musical group in the [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority) with [[Jane Pauley]], was involved in theater,{{sfn|Toobin|2016|pp=76-78}} and majored in education.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} She helped fellow theater student [[Kevin Kline]] organize and run a [[guerrilla theatre]] group in town. She married Gary Atwood while still an undergraduate, and they befriended [[William Harris (Symbionese Liberation Army)|William Harris]], another Indiana University actor, and his wife [[Emily Harris (SLA)|Emily Harris]].{{sfn|Toobin|2016|pp=76-78}} She graduated in 1970 and began student teaching in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Symbionese Liberation Army==
The Atwoods moved to [[San Francisco]], where Angela became friends with  [[Kathleen Soliah]] (now known as Sara Jane Olson). The two women acted together in a local production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' and Angela got Kathy a job waiting tables.

Atwood moved in with the Harrises in early December 1973.{{sfn|McClellan|1977|p=151}}  She then joined the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) along with the Harrises.
She was described as well dressed, with a preference for [[hippie]] attire, particularly Indian silk shirts and [[batik]]. Atwood liked such feminine accessories as earrings, jewelry, and rings. A friend described her as "the [[prima donna]] of the whole thing", and likened her to the woman depicted by [[Bob Dylan]] in "[[Just Like A Woman]]".{{sfn|McClellan|1977|pp=151-152}}

Atwood (speaking as "Gelina") was often the voice of the SLA, in the form of tape-recorded press releases.  In Patricia Hearst's account of her time with the SLA, she writes that Gelina would spend hours, and sometimes days, perfecting communiques.{{sfn|Hearst|1982|p=94}}

SLA members held an anti-bourgeois ideology of popular rule partly based on the idea that the most oppressed members of society, who were often blacks, must be the ones to lead a revolution against [[The Establishment]].  Patty Hearst testified that Atwood, William Harris, and [[Nancy Ling Perry]] were given to bemoaning their white skin and wishing they were black. According to Hearst's testimony, SLA members also envied persons like their black leader Field Marshal Cinque (pronounced ''sin-q'') ([[Donald DeFreeze]]), who had served time in prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The Many Trials of Patty Hearst'', Los Angeles Times, 27 February 1976, pg. OC_C1.&lt;/ref&gt; This partly explained their allegiance to Cinque. Atwood, however, many times disagreed with his directives, as when she argued against his issuing a death warrant for two imprisoned SLA members.{{sfn|Hearst|1982|p=128}}

Atwood was assigned the task of surveillance in the potential kidnapping of John E. Countryman, former chairman of the board of [[Del Monte Corporation]]. The surveillance plan gave Countryman's age as 70. Atwood was apparently unaware that Mr. Countryman had died in July 1972 at the age of 69.{{sfn|McClellan|1977|p=171}}

Atwood used the name Anne Lindberg when she visited inmate James Harold ("Doc") Holiday on January 10, 1974. This encounter alerted Holiday to the capture of Remiro and [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]], who were both linked through strong [[circumstantial evidence]] to the murder of [[Marcus Foster]], Superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California. They were arrested following a shootout with policemen in [[Concord, California]]. Quickly after Atwood's approach of Holiday, she fled the [[Oakland, California]] home with the Harrises. They left behind clothes, a stereo, personal papers, and three pistol boxes.{{sfn|McClellan|1977|pp=167-168}}

==Prominent role in Hearst kidnapping==

In her trial for [[armed robbery]] [[Patricia Campbell Hearst]] testified that she was kidnapped from her [[Berkeley, California]] apartment by Atwood, [[Donald DeFreeze]], and William Harris, on the night of February 4, 1974.{{sfn|McClellan|1977|p=197}}

Hearst's insistence that she was forced by the SLA to make a series of self-incriminating statements was supported by Dr. Margaret Thaler-Singer, a [[UC-Berkeley]] [[clinical psychologist]]. As an expert on speech patterns who studied the tapes released by the SLA, Thaler-Singer stated that
the speech patterns did not fit the style of Hearst. Rather they resembled the styles of Atwood and [[Emily Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hearst Defense Rests After Losing Bid For Dismissal'', [[Los Angeles Times]], March 2, 1976, pg. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwood's voice is heard on a taped message of March 9, 1974, used in negotiations with [[Randolph Hearst]] for the return of Patty Hearst. Atwood assumed the voice of a black woman and said, "The dream - and indeed it is a dream - of [many on the Left] is that the enemy corporate state will willingly give the stolen riches of the earth back to the people and that this will be accomplished through compromising talk and empty words . . . to this, our bullets scream loudly. The enemy's bloodthirsty greed will be destroyed by the growing spirit of the people and their thirst for freedom. We call upon the people to judge for themselves whether our tactics of waging struggle are correct or incorrect in fighting the enemy by any means necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judging the SLA|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/judging-the-sla-2134316|author=Goldin, Greg|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]''|access-date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecution witness Dr. Joel Fort identified Atwood, Perry, and [[Willie Wolfe]] as the SLA members Hearst developed the "most affectionate bonds" with.&lt;ref&gt;''Miss Hearst Called 'Queen of SLA', Voluntary Member'', Los Angeles Times, March 9, 1976, pg. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death in Los Angeles safehouse shootout==

Atwood, along with five other founding members of the SLA, including Donald DeFreeze, was killed in [[Los Angeles]] on May 17, 1974, in a shootout with police that was broadcast live on television. Atwood died of burns and smoke inhalation when the SLA's safehouse caught fire during the gun battle and burned to the ground.{{sfn|Toobin|2006|pp=203-208}}  It was Atwood's death that prompted Kathleen Soliah to hold a memorial service for her and the other deceased members of the SLA; Soliah and a few others became part of the "second team", giving the SLA life for about two more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Fugitive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA149|author=Carney, Thomas|issue=January 2000|page=149|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Magazine]]''|access-date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insect/&gt;

==Eulogy==
Atwood was eulogized by the Reverend Joseph Citro, a 25-year-old priest, at her funeral mass in [[Prospect Park, New Jersey]] on May 26, 1974. They grew up blocks from each other and knew each other through the local [[Catholic Youth Organization]].

'''Bashing''' is a harsh, gratuitous, prejudicial attack on a person, group, or subject. [[Literal and figurative language|Literally]], bashing is a term meaning to hit or assault, but when it is used as a [[Affix|suffix]], or in conjunction with a noun indicating the subject being attacked, it is normally used to imply that the act is motivated by bigotry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically, to describe verbal or critical assaults.  Topics which attract bashing tend to be highly [[partisan (political)|partisan]] and personally sensitive topics for the bashers, the victims, or both. Common areas include [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], and [[politics]].

Physical bashing is differentiated from regular assault because it is a motivated assault, which may be considered a [[hate crime]]. In relation to non-physical bashing, the term is used to imply that a verbal or critical attack is similarly unacceptable and similarly prejudicial. Use of the term in this manner is an [[ad hominem|abusive ad hominem]] action, used to denounce the attack and admonish the attackers by comparing them to perpetrators of physical bashing.

Karen Franklin, in her paper "Psychosocial motivations of hate crimes perpetrators" identifies the following motivations for bashing: socially instilled prejudice or partisan conflict; the perception that the bashing subject is in some way contrary to, or in offense to, an underlying ideology; group or peer influence.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417233212/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf |date=April 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical bashing ==

One of the more common uses of the term ''bashing'' is to describe assault or vilification of people perceived to be [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. Gay-bashing is related to [[homophobia]] and  [[Religion and homosexuality|religious objections to homosexuality]].

==Non-physical bashing==
{{see also|French bashing}}
In cases of non-physical bashing, the term is normally used with the intention of having a pejorative effect on the identified bashers by comparing them to perpetrators of criminal assaults. Sometimes this label is applied to criticisms that are not particularly vehement nor even inappropriate. In these cases, the term can be seen to be applied purely for partisan benefit. The use of the term within this context is most common in editorial or personal commentary. These terms are used to imply that the criticism of these groups or individuals is excessive, too frequent, uncompromising, or inappropriate. Since politics is inherently partisan, the term bashing is frequently used to cast negative aspersions on critics for political gain.

Fans of different artistic works often accuse critics, who may be other fans, of bashing the subject or individuals upon which the fandom is centered. A common example of this on the [[internet]] is ''Lucas bashing'', where the term is used to decry criticism of [[Star Wars]] or [[George Lucas]] personally. In this case, again the motivations include partisan conflict (for or against an aspect of an artistic work); an offense to an underlying ideology (nostalgic attachment to, or immersion in, an artistic genre); and the group influence of other fans and discussion forums. There is also ''character bashing'', which happens when a part of the fandom openly criticises one or more characters in an artistic work, or even real people from media industry.

'''Belgians''' ({{lang-nl|Belgen}}, {{lang-fr|Belges}}, {{lang-de|Belgier}}) are people identified with the [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]], a [[federation|federal]] state in [[Western Europe]]. As Belgium is a [[multinational state]], this connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural rather than ethnic. The majority of Belgians, however, belong to two distinct ethnic groups or ''communities'' ({{lang-nl|gemeenschap}} or {{lang-fr|communauté}}) native to the country, i.e. its historical regions: [[Flemings]] in [[Flanders]], who speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Walloons]] in [[Wallonia]] who speak [[French language|French]] or [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. There is also a substantial [[Belgian diaspora]], which has settled primarily in the [[Belgian Americans|United States]], [[Belgian Canadians|Canada]], [[Belgians in France|France]] and Netherlands.

The Latin name was revived in 1790 by the short-lived [[United States of Belgium|United Belgian States]] which was created after [[Brabant Revolution|a revolution against Austrian rule]] took place in 1789. Since no [[adjective]] equivalent to "Belgian" existed at the time, the French noun "Belgique" (or "Belgium") was adopted as both noun and adjective; a phenomenon borrowed from Latin which was still commonly used during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=un peu d'histoire: la révolution belgique|url=http://www.canaris1790.be/fr/index.php?id=12|publisher=Canaris1790.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the sixteenth century, the [[Low Countries]]" or "[[Netherlands (toponymy)|Netherlands]]", were referred to as 'Belgica' in Latin, as was the [[Dutch Republic]].

==Belgian culture==
{{main article|Culture of Belgium}}

==Relations between Belgian linguistic communities==
{{main article|Languages of Belgium}}

Belgians are primarily a [[nationality]] or citizen group, by ''[[jus soli]]'' (Latin: right of the soil),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jus%20soli jus soli], definition from [http://www.merriam-webster.com merriam-webster.com].&lt;/ref&gt; also known as birthright citizenship, and are not a homogeneous [[ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983), ''The Invention of Tradition'', Sider 1993 ''Lumbee Indian Histories''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner,(1982), ''Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective'', pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith 1987 pp.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Belgians are made up of two main linguistic and ethnic groups; the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speakers]] (called the [[Flemish people|Flemish]]) and the [[Francophone|French-speakers]] (mostly [[Walloons]]), as well as a third tiny but constitutionally recognized group from two small German-speaking areas. These sometimes competing ethnic and linguistic priorities are governed by constitutionally designated [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|"regions or communities"]], depending on the constitutional realm of the topic, a complex and uniquely Belgian political construct. Since many Belgians are at least bilingual, or even trilingual, it is common for business, social and family networks to include members of the various ethnic groups composing Belgium.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]] occupies a unique political and cultural position since geographically and linguistically it is a bilingual enclave within the unilingual Flemish Region. Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, the city of Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking into a multilingual city with French as the majority language and ''[[lingua franca]]'', a process that has been labelled the [[Frenchification of Brussels]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook|first=David|last=Levinson|year=1998|location=Phoenix, AZ|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=1-57356-019-7|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the independence of Belgium in 1830, the constitutional title of the Belgian [[head of state]] is the [[Monarchy in Belgium|"King of the Belgians"]] rather than the "King of Belgium".&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Arango, ''Leopold III and the Belgian Royal Question'', p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Fusilier in ''Les monarchies parlementaires en Europe'', Editions ouvrières, Paris, 1960, p. 350, wrote the Belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the French Constitution of the [[Kingdom of France (1791-1792)]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776 and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flemish (Dutch-speaking)===
{{Main article |Flemish people}}
[[File:Quad Flandria.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the medieval [[County of Flanders]].]]
Within [[Belgium]] the Flemish, about 60% of the population, form a clearly distinguishable group, set apart by their language and customs. However, when compared to the [[Netherlands]] most of these cultural and linguistic boundaries quickly fade, as the Flemish share the same language, similar or identical customs and (though only with the southern part of today's Netherlands) traditional religion with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;National minorities in Europe, W. Braumüller, 2003, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the popular perception of being a single polity varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality and personal background. Generally, Flemings will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;Nederlandse en Vlaamse identiteit, Civis Mundi 2006 by S.W. Couwenberg. {{ISBN|90-5573-688-0}}. Page 62. Quote: "Er valt heel wat te lachen om de wederwaardigheden van Vlamingen in Nederland en Nederlanders in Vlaanderen. Ze relativeren de verschillen en beklemtonen ze tegelijkertijd. Die verschillen zijn er onmiskenbaar: in taal, klank, kleur, stijl, gedrag, in politiek, maatschappelijke organisatie, maar het zijn stuk voor stuk varianten binnen één taal-en cultuurgemeenschap." The opposite opinion is stated by L. Beheydt (2002): "Al bij al lijkt een grondiger analyse van de taalsituatie en de taalattitude in Nederland en Vlaanderen weinig aanwijzingen te bieden voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit. Dat er ook op andere gebieden weinig aanleiding is voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit is al door Geert Hofstede geconstateerd in zijn vermaarde boek ''Allemaal andersdenkenden'' (1991)." L. Beheydt, "Delen Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele identiteit?", in P. Gillaerts, H. van Belle, L. Ravier (eds.),  ''Vlaamse identiteit: mythe én werkelijkheid'' (Leuven 2002), 22-40, esp. 38. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walloon (French-speaking)===
{{Main article |Walloons}}

Walloons are a [[French language|French]]-speaking people who live in [[Belgium]], principally in [[Wallonia]]. Walloons are a distinctive community within Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Groups Worldwide, a ready reference Handbook, David Levinson, ORYX Press, ({{ISBN|1-57356-019-7}}), p. 13 : « Walloons are identified through their residence in Wallonia and by speaking dialects of French. They, too, are descended from the original Celtic inhabitants of the region and Romans and Franks who arrived later. Walloons are mainly Roman catholic. »&lt;/ref&gt; important historical and anthropological criteria (religion, language, traditions, folklore) bind Walloons to the [[French people]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Groups Worldwide, a ready reference Handbook'', David Levinson, ORYX Press, {{ISBN|1-57356-019-7}}, p.13 : "Walloon culture was heavely influenced by the French"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of the Peoples of the World, A Henri Holt Reference Book, page 645 : « Culturally there is continuity between the French and the Walloons, Wallon culture consisting mainly of dialect literary productions. While historically most Wallons came within France's cultural orbit&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also refers to the inhabitants of the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]. They may speak regional languages such as ''[[Walloon language|Walloon]]'' (with ''[[Picard language|Picard]]'' in the West and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] in the South).

Though roughly three-quarters of Belgium's French speakers live in Wallonia, it is important to note that French-speaking residents of Brussels tend not to identify as Walloons.

===German-speaking community===
{{Main article |German-speaking Community of Belgium}}
The German-speaking Community of Belgium is one of the three constitutionally recognized federal communities of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dglive.be/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263//2264_read-27181/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504234715/http://www.dglive.be/en/Desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263/2264_read-27181/ |archivedate=4 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; Covering an area of less than 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the [[provinces of Belgium|province]] of [[Liège (province)|Liège]] in [[Wallonia]], it includes nine of the eleven municipalities of the so-called [[East Cantons]] and the local population numbers over 73,000 — less than 1% of the national total. Bordering the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Luxembourg]], the area has its own parliament and government at [[Eupen]].

The German-speaking community is composed of the German-speaking parts of the lands that were annexed in 1920 from Germany. In addition, in contemporary Belgium there are also some other German-speaking areas that belonged to Belgium even before 1920, but they are not currently considered officially part of the German-speaking community in Belgium: [[Bleiberg]]-[[Welkenraat]]-[[Baelen]] in Northeastern [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]] and [[Arelerland]] (city of [[Arlon]] and some of its nearby villages in Southeastern [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|province of Belgian Luxembourg]]). However, in these localities, the German language is highly endangered due to the adoption of [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/vielfalt-dt.html|title=Gefaehrdete Vielfalt - Kleine Sprachen ohne Zukunft.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Belgium}}
[[Roman Catholicism]] has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion, with approximately 65% of the Belgians declaring themselves to be Catholics.&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{citation|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012|work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]]}} The question asked was "Do you consider yourself to be...?"

Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu did not reach the 1% threshold.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2004, nationwide Sunday [[church attendance]] was only about 4 to 8% (9% for Flanders only). A 2006 inquiry in [[Flemish Region|Flanders]], long considered more religious than the [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]] or [[Wallonia]] regions in [[Belgium]], showed 55% of its inhabitants calling themselves religious, while 36% said that they believed that God created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in [[Knack (magazine)|Knack magazine]] 22 November 2006 p. 14 (The Dutch language term 'gelovig' was translated in the text as 'religious', more precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of god in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense or in some [[afterlife]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main article|Demographics of Belgium}}

Belgium had a population of 10,839,905 people on 1 January 2010, an increase of 601,000 in comparison to 2000 (10,239,085 inhabitants). Between 1990 (9,947,782 inhabitants) and 2000 the increase was only 291,000. The population of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels on 1 January 2010 was 6,251,983 (57.7%), 3,498,384 (32.3%) and 1,089,538 (10.1%), respectively.

The [[City Harvest Church]] Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) Case is the biggest CBT case in [[Singapore]] since the beginning of the 21st century. The case involves the church's founders, especially [[Kong Hee]], and a sum of S$50 million.

==Investigation==
On 31 May 2010, the Office of the Commissioner of Charities (COC) and the [[Commercial Affairs Department]] (CAD) of the Singapore Police announced in a joint press statement that 17 individuals linked to the City Harvest Church, including church founder Pastor Kong Hee and his deputy, Pastor Tan Ye Peng, were under investigation after complaints alleging the misuse of church funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4121597 |title=City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee &amp; 16 others under funds probe |publisher=Xin MSN News |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/the%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20100607-220579.html |title=City Harvest deputy also assisting in probe |publisher=Asia One |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1063720/1/.html |title=Over 18 people from City Harvest Church called up in probe so far |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police launched investigations into possible falsification of accounts and criminal breach of trust amounting to millions of dollars which dated back a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1060093/1/.html |title=Individuals, firms linked to City Harvest Church under probe |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100531-219380.html |title=Church members probed |publisher=Asia One |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100601-0000111/City-Harvest-probe |title=City Harvest Probe |work=Today |location=Singapore |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124121320/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100601-0000111/City-Harvest-probe |archivedate=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation followed requests by church members for the COC to review the church's constitution, which denied ordinary members the chance to attend general meetings, or be privy to its annual reports and financial statements. Some members felt that the church board had utilised the church's building fund and committed it to "future liabilities" without consulting members at its latest AGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100609-0000124/Ordinary-members-have-no-right-to-attend-general-meetings |title=Ordinary members have no right to attend general meetings |publisher=TODAY |location=Singapore |accessdate=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622012020/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100609-0000124/Ordinary-members-have-no-right-to-attend-general-meetings# |archive-date=2011-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Kong Hee and four other members of the church were arrested by the [[Commercial Affairs Department]] of the [[Singapore Police Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLICE NEWS RELEASE|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/files/PoliceNewsRelease-CADarrest5forCBTCHC.doc.pdf|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were filed against the five individuals and who were released on $500,000 bail each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Harvest case: Allegedly total of $50m misused |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-1/Story/STIStory_815914.html |accessdate=28 June 2012 |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628045656/http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-1/Story/STIStory_815914.html |archivedate=28 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, charges were brought on one additional former finance director with the last of the pre-trial conferences set for 22 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Katherine|title=Singapore City Harvest Church Manager Accused in Fraud Case Allowed to Travel|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/singapore-city-harvest-church-manager-accused-in-fraud-case-allowed-to-travel-82734/|accessdate=11 October 2012|newspaper=The Christian Post|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6th City Harvest member charged; cases adjourned for 5 weeks |url=http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120725-0000065/6th-City-Harvest-member-charged-cases-adjourned-for-5-weeks |accessdate=25 July 2012 |newspaper=Today |date=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727034124/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120725-0000065/6th-City-Harvest-member-charged-cases-adjourned-for-5-weeks |archivedate=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Harvest Church case adjourned to Oct 4|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/chc-funds-scandal/story/city-harvest-church-case-adjourned-oct-4-20120830|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the trial started on 15 May 2012, some Christians expressed concern that the slow pace of the trial may have a negative impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Christians want quick justice in City Harvest Church case|url=http://www.bikyamasr.com/79284/singapore-christians-want-quick-justice-in-city-harvest-church-case/|publisher=Bikya Masr|accessdate=11 October 2012|date=5 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212230045/http://www.bikyamasr.com/79284/singapore-christians-want-quick-justice-in-city-harvest-church-case/#|archive-date=2012-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial involving City Harvest Church leaders to start on May 15|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/trial-involving-city-harvest-church-leaders-start-may-15|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day as the initial arrests, the COC released a press statement detailing the results of its inquiry stating there were misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the charity. There were irregularities of at least $23 million in the charity's funds, which were used to finance Sun Ho's secular music career. There was also a concerted effort to conceal this movement of funds from stakeholders.

==Conviction==

In October 2015, all six accused were found guilty of all criminal breach of trust charges pertaining to 409 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. Falsification of Accounts under section 477A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|last2=Lee|first2=Min Kok|last3=Ng|first3=Huiwen|title=City Harvest trial: All 6 accused, including founder Kong Hee, found guilty of all charges|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/city-harvest-trial-verdict-due-for-six-accused-church-leaders|accessdate=21 October 2015|agency=The Straits Times|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the conviction, other pastors and Christians began speaking out regarding the trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=Controversy over City Harvest Church's 'prosperity gospel'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/controversy-over-churchs-prosperity-gospel|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sim|first1=Geraldine|title=9 Reasons Why City Harvest Church Was the Devil To Me|url=http://gerashen.com/2015/10/22/8-reasons-why-city-harvest-church-was-the-devil-to-me/|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the second longest in Singapore history with the trial stretching over 140 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-city-harvest-trial-0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serina Wee''', former finance manager of CHC, was found guilty of 6 counts of criminal breach of trust and 4 counts of falsifying the church's accounts. The prosecutor labelled her as the most inextricably involved in the conspiracy due to her role as administrator of the Crossover project.

'''Sharon Tan''', former finance manager of CHC, was found guilty of 3 counts of criminal breach of trust and 4 counts of falsifying the church's accounts. The prosecutor noted her defense was deeply cynical and self-seriving, attempting to minimise her involvement in the offences.

'''Chew Eng Han''', CHC board member, was found guilty of 6 counts of criminal breach of trust and 4 counts of falsifying church accounts. The prosecutor noted that his defense was incoherent while lacking credibility.

'''Tan Ye Peng''', founding member and senior pastor of CHC, was found guilty of 6 counts of criminal breach of trust and 4 counts of falsifying the church's accounts.

'''John Lam''', former secretary of the church's management board, was found guilty of 3 counts of criminal breach of trust. The prosecutor noted that he was the inside man in church governance and oversaw bodies that prevented the sham investment bonds from being discovered.

'''Kong Hee''', senior pastor and founder of the church, was found guilty of 3 counts of criminal breach of trust. The prosecutor noted that he was had not maintained a consistent position on critical factual issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/kong-well-practised-liar-prosecution Kong a ‘well-practised liar’: Prosecution&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6 accused, and the Prosecution, have all filed appeals on their conviction, with the prosecution calling the current sentences "manifestly inadequate". The appeals will be heard over 5 days, Sep 19 to Sep 23 of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-church/2572212.html City Harvest Church appeal: Case to be heard in September&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Chew filed a new police report against 8 members of the church (including Kong Hee and Sun Ho). Chew alleged that this was for ''"fraudulent misrepresentation of vital facts about the church which induced me and other members to give our donations", and also for use of funds for purposes other than what was represented to the members of the church.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ex-city-harvest-church/2955188.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
On 7 April 2017, the outcome of the appeal against the conviction and sentences of the six accused resulted in the length of their jail term approximately halved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-appeal-kong-hee-s-sentence-reduced-to-3-5-years/3659450.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2018, the prosecutors' appeal to reinstate the original jail terms was dismissed by the Court of Appeal as the High Court had set the jail terms based on wrong interpretation of the meaning of "agent" in section 409 of the Penal Code hence they were charged under the 'less serious' section 406 instead.&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/city-harvest-appeal-jail-terms-maintained-kong-hee-ex-leaders-021601556.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/appropriate-revisions-to-penal-code-to-be-made-following-dismissal-of-appeal-in-chc-case&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serina Wee''' from 5 years to 2 years and 6 months;

'''Sharon Tan''' from 21 months to 7 months;

'''Chew Eng Han''' from 6 years to 3 years and 4 months;

'''Tan Ye Peng''' from 5 years 6 months to 3 years and 2 months;

'''John Lam''' from 3 years to 1 year 6 months;

'''Kong Hee''' from 8 years to 3 years and 6 months.

With the exception of Chew, 5 of the group began their sentences on April 21, 2017. Chew, who had been on bail pending the appeal, was been granted permission by the court to begin his sentence on February 22, 2018. On 21st February a day before Chew was due to start his sentence he was arrested for trying to flee Singapore unlawfully and was subsequently charged by the police.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-church-chew-eng-han-charged-trying-to-flee-9979914&lt;/ref&gt;Meanwhile Sharon Tan completed her sentence and was released from jail.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-church-chew-eng-han-escape-timeline-9978064&lt;/ref&gt; Chew started his jail term on 1st of March 2018,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-city-harvest-church-leader-chew-eng-han-begins-jail-term-boatman-remanded&lt;/ref&gt; while the Malaysian boatman charged with abetting his escape is slapped with a jail term of 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chew-eng-han-city-harvest-church-malaysian-man-jailed-10131150&lt;/ref&gt;

The S$50 million taken from the mega-church’s coffers is the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore.

The '''Dogon''' are an ethnic group living in the central plateau region of [[Mali]], in [[West Africa]], south of the [[Niger River|Niger]] bend, near the city of [[Bandiagara]] and in [[Burkina Faso]]. The population numbers between 400,000 and 800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shoup |first1=John A. |title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia |date=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781598843620 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=dogon+ghana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikiPyw6uXeAhWq4YUKHec1DtQQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=dogon%20ghana&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Dogon languages]], which are considered to constitute an independent branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dogon are best known for their religious traditions, their mask dances, wooden sculpture and their architecture. The past century has seen significant changes in the social organisation, material culture and beliefs of the Dogon, partly because Dogon country is one of Mali's major tourist attractions.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Geography and history==
[[Image:Falaise de Bandiagara.png|thumb|300px|Dogon dwelling on the [[Bandiagara Escarpment]].]]

The principal Dogon area is bisected by the [[Bandiagara Escarpment]], a sandstone cliff of up to 500 m (1,640.42&amp;nbsp;ft) high, stretching about 150&amp;nbsp;km (90 miles). To the southeast of the cliff, the sandy Séno-Gondo Plains are found, and northwest of the cliff are the Bandiagara Highlands. Historically, Dogon villages were established in the Bandiagara area in consequence of the Dogon people's collective refusal to convert to Islam a thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1965|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogon insecurity in the face of these historical pressures caused them to locate their villages in defensible positions along the walls of the escarpment. The other factor influencing their choice of settlement location is water. The [[Niger River]] is nearby and in the sandstone rock, a rivulet runs at the foot of the cliff at the lowest point of the area during the wet season.

Among the Dogon, several oral traditions have been recorded as to their origin. One relates to their coming from [[Mandé, Mali|Mande]], located to the southwest of the [[Bandiagara]] escarpment near [[Bamako]]. According to this oral tradition, the first Dogon settlement was established in the extreme southwest of the escarpment at Kani-Na.

Archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies in the Dogon region were especially revealing about the settlement and environmental history, and about social practices and technologies in this area over several thousands of years.

Over time, the Dogon moved north along the escarpment, arriving in the [[Sangha, Mali|Sanga]] region in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Griaule, M. 1938 Masques dogons. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Other oral histories place the origin of the Dogon to the west beyond the river Niger, or tell of the Dogon coming from the east. It is likely that the Dogon of today combine several groups of diverse origin who migrated to escape [[Islamization]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Robert (ed.) &amp; Hollyman, Stephenie (photographs) &amp; Walter E.A. van Beek (text) (2001) Dogon: Africa's people of the cliffs. New York: Abrams. {{ISBN|0-8109-4373-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often difficult to distinguish between pre-Muslim practices and later practices, though [[Sharia|Islamic law]] classified them and many other ethnicities of the region, ([[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Gurma]], [[Bobo people|Bobo]], [[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]] and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]) as being within the non-canon [[dar al-harb]] and consequently fair game for slave raids organized by merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Insoll, ''The Archaeology of Islam in Sub-Saharan Africa'' (2003) Cambridge University Press, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; As the growth of cities increased, the demand for slaves across the region of West Africa also increased. The historical pattern has included the murder of indigenous males by Islamic raiders and enslavement of women and children.&lt;ref name="Wise"&gt;[[Christopher Wise]], ''Yambo Ouologuem: Postcolonial Writer, Islamic Militant'', Published 1999, Lynne Rienner Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
{{Main|African art#Dogon}}
Dogon art is primarily sculpture. Dogon art revolves around religious values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, [[sanctuaries]], or kept with the Hogon (Laude, 20).  The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.

Themes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with [[caryatid]]s, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding [[pearl millet]], women bearing [[Bowl (vessel)|vessels]] on their heads, [[donkey]]s bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46–52).

Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art.  The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara.  Influence from [[Tellem]] art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).

==Culture and religion==

The blind Dogon elder, Ogotemmêli, taught the main symbols of the Dogon religion to the French anthropologist [[Marcel Griaule]] in October 1946.&lt;ref name="Griaule_3"&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Griaule had lived amongst the Dogon people for fifteen years before this meeting with Ogotemmêli had taken place. Ogotemmêli taught Griaule the religious stories in the same way that Ogotemmêli had learned them from his father and grandfather; instruction which he had learned over the course of more than twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; What makes the record so important from a historical perspective is that the Dogon people were still living in their oral culture at the time their religion was recorded.  They were one of the last people in Africa to lose their independence and come under French rule.&lt;ref name="Griaule_3"/&gt;

The Dogon people with whom the French anthropologists Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen worked with during the 1930s and 40s had a system of signs which ran into the thousands, including "their own systems of astronomy and calendrical measurements, methods of calculation and extensive anatomical and physiological knowledge, as well as a systematic [[pharmacopoeia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion embraced many aspects of nature, which some researchers{{who|date=December 2017}} associate with a [[traditional African religion]].

The key spiritual figures in the religion were the [[Nommo|Nummo/Nommo]] twins. According to Ogotemmêli's description of them, the Nummo, whom he also referred to as the Serpent, were amphibians that were often compared to serpents, lizards, chameleons, and occasionally even sloths (because of their being slow moving and having a shapeless neck). They were also described as fish capable of walking on land; while they were on land, the Nummo stood upright on their tails. The Nummos' skin was primarily green, but, like the chameleon, it sometimes changed colours. It was said to at times have all the colours of the rainbow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Dorey]], ''The Master of Speech'', Elemental Expressions Ltd., Elora, Canada, 2002, reprint 2013. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In other instances, the Nummo were referred to as "Water Spirits".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Nummo were identified as being "Dieu d'eau" (gods of water) by Marcel Griaule, Ogotemmêli identified the Nummo as hermaphrodites and they appeared on the female side of the Dogon sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were primarily symbolized by the sun, which was a female symbol in the religion. In the Dogon language, the sun's name (''nay'') had the same root as "mother" (''na'') and "cow" (''nā'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1986|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were symbolized by the colour red, a female symbol.

The problem of "twin births" versus "single births", or androgyny versus single-sexed beings, contributed to a disorder at the beginning of time. This theme became a significant basis of the Dogon religion. "The jackal was alone from birth," said Ogotemmêli, "and because of this he did more things than can be told."&lt;ref name="Griaule_22"&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogon males were primarily associated with the single-sexed male Jackal and the Sigui festival, which was associated with death on the Earth. It was held once every sixty years and allegedly celebrated the white dwarf star, [[Sirius B]],&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.badarchaeology.com/extraterrestrials/the-sirius-mystery/&lt;/ref&gt; provoking numerous [[The Sirius Mystery|speculations]] about the origin of such knowledge. The colour white was a symbol of males. The ritual language, "Sigi so" or "language of the Sigui", which was taught to male dignitaries of the Society of the Masks ("awa"), was considered a poor language, and only contained about a quarter of the vocabulary of "Dogo so", the Dogon word language. The "Sigi so" was used to tell the story of creation of the universe, of human life, and the advent of death on the Earth, during funeral ceremonies and the rites of the "end of mourning" ("dama").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1986|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the birth of the single-sexed male Jackal, who was born without a soul, all humans eventually had to be turned into single-sexed beings. This was to prevent a being like the Jackal from ever being born on Earth again. "The Nummo foresaw that the original rule of twin births was bound to disappear, and that errors might result comparable to those of the jackal, whose birth was single. Because of his solitary state, the first son of God acted as he did."&lt;ref name="Griaule_22"/&gt; The removal of the second sex and soul from humans is what the ritual of circumcision represents in the Dogon religion. "The dual soul is a danger; a man should be male, and a woman female. Circumcision and excision are once again the remedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dogon religion was centered on this loss of twinness or androgyny. Griaule describes it in this passage:

{{quote|Most of the conversations with Ogotemmêli had indeed turned largely on twins and on the need for duality and the doubling of individual lives. The Eight original Ancestors were really eight pairs&amp;nbsp;... But after this generation, human beings were usually born single. Dogon religion and Dogon philosophy both expressed a haunting sense of the original loss of twin-ness. The heavenly Powers themselves were dual, and in their Earthly manifestations they constantly intervened in pairs&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Griaule_198"&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The birth of human twins was celebrated in the Dogon culture in Griaule's day because it recalled the "fabulous past, when all beings came into existence in twos, symbols of the balance between humans and the divine". According to Griaule, the celebration of twin-births was a cult that extended all over Africa.&lt;ref name="Griaule_198"/&gt;

Today, a significant minority of the Dogon practice [[Islam]]. Another minority practice Christianity. Today the Dogon record their ancestry through a [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] system. Each Dogon community, or enlarged family, is headed by one male elder. This chief head is the oldest living son of the ancestor of the local branch of the family. [[polygyny|Polygynous]] marriages are allowed in the Dogon culture. Most men, however, have only one wife, and it is rare for a man to have more than two wives. Formally, wives join their husband's household only after the birth of their first child.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Women may leave their husbands early in their marriage, before the birth of their first child.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} After having children, divorce is a rare and serious matter, and it requires the participation of the whole village.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} An enlarged family can count up to a hundred persons and is called ''guinna''.

[[Image:Hogon.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Hogon]].]]
The Dogon are strongly oriented toward harmony, which is reflected in many of their rituals. For instance, in one of their most important rituals, the women praise the men, the men thank the women, the young express appreciation for the old, and the old recognize the contributions of the young. Another example is the custom of elaborate greetings whenever one Dogon meets another. This custom is repeated over and over, throughout a Dogon village, all day.

During a greeting ritual, the person who has entered the contact answers a series of questions about his or her whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is ''sewa'', which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word ''sewa'' is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the ''sewa people''.

=== Hogon ===
The [[Hogon]] is the spiritual leader of the village. He is elected from among the oldest men of the extended families of the village.

After his election, he has to follow a six-month [[initiation]] period, during which he is not allowed to shave or wash. He wears white clothes and nobody is allowed to touch him. A [[virgin]] who has not yet had her [[Menstrual cycle|period]] takes care of him, cleans the house and prepares his meals. She returns to her home at night.

[[File:Tellem Dwelling Bandiagara Escarpment Mali.jpg|300px|thumb|A mud mosque and [[minaret]].]]
After his initiation, he wears a red fez. He has an armband with a sacred [[pearl]] that symbolises his function. The virgin is replaced by one of his wives, and she also returns to her home at night. The [[Hogon]] has to live alone in his house. The Dogon believe the sacred snake Lébé comes during the night to clean him and to transfer [[wisdom]].

=== Agriculture ===
The Dogon maintain an agricultural mode of subsistence, and cultivate pearl millet, [[sorghum]] and rice, as well as onions, tobacco, peanuts, and some other vegetables.  [[Marcel Griaule]] stimulated the construction of a dam near Sangha and incited the Dogon to cultivate [[onion]]s.  The economy of the Sangha region has doubled since then, and its onions are sold as far as the market of [[Bamako]] and even [[Ivory Coast]]. They also raise sheep, goats, and chickens.  Grain is stored in granaries.

===Circumcision===
[[Image:Dogon Circumsion Cave Painting.jpg|300px|thumb|Cave paintings depicting circumcisions.]]
In Dogon thought, males and females are born with both sexual components. The [[clitoris]] is considered male, while the [[foreskin]] is considered female.&lt;ref name="Griaule_22"/&gt; (Originally, for the Dogon, man was endowed with a dual soul, and circumcision eliminates the superfluous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|1970|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Rites of circumcision thus allow each sex to assume its proper physical identity.

Boys are [[circumcision|circumcised]] in age groups of three years, counting for example all boys between 9 and 12 years old. This marks the end of their youth, and they are now [[initiation|initiated]]. The [[blacksmith]] performs the circumcision. Afterwards, they stay for a few days in a hut separated from the rest of the village people, until the wound has healed. The circumcision is a reason for celebration and the initiated boys go around and receive presents. They make music on a special instrument that is made of a rod of wood and [[calabash]]es that makes the sound of a [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].

The newly circumcised men must walk around naked for a month after the procedure so that their achievement in age can be admired by the tribe. This practice has been passed down for generations and is always followed, even during winter.

They are one of several African ethnic groups that practices [[female genital mutilation]] including a type I circumcision, meaning that the clitoris is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=Mari|title=The Anthropology of Health and Healing|date=2009|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0759110441|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqAraOM_CKgC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=Dogon+female+circumcision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRlbOX5ffMAhWTDRoKHVZzA20Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dogon%20female%20circumcision&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of Songho has a circumcision cave ornamented with red and white [[cave painting|rock painting]]s of animals and plants. Nearby is a cave where [[musical instrument|music instrument]]s are stored.

=== Funeral masquerade ===
Due to the expense, their traditional funeral rituals or "damas" are becoming very rare.  They may be performed years after the death.  Damas that are still performed today are not usually performed for their original intent, but instead are done as a source of entertainment for tourists interested in the Dogon way of life. The Dogon use this entertainment to gain profit by charging the tourists money for what [[mask]]s they want to see and the ritual itself (Davis, 68).

The traditional dama consists of a masquerade that essentially leads the [[souls]] of the departed to their final resting places through a series of ritual dances and rites.  Dogon damas include the use of many masks which they wore by securing them in their teeth, and [[Sculpture|statuettes]].  Each Dogon village may differ in the designs of the masks used in the dama ritual.  Every village may have their own way of performing the dama rituals.  The dama consists of an event, known as the Halic, immediately after the death of a person and lasts for one day (Davis, 68).

According to Shawn R. Davis, this particular ritual incorporates the elements of the yingim and the danyim. During the yincomoli ceremony, a [[gourd]] is smashed over the deceased's wooden [[Bowl (vessel)|bowl]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], and bundukamba, (burial blanket), which announces the entrance of the masks used in this ceremony, while the deceased entrance to their home in the family compound is decorated with ritual elements (Davis, 72–73).

[[File:Mali1974-027 hg.jpg|thumb|A man wearing a Sirige mask jumps during a ceremony, 1974]]
Masks used during the yincomoli ceremony include the Yana Gulay mask, the Satimbe mask, the Sirige mask, and the Kanaga mask. The Yana Gulay mask's purpose is to impersonate a Fulani woman, and is made from cotton cloth and cowell shells. The Satimbe mask represents the women ancestors, who are said to have discovered the purpose of the masks by guiding the spirits of the deceased into the [[afterlife]] (Davis, 74). The Sirige mask is a tall mask that is used in funerals for only the men who were alive during the holding of the Sigui ceremony (see below) (Davis, 68).  The Kanaga masqueraders, at one point, dance and sit next to the bundkamba, which represents the deceased.

The yingim and the danyim rituals each last a few days. These events are held annually to honor the elders that have died since the last Dama.  The yingim consists of the sacrifice of cows, or other valuable animals, and large mock battles performed in order to help chase the spirit, known as the nyama, from the deceased body and village, and towards the path to the afterlife (Davis, 68).

The danyim then takes place a couple of months later. During the danyim, masqueraders perform dances every morning and evening for anytime up to six days depending on how that village performs this ritual. The masqueraders dance on the deceased's rooftops, throughout the village, and the area of fields around the village (Davis, 68). Until the masqueraders have completed their dances, and every ritual has been performed, it is said that any misfortune can be blamed on the remaining spirits of the dead (Davis, 68).

===Sects===
[[Image:Crocodile totem.jpg|thumb|300px|Crocodile Totem]]
Dogon society is composed of several different [[sect]]s:
*The sect of the [[creator deity|creator god]] Amma. The celebration is once a year and consists of offering boiled millet on the conical [[altar]] of Amma, colouring it white. All other sects are directed to the god Amma.
*''Sigui'' is the most important [[ceremony]] of the Dogon. It takes place every 60 years and can take several years. The last one started in 1967 and ended in 1973; the next one will start in 2027. The Sigui ceremony symbolises the death of the first ancestor (not to be confused with Lébé) until the moment that humanity acquired the use of the spoken word. The Sigui is a long [[procession]] that starts and ends in the village of Youga Dogorou and goes from one village to another during several months or years. All men wear [[masks]] and dance in long processions. The Sigui has a secret language, Sigui So, that women are not allowed to learn. The secret Society of Sigui plays a central role in the ceremony. They prepare the ceremonies a long time in advance, and they live for three months hidden outside of the villages while nobody is allowed to see them. The men from the Society of Sigui are called the ''Olubaru''. The villagers are afraid of them, and fear is cultivated by a prohibition to go out at night, when sounds warn that the Olubaru are out. The most important mask that plays a major role in the Sigui rituals is the Great Mask or the Mother of Masks. It is several meters long, held by hand, and not used to hide a face. This mask is newly created every 60 years.
*The ''Lébé'' sect worships the ancestor Lébé Serou, the first mortal human being, who, in Dogon myth, was transformed into a snake. The celebration takes place once a year and lasts for three days. The altar is a pointed conic structure on which the Hogon offers boiled millet while mentioning in his [[benediction]] eight [[Cereal|grains]] plus one. Afterwards, the Hogon performs some [[rituals]] in his house that is the home of Lébé. The last day, all the village men visit all the Binou altars and dance three times around the Lébé altar. The Hogon invites everybody that assisted to drink the millet beer.
*The ''Binou'' sect uses [[totem]]s: common ones for the entire village and individual ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] for Ogol-du-Haut and the [[Black panther|panther]] for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even if this is a [[crocodile]], as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large [[pond|pool]] of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a [[Ritual purification|purification]] [[sacrifice]] at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch [[clouds]] and make it rain.
*The ''twin'' sect: The birth of [[twins]] is a sign of good luck. The enlarged Dogon families have common rituals, during which they evoke all their [[ancestors]] back to their [[genealogy|origin]]—the ancient pair of twins from the creation of the world.
*The ''Mono'' sect: The Mono altar is at the entry of every village. Unmarried young men celebrate the Mono sect once a year in January or February. They spend the night around the altar, singing and screaming and waving with fire [[torches]]. They hunt for mice that will be sacrificed on the altar at dawn.

== Dogon villages ==
[[Image:DogonVillage.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical Dogon village.]]
[[Image:Toguna.jpg|thumb|300px|A Toguna]]
Dogon villages have different buildings:

*''Male granary'': storage place for pearl millet and other grains. Building with a pointed roof. This building is well protected from mice. The amount of filled male granaries is an indication for the size and the richness of a guinna.
*''Female granary'': storage place for a woman's things, her husband has no access. Building with a pointed roof. It looks like a male granary but is less protected against mice. Here, she stores her personal belongings such as clothes, jewelry, money and some food. A woman has a degree of economic independence, and earnings and things related to her merchandise are stored in her personal granary. She can for example make cotton or [[pottery]]. The number of female granaries is an indication for the number of women living in the guinna.
*''Tógu nà'' (a kind of ''case à palabres''): a building only for men. They rest here much of the day throughout the heat of the dry season, discuss affairs and take important decisions in the [[toguna]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Doquet, Sory Camara, ''Les masques dogon:ethnologie savante et ethnologie autochtone,'' Karthala editions, 1999 p.253&lt;/ref&gt; The roof of a toguna is made by 8 layers of millet stalks. It is a low building in which one cannot stand upright. This helps with avoiding violence when discussions get heated.
*''Punulu'' (a house for [[menstrual cycle|menstruating]] women): this house is on the outside of the village. It is constructed by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings. Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They bring with them their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought to have some sort of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.

==Languages==
{{main|Dogon languages}}
Dogon has been frequently referred to as a single language. In reality, there are at least five distinct groups of dialects. The most ancient dialects being  ''dyamsay'' and ''tombo'', the former being most frequently used for traditional prayers and ritual chants. The Dogon language family is internally highly diverse, and many varieties are not mutually intelligible, actually amounting to some 12 dialects and 50 sub-dialects. There is also a secret ritual language ''sigi sǫ'' (language of Sigi), which is taught to dignitaries (''olubarū'') of the Society of the Masks during their enthronement at the ''Sigui'' ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1965|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A very detailed recent study can be found in Hochstetler ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Women have no right to learn ''Sigui So''.

It is generally accepted that the [[Dogon languages]] belong to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]], though the evidence is weak.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}{{why|date=December 2017}} They have been linked to the [[Mande languages|Mande]] subfamily but also to [[Gur languages|Gur]]. In a recent overview of the Niger–Congo family, Dogon is treated as an independent branch.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvp|Williamson|Blench|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dogon languages show few remnants of a [[noun class]] system (one example is that human nouns take a distinct plural suffix), leading linguists to conclude that Dogon is likely to have diverged from Niger–Congo very early.{{when|date=December 2017}} Another indication of this is the [[subject–object–verb]] basic word order, which Dogon shares with such early Niger–Congo branches as [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] and [[Mande languages|Mande]].

About 1,500 ethnic Dogon in seven villages in southern Mali speak the [[Bangime language]], which is unrelated to the other Dogon languages and presumed{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to be an ancient, pre-Dogon [[language isolate]].

==Dogon astronomical beliefs==
Starting with the French anthropologist [[Marcel Griaule]], several authors have claimed that Dogon traditional religion incorporates details about extrasolar astronomical bodies that could not have been discerned from naked-eye observation. This idea has entered the [[New Age]] and [[ancient astronaut]] literature as evidence that extraterrestrial aliens visited Mali in the distant past. Other authors have argued that previous 20th-century European visitors to the Dogon are a far more plausible source of such information, as well as disputing whether Griaule's account accurately describes Dogon myths at all.

From 1931 to 1956, Griaule studied the Dogon in field missions ranging from several days to two months in 1931, 1935, 1937 and 1938&lt;ref&gt;Ciarcia, Gaetano "Dogons et Dogon. Retours au 'pays du reel'", ''L'Homme'' 157 (janvier/mars):

[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.cairn.info/article.php%3FID_REVUE%3DLHOM%26ID_NUMPUBLIE%3DLHOM_157%26ID_ARTICLE%3DLHOM_157_0217&amp;ei=QpgNSrSRKtSrjAfC4JG2Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Ddogon%2Bgriaule%2B%25221931-1933%2522%2B1935%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DG%26num%3D100%26newwindow%3D1]&lt;/ref&gt; and then annually from 1946 until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Imperato, Pascal James, ''Historical Dictionary of Mali'' Scarecrow Press, 1977 {{ISBN|978-0-8108-1005-1}} p.53&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1946, Griaule spent a consecutive thirty-three days in conversations with the Dogon wiseman Ogotemmêli, the source of much of Griaule and Dieterlen's future publications.&lt;ref&gt;Imbo, Samuel Oluoch, ''An Introduction to African Philosophy'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers (28 June 1998) {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8841-8}} p.64 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-p0iHjAEBvkC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=griaule+dogon+Ogotemm%C3%AAli+++days&amp;num=100&amp;ei=u7ANStfWC6TcMO_dmdsJ&amp;client=firefox-a]&lt;/ref&gt; They reported that the Dogon believe that the brightest star in the night sky, [[Sirius]] (''sigi tolo'' or "star of the Sigui"&lt;ref&gt;Sirius is also called ''albararu''. See {{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1965|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;), has two companion stars, ''pō tolo'' (the [[Fonio|Digitaria]] star), and ''ęmmę ya tolo'', (the female [[Sorghum]] star), respectively the first and second companions of Sirius A.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1965|pp=468, 470, 514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirius, in the Dogon system, formed one of the foci for the orbit of a tiny star, the companionate Digitaria star. When Digitaria is closest to Sirius, that star brightens: when it is farthest from Sirius, it gives off a twinkling effect that suggests to the observer several stars. The orbit cycle takes 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1976|pp=64–65, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed that the Dogon appeared to know of the [[rings of Saturn]], and the [[moons of Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;M Griaule, G Dieterlen, ''The Dogon of the French Sudan'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

Griaule and Dieterlen were puzzled by this Sudanese star system, and prefaced their analysis with the disclaimer, "The problem of knowing how, with no instruments at their disposal, men could know the movements and certain characteristics of virtually invisible stars has not been settled, nor even posed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Griaule|Dieterlen|1976|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert K. G. Temple]] wrote a book called ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'' arguing that the Dogon's system reveals precise knowledge of cosmological facts known only by the development of modern astronomy, since they appear to know, from Griaule and Dieterlen's account, that Sirius is part of a binary star system, whose second star, Sirius B, a [[white dwarf]], is however completely invisible to the human eye (just as ''Digitaria'' has the smallest grain known to the Dogon) and that it takes 50 years to complete its orbit. The existence of Sirius B had only been inferred to exist through mathematical calculations undertaken by [[Friedrich Bessel]] in 1844. Temple then argued that the Dogon's information, if traced back to ancient Egyptian sources and myth, indicates an extraterrestrial transmission of knowledge of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. G. Temple]], ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Griaule nor Dieterlen had ever made such bold claims about a putative esoteric source for the Dogon's knowledge.

More recently, doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlein's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| title = The Dogon Revisited| accessdate = 2007-10-13| author = Bernard R.

All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 2743641| last =van Beek | first = WAE | journal = Current Anthropology| volume = 32 | issue = 2 | year = 1991 | title = Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule | author2 = Bedaux | author3 = Blier | author4 = Bouju | author5 = Crawford | author6 = Douglas | author7 = Lane | author8 = Meillassoux | pages = 139–67 | doi = 10.1086/203932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griaule's daughter Geneviève Calame-Griaule responded in a later issue, arguing that Van Beek did not go "through the appropriate steps for acquiring knowledge" and suggesting that van Beek's Dogon informants may have thought that he had been "sent by the political and administrative authorities to test the Dogon's Muslim orthodoxy".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Calame-Griaule: "On the Dogon Restudied". Current Anthropology, Vol. 32, No. 5 (December 1991), pp. 575–577&lt;/ref&gt;  An independent assessment is given by Andrew Apter of the University of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/apter/Cahiers.pdf| title = Griaule's Legacy: Rethinking "la parole claire" in Dogon Studies| author = Andrew Apter, ''[[Cahiers d'Études africaines]]'', XLV (1), 177, (2005), pp. 95–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 critique, skeptic Ian Ridpath concluded: "There are any number of channels by which the Dogon could have received Western knowledge long before they were visited by Griaule and Dieterlen."&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath, Ian (1978) [https://web.archive.org/web/20030217073018/http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html "Investigating the Sirius Mystery"] Skeptical Inquirer, vol.3, no.1, pp.56–62&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Sirius Matters'', Noah Brosch postulates that the Dogon may have had contact with astronomers based in Dogon territory during a five-week expedition, led by [[Henri-Alexandre Deslandres]], to study the [[Solar eclipse of April 16, 1893|solar eclipse of 16 April 1893]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |first=Noah|last=Brosch|year=2008|title=Sirius Matters|page=66|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ricStR4SE-UC|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] also states that a more likely source of the knowledge of the Sirius star system is from contemporary, terrestrial sources who provided information to interested members of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carroll | first = RT | authorlink = Robert Todd Carroll | title = The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions | url =https://books.google.com/?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA104 | page = 104 | isbn = 0-471-27242-6 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Oberg]], however, citing these suspicions notes their completely speculative nature, writing that, "The obviously advanced astronomical knowledge must have come from somewhere, but is it an ancient bequest or a modern graft? Although Temple fails to prove its antiquity, the evidence for the recent acquisition of the information is still entirely circumstantial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Oberg | first = J | authorlink = James Oberg | url = http://www.debunker.com/texts/dogon.html | title = The Sirius Mystery | accessdate = 2008-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] notes that Griaule sought informants best qualified to speak of traditional lore, and deeply mistrusted converts to Christianity, Islam, or people with too much contact with whites.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]], 'Power and Dialogue in Ethnography:Marcel Griaule’s initiation,’ in George W. Stocking (ed.) ''Observers observed: essays on ethnographic fieldwork'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1983 pp. 121–156, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

Oberg points out a number of errors contained in the Dogon beliefs, including the number of moons possessed by [[Jupiter]], that [[Saturn]] was the furthest planet from the sun, and the only planet with rings. Intrigue of other seemingly falsifiable claims, namely concerning a red dwarf star orbiting around Sirius (not hypothesized until the 1950s) led him to entertain a previous challenge by Temple, asserting that "Temple offered another line of reasoning. 'We have in the Dogon information a predictive mechanism which it is our duty to test, regardless of our preconceptions.' One example: 'If a Sirius-C is ever discovered and found to be a red dwarf, I will conclude that the Dogon information has been fully validated.'

This alludes to reports that the Dogon knew of another star in the Sirius system, Ęmmę Ya, or a star "larger than Sirius B but lighter and dim in magnitude". In 1995, gravitational studies indeed showed the possible presence of a [[brown dwarf]] star orbiting around Sirius (a Sirius-C) with a six-year orbital period.&lt;ref&gt;Benest, D. and Duvent, J. L. (1995). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A&amp;A...299..621B "Is Sirius a triple star?"] Astronomy and Astrophysics 299: 621–628&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study using advanced infrared imaging concluded that the probability of the existence of a triple star system for Sirius is "now low" but could not be ruled out because the region within 5 AU of Sirius A had not been covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''FareShare''' is a charity aimed at relieving food poverty and reducing [[food waste in the United Kingdom|food waste]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/yorkslincs/series7/supermarket_landfills.shtml BBC Inside Out]&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK. It does this by rescuing good quality surplus food that would otherwise have gone to waste and sending it to almost 10,000 charity and community groups across the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/huge-rise-in-food-redistribution-to-people-in-need-across-uk|title=Huge rise in food redistribution to people in need across UK|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=28 May 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 August 2018|authorlink=Rebecca Smithers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FareShare only redistributes food inside its best before and [[use by date]]; in 2016/7 they rescued over 17,000 tonnes of food which would have otherwise gone to waste or [[landfill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/huge-rise-in-food-redistribution-to-people-in-need-across-uk|title=Huge rise in food redistribution to people in need across UK|author=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=28 May 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 August 2018|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FareShare works with all sectors of the supply chain; producers, manufacturers and retailers. All of the major UK food retailers have encouraged their suppliers to work with FareShare to minimise food waste. FareShare has also run two successful food drives with both [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Tesco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the charity announced a three year £20 million partnership with [[Asda|ASDA]] and The Trussell Trust with the aim of helping more than one million people out of food poverty over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/home/topics/waste-not-want-not/asda-set-to-spend-20m-on-key-food-waste-charities/563157.article|title=Asda set to spend £20m on key food waste charities|last=Quinn|first=Ian|date=8 February 2018|work=The Grocer|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FareShare contributed towards more than 36.7 million meals in 2016/17, which equates to feeding over 772,000 people a week. The food FareShare supplies enables the charity sector to make £28.7 million in savings per year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/huge-rise-in-food-redistribution-to-people-in-need-across-uk|title=Huge rise in food redistribution to people in need across UK|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=2018-05-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This food is delivered to a broad range of frontline charities and community groups across the UK including [[homeless shelters]], day centres, women’s refuge centres and children's breakfast clubs.

==Awards==
In 2010 the charity won "Britain's Most Admired Charity" at the [[Third Sector (magazine)|Third Sector]] awards.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/britains-admired-charities/governance/article/990733 |title=Britain's Most Admired Charities |first=Tristan |last=Donovan |work=[[Third Sector (magazine)|Third Sector]] |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the charity won "Charity of the Year" at both the Charity Times awards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitytimes.com/awards/winners17.php|title=Charity Times Awards|website=www.charitytimes.com|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Third Sector Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdsectorexcellenceawards.com/winners-2017/|title=Winners 2017 - Third Sector Awards|last=webvid.co.uk|website=Third Sector Awards|language=en|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and were selected for [[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'s Christmas Charity Appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/telegraph-christmas-charity-appeal-2017-chosen-charities/|title=Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal 2017: Our chosen charities|last=Reporters|first=Telegraph|date=2017-11-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since he did not talk, look, or act like a slave (in the eyes of Northern audiences), Douglass was denounced as an imposter."&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass wrote several autobiographies. He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography, ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]''. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, it covered events during and after the Civil War. Douglass also actively supported [[women's suffrage]], and held several public offices. Without his approval, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States [[United States presidential election, 1872|as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee of]] [[Victoria Woodhull]], on the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] ticket.&lt;ref name=VP/&gt;

Douglass was a firm believer in the [[Egalitarianism|equality]] of all peoples, whether [[African Americans|black]], [[Woman|female]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], or recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]]. He was also a believer in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, and in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution. When radical abolitionists, under the motto "No Union With Slaveholders", criticized Douglass' willingness to dialogue with slave owners, he famously replied: "I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong."&lt;ref name=uniteQuote&gt;{{Cite book

==Life as a slave==
Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Talbot County, Maryland]]. The plantation was between [[Hillsboro, Maryland|Hillsboro]]&lt;ref name="Narrative" /&gt; and [[Cordova, Maryland|Cordova]]; his birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin{{efn|"The old cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads upstairs, and its clay floor downstairs, and its dirt chimney, and windowless sides, ... was MY HOME – the only home I ever had; and I loved it, and all connected with it.  The old fences around it, and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it, and the squirrels that ran, skipped, and played upon them, were objects of interest and affection.  There, too, right at the side of the hut, stood the old well." {{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/douglass55/douglass55.html#p44|title=My Bondage and My Freedom|first=Frederick|last=Douglass|year=1855|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}}} east of Tappers Corner, ({{Coord|38.8845|-75.958|region:US-WI_type:landmark|display=inline}}) and west of [[Tuckahoe Creek]].&lt;ref name=Barker1996&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;br /&gt;Frederick Douglass began his own story thus: "I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland." (Tuckahoe is not a town; it refers to the area west of the creek in Talbot County.) In successive autobiographies, Douglass gave more precise estimates of when he was born, his final estimate being 1817. He adopted February 14 as his birthday because his mother Harriet Bailey used to call him her "little [[Valentine's Day|valentine]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slaves were punished for learning to read or write, and so could not keep records. Based on the extant records of Douglass's former owner, Aaron Anthony, historian [[Dickson Preston]] determined that Douglass was born in February 1818. McFeely, 1991, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass was of mixed race, which likely included Native American and African on his mother's side, as well as European.&lt;ref name=pbs-WGBH&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Black? One Nation's Definition|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html|work=Frontline |publisher=WGBH |accessdate=November 27, 2015|ref=pbs-WGBH}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was "almost certainly white," as shown by historian [[David W. Blight]] in his 2018 biography of Douglass.&lt;ref name="gopnik76"&gt;Adam Gopnik, "American Prophet", ''The New Yorker'', 15 October 2018, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He said his mother Harriet Bailey gave him his grand name. After escaping to the North years later, he took the surname [[Douglass family|Douglass]], having already dropped his two middle names.

He later wrote of his earliest times with his mother:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The opinion was ... whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion I know nothing ... My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant ... It [was] common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. ... I do not recollect ever seeing my mother by the light of day. ... She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave.

After this early separation from his mother, young Frederick lived with his maternal grandmother, Betty Bailey. At the age of six, he was separated from his grandmother and moved to the [[Wye House]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hstc.org/museum-gardens/frederick-douglass|title="Frederick Douglass", The Historical Society of Talbot County, Maryland|access-date=December 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222223221/http://www.hstc.org/museum-gardens/frederick-douglass|archive-date=December 22, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass's mother died when he was about ten. After Anthony died, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas' brother Hugh Auld in [[Baltimore]]. He felt himself lucky to be in the city, where he said slaves were almost freemen, compared to those on plantations.&lt;ref name="gopnik76"/&gt;
{{Slavery}}
When Douglass was about twelve, Hugh Auld's wife Sophia started teaching him the [[alphabet]]. Douglass described her as a kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him "as she supposed one human being ought to treat another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave. Written by himself| chapter = Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage slaves to desire freedom; Douglass later referred to this as the "first decidedly antislavery lecture" he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick.

Dover Value Editions, Courier Dover Publications, 2003. {{ISBN|0-486-43170-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under her husband's influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave.

Douglass continued, secretly, to teach himself how to read and write. He later often said, "knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, H. and Appiah, K. (2004). ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave &amp; Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.'' pp. xiii, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited ''[[The Columbian Orator]]'', an anthology that he discovered at about age twelve, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. The book, first published in 1797, is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar.

When Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he taught other slaves on the plantation to read the [[New Testament]] at a weekly [[Sunday school]]. As word spread, the interest among slaves in learning to read was so great that in any week, more than 40 slaves would attend lessons. For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed. While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated. One Sunday they burst in on the gathering, armed with clubs and stones, to disperse the congregation permanently.

In 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh ("[a]s a means of punishing Hugh," Douglass later wrote). Thomas Auld sent Douglass to work for [[Edward Covey]], a poor farmer who had a reputation as a "slave-breaker". He whipped Douglass regularly, and nearly broke him psychologically. The sixteen-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings, however, and fought back. After Douglass won a physical confrontation, Covey never tried to beat him again.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Jerome.

==From slavery to freedom==
Douglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him out from his owner [[Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland)|Colonel Lloyd]], but was unsuccessful. In 1836, he tried to escape from his new master Covey, but failed again. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with [[Anna Murray-Douglass|Anna Murray]], a [[Free people of color|free black]] woman in Baltimore about five years older than he. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;
[[File:Anna Murray-Douglass (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Anna Murray-Douglass]], Douglass's wife for 44 years, portrait ca. 1860.]]
On September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a train from the newly merged [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (P.W.&amp; B.) railroad line to the great Northern cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The area where he boarded was a short distance east of the previous temporary P.W.&amp; B. train depot in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of [[Harbor East]] and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]]. The depot was located at President and Fleet streets, east of [[Inner Harbor|"The Basin"]] of the [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore harbor]], on the Northwest Branch of the [[Patapsco River]]. (This depot was replaced by the historic [[President Street Station]], constructed 1849–1850; it was noted as a site of other slave escapes along one of many routes of the famous "[[Underground Railroad]]" and during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].)

Young Douglass reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], in the northeast corner of the state, along the southwest shore of the [[Susquehanna River]], which flowed into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Although this placed him some 20 miles from the free state of Pennsylvania, it was easier to travel through Delaware, another slave state. Dressed in a sailor's [[uniform]] provided to him by Murray, who also gave him part of her savings to cover his travel costs, he carried identification papers and [[protection papers]] that he had obtained from a free black seaman.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Julius Eric Thompson|author2=James L.

From there, because the rail line was not yet completed, he went by [[steamboat]] along the [[Delaware River]] further northeast to the "Quaker City" of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, an anti-slavery stronghold. He continued to the safe house of noted abolitionist [[David Ruggles]] in [[History of New York City|New York City]]. His entire journey to freedom took less than 24 hours.&lt;ref name=SouthCoast&gt;{{Cite news | title= Discovering Anna Murray Douglass | date=February 17, 2008| work=[[South Coast Today]] | url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080217/NEWS/802170364| accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Douglass later wrote of his arrival in New York City:

{{quote|I have often been asked, how I felt when first I found myself on free soil. And my readers may share the same curiosity. There is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath, and the 'quick round of blood,' I lived more in one day than in a year of my slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: 'I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions.' Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8ILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |page=170 |accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once Douglass had arrived, he sent for Murray to follow him north to New York. She brought with her the necessary basics for them to set up a home. They were married on September 15, 1838, by a black [[Presbyterian]] minister, just eleven days after Douglass had reached New York.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SouthCoast /&gt; At first, they adopted Johnson as their married name, to divert attention.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;

Douglass thought of joining a white Methodist Church but from the beginning, he was disappointed when he saw it was segregated. Later he joined the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], an independent [[black church|black denomination]] first established in New York City, which counted among its members [[Sojourner Truth]] and [[Harriet Tubman]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice S. Lee (2009), ''The Cambridge Companion to Frederick Douglass''. Cambridge University Press, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a licensed preacher in 1839,&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/frederick_douglass.html|title=This Far by Faith. Frederick Douglass |publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this helped him hone his oratorical skills. He held various positions, including steward, Sunday School superintendent, and sexton. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in [[Elmira, New York]], then a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. (Years later, a black congregation formed there and by 1940 it became the region's largest church.)&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"&gt;[http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass/ "Religious Facts You Might Not Know about Frederick Douglass"], ''Religion News'', 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass also joined several organizations in New Bedford, and regularly attended abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s weekly journal ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. Inspired by Garrison, Douglass later said, "no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments [of the hatred of slavery] as did those of William Lloyd Garrison." So deep was this influence that in his last biography, Douglass confessed "his paper took a place in my heart second only to The Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass (2008). ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass''. Cosimo, Inc. p. 149 {{ISBN|9781605203997}} (first published in 1881).&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass, and had written about his anti-colonialism stance in ''The Liberator'' as early as 1839. In 1841, Douglass first heard Garrison speak at a meeting of the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later Douglass spoke at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in [[Nantucket]]. Then 23 years old, Douglass conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his rough life as a slave.

While living in Lynn, Douglass engaged in early protest against the segregation in transportation. In September 1841 at [[Lynn station|Lynn Central Square station]], Douglass and friend [[James N. Buffum]] were thrown off an [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] train because Douglass refused to sit in the segregated railroad coach.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.civilrightsteaching.org/desegregation/transportation-protests/ |title=Transportation Protests: 1841 to 1992 |website=www.civilrightsteaching.org |language=en |access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://primaryresearch.org/resistance-to-the-segregation-of-public-transportation-in-the-early-1840s/ |title=Resistance to the Segregation of Public Transportation in the Early 1840’s |website=primaryresearch.org |language=en |access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikisource-inline|Page:My Bondage and My Freedom (1855).djvu/411 |single=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Douglass joined other speakers in the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]'s "Hundred Conventions" project, a six-month tour at meeting halls throughout the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]]. During this tour, slavery supporters frequently accosted Douglass. At a lecture in [[Pendleton, Indiana]], an angry mob chased and beat Douglass before a local Quaker family, the Hardys, rescued him. His hand was broken in the attack; it healed improperly and bothered him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8ILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |pages=287–88 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stone marker in Falls Park in the [[Pendleton Historic District (Pendleton, Indiana)|Pendleton Historic District]] commemorates this event.

===Autobiography===
Douglass's best-known work is his first autobiography ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', written during his time in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.itemlive.com/2018/02/02/re-examining-fredrick-douglasss-time-lynn/ |title=Re-Examining Fredrick Douglass's Time In Lynn |publisher=Lynn Daily Item / itemlive.com |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and published in Europe.

Douglass published three versions of his autobiography during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 ''Narrative'' was his biggest seller, and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]''. In 1881, after the Civil War, Douglass published ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]'', which he revised in 1892.

===Travels to Ireland and Great Britain===
[[File:Unidentified Artist - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project-restore.png|215px|thumb|Douglass in 1847, around 29 years of age]]
Douglass' friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his "property" back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the ''Cambria'' for [[Liverpool]] on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] was beginning.

The feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlour—I dine at the same table—and no one is offended ... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, {{'}}''We don't allow niggers in here!''{{'}}&lt;ref name="My Bondage"&gt;Frederick Douglass, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]: Part I – Life as a Slave, Part II – Life as a Freeman'', with an introduction by James M'Cune Smith.

Douglass spent two years in Ireland and Great Britain, where he gave many lectures in churches and chapels. His draw was such that some facilities were "crowded to suffocation". One example was his hugely popular ''London Reception Speech'', which Douglass delivered in May 1846 at [[Alexander Fletcher (minister)|Alexander Fletcher's]] [[Finsbury Chapel]]. Douglass remarked that in England he was treated not "as a color, but as a man."&lt;ref name="Ruuth"&gt;Marianne Ruuth (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lx8nXxmAlcC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglass%20-%20england%20-%20not%20%22as%20a%20color%2C%20but%20as%20a%20man Frederick Douglass], pp.&amp;nbsp;117–18. Holloway House Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Douglass met with [[Thomas Clarkson]], one of the last living British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]], who had persuaded Parliament to abolish slavery in Great Britain's colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], ''[[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006, pp. 415–21.&lt;/ref&gt; During this trip Douglass became legally free, as British supporters led by [[Anna Richardson (abolitionist)|Anna Richardson]] and her sister-in-law Ellen of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] raised funds to buy his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld.&lt;ref name="Ruuth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Return to the United States===
[[File:Frederick Douglass by Samuel J Miller, 1847-52.png|thumb|Douglass circa 1847–52, around his early 30s]]
After returning to the U.S. in 1847, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|North Star]]'', from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass|title=5 religious facts you might not know about Frederick Douglass|work=Religion News Service|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''North Star'''s motto was "Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren." The AME Church and ''North Star'' vigorously opposed the mostly white [[American Colonization Society]] and its proposal to send blacks back to Africa. This and Douglass's later abolitionist newspapers were mainly funded by English supporters, who gave Douglass five hundred pounds to use as he chose.&lt;ref name="Ruuth"/&gt; Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the ''North Star'' competed with Garrison's ''[[National Anti-Slavery Standard]]'' and Marius Robinson's ''Anti-Slavery Bugle''.

Douglass also came to consider Garrison too radical. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. But, [[Lysander Spooner]] published ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1846), which explored the [[United States Constitution]] as an anti-slavery document. Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fanuzzi, "Frederick Douglass' 'Colored Newspaper': Identity Politics in Black and White," in ''The Black Press: New Literary and Historical Essays'', edited by Todd Vogel (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2001), pp. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1848, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and enquiring after members of his family still held by Auld.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglass1848"/&gt; In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he would feel if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619–1895: from the colonial period to the age of Frederick Douglass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-y0OAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=February 2, 2011|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=104–05|isbn=978-0-19-516777-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglass1848"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/02/i-am-your-fellow-man-but-not-your-slave.html|title=I am your fellow man, but not your slave |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
In 1848, Douglass was the only African American to attend the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, in upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/seneca_falls |title=Seneca Falls Convention |publisher=Virginia Memory |date=August 18, 1920 |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 1997, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;USConstitution.net. [http://www.usconstitution.net/sentiments.html Text of the "Declaration of Sentiments", and the Resolutions]. Retrieved on April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers [[James Mott|James]] and [[Lucretia Mott]].&lt;ref name=McMillen93/&gt; Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could not also claim that right. He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere.

{{quote|In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.&lt;ref name=McMillen93&gt;McMillen, 2008, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Douglass's powerful words, the attendees passed the resolution.&lt;ref name=McMillen93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. Women's Rights. [http://www.nps.gov/wori/historyculture/report-of-the-womans-rights-convention.htm Report of the Woman's Rights Convention, July 19–20, 1848]. Retrieved April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial spot in his paper, the North Star, to press the case for women's rights in this public venue. The article was two-fold: it recalled the "marked ability and dignity" of the proceedings and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.

On the first count, Douglass acknowledged the "decorum" of the participants in the face of disagreement. The latter half discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and his own discussion of the "infant" feminist cause. Strikingly, he expressed the belief that "[a] discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency ... than would be a discussion of the rights of women," and Douglass noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.

His opinion as the prominent editor of the paper likely carried weight, and he stated the position of the North Star explicitly: "[w]e hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man." This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, "right is of no sex."

Later, after the Civil War when the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] to give freedmen and free blacks the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for [[universal suffrage]], and opposed any bill that split the issues.&lt;ref name="DouglassO'Meally2003"/&gt; Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.&lt;ref name="Foner, p.600"&gt;Foner, p.  600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote.&lt;ref name="Foner, p.600"/&gt; Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTV8OsmDQPcC&amp;pg=PA138 |page=138 |title=The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia |last=Watkins |first=Valetha |chapter=National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) |editor=Julius E. Thompson |editor2=James L. Conyers Jr. |editor3=Nancy Dawson |publisher=Greenwood/ABC_CLIO |year=2009 |isbn=9780313385599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Douglass refines his ideology===
[[File:Motto frederick douglass 2.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age]]

Meanwhile, in 1851, Douglass merged the ''North Star'' with [[Gerrit Smith]]'s ''Liberty Party Paper'' to form ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', which was published until 1860.

On July 5, 1852, Douglass delivered an address to the ladies of the Rochester Anti-Slavery Sewing Society. This speech eventually became known as "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"; one biographer called it "perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William S. McFeely|title=Frederick Douglass|date=1991|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0393634112|format=hardcover|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester. His was one of 5 names attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, ''The Claims of Our Common Cause'', along with [[Amos Noë Freeman]], [[James Monroe Whitfield]], [[Henry O. Wagoner]], and [[George Boyer Vashon]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick. Frederick Douglass: Selected speeches and writings. Chicago Review Press, 2000. pp. 260–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.

[[File:Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry - NARA - 559102.jpg|thumb|''Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry'', painting by [[Jacob Lawrence]]]]

On March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[George DeBaptiste]], and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Underground Railroad, US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center. Diane Publishing, February 1, 1995, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass met Brown again, when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on [[Harpers Ferry Armory|the federal armory]] in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. However, Douglass disapproved of Brown's plan to start an armed [[slave rebellion]] in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Douglass believed that attacking federal property would enrage the American public. After the raid, Douglass fled for a time to Canada, fearing guilt by association as well as arrest as a co-conspirator. Years later, Douglass shared a stage in Harpers Ferry with [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]], the prosecutor who secured Brown's conviction and execution.

In March 1860, while Douglass was once again traveling in England, his youngest daughter Annie died in [[Rochester, New York]]. Douglass sailed back from England the following month, traveling through Canada to avoid detection.

====Photography====
Douglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white, as photographs were an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views.&lt;ref name="Picturing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Stauffer|author2=Zoe Trodd|author3=Celeste-Marie Bernie|author4=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|author5=Kenneth B.

==Religious views==
As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the Bible. In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Conyers &amp; Dawson (2009). ''The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul. 2006. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619–1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass Three-volume Set''. Oxford University Press. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He described this approach in his last biography, ''Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to "cast all my care upon God." This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick (1882); ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass: From 1817–1882''. 3rd edition by John Lobb. Christian Age Office. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Douglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy&lt;ref name="lib.rochester.edu"&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2945], University of Rochester Frederick Douglass Project. Retrieved on November 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and accused slaveholders of ''[[wickedness]]'', lack of morality, and failure to follow the [[Golden Rule]]. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the "Christianity of Christ" and the "Christianity of America" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented "wolves in sheep's clothing".&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, 2006. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See his lecture: ''Love of God, Love of Man, Love of Country''. Delivered at Market Hall, New York City October 22, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, in a famous oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a ''[[blasphemy]]'' when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was "one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church "stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form", and "an abomination in the sight of God". Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, [[Ichabod Spencer]], and [[Orville Dewey]], he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that "we ought to obey man's law before the law of God". He further asserted, "in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... [[Henry Ward Beecher]] of Brooklyn, [[Samuel J. May]] of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]". He maintained that "upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains". In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, "let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds."&lt;ref name="lib.rochester.edu"/&gt;

During his visits to the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American Churches that permitted slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Conyers &amp; Dawson (2009). The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

On his return to the United States, Douglass founded the ''North Star'', a weekly publication with the motto "Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren." Douglass later wrote a letter to his former slaveholder, in which he denounced him for leaving Douglass's family illiterate:

{{quote|Your wickedness and cruelty committed in this respect on your fellow creatures, are greater than all the stripes you have laid upon my back or theirs. It is an outrage upon the soul, a war upon the immortal spirit, and one for which you must give account at the bar of our common Father and Creator.|Letter to His Old Master. To my Old Master Thomas Auld.&lt;ref name="My Bondage" /&gt;}}

==Civil War years==
===Before the Civil War===
By the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as [[women's rights]]. His eloquence gathered crowds at every location. His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.

===Fight for emancipation and suffrage===
[[File:Men of Color Civil War Recruitment Broadside 1863.png|thumb|1863 Broadside listing Douglass as a speaker calling men of color to arms]]
Douglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. In August 1861, Douglass published an account of the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] that noted that there were some blacks already in the Confederate ranks.&lt;ref name="Black Confederates"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/black-confederates/|title= Black Confederates}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Douglass brought the subject up again, quoting a witness to the battle who said they saw black Confederates "with muskets on their shoulders and bullets in their pockets."&lt;ref name="Black Confederates"/&gt; Douglass conferred with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; and with President [[Andrew Johnson]] on the subject of black [[suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which took effect on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory.&lt;ref&gt;Slaves in Union-held areas were not covered by this war-measures act.&lt;/ref&gt; (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with the adoption of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries."&lt;ref name="thecivilwaryears-thefightforemancipation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html|title=The Fight For Emancipation|accessdate=April 19, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708000612/http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html|archivedate=July 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1864|U.S. Presidential Election of 1864]], Douglass supported [[John C. Frémont#Presidential candidate Radical Democracy Party 1864|John C. Frémont]], who was the candidate of the abolitionist [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]]. Douglass was disappointed that President Lincoln did not publicly endorse [[suffrage]] for black freedmen. Douglass believed that since African-American men were fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, they deserved the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the North no longer obliged to return slaves to their owners in the South, Douglass fought for equality for his people. He made plans with Lincoln to move liberated slaves out of the South. During the war, Douglass also helped the Union cause by serving as a recruiter for the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]]. His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, but was ill for much of his service.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of [[Fort Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;William S. McFeely, ''Frederick Douglass'' (New York: W. W. Norton, 1991), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.

===After Lincoln's death===
The post-war (1865) ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] outlawed slavery. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] provided for citizenship and equal protection under the law. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race.&lt;ref name="DouglassO'Meally2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick Douglass|author2=Robert G. O'Meally|title=Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIwdPfWvjMC&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=February 1, 2011|date=November 30, 2003|publisher=Spark Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-59308-041-9|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1876, Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the [[Emancipation Memorial]] in Washington's Lincoln Park. In that speech, Douglass spoke frankly about Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln "the white man's president", Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination. But Douglass also asked, "Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed [[Emancipation Proclamation|the first day of January 1863]], when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=39 |title=Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln by Frederick Douglass|publisher=Teaching American History |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass also said: "Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery ..."

The crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln's widow [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]] supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite [[walking-stick]] to Douglass in appreciation. That walking-stick still rests in Douglass's final residence, "Cedar Hill", now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

==Reconstruction era==
[[File:George Kendall Warren - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Douglass in 1876, around 58 years of age]]

After the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African-Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Freedman's Savings Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass also became chargé d'affaires for the Dominican Republic, but resigned that position after two years because of disagreements with U.S. government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, G. Pope. ''The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism'', University of Georgia Press, 1998, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, white insurgents had quickly arisen in the South after the war, organizing first as secret [[vigilante]] groups, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as "the military arm of the Democratic Party", turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 10 years after the end of the war, Democrats regained political power in every state of the former Confederacy and began to reassert white supremacy. They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing [[racial segregation|segregation]] and a concerted effort to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12–13, accessed March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to combat these efforts, Douglass supported the presidential campaign of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]]. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the ''New National Era'', attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; President Grant sent a Congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate if the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South allowing [[African Americans]] their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, however, Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who opposed annexation, stating if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would "regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent."&lt;ref name="Brands 2012a"&gt;Brands (2012), ''The Man Who Saved the Union Ulysses S Grant In War and Peace'', p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2000-2008 17th Street, NW.JPG|thumb|left|Douglass' former residence in the [[U Street Corridor]] of Washington, D.C. He built 2000–2004 17th Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|N.W.]], in 1875.]]

After the midterm elections, Grant signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (also known as the Klan Act), and the second and third [[Enforcement Acts]]. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites, but earned Douglass's praise. An associate of Douglass wrote of Grant that African Americans "will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services."

In 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as [[Victoria Woodhull]]'s running mate on the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] ticket. He was nominated without his knowledge. Douglass neither campaigned for the ticket nor acknowledged that he had been nominated.&lt;ref name=VP&gt;{{cite book

However, in early June of that year, Douglass' home on South Avenue in Rochester, New York, burned down; arson was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;''Democrat and Chronicle'' (Rochester, New York), June 3, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Daily Union and Advertiser'' (Rochester, New York), June 3, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; There was extensive damage to the house, its furnishings, and the grounds; in addition, sixteen volumes of the ''North Star'' and ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'' were lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Daily Union and Advertiser'' (Rochester, New York), June 17, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass then moved to Washington, D.C.

Throughout the Reconstruction era, Douglass continued speaking, and emphasized the importance of work, voting rights and actual exercise of suffrage. Douglass's stump speech for 25 years after the end of the Civil War emphasized work to counter the racism that was then prevalent in unions.&lt;ref&gt;Olasky, Marvin. "History turned right side up". ''World magazine''. February 13, 2010. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered on November 15, 1867, Douglass said: "A man's rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box and the cartridge box. Let no man be kept from the ballot box because of his color. Let no woman be kept from the ballot box because of her sex."&lt;ref name=auken&gt;{{cite book

==Family life==
[[File:Douglass Helen Eva Frederick.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass after 1884 with his second wife [[Helen Pitts Douglass]] (sitting). The woman standing is her sister Eva Pitts.]]
Douglass and [[Anna Murray-Douglass|Anna]] had five children: [[Rosetta Douglass]], [[Lewis Henry Douglass]], Frederick Douglass Jr., [[Charles Remond Douglass]], and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.

Anna Douglass remained a loyal supporter of her husband's public work. His relationships with [[Julia Griffiths]] and [[Ottilie Assing]], two women with whom he was professionally involved, caused recurring speculation and scandals.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA125"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julius Eric Thompson|author2=James L.

After Anna died in 1882, in 1884 Douglass married again, to [[Helen Pitts Douglass|Helen Pitts]], a white suffragist and abolitionist from [[Honeoye, New York]]. Pitts was the daughter of [[Gideon Pitts Jr]]., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass. A graduate of [[Mount Holyoke College]] (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named ''Alpha'' while living in Washington, D.C. She later worked as Douglass's secretary.&lt;ref name="gopnik"/&gt;

Their marriage provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger than Douglass. Her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage a repudiation of their mother. But feminist [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] congratulated the couple.&lt;ref name="winningthevote"&gt;[http://winningthevote.org/FDouglass.html Frederick Douglass biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211042543/http://winningthevote.org/FDouglass.html |date=February 11, 2006 }} at winningthevote.org.

==Final years in Washington, D.C.==
The Freedman's Savings Bank went bankrupt on June 29, 1874,&lt;ref name="occ.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.occ.gov/about/what-we-do/history/freedman-savings-bank.html|title=The Freedman's Savings Bank: Good Intentions Were Not Enough; A Noble Experiment Goes Awry|date=March 3, 2015|website=www.occ.gov|language=en-US|access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; just a few months after Douglass became its president in late March.&lt;ref name="occ.gov"/&gt; During that same economic crisis, his final newspaper, ''The New National Era'', failed in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/frederick-douglass-chronology.htm|title=Frederick Douglass Chronology - Frederick Douglass National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] was elected President, Douglass accepted an appointment as [[United States Marshal]] for the [[District of Columbia]], which helped assure his family's financial security.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass House.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site|Cedar Hill]]'', Douglass' house in the [[Anacostia Historic District|Anacostia]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., is preserved as a [[List of areas in the United States National Park System#National historic sites|National Historic Site]].]]

In 1877, Douglass visited Thomas Auld, who was by then on his deathbed, and the two men reconciled. Douglass had met Auld's daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior; she had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass' speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105" /&gt;

That same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family's final home in Washington D.C., on a hill above the [[Anacostia River]]. He and Anna named it ''Cedar Hill'' (also spelled ''CedarHill''). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms, and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15&amp;nbsp;acres (61,000&amp;nbsp;m²). The home is now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

In 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass''. That year he was appointed as [[Recorder of Deeds]] for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray-Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist [[Ida B. Wells]]. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.

Douglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With his new wife, Helen, Douglass traveled to England, Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt and Greece from 1886 to 1887. Douglass also became known for advocating [[Irish Home Rule]] and supported [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in Ireland.

Many African Americans, called [[Exoduster]]s, escaped the Klan and racially discriminatory laws in the South by moving to [[Kansas]], where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the [[Back-to-Africa movement]]. He thought the latter resembled the [[American Colonization Society]] which he had opposed in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop [[Henry McNeal Turner]], Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled.

==Death==
On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a massive heart attack.&lt;ref name="frederick-douglass-heritage.org"/&gt; He was 77.

His funeral was held at the [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Thousands of people passed by his coffin to show their respect. Although Douglass had attended several churches in the nation's capital, he had a pew here and donated two standing candelabras when this church had moved to a new building in 1886. He also gave many lectures there, including his last major speech, "The Lesson of the Hour."&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"/&gt;

Douglass' coffin was transported back to [[Rochester, New York]], where he had lived for 25 years, longer than anywhere else in his life. He was buried next to Anna in the Douglass family plot of [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester|Mount Hope Cemetery]], and Helen joined them in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|7407760|Anna Murray Douglass (1813–1882)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|7407772|Helen Pitts Douglass (1838–1903)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freethought-trail.org/site.php?By=SiteType&amp;Page=3&amp;Site=50|title=The Freethought Trail|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Finkenbine argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!&lt;ref&gt;Roy E. Finkenbine. [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00186.html "Douglass, Frederick"], ''American National Biography Online'', 2000. Accessdate: March 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Episcopal Church (USA)]] remembers Douglass annually on its [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar]] for February 20, the anniversary of his death. Many public schools have also been named in his honor. Douglass still has living descendants today, such as Ken Morris, who is also a descendant of [[Booker T.

{{Nanotech}}
'''Green nanotechnology''' refers to the use of [[nanotechnology]] to enhance the environmental sustainability of processes producing [[negative externalities]]. It also refers to the use of the products of nanotechnology to enhance [[sustainability]].  It includes making green nano-products and using nano-products in support of sustainability.

Green nanotechnology has been described as the development of [[clean technologies]], "to minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products, and to encourage replacement of existing products with new nano-products that are more environmentally friendly throughout their [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|lifecycle]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/topics/green/ |title=Environment and Green Nano - Topics - Nanotechnology Project |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aim==
Green nanotechnology has two goals: producing [[nanomaterials]] and products without harming the environment or human health, and producing nano-products that provide solutions to environmental problems. It uses existing principles of [[green chemistry]] and [[green engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppt/greenengineering/pubs/whats_ge.html What is Green Engineering], US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt; to make nanomaterials and nano-products without toxic ingredients, at low temperatures using less energy and renewable inputs wherever possible, and using lifecycle thinking in all design and engineering stages.

In addition to making nanomaterials and products with less impact to the environment, green nanotechnology also means using nanotechnology to make current manufacturing processes for non-nano materials and products more environmentally friendly. For example, nanoscale [[artificial membrane|membranes]] can help separate desired chemical reaction products from waste materials. Nanoscale [[Catalysis|catalysts]] can make chemical reactions more efficient and less wasteful. [[Sensor]]s at the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] can form a part of [[Process control|process control systems]], working with nano-enabled information systems. Using [[alternative energy]] systems, made possible by nanotechnology, is another way to "green" manufacturing processes.

The second goal of green nanotechnology involves developing products that benefit the environment either directly or indirectly. Nanomaterials or products directly can clean [[hazardous waste]] sites, [[Desalination|desalinate water]], treat pollutants, or sense and monitor environmental pollutants. Indirectly, lightweight [[nanocomposite]]s for automobiles and other means of transportation could save fuel and reduce materials used for production; nanotechnology-enabled [[fuel cell]]s and [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) could reduce pollution from energy generation and help conserve fossil fuels; self-cleaning nanoscale surface coatings could reduce or eliminate many cleaning chemicals used in regular maintenance routines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Nano Coatings|url=http://www.nanoshell.co.uk/sustainable-protective-coatings|publisher=nanoShell Ltd|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced battery life could lead to less material use and less waste. Green Nanotechnology takes a broad systems view of nanomaterials and products, ensuring that unforeseen consequences are minimized and that impacts are anticipated throughout the full life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/NanoLCA_3.07.pdf Nanotechnology and Life Cycle Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

===Solar cells===
{{Main|Energy applications of nanotechnology}}
Research is underway to use nanomaterials for purposes including more efficient [[solar cell]]s, practical [[fuel cell]]s, and [[Nanobatteries|environmentally friendly batteries]].  The most advanced nanotechnology projects related to energy are: storage, conversion, manufacturing improvements by reducing materials and process rates, energy saving (by better thermal insulation for example), and enhanced renewable energy sources.

One major project that is being worked on is the development of nanotechnology in solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2014/02/nano-flake-technology-a-cheaper-way-to-produce-solar-cells Nano Flake Technology – A Cheaper Way to Produce Solar Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Solar cells are more efficient as they get tinier and [[solar energy]] is a [[renewable resource]]. The price per watt of solar energy is lower than one dollar.

Research is ongoing to use [[nanowires]] and other nanostructured materials with the hope of to create cheaper and more efficient solar cells than are possible with conventional planar silicon solar cells.&lt;ref name="TianZheng2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tian|first1=Bozhi|last2=Zheng|first2=Xiaolin|last3=Kempa|first3=Thomas J.|last4=Fang|first4=Ying|last5=Yu|first5=Nanfang|last6=Yu|first6=Guihua|last7=Huang|first7=Jinlin|last8=Lieber|first8=Charles M.|title=Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources|journal=Nature|volume=449|issue=7164|year=2007|pages=885–889|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature06181|pmid=17943126|bibcode=2007Natur.449..885T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohlinAl-Obeidi2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johlin|first1=Eric|last2=Al-Obeidi|first2=Ahmed|last3=Nogay|first3=Gizem|last4=Stuckelberger|first4=Michael|last5=Buonassisi|first5=Tonio|last6=Grossman|first6=Jeffrey C.|title=Nanohole Structuring for Improved Performance of Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon Photovoltaics|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=8|issue=24|year=2016|pages=15169–15176|issn=1944-8244|doi=10.1021/acsami.6b00033|pmid=27227369|hdl=1721.1/111823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the use of fuel cells powered by hydrogen, potentially using a catalyst consisting of carbon supported noble metal particles with diameters of 1–5&amp;nbsp;nm. Materials with small nanosized pores may be suitable for hydrogen storage.  Nanotechnology may also find [[Nanobatteries|applications in batteries]], where the use of [[nanomaterials]] may enable batteries with higher energy content or [[supercapacitors]] with a higher rate of recharging.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Nanotechnology is already used to provide improved performance coatings for [[photovoltaic]] (PV) and solar thermal panels. Hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties combine to create more efficient solar panels, especially during inclement weather. PV covered with nanotechnology coatings are said to stay cleaner for longer to ensure maximum energy efficiency is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improved Performance Coatings|url=http://www.nanoshell.co.uk/solar-pv|publisher=nanoShell Ltd|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoremediation and water treatment===
{{Main|Nanofiltration|Nanoremediation}}

Nanotechnology offers the potential of novel [[nanomaterial]]s for the treatment of surface water, [[groundwater]], [[wastewater]], and other environmental materials contaminated by toxic [[metal]] ions, organic and inorganic solutes, and [[microorganism]]s. Due to their unique activity toward recalcitrant contaminants, many nanomaterials are under active research and development for use in the treatment of water and contaminated sites.&lt;ref name= CloeteTE&gt;{{cite book |editor= Cloete, TE et al | year=2010 |title=Nanotechnology in Water Treatment Applications| publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-66-0}}{{pn|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Karn2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.0900793 |pmid=20049198 |pmc=2799454 |title=Nanotechnology and in Situ Remediation: A Review of the Benefits and Potential Risks |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=117 |issue=12 |pages=1813–1831 |year=2009 |last1=Karn |first1=Barbara |last2=Kuiken |first2=Todd |last3=Otto |first3=Martha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present market of nanotech-based technologies applied in water treatment consists of [[reverse osmosis]](RO), nanofiltration, ultrafiltration membranes. Indeed, among emerging products one can name nanofiber filters, carbon nanotubes and various nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanft|first=Susan|title=Market Research Report Nanotechnology in water treatment|year=2011|publisher=BCC Research|location=Wellesley, MA USA|isbn=978-1596237094|page=16|url=http://www.bccresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology is expected to deal more efficiently with contaminants which convectional water treatment systems struggle to treat, including bacteria, viruses and heavy metals. This efficiency generally stems from the very high specific surface area of nanomaterials which increases dissolution, reactivity and sorption of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/157341311796196772 |bibcode=2011CNan....7..640K |title=Nanotechnology for Water Treatment |journal=Current Nanoscience |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=640 |last1=k.

Some nanoremediation methods, particularly the use of nano [[zerovalent iron]] for groundwater cleanup, have been deployed at full-scale cleanup sites.&lt;ref name="EPA1" /&gt; Nanoremediation is an emerging industry; by 2009, nanoremediation technologies had been documented in at least 44 cleanup sites around the world, predominantly in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mueller2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karn20092"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.0900793 |pmid=20049198 |pmc=2799454 |title=Nanotechnology and in Situ Remediation: A Review of the Benefits and Potential Risks |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=117 |issue=12 |pages=1813–1831 |year=2009 |last1=Karn |first1=Barbara |last2=Kuiken |first2=Todd |last3=Otto |first3=Martha }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/remediation_map/|title=Nanoremediation Map|last=Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies|accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During nanoremediation, a nanoparticle agent must be brought into contact with the target contaminant under conditions that allow a detoxifying or immobilizing reaction. This process typically involves a pump-and-treat process or ''in situ'' application. Other methods remain in research phases.

Scientists have been researching the capabilities of [[buckminsterfullerene]] in controlling pollution, as it may be able to control certain chemical reactions. Buckminsterfullerene has been demonstrated as having the ability of inducing the protection of reactive oxygen species and causing lipid peroxidation. This material may allow for hydrogen fuel to be more accessible to consumers.

{{The Thermonuclear Trap Technology (TTT)}}

====Water cleaning technology ====
In 2017 the RingwooditE Co Ltd was formed in order to explore Thermonuclear Trap Technology (TTT) for the purpose of cleaning all sources of water from pollution and toxic contents. This patented nanotechnology uses a high pressure and temperature chamber to separate isotopes that should by nature not be in drinking water to pure drinking water, as to the by the [[WHO]]´s established classification.
This method has been developed by among others, by professor Vladimir Afanasiew, at the Moscow Nuclear Institution. This technology is targeted to clean Sea, river, lake and landfill waste waters. It even removes radioactive isotopes from the sea water, after Nuclear Power Stations catastrophes and cooling water plant towers.
By this technology pharmaca rests are being removed as well as narcotics and tranquilizers. Bottom layers and sides at lake and rivers can be returned, after being cleaned. Machinery used for this purpose are much similar to those of deep sea mining.
Removed waste items are being sorted by the process, and can be re used as raw material for other industrial production.

==== Water filtration ====
{{main|Nanofiltration}}Nanofiltration is a relatively recent [[Membrane technology|membrane filtration]] process used most often with low [[total dissolved solids]] water such as [[surface water]] and fresh [[groundwater]], with the purpose of softening ([[Valence (chemistry)|polyvalent]] [[cation]] removal) and removal of disinfection by-product precursors such as natural [[Organic compound|organic]] matter and synthetic organic matter.&lt;ref name="WQ"&gt;Raymond D. Letterman (ed.)(1999). "Water Quality and Treatment." 5th Ed. (New York: American Water Works Association and McGraw-Hill.) {{ISBN|0-07-001659-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmTec"&gt;Dow Chemical Co. [http://www.dow.com/liquidseps/prod/app_nano.htm Nanofiltration Membranes and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanofiltration is also becoming more widely used in [[food processing]] applications such as [[dairy]], for simultaneous concentration and partial (monovalent [[ion]]) [[Deionization|demineralisation]].

Nanofiltration is a [[Membrane technology|membrane filtration]] based method that uses [[nanometer]] sized cylindrical through-pores that pass through the membrane at a 90°. Nanofiltration membranes have pore sizes from 1-10 [[Angstrom]], smaller than that used in [[microfiltration]] and [[ultrafiltration]], but just larger than that in [[reverse osmosis]]. Membranes used are predominantly created from polymer thin films. Materials that are commonly used include [[polyethylene terephthalate]] or metals such as [[aluminum]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lane A. |last1=Baker |first2=Charles R. |last2=Martin |year=2007 |chapter=Nanotube-Based Membrane Systems |chapterurl=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420004441/chapters/10.1201/9781420004441-16 |editor1-first=Tuan |editor1-last=Vo-Dinh |title=Nanotechnology in Biology and Medicine: Methods, Devices and Applications |isbn=9781420004441 |doi=10.1201/9781420004441-16 |doi-broken-date=2018-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pore dimensions are controlled by [[pH]], temperature and time during development with pore densities ranging from 1 to 106 pores per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Membranes made from polyethylene terephthalate and other similar materials, are referred to as "track-etch" membranes, named after the way the pores on the membranes are made.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2006.05.045 |title=Structure of polycarbonate track-etch membranes: Origin of the "paradoxical" pore shape |journal=Journal of Membrane Science |volume=282 |pages=393–400 |year=2006 |last1=Apel |first1=P. |last2=Blonskaya |first2=I. |last3=Dmitriev |first3=S. |last4=Orelovitch |first4=O. |last5=Sartowska |first5=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tracking" involves bombarding the polymer thin film with high energy particles. This results in making tracks that are chemically developed into the membrane, or "etched" into the membrane, which are the pores. Membranes created from metal such as alumina membranes, are made by electrochemically growing a thin layer of aluminum oxide from aluminum metal in an acidic medium.

Some water-treatment devices incorporating nanotechnology are already on the market, with more in development.  Low-cost nanostructured separation membranes methods have been shown to be effective in producing potable water in a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.350 |pmid=18654395 |bibcode=2007NatNa...2..663H |title=Nanotechnology and the challenge of clean water |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=663–4 |last1=Hillie |first1=Thembela |last2=Hlophe |first2=Mbhuti |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nanotech to disinfect water ====
Nanotechnology provides an alternative solution to clean germs in water, a problem that has been getting worse due to the population explosion, growing need for clean water and the emergence of additional pollutants. One of the alternatives offered is antimicrobial nanotechnology stated that several nanomaterials showed strong antimicrobial properties through diverse mechanisms, such as photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species that damage cell components and viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.350 |pmid=18654395 |bibcode=2007NatNa...2..663H |title=Nanotechnology and the challenge of clean water |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=663–4 |last1=Hillie |first1=Thembela |last2=Hlophe |first2=Mbhuti |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of the synthetically-fabricated nanometallic particles that produce antimicrobial action called [[Oligodynamic effect|oligodynamic]] disinfection, which can inactivate microorganisms at low concentrations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanotechnology Applications for Clean Water: Solutions for Improving Water Quality|last=Street|first=Anita|last2=Sustich|first2=Richard|last3=Duncan|first3=Jeremiah|last4=Savage|first4=Nora|publisher=Elsevier|year=2014|isbn=9781455731169|location=Oxford|pages=286, 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commercial purification systems based on titanium oxide photocatalysis also currently exist and studies show that this technology can achieve complete inactivation of fecal [[Coliform bacteria|coliforms]] in 15 minutes once activated by sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are four classes of nanomaterials that are employed for water treatment and these are [[Dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles|dendrimers]], [[zeolite]]s, [[carbon]]aceous nanomaterials, and metals containing nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drinking Water Disinfection Techniques|last=Kumar|first=Jyot|last2=Pandit|first2=Aniruddha|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439877418|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the reduction of the size of the metals (e.g. [[silver]], [[copper]], [[titanium]], and [[cobalt]]) to the nanoscale such as contact efficiency, greater surface area, and better elution properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Cleaning up oil spills==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) documents more than ten thousand oil spills per year. Conventionally, biological, dispersing, and gelling agents are deployed to remedy oil spills. Although, these methods have been used for decades, none of these techniques can retrieve the irreplaceable lost oil. However, [[nanowires]] can not only swiftly clean up oil spills but also recover as much oil as possible. These nanowires form a mesh that absorbs up to twenty times its weight in hydrophobic liquids while rejecting water with its water repelling coating. 
Since the potassium manganese oxide is very stable even at high temperatures, the oil can be boiled off the nanowires and both the oil and the nanowires can then be reused.&lt;ref name="Nanotech For Oil"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Nanotech For Oil| doi=10.1080/21622515.2012.733966 |volume=1 |year=2012 |journal=Environmental Technology Reviews |pages=136–148 | last1 = Sofian Yunus | first1 = Ian | last2 = Harwin | last3 = Kurniawan | first3 = Adi | last4 = Adityawarman | first4 = Dendy | last5 = Indarto | first5 = Antonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina damaged or destroyed more than thirty oil platforms and nine refineries. The Interface Science Corporation successfully launched a new oil remediation and recovery application, which used the water repelling nanowires to clean up the oil spilled by the damaged oil platforms and refineries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wwdmag.com/nanotechnology-innovation-enables-recovery-and-reuse-spilled-oil |title=Solutions for the Catastrophe Katrina Left|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removing plastics from oceans===
One innovation of green nanotechnology that is currently under development are nanomachines modeled after a bacteria bioengineered to consume plastics, ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]''. These nano-machines are able to decompose plastics dozens of times faster than the bioengineered bacteria not only because of their increased surface area but also because of the fact that the energy released from decomposing the plastic is used to fuel the nano-machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2016-03-newly-bacteria-plastic-bottles.html |title=Newly discovered bacteria can eat plastic bottles |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution control===

In addition to water treatment and environmental remediation, nanotechnology is currently improving air quality.  Nanoparticles can be engineered to catalyze, or hasten, the reaction to transform environmentally pernicious gases into harmless ones. For example, many industrial factories that produce large amounts harmful gases employ a type of nanofiber catalyst made of [[magnesium oxide]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to purify dangerous organic substances in the smoke. Although chemical catalysts already exist in the gaseous vapors from cars, nanotechnology has a greater chance of reacting with the harmful substances in the vapors. This greater probability comes from the fact that nanotechnology can interact with more particles because of its greater surface area.&lt;ref name="dujs.dartmouth.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/2009/02/turning-to-nanotechnology-for-pollution-control-applications-of-nanoparticles/#.We1NfhOPLow |title=Turning to Nanotechnology for Pollution Control: Applications of Nanoparticles - Topics - Nanotechnology for Pollution Control |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotechnology has been used to remediate air pollution including car exhaust pollution, and potentially greenhouse gases due to its high surface area. Based on research done by the Environmental Science Pollution Research International, nanotechnology can specifically help to treat carbon-based nanoparticles, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds. There is also work being done to develop antibacterial nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and amendment agents for phytoremediation processes. Nanotechnology can also give the possibility of preventing air pollution in the first place due to its extremely small scale. Nanotechnology has been accepted as a tool for many industrial and domestic fields like gas monitoring systems, fire and toxic gas detectors, ventilation control, breath alcohol detectors and many more.  Other sources state that nanotechnology has the potential to develop the pollutants sensing and detection methods that already exist. The ability to detect pollutants and sense unwanted materials will be heightened by the large surface area of nanomaterials and their high surface energy. The World Health Organization declared in 2014 that air contamination caused around 7 million deaths in 2012. This new technology could be an essential asset to this epidemic. The three ways that nanotechnology is being used to treat air pollution are nano-adsoptive materials, degradation by nanocatalysis, and filtration/separation by nanofilters. 
Nanoscale adsorbents being the main alleviator for many air pollution difficulties. Their structure permits a great interaction with organic compounds as well as increased selectivity and stability in maximum adsorption capacity. Other advantages include high electrical and thermal conductivities, high strength, high hardness. Target pollutants that can be targeted by nanomolecules are 〖NO〗_x, 〖CO〗_2, 〖NH〗_3, N_2, VOCs, Isopropyl vapor, 〖CH〗_3 OH gases, N_2 O, H_2 S. 
Carbon nanotubes specifically remove particles in many ways. One method is by passing them through the nanotubes where the molecules are oxidized; the molecules then are adsorbed on a nitrate species. Carbon nanotubes with amine groups provide numerous chemical sites for carbon dioxide adsorption at low temperature ranges of 20°-100° degrees Celsius. Van der waals forces and π-π interactions also are used to pull molecules onto surface functional groups. Fullerene can be used to rid of carbon dioxide pollution due to its high adsorption capacity. Graphene nanotubes have functional groups that adsorb gases. 
There are plenty of nanocatalysts that can be used for air pollution reduction and air quality. Some of these materials include 〖TiO〗_2, Vanadium, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, and Silver. Catalytic industrial emission reduction, car exhaust reduction, and air purification are just some of the major thrusts that these nanomaterials are being utilized within. Certain applications are not widely spread, but other are more popular. Indoor air pollution is barely on the market yet, but it is being developed more efficiently due to complications with health effects. Car exhaust emission reduction is widely used in diesel fueled automobiles currently being one of the more popular applications. Industrial emission reduction is also widely used. It is n integral method specifically at coal fired power plants as well as refineries. According to Macrothink Institute process control, ecosystem monitoring is becoming more sensitive and precise due to nanotechnology development and research. These methods are analyzed and reviewed using SEM imaging to ensure its usefulness and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11356-016-6457-z |pmid=27074929 |title=Environmental application of nanotechnology: Air, soil, and water |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=23 |issue=14 |pages=13754–13788 |year=2016 |last1=Ibrahim |first1=Rusul Khaleel |last2=Hayyan |first2=Maan |last3=Alsaadi |first3=Mohammed Abdulhakim |last4=Hayyan |first4=Adeeb |last5=Ibrahim |first5=Shaliza |bibcode=2016ESPR...2311471P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9491-0_20 |bibcode=2009nrb..book..265R |title=Air Pollution Monitoring and Use of Nanotechnology Based Solid State Gas Sensors in Greater Cairo Area, Egypt |journal=Nanomaterials: Risks and Benefits |pages=265–273 |last1=Ramadan |first1=A.

Additionally, research is currently being conducted to find out if nanoparticles can be engineered to separate car exhaust from methane or carbon dioxide,&lt;ref name="dujs.dartmouth.edu"/&gt; which has been known to damage the Earth's ozone layer. In fact, John Zhu, a professor at the [[University of Queensland]], is exploring the creation of a [[carbon nanotube]](CNT) which can trap greenhouse gases hundreds of times more efficiently than current methods can.&lt;ref name="chemeng.uq.edu.au"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chemeng.uq.edu.au/zhu |title=Professor John Zhu of THe university of Queensland|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nanotechnology for sensors ==

Perpetual exposure to heavy metal pollution and particulate matter will lead to health concerns such as lung cancer, heart conditions, and even motor neuron diseases. However, humanity's ability to shield themselves from these health problems can be improved by accurate and swift [[nanocontact]]-sensors able to detect pollutants at the atomic level. These nanocontact sensors do not require much energy to detect metal ions or radioactive elements. Additionally, they can be made in automatic mode so that they can be readably used at any given moment. Additionally, these nanocontact sensors are energy and cost effective since they are composed with conventional microelectronic manufacturing equipment using electrochemical techniques.&lt;ref name="Nanotech For Oil"/&gt;

Some examples of nano-based monitoring include:
# Functionalized nanoparticles able to form anionic oxidants bonding thereby allowing the detection of carcinogenic substances at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name="dujs.dartmouth.edu"/&gt;
# Polymer nanospheres have been developed to measure organic contaminates in very low concentrations
# "Peptide nanoelectrodes have been employed based on the concept of thermocouple. In a 'nano-distance separation gap, a peptide molecule is placed to form a molecular junction. When a specific metal ion is bound to the gap; the electrical current will result conductance in a unique value. Hence the metal ion will be easily detected."&lt;ref name="chemeng.uq.edu.au"/&gt;
# Composite electrodes, a mixture of nanotubes and copper, have been created to detect substances such as organophosphorus pesticides, carbohydrates and other woods pathogenic substances in low concentrations.

==Concerns==
Although green nanotechnology poses many advantages over traditional methods, there is still much debate about the concerns brought about by nanotechnology. For example, since the nanoparticles are small enough to be absorbed into skin and/or inhaled, countries are mandating that additional research revolving around the impact of nanotechnology on organisms be heavily studied. In fact, the field of eco-[[nanotoxicology]] was founded solely to study the effect of nanotechnology on earth and all of its organisms. At the moment, scientists are unsure of what will happen when nanoparticles seep into soil and water, but organizations, such as NanoImpactNet, have set out to study these effects.&lt;ref name="dujs.dartmouth.edu"/&gt;

'''Hairshirt environmentalism''' (or '''hairshirt-green''') refers to the idea that the environmental problems we face can be addressed by limiting our consumption of resources.

== Etymology ==
A [[hairshirt]] (or [[Cilice]]) is an undergarment worn to induce discomfort, and thereby lead the wearer to spiritual purity, salvation, or atonement for sin.  Similarly, hairshirt environmentalism refers to the belief that denial of material comfort will lead to environmental sustainability.

== Usage ==
This term is often used in a derogatory way in reference to the [[anti-consumerism]] present in the environmental movement.  The central argument for this usage is that conservation alone will not be enough even if substantial numbers of people can be convinced to conserve, and that not enough people can be convinced to conserve for it to make a substantial difference.  It is also used by those having interests in promoting throwaway consumerism to accuse well-meaning environmentalists of stifling personal freedoms.  Famously, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] said "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-05-01-cheney-usat.htm USAToday May 1, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

This term is also used by environmentalists that believe changes in technology, or society itself are necessary to make a substantial difference in environmental degradation, and that merely using less of the same technology within the same societal structure will not nearly be enough.  [[Bruce Sterling]], in his final closing note of the [[Viridian Design Movement]] noted "Hairshirt-green is the simple-minded inverse of 20th-century consumerism. Like the New Age mystic echo of Judaeo-Christianity, hairshirt-green simply changes the polarity of the dominant culture, without truly challenging it in any effective way. It doesn't do or say anything conceptually novel – nor is it practical, or a working path to a better life." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viridiandesign.org/ Viridian Design Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sterling's case, this is clearly not meant to be derogatory to the environmentalist movement as a whole, but rather a challenge to think of transformative ways of changing our society's energy use - not merely gradual ones.

&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\ddot{n}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Eastern Jakaltek is one of the few languages besides the [[Malagasy language]] of [[Madagascar]] to make use of an n-[[trema (diacritic)|trema]] character in its alphabet. In both languages, the n-trema represents a [[velar nasal]] consonant {{IPAblink|ŋ}} (like "ng" in "bang").

Jakaltek-language programming is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio station [[XEVFS]], broadcasting from [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas]].

==Grammar==
The Jakaltek language has a [[verb–subject–object]] syntax. Like many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages,  Jakaltek has complex [[agglutinative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and uses [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive case alignment]]. It is divided in two dialects, Eastern and Western Jakalteko. "Eastern and Western Jakalteko understand each other's spoken languages, but not written text."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G, ed. "Jakalteko, Western." ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World''. 15th ed. Dallas, TX: SIL International, 2005. 254. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakaltek is unusual in that it as four systems of noun and numeral classifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/fulltext/Grinevald/Grinevald_1986_Jacaltec_grammaticalization_lingua.pdf |title=Jacaltec Noun Classifiers: A Study in Grammaticalization |first=Colette G. |last=Craig |authorlink=Colette Grinevald |journal=[[Lingua (journal)|Lingua]] |edition=70 |year=1986 |pages=241-284 |publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. |location=North-Holland |ISSN=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to Jakaltek's dissimilarity with [[Indo-European language]]s, the reasonably healthy linguistic population and the relative ease of access to Guatemala, Jakaltek has become a favorite of students of [[linguistic typology]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Affiche émigration JP au BR-déb. XXe s..jpg|thumb|right|A poster used in Japan to attract immigrants to Brazil. It reads: "Let’s go to South America (Brazil highlighted) with your entire family."]]

Between the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, coffee was the main export product of Brazil. At first, Brazilian farmers used African [[slave labour|slave labor]] in the coffee [[plantation]]s, but in 1850, the slave trade was abolished in Brazil. To solve the [[labour shortage]], the Brazilian elite decided to attract [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]]an immigrants to work on the coffee plantations. This also was in line the government's push towards "whitening" the country. The hope was that through procreation the large African and Native American groups would be eliminated or reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Roots of the "Whitening" of Brazil|first1=Sales Augusto dos|last1=Santos|first2=Laurence|last2=Hallewell|date=May 4, 2018|publisher=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=29|issue=1|pages=61–82 |df=mdy-all|jstor = 3185072}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government and farmers offered to pay European immigrants' passage. The plan encouraged millions of Europeans, most of them [[Italian diaspora|Italians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/italianos/regdestino.html Brasil 500 anos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530012836/http://www.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/italianos/regdestino.html |date=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Immigration to Brazil|migrate to Brazil]]. However, once in Brazil, the immigrants received very low salaries and worked in poor conditions, including long working hours and frequent ill-treatment by their bosses. Because of this, in 1902, Italy enacted ''Decree Prinetti'', prohibiting subsidized immigration to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historica.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br/materias/anteriores/edicao09/materia01/|title=HISTÓRICA - Revista Eletrônica do Arquivo do Estado|author=|date=|website=www.historica.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919072733/http://www.historica.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br/materias/anteriores/edicao09/materia01/|archivedate=September 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abolition of the han system|end of feudalism in Japan]] generated great poverty in the rural population, so many Japanese began to emigrate in search of better living conditions. By the 1930s, Japanese industrialisation had significantly boosted the population. However, prospects for Japanese people to migrate to other countries were limited. The US had banned non-white immigration from some parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mosley |first=Leonard |title= Hirohito, Emperor of Japan |year=1966 |publisher=Prentice Hall International, Inc |location=London |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that they would not integrate into society; this Exclusion Clause, of the [[1924 Immigration Act]], specifically targeted the Japanese. At the same time in Australia, the [[White Australia Policy]] prevented the immigration of non-whites to Australia.

===First immigrants===
[[File:Kasato Maru Postal Card.jpg|thumb|right|The Kasato Maru]]

In 1907, the Brazilian and the Japanese governments signed a treaty permitting Japanese migration to Brazil. This was due to the decrease in the Italian immigration to Brazil and a new labor shortage on the coffee plantations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imigracaojaponesa.com.br/naviodaesperanca.html Imigração Japonesa no Brasil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218164031/http://www.imigracaojaponesa.com.br/naviodaesperanca.html |date=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The first Japanese immigrants (790 people – mostly farmers) came to Brazil in 1908 on the ''[[Kasato Maru]]''.  About half of these immigrants came from southern Okinawa.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{citation |title=A little corner of Brazil that is forever Okinawa |newspaper=BBC News |date=February 4, 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42859249 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205184155/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42859249 |archivedate=February 5, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They travelled from the Japanese port of [[Kobe]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Osada, Masako.

In the first seven years, 3,434 more Japanese families (14,983 people) arrived. The beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914 started a boom in Japanese migration to Brazil; such that between 1917 and 1940 over 164,000 Japanese came to Brazil, 75% of them going to [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], where most of the coffee plantations were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/historia.php|title=Governo do Estado de São Paulo|author=|date=|website=Governo do Estado de São Paulo|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231203754/http://saopaulo.sp.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/historia.php/|archivedate=December 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New life in Brazil===
The vast majority of Japanese immigrants intended to work a few years in Brazil, make some money, and go home. However, "getting rich quick" was a dream that was almost impossible to achieve. The immigrants were paid a very low salary and worked long hours of exhausting work. Also, everything that the immigrants consumed had to be purchased from the landowner (see [[truck system]]). Soon, their debts became very significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/historia.php|title=Governo do Estado de São Paulo|author=|date=|website=Governo do Estado de São Paulo|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231203754/http://saopaulo.sp.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/historia.php/|archivedate=December 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Japanese Brazilian Miko Curitiba Paraná.jpg|thumb|upright|A Japanese Brazilian [[miko]] during a festival in [[Curitiba]]]]

The land owners in Brazil still had a slavery mentality. Immigrants, although employees, had to confront the rigidity and lack of [[labour laws]]. Indebted and subjected to hours of exhaustive work, often suffering physical violence, the immigrants saw the {{clarify|date=November 2016|text=leak}} as an alternative to escape the situation. Suicide, ''yonige'' (to escape at night), and strikes were some of the attitudes taken by many Japanese because of the exploitation on coffee farms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil Uma reconstrução da memória da imigração japones ano Brasil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202109/http://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil |date=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier of language, [[religion in Brazil|religion]], dietary habits, clothing, lifestyles and differences in climate entailed a [[culture shock]]. Many immigrants tried to return to Japan but were prevented by Brazilian farmers, who required them to comply with the contract and work with the coffee.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

On August 1, 1908, ''[[The New York Times]]'' remarked that relations between Brazil and Japan at the time were "not extremely cordial", because of "the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers."&lt;ref&gt;An extensive quotation from this article appears in [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes''-class battleship]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese children born in Brazil were educated in schools founded by the Japanese community. Most only learned to speak the Japanese language and lived within the Japanese community in rural areas. Over the years, many Japanese managed to buy their own land and became small farmers. They started to plant strawberries, tea and rice. Only 6% of children were the result of [[Miscegenation|interracial]] relationships. Immigrants rarely accepted marriage with a non-Japanese person.&lt;ref name="ELB"&gt;[http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/asiaticas/japones.htm Enciclopédia das Línguas no Brasil – Japonês] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522012304/http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/asiaticas/japones.htm |date=May 22, 2011 }} (Accessed September 4, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prejudice and forced assimilation ===
On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: "The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited." On October 22, 1923, representative Fidélis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: "The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country. . . ."&lt;ref name="rios"&gt;[http://www.movimentoafro.amazonida.com/branqueamento.htm RIOS, Roger Raupp. Text excerpted from a judicial sentence concerning crime of racism. Federal Justice of 10ª Vara da Circunscrição Judiciária de [[Porto Alegre]], November 16, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Accessed September 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years before [[World War II]], the government of President [[Getúlio Vargas]] initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: "''The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited, the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien''". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Jewish, Japanese immigrants and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil Memória da Imigração Japonesa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202109/http://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil |date=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the government's conception, the non-White population of Brazil should disappear within the dominant class of [[Portuguese Brazilian]] origin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} This way, the mixed-race population should be "whitened" through selective mixing, then a preference for European immigration. In consequence, the non-white population would, gradually, achieve a desirable White phenotype. The government focused on Italians, Jews, and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The formation of "ethnic cysts" among immigrants of non-Portuguese origin prevented the realization of the whitening project of the Brazilian population. The government, then, started to act on these communities of foreign origin to force them to integrate into a "Brazilian culture" with Portuguese roots. It was the dominant idea of a unification of all the inhabitants of Brazil under a single "national spirit". During World War II, Brazil severed relations with Japan. Japanese newspapers and teaching the Japanese language in schools were banned, leaving Portuguese as the only option for Japanese descendants. Newspapers in German or Italian were also advised to cease production, as Germany and Italy were Japan's allies in the war.&lt;ref name="A Imigração Japonesa em Itu"/&gt; In 1939, research of Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, from São Paulo, showed that 87.7% of Japanese Brazilians read newspapers in the Japanese language, a high figure for a country with many [[illiterate]] people like Brazil at the time.&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mais/fs2004200804.htm SUZUKI Jr, Matinas. História da discriminação brasileira contra os japoneses sai do limbo ''in'' Folha de S.Paulo, 20 de abril de 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015090047/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mais/fs2004200804.htm |date=October 15, 2012 }} (visitado em 17 de agosto de 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese appeared as undesirable immigrants within the "whitening" and assimilationist policy of the Brazilian government.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: "They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble". The Brazilian magazine "O Malho" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: "The government of São Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours".&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; In 1941, the Brazilian Minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in São Paulo and wrote: "their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country’s worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil".&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without [[safe conduct]] issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on [[short wave radio|short wave]] from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco América do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations of "activities against national security" arising from disagreements between neighbors, recovery of debts and even fights between children.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; Japanese Brazilians were arrested for "suspicious activity" when they were in artistic meetings or [[picnic]]s. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]] had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in [[Baixada Santista]], the Japanese had to have a safe conduct.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in [[Tomé-Açu]], in [[Pará]], was virtually turned into a "concentration camp". This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to "internment camps" without the need for legal support, in the same manner [[Japanese American internment|as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States]]. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against "national security" was confirmed.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

During the National Constituent Assembly of 1946, Rio Miguel Couto Filho proposed Amendments to the Constitution as follows: "It is prohibited the entry of Japanese immigrants of any age and any origin in the country". In the final vote, a tie with 99 votes in favor and 99 against. [[Senate of Brazil|Senator]] Fernando de Melo Viana, who chaired the session of the Constituent Assembly, had the casting vote and rejected the constitutional amendment. By only one vote, the immigration of Japanese people to Brazil was not prohibited by the Brazilian Constitution of 1946.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

The Japanese immigrants appeared to the Brazilian government as undesirable and non-assimilable immigrants. As Asian, they did not contribute to the "whitening" process of the Brazilian people as desired by the ruling Brazilian elite. In this process of forced assimilation the Japanese, more than any other immigrant group, suffered the ethno-cultural persecution imposed during this period.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

===Prestige===
For decades, Japanese Brazilians were seen as a non-assimilable people. The immigrants were treated only as a reserve of cheap labour that should be used on coffee plantations and that Brazil should avoid absorbing their cultural influences. This widespread conception that the Japanese were negative for Brazil was changed in the following decades. The Japanese were able to overcome the difficulties along the years and drastically improve their lives through hard work and education; this was also facilitated by the involvement of the Japanese government in the process of migration. The image of hard working [[agricultural science|agriculturists]] that came to help develop the country and agriculture helped erase the lack of trust of the local population and create a positive image of the Japanese. In the 1970s, Japan became one of the richest countries of the world, synonymous with modernity and progress. In the same period, Japanese Brazilians achieved a great cultural and economic success, probably the immigrant group that most rapidly achieved progress in Brazil. Due to the powerful Japanese economy and due to the rapid enrichment of the [[Nisei]], in the last decades Brazilians of Japanese descent achieved a social prestige in Brazil that largely contrasts with the aggression with which the early immigrants were treated in the country.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Ribeiro.

Nowadays as of 2008, many Japanese Brazilians belong to the third generation ([[sansei]]), who make up 41.33% of the community. First generation ([[issei]]) are 12.51%, second generation ([[nisei]]) are 30.85% and fourth generation ([[Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei)|yonsei]]) 12.95%.&lt;ref name="ELB"/&gt;

A more recent phenomenon in Brazil is [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]]s between Japanese Brazilians and non-ethnic Japanese. Though people of Japanese descent make up only 0.8% of the country's population, they are the largest Japanese community outside Japan, with over 1.4&amp;nbsp;million people. In areas with large numbers of Japanese, such as [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], since the 1970s, large numbers of Japanese descendants started to marry into other [[ethnic group]]s. Jeffrey Lesser's work has shown the complexities of integration both during the Vargas era, and more recently during the dictatorship (1964–1984)

Nowadays, among the 1.4&amp;nbsp;million Brazilians of Japanese descent, 28% have some non-Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0102-311X2006001100018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|title=Influence of acculturation on self-perceived oral health among Japanese-Brazilian elderly|first1=Daniel Afonso|last1=Hiramatsu|first2=Laércio Joel|last2=Franco|first3=Nilce Emy|last3=Tomita|date=November 1, 2006|publisher=|journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2441–2448|accessdate=May 4, 2018|via=SciELO|doi=10.1590/S0102-311X2006001100018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504144407/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0102-311X2006001100018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|archivedate=May 4, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number reaches only 6% among children of Japanese immigrants, but 61% among great-grandchildren of Japanese immigrants.

===Religion===
Immigrants, as well as most Japanese, were mostly followers of [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]]. In the Japanese communities in Brazil, there was a strong effort by Brazilian priests to [[Proselytism| proselytize]] the Japanese. More recently, intermarriage with Catholics also contributed to the growth of Catholicism in the community. Currently, 60% of Japanese-Brazilians are Roman Catholics and 25% are adherents of a Japanese religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panib.org.br/ PANIB – Pastoral Nipo Brasileira&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629122026/http://www.panib.org.br/ |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martial Arts===
The Japanese immigration to Brazil, in particular the immigration of the [[judoka]] [[Mitsuyo Maeda]], resulted in the development of one of the most effective modern martial arts, [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]].

===Language===
[[File:CuritibaPracaDoJapaoCerejeira.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cherry blossom]] in Japan's Square in [[Curitiba]], Paraná.]]
The knowledge of the Japanese and Portuguese languages reflects the integration of the Japanese in Brazil over several generations. Although first generation immigrants will often not learn Portuguese well or not use it frequently, most second generation are [[bilingual]]. The third generation, however, are most likely [[monolingual]] in Portuguese or speak, along with Portuguese, non-fluent Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.litoral.ufpr.br/diversa/ed1/Revista%20Divers@%20n_1%20v_1Birello%20e%20Lessa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112144138/http://www.litoral.ufpr.br/diversa/ed1/Revista%20Divers@%20n_1%20v_1Birello%20e%20Lessa.pdf |archivedate=January 12, 2015 |df=mdy-all }} THE JAPANESE IMMIGRATION FROM THE PAST AND THE INVERSE IMMIGRATION, GENDER AND GENERATIONS ISSUES IN THE ECONOMY OF BRAZIL AND JAPAN&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in the Japanese Brazilian communities of [[Nova Aliança|Aliança]] and [[Suzano|Fukuhaku]], both in the state of São Paulo, released information on the language spoken by these people. Before coming to Brazil, 12.2% of the first generation interviewed from Aliança reported they had studied the Portuguese language in Japan, and 26.8% said to have used it once on arrival in Brazil. Many of the Japanese immigrants took classes of Portuguese and learned about the [[history of Brazil]] before migrating to the country. In Fukuhaku only 7.7% of the people reported they had studied Portuguese in Japan, but 38.5% said they had contact with Portuguese once on arrival in Brazil. All the immigrants reported they spoke exclusively Japanese at home in the first years in Brazil. However, in 2003, the figure dropped to 58.5% in Aliança and 33.3% in Fukuhaku. This probably reflects that through contact with the younger generations of the family, who speak mostly Portuguese, many immigrants also began to speak Portuguese at home.

The first Brazilian-born generation, the Nisei, alternate between the use of Portuguese and Japanese. Regarding the use of Japanese at home, 64.3% of Nisei informants from Aliança and 41.5% from Fukuhaku used Japanese when they were children. In comparison, only 14.3% of the third generation, Sansei, reported to speak Japanese at home when they were children. It reflects that the second generation was mostly educated by their Japanese parents using the Japanese language. On the other hand, the third generation did not have much contact with their grandparent's language, and most of them speak the national language of Brazil, Portuguese, as their [[mother tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;As línguas japonesa e portuguesa em duas comunidades nipo-brasileiras: a relação entre os domínios e as gerações {{cite web |url=http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2006/sistema06/933.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706161125/http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2006/sistema06/933.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Brazilians usually speak Japanese more often when they live along with a first generation relative. Those who do not live with a Japanese-born relative usually speak Portuguese more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Taeko Doi|first=Elza|url=http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2006/sistema06/etd.pdf|title=O ensino de japonês no Brasil como língua de imigração|trans-title=Japanese teaching as an immigrant language in Brasil|language=pt|journal=Estudos Lingüísticos|publisher=Estado de São Paulo|year=2006|volume=XXXV|pages=66–75|issn=1413-0939|accessdate=October 13, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509112524/http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2006/sistema06/etd.pdf|archivedate=May 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese spoken in Brazil is usually a mix of different [[Japanese dialects]], since the Japanese community in Brazil came from all regions of Japan, influenced by the Portuguese language. The high numbers of Brazilian immigrants returning from Japan will probably produce more Japanese speakers in Brazil.&lt;ref name="ELB"/&gt;

According to the IBGE, as of 2000 there were 70,932 Japanese-born immigrants living in Brazil (compared to the 158,087 found in 1970). Of the Japanese, 51,445 lived in São Paulo. Most of the immigrants were over 60 years old, because the Japanese immigration to Brazil has ended since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=1167&amp;id_pagina=1 Japoneses IBGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219145951/http://ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=1167&amp;id_pagina=1 |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, IBGE published a book about the [[Japanese diaspora]] and it estimated that, as of 2000, there were 1,405,685 people of Japanese descent in Brazil. The Japanese immigration was concentrated to São Paulo and, still in 2000, 49.3% of Japanese Brazilians lived in this state. There were 693,495 people of Japanese origin in São Paulo, followed by [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] with 143,588. More recently, Brazilians of Japanese descent are making presence in places that used to have a small population of this group. For example: in 1960, there were 532 Japanese Brazilians in [[Bahia]], while in 2000 they were 78,449, or 0.6% of the state's population. [[Northern Brazil]] (excluding [[Pará]]) saw its Japanese population increase from 2,341 in 1960 (0.2% of the total population) to 54,161 (0.8%) in 2000. During the same period, in [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-Western Brazil]] they increased from 3,582 to 66,119 (0.7% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japao100.com.br/arquivo/nipo-brasileiros-estao-mais-presentes/|title=Centenário da Imigração Japonesa - Reportagens - Nipo-brasileiros estão mais presentes no Norte e no Centro-Oeste do Brasil|first=ZeroUm Digital -|last=www.zeroum.com.br|date=|website=www.japao100.com.br|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813021532/http://www.japao100.com.br/arquivo/nipo-brasileiros-estao-mais-presentes/|archivedate=August 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the overall Japanese population in Brazil is shrinking, secondary to a decreased birth rate and an aging population; return immigration to Japan,&lt;ref name="Naoto Higuchi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/IttMigLAC/P11_Higuchi.pdf|title=BRAZILIAN MIGRATION TO JAPAN TRENDS, MODALITIES AND IMPACT|author=Naoto Higuchi|publisher=United Nations|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=2013-02-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329015355/http://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/IttMigLAC/P11_Higuchi.pdf|archivedate=March 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Gunde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=6996 |title=Japanese Brazilian Return Migration and the Making of Japan's Newest Immigrant Minority |author=Richard Gunde |publisher= 2013.

For the whole Brazil, with over 1.4&amp;nbsp;million people of Japanese descent, the largest percentages were found in the states of São Paulo (1.9% of Japanese descent), Paraná (1.5%) and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (1.4%). The smallest percentages were found in [[Roraima]] and [[Alagoas]] (with only 8 Japanese). The percentage of Brazilians with Japanese roots largely increased among children and teenagers. In 1991, 0.6% of Brazilians between 0 and 14 years old were of Japanese descent. In 2000, they were 4%, as a result of the returning of [[Dekasegi]]s (Brazilians of Japanese descent who work in Japan) to Brazil.&lt;ref name="IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes/ |title=IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes |trans-title=IBGE does a profile of immigrants |language=pt |publisher=madeinjapan.uol.com.br |date=June 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624140253/http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese from Maringá===
A 2008 census revealed details about the population of Japanese origin from the city of [[Maringá]] in Paraná, making it possible to have a profile of the Japanese-Brazilian population.&lt;ref&gt;[ Japoneses e descendentes em Maringá passam de 14 mil {{cite web |url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/politica/3103034/japoneses-e-descendentes-em-maringa-passam-de-14-mil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721022317/http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/politica/3103034/japoneses-e-descendentes-em-maringa-passam-de-14-mil |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dekasegi==
{{See also|Brazilians in Japan}}
During the 1980s, the Japanese economic situation improved and achieved stability. Many Japanese Brazilians went to Japan as contract workers due to economic and political problems in Brazil, and they were termed "[[Dekasegi]]". Working visas were offered to Brazilian Dekasegis in 1990, encouraging more immigration from Brazil.

In 1990, the Japanese government authorized the legal entry of Japanese and their descendants until the third generation in Japan. At that time, Japan was receiving a large number of illegal immigrants from [[Pakistan]], Bangladesh, China, and [[Thailand]]. The legislation of 1990 was intended to select immigrants who entered Japan, giving a clear preference for Japanese descendants from South America, especially Brazil. These people were lured to Japan to work in areas that the Japanese refused (the so-called "three K": ''Kitsui'', ''Kitanai'' and ''Kiken'' – hard, dirty and dangerous). Many Japanese Brazilians began to immigrate. The influx of Japanese descendants from Brazil to Japan was and continues to be large: there are over 300,000 Brazilians living in Japan today, mainly as workers in factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200805030045.html|title=asahi.com : EDITORIAL: Brazilian immigration - ENGLISH|author=|date=May 6, 2008|website=archive.org|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506061352/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200805030045.html|archivedate=May 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their Japanese ancestry, the Japanese Government believed that Brazilians would be more easily integrated into Japanese society. In fact, this easy integration did not happen, since Japanese Brazilians and their children born in Japan are treated as foreigners by native Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/unicamp_hoje/jornalPDF/178-pag11.pdf Parece, mas nao é] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309150730/http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/unicamp_hoje/jornalPDF/178-pag11.pdf |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comciencia.br/reportagens/migracoes/migr19.htm|title=Brasil: migrações internacionais e identidade|first=Carlos Vogt, Mônica Macedo, Anna Paula Sotero, Bruno Buys,  Rafael Evangelista, Marianne Frederick, Marta Kanashiro, Marcelo Knobel,  Roberto Belisário,  Ulisses Capozoli, Sérgio Varella Conceicao, Marilissa Mota, Rodrigo Cunha,  Germana Barata,  Beatriz Singer, Flávia Tonin, Daisy Silva de|last=Lara|date=|website=www.comciencia.br|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819165640/http://www.comciencia.br/reportagens/migracoes/migr19.htm|archivedate=August 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparent contradiction between being and seeming causes conflicts of adaptation for the migrants and their acceptance by the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&amp;src=google&amp;base=LILACS&amp;lang=p&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;exprSearch=447388&amp;indexSearch=ID |title=Permanentemente temporário: dekasseguis brasileiros no Japão |first1=Beltrão, Kaizô |last1=Iwakami |first2=Sugahara |last2=Sonoe |date=June 1, 2006 |journal=Rev.

They also constitute the largest number of Portuguese speakers in Asia, greater than those of formerly Portuguese [[East Timor]], Macau and [[Goa]] combined. Likewise, Brazil, alongside the [[Japanese American]] population of the United States, maintains its status as home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan.

Cities and prefectures with the most Brazilians in Japan are: [[Hamamatsu]], [[Aichi]], [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], [[Kanagawa]], [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], and [[Gunma]].

Due to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], many Brazilians returned from Japan to Brazil. From January 2011 to March, it is estimated that 20,000 Brazilian immigrants left Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariosp.com.br/_conteudo/2010/07/2928-brasileiros+que+trabalharam+no+japao+estao+retornando+ao+brasil.html Brasileiros que trabalharam no Japão estão retornando ao Brasil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014101613/http://www.diariosp.com.br/_conteudo/2010/07/2928-brasileiros+que+trabalharam+no+japao+estao+retornando+ao+brasil.html |date=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazilian identity in Japan===
In Japan, many Japanese Brazilians suffer prejudice because they do not know how to speak Japanese fluently. Despite their Japanese appearance, Brazilians in Japan are culturally Brazilians, usually only speaking Portuguese, and are treated as foreigners.&lt;ref name="onishi"&gt;Onishi, Norimitsu. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/world/asia/02japan.html?scp=1&amp;sq=enclave+of+brazilians&amp;st=nyt  "An Enclave of Brazilians Is Testing Insular Japan,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202063015/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/world/asia/02japan.html?scp=1&amp;sq=enclave+of+brazilians&amp;st=nyt |date=February 2, 2017 }} ''New York Times.'' November 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children of ''Dekasegi'' Brazilians encounter difficulties in Japanese schools.&lt;ref&gt;Tabuchi, Hiroko. "Despite Shortage, Japan Keeps a High Wall for Foreign Labor," ''New York Times.'' January 3, 2011; excerpt, "...the government did little to integrate its migrant populations. Children of foreigners are exempt from compulsory education, for example, while local schools that accept non-Japanese-speaking children receive almost no help in caring for their needs."&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Brazilian children are out of school in Japan.&lt;ref name="onishi"/&gt;

Academic studies report that many Japanese Brazilians felt (and were often treated) as Japanese in Brazil. But when they move to Japan, they realize that they strongly feel their Brazilian background. In Brazil, Japanese Brazilians rarely listened to samba or participated in a carnival parade. However, once in Japan, Japanese Brazilians often promote carnivals and samba festivities in the Japanese cities to demonstrate their pride of being Brazilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ea/v20n57/a09v2057.pdf|title=a09v2057.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=scielo.br|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818062731/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ea/v20n57/a09v2057.pdf|archivedate=August 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}}

The Brazilian influence in Japan is growing. Tokyo has the largest carnival parade outside of Brazil itself. Portuguese is the third most spoken foreign language in Japan, after Chinese and Korean, and is among the most studied languages by students in the country. In [[Oizumi]], it is estimated that 15% of the population speak Portuguese as their native language. Japan has two newspapers in the Portuguese language, besides radio and television stations spoken in that language. The Brazilian fashion and [[Bossa Nova]] music are also popular among Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correiodoestado.com.br/noticias/japao-imigrantes-brasileiros-popularizam-lingua-portuguesa/43355/|title=Japão: imigrantes brasileiros popularizam língua portuguesa|first=|last=http://www.dothnews.com.br|date=|website=correiodoestado.com.br|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053337/http://www.correiodoestado.com.br/noticias/japao-imigrantes-brasileiros-popularizam-lingua-portuguesa/43355/|archivedate=October 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, there were an estimated 302,000 Brazilian nationals in Japan, of whom 25,000 also hold Japanese citizenship.

Throughout his stay in Brazil, the Prince was received by a crowd of Japanese immigrants and their descendants. He broke the protocol of the Japanese Monarchy, which prohibits physical contact with people, and greeted the Brazilian people. In the São Paulo [[sambódromo]], the Prince spoke to 50,000 people and in Paraná to 75,000.

==Media==
In [[São Paulo]] there are two Japanese publications, the ''[[São Paulo Shimbun]]'' and the ''[[Nikkey Shimbun]]''. The former was established in 1946 and the latter was established in 1998. The latter has a Portuguese edition, the ''[[Jornal Nippak]]'', and both publications have Portuguese websites. The ''Jornal Paulista'', established in 1947, and the ''Diário Nippak'', established in 1949, are the predecessors of the ''Nikkey Shimbun''.&lt;ref name=MatheusTatOutro&gt;Matheus, Tatiane.

The ''Nambei'', published in 1916, was Brazil's first Japanese newspaper. In 1933 90% of East Asian-origin Brazilians read Japanese publications, including 20 periodicals, 15 magazines, and five newspapers. The increase of the number of publications was due to Japanese immigration to Brazil. The government banned publication of Japanese newspapers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=MatheusTatOutro/&gt;

Tatiane Matheus of ''[[Estadão]]'' stated that in the pre-World War II period the ''Nippak Shimbun'', established in 1916; the ''Burajiru Jiho'', established in 1917; and two newspapers established in 1932, the ''Nippon Shimbun'' and the ''Seishu Shino'', were the most influential Japanese newspapers. All were published in São Paulo.&lt;ref name=MatheusTatOutro/&gt;

"The immigrants opened Japanese schools for their children as they were living in the rural areas where there were no local schools for their children and no support from the local authorities. About 600 Japanese schools were open by 1938. The children were full time students,[...]"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 over 10,000 Nikkei Brazilian children attended almost 200 Japanese supplementary schools in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;Goto, Junichi ([[Kyoto University]]). ''Latin Americans of Japanese Origin (Nikkeijin) Working in Japan: A Survey''. [[World Bank Publications]], 2007. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzUFpa10z0C&amp;pg=PA8 8].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938 Brazil had a total of 600 Japanese schools.&lt;ref name=LaughtonKurap10/&gt;

In 1970, 22,000 students, taught by 400 teachers, attended 350 supplementary Japanese schools. In 1992 there were 319 supplementary Japanese language schools in Brazil with a total of 18,782 students, 10,050 of them being female and 8,732 of them being male. Of the schools, 111 were in São Paulo State and 54 were in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná State]]. At the time, the [[São Paulo Metropolitan Area]] had 95 Japanese schools, and the schools in the city limits of São Paulo had 6,916 students.&lt;ref name=CarvalhoPT46/&gt;

In the 1980s, São Paulo Japanese supplementary schools were larger than those in other communities. In general, during that decade a Brazilian supplementary Japanese school had one or two teachers responsible for around 60 students.&lt;ref name=CarvalhoPT46/&gt;

Hiromi Shibata, a PhD student at the [[University of São Paulo]], wrote the dissertation ''As escolas japonesas paulistas (1915–1945)'', published in 1997. Jeff Lesser, author of ''Negotiating National Identity: Immigrants, Minorities, and the Struggle for Ethnicity in Brazil'', wrote that she "suggests" that the Japanese schools in São Paulo "were as much an affirmation of Nipo-Brazilian identity as they were of Japanese nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, Jeff.

[[File:Japanese_people_of_all_ages.jpg|thumb|220px|A Japanese family of all ages]]

The family is called {{nihongo|''kazoku''|家族}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].  It is basically composed of a couple as is the [[family]] in other societies. The Japanese family is based on the line of descent and adoption. Ancestors and offspring are linked together by an idea of family [[genealogy]], or ''keizu'', which does not mean relationships based on mere blood inheritance and succession, but rather a bond of relationship inherent in the maintenance and continuance of the family as an institution.

In any given period of history, all family members have been expected to contribute to the perpetuation of the family, which is held to be the highest duty of the member.&lt;ref&gt;(Ariga 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A great number of family forms have existed historically in Japan, from the [[matrilocal]] customs of the [[Heian period|Heian]].

As official surveys conducted during the early years of the Meiji dynasty demonstrated, the most common family form during the [[Edo period|Edo]] ([[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]) period was characterized by patrivirilocal residence, stem structure, patrilineal descent and patrilineal primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Family History Revisited: Comparative Perspectives |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Wall |editor2-first=Tamara K. |editor2-last=Hareven |editor3-first=Joseph |editor3-last=Ehmer |pages=343–344 |url={{Google books |id=8awruI9XyXsC |page=343 |plainurl=yes }} }}&lt;/ref&gt; so a set of laws were promulgated institutionalizing this family pattern, beginning with the "Outline of the New Criminal Law" in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Law in Japan Since 1868 |editor-first=W. |editor-last=Röhl |pages=307–321 |url={{Google books |id=47yhjgB-XhgC |page=307 |plainurl=yes }} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, individuals were registered in an official {{nihongo|[[family registry]]|戸籍|[[koseki]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;(Mosk 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century, each family was required to conform to the {{nihongo|''[[ie (Japanese family system)|ie]]''|家||household}} system, with a multigenerational household under the legal authority of a household head. In establishing the ''ie'' system, the government moved the ideology of family in the opposite direction of trends resulting from [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]]. The ie system took as its model for the family the [[Confucianism|Confucian]]-influenced pattern of the upper classes of the Tokugawa period.

Authority and responsibility for all members of the ''ie'' lay legally with the household head. Each generation supplied a male and female adult, with a preference for inheritance by the first son and for patrilocal marriage. When possible, daughters were expected to marry out, and younger sons were expected to establish their own households.{{Cn|date=February 2015}}

===Post-World War II===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}

[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|thumb|450px|The percentage of births to unmarried women in selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of other Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree.]]
After [[World War II]], the Allied occupation forces established a new family ideology based on [[women's rights|equal rights]] for women, equal inheritance by all children{{cn|date=February 2015}}, and free choice of spouse{{cn|date=February 2015}} and career{{cn|date=February 2015}}. From the late 1960s, most marriages in Japan have been based on the mutual attraction of the couple and not the {{nihongo|arrangement by the parents|お見合い|[[miai|omiai]]}}{{cn|date=February 2015}}. Moreover, [[arranged marriage]]s might begin with an introduction by a relative or family friend, but actual negotiations do not begin until all parties, including the bride and groom, are satisfied with the relationship.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Under the ie system, only a minority of households included three generations at a time because nonsuccessor sons (those who were not heirs) often set up their own household.{{cn|date=February 2015}} From 1970 to 1983, the proportion of three-generation households fell from 19% to 15% of all households, while two generation households consisting of a couple and their unmarried children increased only slightly, from 41% to 42% of all households. The greatest change has been the increase in couple-only households and in elderly single-person households.

Public opinion surveys in the late 1980s seemed to confirm the statistical movement away from the three-generation ie family model. Half of the respondents did not think that the first son had a special role to play in the family, and nearly two-thirds rejected the need for [[Mukoyōshi|Mukoyōshi adoption]] of a son in order to continue the family. Other changes, such as an increase in filial violence and [[school refusal]], suggest a breakdown of strong family authority.

Official statistics indicate that Japanese concepts of family continued to diverge from those in the [[United States]] in the 1980s. The [[divorce rate]], although increasing slowly, remained at 1.3 per 1,000 marriages in 1987, low by international standards. Strong gender roles remained the cornerstone of family responsibilities. Most survey respondents said that family life should emphasize parent-child ties over husband-wife relations. Nearly 80% of respondents in a 1986 government survey believed that the ancestral home and family grave should be carefully kept and handed on to one's children. More than 60% thought it best for elderly parents to live with one of their children.

This sense of family as a unit that continues through time is stronger among people who have a livelihood to pass down, such as [[farmer]]s, [[merchant]]s, owners of small companies, and [[physician]]s, than among urban salary and wage earners. Anthropologist Jane M. Bachnik noted the continued emphasis on continuity in the rural families she studied. Uchi (here, the contemporary family) were considered the living members of an ie, which had no formal existence. Yet, in each generation, there occurred a sorting of members into permanent and temporary members, defining different levels of uchi.

Various family life-styles exist side by side in contemporary Japan. In many urban [[salaryman]] families, the husband may commute to work and return late, having little time with his children except for Sundays, a favorite day for family outings. The wife might be a "professional [[housewife]]", with nearly total responsibility for raising children, ensuring their careers and marriages, running the household, and managing the family budget. She also has primary responsibility for maintaining social relations with the wider circles of relatives, neighbors, and acquaintances and for managing the family's reputation. Her social life remains separate from that of her husband. It is increasingly likely that in addition to these family responsibilities, she may also have a part-time job or participate in adult education or other community activities. The closest emotional ties within such families are between the mother and children.

In other families, particularly among the [[self-employed]], husband and wife work side by side in a family business. Although gender-based roles are clear cut, they might not be as rigidly distinct as in a household where work and family are more separated. In such families, fathers are more involved in their children's development because they have more opportunity for interacting with them.

As women worked outside of the home with increasing frequency beginning in the 1970s, there was pressure on their husbands to take on more responsibility for housework and child care. Farm families, who depend on nonfarm employment for most of their income, are also developing patterns of interaction different from those of previous generations.

==Members==
The [[monogamous]] and [[patriarchal]] family has been prevalent since the 8th century.  If a wife were childless the husband often kept a [[concubine]], whose offspring succeeded to the headship of the family, thus securing its continuation.  When neither wife nor concubine bore him a child, custom allowed the family head to adopt a successor.&lt;ref&gt;(Ariga 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members may die under no circumstances
#persons socially recognized as being related in the family line, chokkei, in which successors, their spouses and possible successors are included, and
#members socially recognized as being outside family members, bokei, under which all other family members, including relatives and servants, are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;(Ariga 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession==
{{See|Ie (Japanese family system)}}
In the traditional Japanese family, one male offspring who is to succeed to the headship of the family lives with his parents after his marriage.  He assumes the headship and has to take care of the parents when they have become aged.  In addition, he is responsible for the support of ''[[bokei]]'' member and directs the labor of family members in the management of the household. Couples in successive generations live together under the same roof.&lt;ref&gt;(Ariga 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Succession in the Japanese family does not simply mean inheritance of the deceased’s property; and the inheritance of property itself has a distinctive meaning, which reflects the institutional demands of the family. Succession in Japan means ''[[katokusozoku]]'', or succession to family headship.

''Katokusozoku'' aims to achieve directly the continuation of the family as an institution. The patriarch, responsible for family continuation, has to decide in advance who is the man to succeed him in the event of his death. He usually selects a certain son as the candidate for his successor.  When he has no offspring at all, the patriarch often adopts both a boy as his successor and a girl as the successor’s wife. In [[Mukoyōshi]] adoption, it does not matter whether or not the boy and the girl concerned have blood relationship with the patriarch or with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;(Ariga 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional ideal of the ''ie'' system designates the oldest son as an heir to the family, and expects his family to live with his parents. When the oldest son is not available or not able to assume this position, one of the younger sons may do so. The elderly parents may opt for living with one of their married daughters, usually when they have no available son.  Implied here is a sex/age hierarchy in terms of living with the parents, descending from oldest son to youngest son, and oldest to youngest daughter. It thus can be expected that oldest sons and oldest daughters without brothers are more likely to live with their parents than other children.&lt;ref&gt;(Kamo 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucker was featured in a 2017 BBC2 Documentary.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite |  title = Transgender Kids, Who Knows Best? | url = https://vimeo.com/217950594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Zucker was born in 1950 to Jewish parents and grew up in [[Skokie, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="prospect"&gt;{{cite news | author = Schwartzapfel, Beth | date = March 14, 2013 | title = Born This Way? | work = The American Prospect | accessdate = March 23, 2015 | url = http://prospect.org/article/born-way}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zucker received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Southern Illinois University]], his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Roosevelt University]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[University of Toronto]] in 1982. He holds a certification from [[College of Psychologists of Ontario]].

Zucker became interested in gender identity after reading [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]]'s 1974 book ''Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults''.&lt;ref name="prospect" /&gt; Zucker's graduate work in [[developmental psychology]] resulted in his master's thesis on [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender identity]] development in children. While in graduate school, Zucker met his future collaborator, [[Susan J. Bradley]], a [[child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] on staff at the Child and Adolescent Service of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry (now the Child and Family Studies Centre of the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]]), a public mental health centre and teaching hospital of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine]].

Zucker was impressed with the Clarke Institute and met with then chief of psychology, Kingsley Ferguson, who told Zucker of Bradley's new working group assessing children and adolescents with [[gender identity]] problems. He joined Bradley's group.&lt;ref name="zucker1995"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Zucker, Kenneth J.  |author2=Susan J. Bradley | year = 1995 | title = Gender Identity Disorder and Psychosexual Problems in Children and Adolescents | publisher = Guilford Press | isbn = 0-89862-266-2 | page = v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic intervention for gender variance==

Since the mid-1970s, Zucker has treated about 500 preadolescent gender-variant children to have them accept the gender identity they were assigned at birth until they are at an age he believes they may determine their own gender identity.&lt;ref name="brown2006"&gt;{{cite news | author = Brown, Patricia Leigh | date = December 2, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/us/02child.html | title = Supporting Boys or Girls When the Line Isn’t Clear | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For children assigned as male at birth, Zucker reportedly asked parents to take away toys associated with girls and to instruct their child not to play alongside or draw pictures of girls,&lt;ref name="spiegel2008"&gt;{{cite news | author = Spiegel, Alix | date = May 7, 2008 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90247842 | title = Two families grapple with sons' gender preferences | work = [[All Things Considered]] | publisher = [[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the parent that originally made this claim has more recently expressed that there was a miscommunication in the original interview and that such directives were to treat the social isolation that stemmed from her son's obsession with dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Singal, Jesse | title = How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got A Leading Sex Researcher Fired | url = https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html| date = February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Darryl Hill wrote that Zucker and Bradley believed that [[conversion therapy|reparative treatments]] can reduce rejection by enabling gender non-conforming children to mix with children of the same sex, reducing the possibility of adult gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="hill2006"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hill D.B. |author2=Rozanski C. |author3=Carfagnini J. |author4=Willoughby B. | year = 2006 | chapter = Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Critical Inquiry | pages = 7–34 |veditors=Karasic D, Drescher J | title = Sexual and Gender Diagnoses of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM): A Reevaluation | publisher = Haworth Press | isbn = 0-7890-3214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Zucker's publications is the [[case history]] of two patients who were male by birth but suffered a [[penectomy]] and were shortly thereafter reassigned as female.  At age 26 both denied ever feeling the desire to be male.  Both patients reported more masculine behavior and bisexuality, about which Zucker suspects that gender role and sexual orientation develop mostly before birth while gender identity development begins shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SJ |first=Bradley |author2=Oliver GD |author3=Chernick AB |author4=Zucker KJ  |title=Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 Months, Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in Young Adulthood |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=e9 |year = 1998 |pmid=9651461 |doi=10.1542/peds.102.1.e9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some support for the position that "prenatal sex differentiation can at least sometimes trump social influences."&lt;ref name="dingfelder2004"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr04/gender.html | accessdate = June 17, 2008 | author= Dingfelder, Sadie F. | title = Gender bender | year = 2004 | journal = Monitor on Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | page = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucker says parents set the goals at his clinic. "We recommend that one goal be to help the child feel more secure about his or her actual gender, another to deal with the child's emotional difficulties, and a third to help with problems in the family. It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross-dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us."&lt;ref name="goleman1994"&gt;{{cite news | author = Goleman, Daniel | date = March 22, 1994 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E0DA153CF931A15750C0A962958260 | title = The 'Wrong' Sex: A New Definition Of Childhood Pain | work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that "about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery" as young adults.&lt;ref name="goleman1994"/&gt; Zucker has stated that "the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions."&lt;ref name="neuropsychiatrie2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zucker K.J. | year = 2008 | title = Children with gender identity disorder: Is there a best practice? | journal = Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 358–364 | doi=10.1016/j.neurenf.2008.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zucker coauthored a statistical report with [[J. Michael Bailey]] that found gay men and lesbians exhibited more cross-gender activity as children.&lt;ref name="bailey1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.M. |author2=Zucker K.J. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood Sex-Typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–55 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[adolescent]] clients expressing gender identity disorder, Zucker's treatment protocol resembles that for adult GID, consisting of [[hormone replacement therapy]] to aid the adolescent in a social transition. Since [[sex reassignment surgery]] is not generally performed on minors in North America, Zucker's clinic does not provide recommendations for it – instead, clients are encouraged to pursue reassignment through the adult Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH, which controls funding for the procedure in [[Ontario]].

Activists have compared Zucker's approaches with reparative therapy.  The [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] believes "'reparative' therapy that seeks to reverse sexual orientation or gender identification"&lt;ref name="dean2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dean, Laura| year = 2000 | title = Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health: Findings and concerns | journal = [[Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 102–151|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an "extreme example" of bias that "may lead to increased self hatred and mental health problems."&lt;ref name="ryan1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ryan, C, Bradford, J &amp; Honnold, J. | year = 1999 | title = Social workers' and counselors' knowledge and understanding of lesbians | journal = Journal of Lesbian and Gay Social Services | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1300/j041v09n04_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychiatrist Simon Pickstone-Taylor has cited similarities between Zucker's therapeutic intervention and reparative therapy for homosexuals.&lt;ref name="pickstone2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pickstone-Taylor, Simon D. | year = 2003 | title = Children with gender nonconformity | journal = [[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | page = 266 | url = http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2809%2960558-X/abstract | doi=10.1097/00004583-200303000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker responded that prevention of homosexuality was never a goal in their treatments and cites a lack of empirical evidence for the most effective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Susan J.|author2=Zucker, Kenneth J. |title=Children With Gender Nonconformity: Drs.

==''Archives of Sexual Behavior''==

As editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', Zucker published a controversial study on [[reparative therapy]] by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]]. According to ''The New York Times'', after his presentation of the study caused controversy, Spitzer asked Zucker to publish it. "I knew Bob and the quality of his work, and I agreed to publish it," Zucker said in an interview. "But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries". Spitzer later recanted the study's conclusions.&lt;ref name=carey&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=Psychiatry Giant Sorry for Backing Gay ‘Cure’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/health/dr-robert-l-spitzer-noted-psychiatrist-apologizes-for-study-on-gay-cure.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender Identity Clinic for Children at CAMH==

Zucker's treatment protocol came under scrutiny in March 2015 when [[Cheri DiNovo]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] tabled a [[private member's bill]] that banned conversion therapies for gender identity or sexual orientation. Zucker's gender identity clinic stopped accepting new patients the same month, awaiting the result of an ongoing review of the practice. CAMH director Kwame McKenzie said that Zucker's treatments were against the centre's guidelines, but that there exist two groups of thinking on such therapy for children under 11 among professionals.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metronews.ca/news/toronto/1315743/outcry-prompts-camh-to-review-its-controversial-treatment-of-trans-youth/|title=Outcry prompts CAMH to review its controversial treatment of trans youth|first=Jessica Smith|last=Cross|newspaper=Metro|publisher=[[Metro International]]|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Paterson, Tara | date = 21 February 2015 | title = As trans issues become mainstream, question of how to address variant gender expression comes to forefront | work = National Post | url = http://news.nationalpost.com/life/as-trans-issues-become-mainstream-question-of-how-to-address-variant-gender-expression-comes-to-forefront}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was expected to take six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gender Identity Service Review Announced | work = CAMH.ca | accessdate = 27 July 2015 | url = http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/child_youth_and_family_program/Pages/Gender-Identity-Service-Review-Announced.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that review, CAMH shut its Child Youth and Family Gender Identity Clinic in December 2015. The reviewers, Suzanne Zinck of [[Dalhousie University]] and Antonio Pignatiello of Toronto's [[Hospital for Sick Children]] noted numerous strengths of the clinic, but also described it as an insular entity with an approach dissimilar from other clinics. &lt;ref&gt;https://2017.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Documents/ExecutiveSummary-GIC_ExternalReview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Zinck and Pignatiello invited stakeholders to comment on their experiences in the clinic. A former client, now an adult, claimed Zucker “asked him to remove his shirt in front of other clinicians present, laughed when he complied, and then referred to him as a ‘hairy little vermin.’”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyxtra.com/toronto/news-and-ideas/news/toronto-centre-shutters-youth-gender-clinic-181985&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation was subsequently retracted by the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Singal, Jesse | date = 27 January 2016 | title = A False Accusation Helped Bring Down Kenneth Zucker, a Controversial Sex Researcher | work = NYMag | url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/false-charge-helped-bring-down-kenneth-zucker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMH removed the report from its website and apologized, and replaced it with a summary of the report.&lt;ref&gt;https://2017.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Documents/ExecutiveSummary-GIC_ExternalReview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwame McKenzie, medical director of CAMH's child, youth, and family services, said “We want to apologize for the fact that not all of the practices in our childhood gender identity clinic are in step with the latest thinking”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ubelacker|first1=Sheryl|title=CAMH to ‘wind down’ controversial gender identity clinic services|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/camh-to-wind-down-controversial-gender-identity-clinic-services/article27766580/|accessdate=15 December 2015|agency=Canadian Press|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Zucker is “no longer at CAMH.” CAMH announced a process of consultation with community leaders to examine how best to offer care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CAMH to 'wind down' gender identity clinic after review of services|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/camh-gender-identity-1.3366424?cmp=rss|accessdate=December 15, 2015|agency=Canadian Press|publisher=CBC News|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, CAMH apologized to, and settled with, Zucker for errors in evaluating his clinical practice and interactions with patients&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/camh-apology&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the settlement documents, the centre will pay him $586,000 in damages, legal fees and interest. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/07/camh-reaches-settlement-with-former-head-of-gender-identity-clinic.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To the CBC, "CAMH stands by its decision to close the child and youth gender identity clinic following an external review which concluded the clinic was not meeting the needs of gender expansive and trans children and their families," the centre said in a statement on Sunday [October 7, 2018].
"We believe our modernized approach to delivering services to youth better supports diverse patients through best practice and timely care."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/camh-settlement-former-head-gender-identity-clinic-1.4854015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

According to the [[Web of Science]], Zucker has published almost 100 articles in [[peer-reviewed journal]]s. These articles have been cited over 2000 times, with an [[h-index]] of 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Web of Science | year = 2008 | url = http://isiwebofknowledge.com | accessdate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published several books, including:

'''Ketagalan''' (Ketangalan, Tangalan) ({{zh|c=凱達格蘭語|p=Kǎidágélán Yǔ}}) was a [[Formosan language]] spoken south of modern-day [[Taipei]] in northern [[Taiwan]] by the [[Ketagalan people]]. The language has become extinct.

The '''Khalkha''' ({{lang-mn|Халх}}, ''Halh'' {{IPA-mn|xɑɮx}}) is the largest subgroup of [[Mongols|Mongol people]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Khalkha-people Khalkha]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mongolia]] since the 15th century. The Khalkha, together with [[Chahars]], [[Ordos Mongols|Ordos]] and [[Tumed]], were directly ruled by [[Borjigin]] khans until the 20th century; unlike the [[Oirats]], who were ruled by [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] nobles, or the [[Khorchin Mongols|Khorchins]], who were ruled by [[Qasar]]'s descendants. 

The two original major Khalkha groups were ruled by the direct male line descendants of [[Dayan Khan]]. The [[Baarin]], [[Khongirad]], [[Jaruud]], Baigut, and the O'zeed (Ujeed) became Dayan Khan's fifth son Achibolod's subjects, thus formed the Southern Five Halhs. The [[Qarai Turks|Qaraei]], [[Jalairs]], [[Olkhonud]], Khatagin, Besut, Iljigin, Gorlos, [[Uriankhai]], [[Sartuul]], Tanghut, [[Khotogoid]], Khuree, and Tsookhor became Dayan Khan's youngest (could be third) son Geresenje's ({{lang-mn|Гэрсэне Жалайр Хан}}) subjects, thus formed the "Аглагийн арван гурван хүрээ Халх" or Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

There were also numerous direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]] who had formed the ruling class of the Khalkha Mongols prior to the 20th century, but they were and still also regarded as Khalkha Mongols rather than belonging to a special unit.

The Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North are the major subethnic group of the independent state of Mongolia. They number 1,610,400 (78.8%) of Mongolia's population (1989 figures).

The Khalkha or Halh dialect is the standard written language of Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Atwood ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire'', Khalkha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''Халх'' ("Halh, Khalkha") has always puzzled linguists and historians. One possible interpretation is that it shares the same root as the words xалхавч "shield" and xалхлах "to protect; to cover; to shield; to hide; to intercept", although there is no noun or verb ''xалх'' that independently exists besides the ethnic group's name. In  saimilar manner, the sub-ethnic groups within the Khalkha Unit have been historically recorded in books, journals, and documents as "Jalair Khalkha", "Sartuul Khalkha", "Tanghut Khalkha" etc. Even the word order in the phrases Southern Five Khalkha and Northern Thirteen Khalkha implies that the word Халх correlates to the units within the Southern and Northern tribal federations, but it does not stand for the group as a whole. Lastly, Mongolians have always linked the term Халх to the name of the [[Khalkhyn Gol]].

== History ==
[[File:Mongolia XVI.png|thumb|Khalkha Mongols during the early [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Northern Yuan]] period.]]
[[File:ErdeneZuuKhiidTemple.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Erdene Zuu Monastery]] was established in the 16th century by [[Abatai Sain Khan]] in the heartland of the Khalkha territory]]

[[Dayan Khan]] created Khalkha Tumen out of Mongols residing in the territory of present-day central Mongolia and northern part of [[Inner Mongolia]]. In Mongolian historical sources such as ''Erdeniin Erih'' ("The Beads of Jewel") it clearly stated how Khalkha Tumen was created and where these people resided at the time of its creation. The statement goes as follows:

*Transliteration:
:''Hangai Khand nutuglan suuj''
:''Hari daisind chinu Khalkha bolson''
:''Haluun amind chinu Tushee bolson''
:''Irehiin uzuur, Harahiin haruul bolson''
:''Khalkha tumen chinu Ter bukhii beer ajaamuu''

*Cyrillic:
:Хангай ханд нутаглан сууж
:Харь дайсанд чинь халх болсон
:Халуун аминд чинь түшээ болсон
:Ирэхийн үзүүр, харахын харуул болсон
:Халх түмэн чинь тэр бүхий бээр ажаамуу

*English translation:
:"Dwelling in the Hangai Mountains" (Central Mongolian Mountain range called Hangai Mountain Range, near which Harakorum, the ancient capital, was built)
:"A shield (in Mongolian, ''khalkha'' means "shield" or "protection") against alien enemies"
:"A support for your precious life"
:"A blade towards those who come, a guard towards those who look"
:"Your Khalkha Tumen is indeed for you"

It is also believed that Southern Khalkha people who now reside in Inner Mongolia were moved to south from its original territory Khangai Mountains. To commemorate and signify its origin, every new year during white month/moon celebration all southern Khalkhas perform special Khangai Mountain worshipping ceremonies and they face northwest and pray. This special ceremony is maintained by only southern khalkhas and no other southern Mongols have such rituals.

Under [[Dayan Khan]], the Khalkha were organized as one of three [[Tumen (unit)|tümen]] of the Left Wing. Dayan Khan installed the fifth son [[Alchu Bolad]] and the eleventh son [[Geresenje]] on the Khalkha. The former became the founder of the Five Halh of Southern Mongolia and the latter became the founder of the Seven Halh of the Northern Mongolia. They were called Inner Khalkha and Outer Khalkha respectively, by the [[Manchu]]s.

Mongolian chronicles called Geresenje as "[[Khong Tayiji]] of the [[Jalayir]]", which indicates that the core part of the Khalkha were descendants of the Jalayir tribe. By extension, some scholars consider that the Halh had a close connection with the Five Ulus of the Left Wing of the former [[Yuan dynasty]], which was led by the five powerful tribes of Jalayir, [[Onggirat]], [[Ikires]], [[Uruud]] and [[Mangghud]].

[[File:CEM-44-La-Chine-la-Tartarie-Chinoise-et-le-Thibet-1734-NE-2571.jpg|thumb|left|"The Country of the Khalkha" (Pays des Kalkas) on a 1734 map by [[d'Anville]], based on [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]]' fieldwork ca. 1700]]
The Five Halh consisted of five tribes called Jarud, Baarin, Onggirat, Bayaud and Öjiyed. They lived around the [[Shira Mören]] valley east of the [[Greater Khingan]]. They clashed with but were eventually conquered by the rising Manchus. The Five Khalkha except for the Jarud and the Baarin were organized into the [[Eight Banners]]. Note that Khalkha Left Banner of Juu Uda League and Khalkha Right Banner of Ulaanchab League were offshoots of the Seven Khalkha.

[[File:Namnansuren2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren]] of Khalkha, a leader of the National Liberation Movement of 1911]]
The Seven Khalkha were involved in regular fights against the [[Oyirad]] in the west. Geresenje's descendants formed the houses of [[Tüsheet Khan]], [[Zasagt Khan]] and [[Setsen Khan]]. They preserved their independence until they had to seek help from the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] against the [[Zungar people|Zungar]] leader [[Galdan]] in 1688. In 1725 the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] gave Tsering independence from the house of [[Tüsheet Khan]], forming the house of [[Sain Noyon Khan]].

The Khalkha led the [[Mongolian independence movement]] in the 20th century. After enduring countless hardships, they established the independent state of Mongolia in northern Mongolia.

==Khalkha diaspora==

The overwhelming majority of Khalkha Mongols now reside in the modern state of Mongolia. However, there are four small banners in China: two in Inner Mongolia; one in [[Qinghai]]; and one in [[Chengde|Jehol]]. There are also several groups among the Buriats in Russia, however, they no longer retain the Khalkha self-identity, culture, and language. The Halh Mongols in Qinghai, China and the ones among the [[Buryats|Buriat]]s in Russia were subjects to Khalkha's Tsogtu Khan and his sons.

'''The [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]]'s Khalkhas (1 banner):''' Poet, supporter of [[Ligdan Khan]], and opponent of the [[Dalai Lama]]'s "Yellow Hat" order, Tsogtu Khong Taiji moved to [[Qinghai]] with his subjects sometime after 1624. Ligdan Khan and Tsogtu Khong Taiji were supposed to meet in Qinghai and eventually build a Mongol base that is independent of the Manchu rule which was geographically far from the Manchu emperor's reach. Moreover, it was clear to the two Mongol Khans that Tibetan [[Dalai Lama]]'s influence in Mongol affairs was increasing. So the two decided to end the influence of Dalai Lama and the "Yellow Hat" order by supporting the "Red Hat" order. However, majority of Ligdan Khan's subjects and soldiers died because of [[smallpox]] on the way to Qinghai. After Ligdan's death, Tsogtu Taiji began attacking dGe-lugs-pa monasteries. When Tsogtu sent 10,000 men under his son Arslang against the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, Arslang switched sides and supported the Dalai Lama. The dGe-lugs-pa hierarch, the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–82), summoned the Oirat Güshi Khan Toro-Baiku, whose 10,000 men in early 1637 crushed Tsogtu’s 30,000 at Ulaan-Khoshuu; Tsogtu Taiji was killed.&lt;ref&gt;C.P.Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, Tsogtu Taij&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Oirats of Gushi Khan is also known as the "[[Upper Mongols]]" or the "ДЭЭД МОНГОЛ", and they still reside in Qinghai forming 21 banners. The remnants of Tsogtu Khong Taiji's Halhs form only one banner and are known as the "Lower Mongols" or "ДООД МОНГОЛ". Tsogtu Khong Taiji is known as Tsogtu [[Khan (title)|Khan]] among the Khalkha Mongols in Qinghai.

'''The Khalkha Right Wing Banner:''' This banner was popularly known as the Darkhan Beili Banner and the ruler of this banner was the descendant of Gersenz Jalair Khan's grandson Bunidari. In 1653 they migrated into Inner Mongolia from the Tusheet Khan Aimak of Outer Mongolia.

'''The Khalkha East Wing Banner:''' This banner was popularly known as the "Chokhor Halh" and the ruler of this banner was the descendant of Gombo-Ilden, the fifth generation grandson to Gersenz Jalair Khan. They fled from the Zasakto Khan Aimak of Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia in 1664. Its boundaries as given by the Mongol Pastures run 125 by 230 "li", or about 41 by 76 miles.

'''The Tanggot Khalkha Banner:''' This Banner formerly subordinated for administrative purposes to the East Wing Tumet (Monggoljin) Banner, is popularly known as Tanggot Khalkha. This tiny territory, of not more than 12 by 15 miles, is said to have a population of about 500 people. There are practically no Chinese, as the surrounding districts are held by Mongols. The tribe, which has a prince of its own, was founded by immigrants from the Jasakto Khan division of Outer Mongolia, who fled to Inner Mongolia and offered submission to the Manchus in 1662, during the wars between the Northern (Khalkha) and Western (Ulot) Mongols.

== Loss of Khalkha territory to Imperial Russia and the Buriatized Khalkhas ==

During the rise of Genghis Khan in the 12th to 13th centuries, neither the Selenge valley in today's southern Buriatia or the Aga steppe had at this time any connection with the Buriats; these were the lands of the Merkid tribe and the Mongol tribe proper. Starting 1628 with the Russian Conquest and Buriat Migration, the Selenge Valley, as before, was inhabited by Mongol clans under the rule of the Khalkha khans. By 1652 the Khalkha khans were protesting the Russian incursions into Transbaikalia, and from 1666 on Khalkha raiding parties reached as far as Bratsk, Ilimsk, Yeravninsk, and Nerchinsk, while the khans besieged the forts on the Selenge. At the same time, however, the Khoris along the Uda River in 1647 surrendered as a block to the Russians to escape paying tribute to the Khalkhas. Smaller Mongol clan fragments also defected north to the protection of Cossack forts. The invasion of Khalkha by Galdan Boshogtu Khan in 1688 stopped Khalkha resistance to the Cossack advance and sent more Mongol refugees fleeing into Russian control. 

Finally, the Selenge Mongols, cut off by the new border from their Khalkha kinsmen and mixed with displaced Buriats and Khori, gradually accepted the Russian designation as Buriat. These groups are: Descendants of Okhin Taij (grandson of Khalkha's Tsogtu Khan); Khatagin; Atagan; Ashabagad; Sartuul; Tavnanguud; Yungsiebu; O'zeed; Uuld; Tsongool. The Tsongool subclans are as follows: 1. Uriankhad, 2. Bolingud, 3. Baatud, 4. Ashibagad, 5. Avgachuud, 6. Sharnuud, 7. Nomkhod, 8. Khamnigan, 9. Arshaantan, 10. Khorchid, 11. Naimantan, 12. Yunshööbü, 13. Khotgoid, 14. Eljiged, 15. Örlüüd, 16. Tavnanguud, 17. Orongoi, 18. Tsookhor, 19. Sartuul, 20. Sharaid, 21. Temdegten.
Mongolian academician, writer, and scholar Byambyn Renchin ({{lang-mn|Бямбын Ренчин}}) is a representative of this ethnic group. His father belonged to the Yungshiebu tribe and his mother was a direct descendant of [[Genghis Khan]] through Khalkha's Tsogtu Khan.

'''[[Lesbian]]''', '''[[gay]]''', '''[[bisexual]]''' and '''[[transgender]] ([[LGBT]])''' '''[[stereotypes]]''' are conventional, formulaic [[generalization]]s, opinions, or images based on the [[sexual orientation]]s or [[gender identity|gender identities]] of LGBT people. Stereotypical [[perception]]s may be acquired through interactions with parents, teachers, peers and [[mass media]],&lt;ref name=stangor&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stereotypes and Prejudice: Essential Readings |first=Charles (ed.) |last=Stangor |year=2000 |isbn=0-86377-588-8 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more generally, through a lack of firsthand familiarity, resulting in an increased reliance on generalizations.&lt;ref name=mccrady&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCrady |first=Richard |author2=Jean Mccrady |title=Effect of direct exposure to foreign target groups on descriptive stereotypes held by American students |url=http://www.atypon-link.com/SJP/doi/abs/10.2224/sbp.1976.4.2.233?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=sbp |journal=Social Behavior and Personality |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=August 1976 |doi=10.2224/sbp.1976.4.2.233 |page=233 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In general==

===Religion===
While LGBT people are associated with irreligiousness, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] promotes the idea that an individual can be gay and religious. Harry Knox, a gay minister, has led this movement since 2005. "Seventy-two percent of adults describe their faith as "very important" in their lives, so do sixty percent of gays and lesbians" (US News). Activists are working to bridge the gap between religion and homosexuality and to make denominations friendlier to the community. Many Protestants have opened their doors and the [[United Church of Christ]] has ordained gay ministers since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/about.html|title=About our LGBT Ministries|website=www.ucc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT clergy are also ordained in the Episcopal Church of America and the Presbyterian Church (US).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.pcusa.org/news/2011/5/11/pcusa-relaxes-constitutional-prohibition-gay-and-l/ and the Evangelical Church in America&lt;/ref&gt; [[The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] has worked with Jewish individuals in the LGBT community,&lt;ref&gt;"Human Rights Campaign's Harry Knox Is Candidate for Senior Pastor of Houston's Resurrection Metropolitan Community Church." Human Rights Campaign's Harry Knox Is Candidate for Senior Pastor of Houston's Resurrection Metropolitan... Web. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations like [[Keshet (organization)|Keshet]] continue to work with Jewish members of the community both to raise awareness of LGBTQ issues in Jewish communities and Jewish issues in LGBTQ communities.

===In fiction: "Bury your gays"===
"Bury your gays" and more specifically "dead lesbian syndrome" describe the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in fiction that requires that [[List of LGBT characters in modern written fiction|gay or lesbian characters]] die or meet another unhappy ending, such as becoming insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Framke|first1=Caroline|title=Queer women have been killed on television for decades. Now The 100's fans are fighting back.|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/25/11302564/lesbian-deaths-television-trope|accessdate=3 April 2016|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Autostraddle]]'', which examined 1,779 [[Screenplay|scripted]] U.S. television [[Television program|series]] from 1976 to 2016, 193 (11%) of them featured lesbian or bisexual female characters, and among these, 35% saw lesbian or bisexual characters dead, but only 16% provided a happy ending for them. Similarly, among all lesbian or bisexual characters in no longer airing series, 31% ended up dead, and only 10% received a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Heather|title=Autostraddle's Ultimate Infographic Guide to Dead Lesbian Characters on TV|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/autostraddles-ultimate-infographic-guide-to-dead-lesbian-tv-characters-332920/|accessdate=3 April 2016|website=[[Autostraddle]]|date=25 March 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of 242 character deaths in the 2015-2016 television season, ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' reported that "A full 10 percent of deaths [were] queer women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Framke|first1=Caroline|last2=Zarracina|first2=Javier|last3=Frostenson|first3=Sarah|title=All the TV character deaths of 2015-'16, in one chart|url=https://www.vox.com/a/tv-deaths-lgbt-diversity|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such statistics led ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' to conclude in 2016 that "the trope is alive and well on TV, and fictional lesbian and bisexual women in particular have a very small chance of leading long and productive lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=What TV Can Learn From 'The 100' Mess|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/opinion/the-100-lexa-jason-rothenberg-1201729110/|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 March 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trope also appears in other fiction, such as [[video games]], where [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters]] are, according to ''[[Kotaku]]'', "largely defined by a pain that their straight counterparts do not share". Facing challenges that "serve as an in-world analogy for anti-LGBTQ bigotry", these characters are defined by tragedy that denies them a chance at happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alexandra |first1=Heather |title=Let Queer Characters Be Happy |url=https://kotaku.com/let-queer-characters-be-happy-1827147707 |accessdate=8 July 2018 |work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===

For years, the media has been moving forward in equally representing members of the [[LGBT community]]. While there may still not be many prominent LGBT characters in the [[mainstream media]], the community has completed many milestones in the recent years. In 2016, the [[coming-of-age]] drama film ''[[Moonlight]]'' became the first LGBT movie to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.psu.edu/civicissues2/2017/03/23/lgbtq-representation-in-the-media/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''[[Love, Simon]]'' also became another groundbreaking and Oscar winning film, delicately documenting the hardships of being a gay teenager. Typically, movies like this attract a smaller following and budget. However, director [[Greg Berlanti]] is proud to say he’s leading a large mainstream audience. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/26/love-simon-review-gay-teen-coming-out-comedy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, LGBT members continue to be underrepresented and type-casted as mentally ill, criminals, or the end of a punchline because they are considered “different” by many. Due to our [[heteronormative]] society, the [[homophobia]] against the community perpetuates bias and assumptions about how it’s “normal” to have a [[nuclear family]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://criticalmediaproject.org/category/lgbtq/]&lt;/ref&gt; In movies such as [[Zoolander 2]], [[My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2]], and [[Neighbors 2]], their narratives included [[stereotypes]] and jokes pertaining to gay characters. As for representation, [[Disney]] holds the title of only representing the LGBT community in 8% of their films as of 2016. Other companies such as [[20th Century Fox]], [[Sony]], [[Lionsgate]] and [[Warner Bros]] have featured LGBT characters in only up to 21% of their films as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15690404/glaad-lgbtq-representation-film-not-getting-better]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder and violence===
LGBT rights activists have fought against fictional representations of LGBT people that depict them as violent and murderous. Columnist [[Brent Hartinger]] observed that "literally all the big-budget Hollywood movies until, perhaps, ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' in 1993 that featured major gay male characters portrayed them as insane villains and serial killers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartinger|first1=Brent|title=Ask the Flying Monkey (August 18, 2008)|url=http://www.newnownext.com/ask-the-flying-monkey-august-19-2008/08/2008/|website=After Elton / New Now Next|publisher=Logo|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community members organized protests and boycotts against films with murderous gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters, including ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'' (1980), ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=John|title=Gay-Bashing, Villainy and the Oscars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/movies/film-gay-bashing-villainy-and-the-oscars.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=28 May 2016|date=29 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout has written about the recurrence of the "homicidal homosexual" in American plays, but notes that LGBT playwrights themselves have appropriated this negative stereotype to confront and subvert homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schildcrout|first1=Jordan|title=Murder Most Queer: The Homicidal Homosexual in the American Theater|date=2014|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-05232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such plays include ''[[The Lisbon Traviata]]'' (1985) by [[Terrence McNally]], ''Porcelain'' (1992) by [[Chay Yew]], ''The Secretaries'' (1993) by the [[Five Lesbian Brothers]], and ''[[The Dying Gaul (film)|The Dying Gaul]]'' (1998) by [[Craig Lucas]].

==Lesbians==
[[File:Portia de Rossi.jpg|thumb|left|Actress [[Portia de Rossi]] came out as a lesbian in the early 2000s.]]

{{More citations needed|date=July 2018}}

Many 20th-century films put a negative connotation on the [[lesbian]] community. "[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]" (1961) gives viewers the idea that lesbians live a "dark" and almost depressing lifestyle. However, by the 21st century, the media was portraying lesbians in a more positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Randy. "Hollywood Has a Long History of Stereotyping Gays, Lesbians." Elvaq.com. Knight Ridder Newspaper, 9 Jan. 2006. Web. 17 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the popular lesbian television series ''[[The L Word]]'' the media refutes the "U-Haul" lesbian stereotype, which is that lesbians move in on the second date. The show depicts a lesbian couple that starts a family and stays together long term. It intends to prove that lesbians hold the same "family values" as that of heterosexual couples. The show also uses mostly "feminine" or "lipstick" lesbians to combat the stereotype that all lesbians are "butch", or dress like men. This promotes the idea that lesbians come in all different shapes, sizes, and styles. The show also battles stereotypes through its character, Shane. Shane challenges the stereotype that lesbians catch feelings easily. It is believed that lesbians are easily domesticated, however, Shane shuffles between a varieties of girls, to challenge the idea that lesbians get easily attached to their partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Challenges to Stereotypes." The L Word. Web. 18 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, negative stereotypes are touched upon, particularly in the first season, in which the lesbian Marina Ferrer is depicted as a sexual predator relentlessly pursuing and ultimately seducing the straight [[Jenny Schecter]] despite being in a relationship and knowing of Jenny's engagement to her fiancé, Tim, which leads to the destruction of Jenny and Tim's relationship, effectively reinforcing the stereotype that lesbians "recruit" straight women and have no respect for their boyfriends (although Jenny herself was badly received by the LGBT community throughout the series' entire run). Another character, Lacey, goes out of her way to defame Shane solely for refusing to commit to her, in the process risking potential police action, and is pacified only when Shane sleeps with her one last time. On many occasions throughout the series, numerous characters are shown starting affairs merely to make their lovers jealous, or simply sabotaging their relationships through adultery for no apparent reason. Of note, all of the main characters are depicted as having cheated at least once on a lover, and generally unable to commit to a sole partner.

In the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', the character [[Renee Montoya]] is a lesbian and recovering drug addict, while the characters Fish Mooney, Barbara Kean and Tabitha Galavan are bisexual. Fish Mooney is introduced as the second-in-command of mafia boss [[Carmine Falcone]], with a penchant for ruthlessness and an ambition to overthrow both Falcone and [[Sal Maroni]] and become Gotham's sole crime boss. Montoya does not hide her grudge against [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] for being in a relationship with Barbara, her former lover. When rumors surface that Gordon may be corrupt, Montoya becomes determined to put him behind bars, though it is primarily in the hopes of getting Barbara back instead of enforcing justice, but after she briefly succeeds in resuming her affair with Barbara, she pushes Barbara away when Barbara appears to be going back to depression and drug addiction. After Gordon begins a relationship with [[Leslie Thompkins]], Barbara is driven insane with jealousy and eventually progresses to become one of the series' main antagonists. The second season introduces Tabitha Galavan, the bisexual sister of Theo Galavan, and who is also depicted as a ruthless, sadistic mercenary who has an on-again off-again relationship with Barbara.

Many lesbians are associated with short hair, wearing baggy clothes and playing sports.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Wendy. "College Students' multiple Stereotypes of Lesbians: A Cognitive&lt;/ref&gt; Further, news coverage of LGBT issues reinforces stereotyped portrayals of lesbians. Often news broadcasts highlight stories on more "masculine" lesbians and fail to give equal coverage to other more faceted lesbian identities. Thus, the populations who receive information about marginalized communities from a news source begin to equate lesbian sexuality with masculine presentation. The way lesbians are portrayed leads people to make assumptions about individuals in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Stossel, John, and Gena Binkley. "Gay Stereotypes: Are They True?" ABC News. ABC News Network, 15 Sept. 2006. Web. 16 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, lesbians are stereotyped as belonging to one of the two following categories: "[[butch and femme]]". Butch lesbians dress in a more [[Masculinity|masculine]] manner than other women. "[[dyke (slang)|Dykes]]" (a [[pejorative]] term that the Lesbian community has [[reappropriation|reclaimed]], to an extent) are considered members of a community that is perceived as being composed of strong and outspoken [[advocacy|advocates]] in wider society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krantz | first1 = S.

[[lesbian feminism|Lesbian feminists]] assert that a sexual component is unnecessary for a woman to declare herself a lesbian if her primary and closest relationships are with women, on the basis that, when considering past relationships within an appropriate historic context, there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothblum, Esther, Brehoney, Kathleen, eds. (1993). ''Boston Marriages: Romantic But Asexual Relationships Among Contemporary Lesbians'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87023-875-2}}, p. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, an [[Cohort (educational group)|academic cohort]] called the Lesbian History Group wrote:
{{quote|"Because of society's reluctance to admit that lesbians exist, a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label. Evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here... A woman who never married, who lived with another woman, whose friends were mostly women, or who moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles, may well have been a lesbian. ...

Homosexual men are often equated interchangeably with heterosexual [[women]] by the [[heterosexism|heterocentric]] mainstream and are frequently stereotyped as being [[effeminate]],&lt;ref name=chrysler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |title=Chrysler TV ad criticized for using gay stereotypes |accessdate=2007-04-07 |date=2006-04-07 |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423032540/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |archivedate=2006-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that [[gender expression]], [[gender identity]] and [[sexual orientation]] are widely accepted to be distinct from each other.&lt;ref name=nacua&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html |title=Gender Identity and Expression Issues at Colleges and Universities |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=[[National Association of College and University Attorneys]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Queen (gay slang)|flaming queen]]" is a characterization that melds [[flamboyant|flamboyance]] and effeminacy, remaining a gay male [[stock character]] in [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Celluloid Closet]]''; (1995) [[Rob Epstein]] and [[Jeffrey Friedman (filmmaker)|Jeffrey Friedman]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theatre]], specifically [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals, are a component of another stereotype, the "[[show queen]]", which generalizes that gay men are involved with the [[performing arts]], and are theatrical, overly dramatic, and [[Camp (style)|camp]].&lt;ref name=moderndrama&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.utpjournals.com/product/md/434/boys10.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061111141422/http://www.utpjournals.com/product/md/434/boys10.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-11-11 |title=Something for the Boys: Musical Theater and Gay Culture |journal=Modern Drama |volume=43 |issue=4 |year=1999 |first=John M. |last=Clum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance and mannerisms ===

Gay men are often associated with a [[gay lisp|lisp]] or a feminine speaking tone.&lt;ref name=xtra&gt;{{cite news |title=Dunk the faggot: A gay radio voice, back from hell |first=Ian |last=Mackenzie |work=[[Xtra!]] |date=2004-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuever&gt;{{cite news|title=Dishy Delight: Steven Cojocaru, a Glamour Boy in TV's Post-Gay Embrace |url=http://www.hankstuever.com/cojocaru.html |date=2003-04-19 |last=Stuever |first=Hank |work=[[The Washington Post]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222160720/http://www.hankstuever.com/cojocaru.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion and effeminacy have long been seen as stereotypes of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Madon |first1=Stephanie |year=1997 |journal=Sex Roles |volume=37 |issue=9-10 |pages=663-685 |title= What do people believe about gay males?

Some commentators argue this encourages the stereotype that most gay men enjoy shopping.&lt;ref name=tatchell&gt;{{cite news |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |title=Yobs for the boys |work=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] |date=1996-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limp wrist is also a mannerism associated with gay men.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures - Page 491, Bonnie Zimmerman - 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by [[William T. L. Cox|Cox]] and colleagues demonstrated that "[[gaydar]]" is often used as an alternate label for using stereotypes, especially those related to appearance and mannerisms, to infer orientation.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2016)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T.

=== Sex and relationships ===

[[File:Carro Arcigay MI - Gay Pride nazionale di Roma 16-6-2007 - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 5.jpg|thumb|[[Gay]] men on a [[pride parade]] float in [[Rome]].]]

Research also suggests that lesbians may be slightly more likely than gay men to be in steady relationships.&lt;ref name=garnets&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda D. |last=Garnets |author2=Douglas C.

Participants in the study reported finding it difficult to befriend other gay men on a platonic basis. They found that when they would engage with other gay men there would be an assumption of sexual motivations, and when it became clear that this was not the case the other men would not be interested in continuing socialising. These stereotypes permeate throughout all facets of society, even influencing those subjected to it.&lt;ref name=Roffee2016&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth | year=2016 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201 | last1 = Roffee | first1 = James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another persistent stereotype associated with the gay male community is partying. Before the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, most LGBT people were extremely private and closeted, and house parties, bars, and taverns became some of the few places where they could meet, socialize, and feel [[safe space|safe]]. The riots represented the start of the modern LGBT social movement and acceptance of sexual and gender minorities, which has steadily increased since. Festive and party-like social occasions remain at the core of organizing and fundraising in the LGBT community. In cities where there are large [[demographics of sexual orientation|populations of LGBT people]], benefits and bar fundraisers are still common, and alcohol companies invest heavily in LGBT-oriented marketing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Ushered in by underground gay clubs and disc jockeys, the [[disco]] era kept the "partying" aspect vibrant and ushered in the more hardcore [[circuit party]] movement, hedonistic and associated with [[party and play]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/05/04/MN281636.DTL DANCE OF DEATH, First of three parts, CRYSTAL METH FUELS HIV] Christopher Heredia, May 4, 2003, SF Gate&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between gay men and female heterosexual "[[fag hag]]s" has become highly stereotypical. The accepted behaviors in this type of relationship can predominantly include physical affections (such as kissing and touching), as in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcspc00g/301/newgayman-csmc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Reinventing Privilege: The (New) Gay Man in Contemporary Popular Media|website=csun.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and drugs===

The term ''[[party and play]]'' (PNP) is used to refer to a [[subculture]] of gay men who use [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] and have sex together, either one-on-one or in groups. The drug chosen is typically [[methamphetamine]], known as ''crystal'' or ''tina'' in the gay community. Other "party drugs" such as [[MDMA]] and [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] are less associated with this term. While PNP probably has its genesis in the distinct subculture of methamphetamine users, and is most associated with its use, it has become somewhat generalized to include partying with other drugs thought to enhance sexual experiences, especially MDMA, GHB, and [[cocaine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A report from the National HIV Prevention Conference (a collaborative effort by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and other governmental and non-government organizations) describes PNP as "sexual behavior under the influence of crystal meth or other 'party' drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aegis.org/conferences/nhivpc/2005/T1-A0802.html |title=How MSM manage HIV risk behavior within the online "party and play" subculture |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been referred to as both an "epidemic" and a "plague" in the gay community.&lt;ref name="metroweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/gauge/?ak=2025 |title=PSA tackles 'PNP': TV ad warns against crystal meth usage in the gay male community |work=[[Metro Weekly]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921093652/http://www.metroweekly.com/gauge/?ak=2025 |archivedate=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110402178.html |title=Meth Comes Out of the Closet |date=November 8, 2005 |author=John-Manuel Andriote |work=[[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; British researchers report that up to 20% of gay men from central [[London]] gyms have tried methamphetamine, the drug most associated with PNP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1974.html |title=Up to 20 per cent of gay men have tried crystal meth |work=Pink News }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite methamphetamine use being relatively unknown in the UK outside the PNP subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Breaking Bad'': Why doesn't the UK have a crystal meth problem? |author=Duncan Walker |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23453028 |work=[[BBC News Online|BBC News Magazine]] |date=6 August 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme sex or [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] is also a stereotype in gay men. People often presume that gay men often conform to the stereotype of leather and chaps, including fisting.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Pedophilia and predation===

[[Societal attitudes toward homosexuality#Association with child abuse and pedophilia|It is a common stereotype that gay men are sexual predators or pedophile]]s.&lt;ref name="Whiteman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-04-14/world/vatican.homosexuality.pedophilia_1_pedophilia-gay-rights-cardinal-tarcisio-bertone?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Gay outrage over cardinal's child abuse comment |publisher=CNN |first=Hilary |last=Whiteman |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018182049/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-04-14/world/vatican.homosexuality.pedophilia_1_pedophilia-gay-rights-cardinal-tarcisio-bertone?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=2010-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former perception can lead to a knee-jerk reaction that created the "[[gay panic defense]]", usually in straight men, who fear being [[hit on]] by gay men, and can be either a cause or an expression of homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chuang HT, Addington D |date=Oct 1988|title=Homosexual panic: a review of its concept|journal=Can J Psychiatry|volume=33|issue=7|pages=613–7|pmid=3197016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception that a greater proportion of gay than straight men are [[pedophiles]] or [[child sexual abuse]]rs is one contributing factor of discrimination against gay teachers, despite the stark contrast to statistical figures, which have generally revealed most male child sexual abusers, including those who target boys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abel|first=Gene G.|title=The Abel and Harlow Child Molestation Prevention Study|url=http://www.childmolestationprevention.org/pdfs/study.pdf|work=The Stop Child Molestation Book|publisher=Xlibris|accessdate=29 June 2012|author2=Nora Harlow|date=2002|quote=More than 70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences.

[[Woody Allen]] is quoted saying, "Being bisexual doubles your chance of a date on Saturday night."&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/bisexuality.htm |title=Bisexuality: A unique sexual orientation |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common bisexual stereotypes include an inability to maintain a steady relationship or be trustworthy (based on a perception that bisexuals are promiscuous because of their attraction to more than one gender),&lt;ref name="bi"/&gt; and indecision as to whether one is gay or straight (which assumes a binary, either-or spectrum of sexuality). Over a person's life, one's sexual desires and activities may vary greatly.&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;

In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made the academic case for bisexuality with her ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life'', in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for "repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92661-0 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock musician [[David Bowie]] famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Roy; Murray, Charles Shaar (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record. New York: Avon. {{ISBN|0-380-77966-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 1976 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Bowie said, "It's true, I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/david-bowie-interview/index.htmlpage=2 |title=Interview: David Bowie |date=September 1976 |work=Playboy |accessdate=14 September 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1983 interview he said it's "the biggest mistake [he had] ever made",&lt;ref&gt;Buckley (2000): p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, David (2005) [First published 1999]. Strange Fascination — David Bowie: The Definitive Story. London: Virgin. {{ISBN|978-0-7535-1002-5}}., p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 elaborating: "I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer ... America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."&lt;ref name="Collis"/&gt;

As for bisexual people portrayed by [[Hollywood]], from the end of the McCarthy era to even today, "The history of male bisexual characters in film has been one of negative stereotyping."&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1300/J159v05n02_35|title=Is That Me Up There?|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=5|issue=2–3|pages=305|year=2005|last1=Bryant|first1=Wayne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender people==
''[[Transgender]]'' is an [[umbrella term]] that encompasses a wide range of people with more specific identities. In general, a person who is transgender identifies with a gender other than their gender assigned at birth. The term may apply to any number of distinct communities, such as [[cross-dressers]], [[drag queens]], and [[drag kings]], in addition to [[transsexual]]s.&lt;ref name=currah&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender Rights |editor-first1=Paisley |editor-last1=Currah |editor-first2=Richard M. |editor-last2=Juang |editor-first3=Shannon Price |editor-last3=Minter |isbn=0-8166-4312-1 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis, Minn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs that transgender people are all prostitutes and caricatures of men and women are two of many erroneous misconceptions.&lt;ref name=aidsinfonyc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/Q-zone/youth.html |title=Transgendered Youth at Risk for Exploitation, HIV, Hate Crimes |work=Inter-Q-Zone |year=1995 |accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common stereotype of [[trans women]] is that they're assumed to be drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth #10: Drag queens and kings are transgender|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/transgender-myths-fiction-facts/transvestites-drag-queens-transgender-myth|website=Vox|publisher=Vox Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; While historically some trans women have been innovators within the drag scene alongside gay men, trans women are not drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide - Transgender|url=https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender|website=GLAAD|publisher=GLAAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transsexualism===
A [[transsexualism|transsexual]] is a person born with the physical characteristics of one sex who psychologically and emotionally identifies with a variant or different gender than their physical sex characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/transexual |title=transexual - definition of transexual by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transvestites and cross-dressers===
[[Transvestites]] are often assumed to be homosexuals. The word ''transvestism'' comes from the combination of Latin words ''trans'' meaning "across, over"  and ''vestitus'' meaning dressed.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Magnus: Die Transvestiten.

Most prefer to use the term ''cross-dresser'' or ''cross-dressing''.&lt;ref name=msualliance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msu.edu/~alliance/faq/faqtransgendered.html#1.3 |title=Transgender FAQ |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520111935/http://www.msu.edu/~alliance/faq/faqtransgendered.html |archivedate=2008-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and prevalence==

===Research===
Social scientists are attempting to understand why there are such negative connotations associated with the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael J. "Homophobia and Acceptance of Stereotypes About Gays and Lesbians." 7.3 (2009): 159,160-167. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James]] assumed that it was a repulsive instinct that came naturally to each woman and that, when an individual enjoyed same-sex interaction, it was because it became a habit. In short, he assumed that "tolerance is learned and revulsion is inborn" (PBS).  In 1908, James and Edward Westermack attempted to understand the violent actions taken toward homosexuals by Jewish, Christian, and Zoroastrian religions. They believed hostility existed because of the historical association between homosexuality and idolatry, heresy, and criminal behavior. [[Sigmund Freud]] asserted in 1905 that homophobia was shaped by society, an individual's environment, and the individual's exposure to homo-eroticism. Sandor Ference (1914) believed that heterosexual women's feelings of repulsion toward those identifying as lesbians was a reaction formation and defense mechanism against affection from the same sex. In other words, he believed heterosexual females feared being labeled as lesbians.

Taking an individual that adheres to stereotypes of LGBT people and putting them in face-to-face interaction with those of the LGBT community tends to lessen tendencies to rely upon stereotypes and increases the presence of individuals with a similar ethnic, religious, or geographical background, and who are accepting of homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Herek, Gregory. "Hating Gays: An Overview of Scientific Studies." PBS. PBS. Web. 18 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hispanics====
[[Hispanics]] generally have a difficult time within the culture of the Hispanic American countries, yet not in Spain, this is due to this cultures being more traditionalist (With the exception of Argentina, Uruguay and Chile). There have been some shifts away from these stereotypes in recent years, but it has been to different extents depending on the culture. The strong belief in "machismo" has caused these shifts in attitude to be so small. [[Machismo]] refers to the male dominant role in society that provides more social authority to men that are not experienced by women. Female homosexuality is less explicitly accepted in many of these cultures, while in certain countries and in certain social status it is accepted, they do not enjoy the acceptance similar to that of Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Forsloff, Carol.

====Asians====
Asian American women that identify as lesbian or bisexual may face sexual fetishization by white men or women and are stereotyped as "spicy", leading to frustrations about Asian lesbians feeling they are not taken seriously by society, stereotypes about Asian women as "freaky", and [[Asian fetish|yellow fever]].&lt;ref name="SungSzymanski2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sung|first1=Mi Ra|last2=Szymanski|first2=Dawn M.|last3=Henrichs-Beck|first3=Christy|title=Challenges, coping, and benefits of being an Asian American lesbian or bisexual woman.|journal=Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity|volume=2|issue=1|year=2015|pages=52–64|issn=2329-0390|doi=10.1037/sgd0000085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay and bisexual Asian men are stereotyped as "effeminate, submissive, and docile".&lt;ref name="CallanderNewman2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callander|first1=Denton|last2=Newman|first2=Christy E.|last3=Holt|first3=Martin|title=Is Sexual Racism Really Racism?

{{See also|Sexual minorities in Japan|Homosexuality in Japan}}

In [[Japan]], adult lesbians (better known as "'bians") are frequently portrayed as smokers in [[Media of Japan|Japanese Media]]. Japanese culture also heavily fetishizes LGBTQ relationships, often seen in the prevalence of [[yaoi]] (male homosexuality) and [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] (female homosexuality/lesbianism). While Japanese culture heavily discourages interest in homosexual fiction matching the reader's sex, certain publications, such as manga magazine [[Comic Yuri Hime|Yuri Hime]], have repeatedly reported their dominant consumers as the same gender as portrayed for most of their operational life.

A '''lead time''' is the [[:wikt:latency|latency]] between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.

==Journalism==
Lead time in [[publishing]] describes the amount of time that a [[journalist]] has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece.  Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.

==Medicine==
Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

==Supply chain management==
A more conventional definition of lead time in the [[supply chain management]] realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of [[finished goods]] or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] identifies "total lead time" as a combination of "internal lead time" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a [[purchase order]]) and "external lead time" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any [[New product development|development]] required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier.  The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for [[material requirements planning]].  It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received.  The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial.  With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.

Lead time is made of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.supply-chain-consultant.eu/10/lead-time-supply-chain/ ''Lead Times'']. "Lead times in supply chain" Supply Chain Consultant Website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preprocessing Lead Time''' (also known as "planning time" or "paperwork"): It represents the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item) from the time you learn of the requirement.
* '''Processing Lead Time''': It is the time required to procure or manufacture an item.
* '''Postprocessing Lead Time''': It represents the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.)

'''Example'''

Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order.  It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.
*If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part.
*If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included.
*If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included.

'''In more detail'''

Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, J. (2012) [http://www.leadtimes.org/ ''www.leadtimes.org''] Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.
* '''Order Lead Time''' - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered.
* '''Order Handling Time''' - Time from customer order received to sales order created.
* '''Manufacturing Lead Time''' - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Production Lead Time''' - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Delivery Lead Time''' - Time from production finished to customer order delivered.

'''Example '''

A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted – Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.

Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.

When he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.

==Order lead time==
When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : 
*The '''Actual Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The order lead-time'', refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the  '''''delivery''''' of the goods."&lt;ref&gt;Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., &amp;  Tirtiroglu, E., 2001  "Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment." International journal of operations &amp; production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''Requested Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer '''''requested''''' delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;2)Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., &amp; Sweeney, M. 2009. "A process for managing manufacturing flexibility." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Silva, L., 2013, "Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Quote Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt;) is the '''''agreed'' ''' time between the Order Entry Date and the supplier’s committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
*The '''Confirmed Order Lead Time''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier '''''confirmed''''' delivery date of goods.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; = Wish Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; = Quote Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; = Delivery Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.

===Average OLT based on volume===
The Average OLT based on Volume (OLT&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OLTV= \frac{\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. &lt;br /&gt;
The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.

===Potential application areas for order lead time measurement===
The correct analysis of OLT will give the company:
*Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management).
*Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema).  
*The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them.

==Project management==
In [[project management]] lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire [[project]] would be the overall duration of the [[critical path method|critical path]] for the project.

Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.

According to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref&gt;PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). ''The Project Management Institute''. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.

[[File:LT-1997-50litų-Karaims and Tatars-b.png|thumb|[[Litas]] commemorative coin for the 600th anniversary of [[Crimean Karaites|Karaims]] and Tatars in Lithuania (1397–1997)]]
The '''Lipka Tatars''' (also known as '''Lithuanian Tatars''', '''Polish Tatars''', ''Lipkowie'', ''Lipcani'' or ''Muślimi'') are a group of [[Tatars]] who originally settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] at the beginning of the 14th century. The first settlers tried to preserve their [[shamanistic]] religion and sought asylum amongst the non-Christian Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="galve.lt"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas Lietuvos totoriai ir jų šventoji knyga - Koranas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029035259/http://www.galve.lt/lt/numeriai/2007062225/Trakai%20ir%20pasaulio%20paveldas/koranas |date=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 14th century, another wave of Tatars – this time, [[Muslim]]s, were invited into the Grand Duchy by [[Vytautas the Great]]. These Tatars first settled in [[Lithuania proper]] around [[Vilnius]], [[Trakai]], [[Hrodna]] and [[Kaunas]] &lt;ref name="galve.lt"/&gt; and later spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. These areas comprise present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars. While maintaining their religion, they united their fate with that of the mainly [[Christian]] Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the [[Battle of Grunwald]] onwards the Lipka Tatar light cavalry regiments participated in every significant military campaign of Lithuania and Poland.

The Lipka Tatar origins can be traced back to the descendant states of the [[Mongol Empire]] of [[Genghis Khan]] – the [[White Horde]], the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Crimean Khanate]] and [[Kazan Khanate]]. They initially served as a noble military caste but later they became urban-dwellers known for their crafts, horses and gardening skills. Throughout centuries they resisted assimilation and kept their traditional lifestyle. While they remained very attached to their religion, over time however, they lost their original [[Tatar language]], from the [[Kipchak languages]] group of the [[Turkic languages]], and for the most part adopted [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, "Polish or Lithuanian Tartars", Harvard University Press, pg. 990&lt;/ref&gt; There are still small groups of Lipka Tatars living in today's Belarus, Lithuania and Poland, as well as their communities in United States.

==Name==
{{further|Tatars|Tartary}}
[[File:Lukiskes mosque.jpg|thumb|right|215 px|Tatar mosque and graveyard in the [[Lukiškės Square|Lukiškės]] suburb (1830), [[Vilnius]]. It was replaced by another, a more traditional one, in 1867]]
The name Lipka is derived from the old [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] [[name of Lithuania]]. The record of the name Lipka in Oriental sources permits us to infer an original Libķa/Lipķa, from which the Polish derivative Lipka was formed, with possible [[Linguistic contamination|contamination]] from [[Language contact|contact]] with the Polish ''lipka'' "small lime-tree"; this etymology was suggested by the Tatar author S. Tuhan-Baranowski. A less frequent Polish form, Łubka, is corroborated in Łubka/Łupka, the Crimean Tatar name of the Lipkas up to the end of the 19th century. The Crimean Tatar term ''Lipka Tatarłar'' meaning ''Lithuanian Tatars'', later started to be used by the Polish–Lithuanian Tatars to describe themselves.

In religion and culture the Lipka Tatars differed nominally from most other Islamic communities in respect of the treatment of their women, who always enjoyed a large degree of freedom, even during the years when the Lipkas were in the service of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Co-education of male and female children was the norm, and Lipka women did not wear the veil – except at the marriage ceremony. While traditionally Islamic, the customs and religious practices of the Lipka Tatars also accommodated many Christian elements adopted during their 600 years residence in Belarus, Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania while still maintaining the traditions and superstitions from their nomadic Mongol past.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Over time, the lower and middle Lipka Tatar nobles adopted the [[Ruthenian language]] then later the [[Belarusian language]] as their native language.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Selim"&gt;Selim Mirza-Juszeński Chazbijewicz, "Szlachta tatarska w Rzeczypospolitej" (Tartar Nobility in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), Verbum Nobile no 2 (1993), Sopot, Poland, {{cite web|url=http://www.szlachta.org/selim.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105135019/http://www.szlachta.org/selim.htm |archivedate= 5 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they used the [[Belarusian Arabic alphabet|Arabic alphabet]] to write in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] until the 1930s. The upper nobility of Lipka Tatars spoke Polish.

Diplomatic correspondence between the Crimean Khanate and Poland from the early 16th century refers to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as the "land of the Poles and the Lipkas".&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt; By the 17th century the term Lipka Tatar began to appear in the official documents of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
[[File:Lithuanian Tatars of Napoleonic army.JPG|thumb|right|215 px|[[Lithuanian Tartars of the Imperial Guard|Lithuanian Tartars]] in the Napoleonic Army with Red and White banners of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
The migration of Tatars into the lands of Lithuania and Poland from [[Golden Horde]] began during the 14th century and lasted until the end of the 17th. There was a subsequent wave of Tatar immigrants from Russia after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, although these consisted mostly of political and national activists.&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;

According to some estimates, by 1590–1591 there were about 200,000 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=0-313-27497-5|location=|pages=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipka Tatars living in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and about 400 mosques serving them. According to the ''Risāle-yi Tatar-i Leh'' (trans: ''Message Concerning the Tatars of Poland'', an account of the Lipka Tatars written for [[Süleyman the Magnificent]] by an anonymous Polish Muslim during a stay in [[Constantinople]] in 1557–1558 on his way to [[Mecca]]) there were 100 Lipka Tatar settlements with mosques in Poland. The largest communities existed in the cities of [[Lida]], [[Navahradak]] and [[Iwye]]. There was a Lipka Tatar settlement in [[Minsk]], today's capital of Belarus, known as [[Tatarskaya Slabada]].

In the year 1672, the Tatar subjects rose up in open rebellion against the Commonwealth. This was the widely remembered [[Lipka Rebellion]]. Thanks to the efforts of King [[Jan III Sobieski]], who was held in great esteem by the Tatar soldiers, many of the Lipkas seeking asylum and service in the [[Ottoman empire#Ottoman Army|Turkish army]] returned to his command and participated in the struggles with the Ottoman Empire up to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, including the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683) that was to turn the tide of Islamic expansion into Europe and mark the beginning of the end for the Ottoman Empire.

Beginning in the late 18th and throughout the 19th century the Lipkas became successively more and more [[polonization|Polonized]]. The upper and middle classes in particular adopted Polish language and customs (although they nominally kept Islam as their religion), while the lower ranks became Ruthenized. At the same time, the Tatars held the Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] (Wattad in Tatar, or "defender of Muslims in non Muslim lands"), who encouraged and supported their settlement during the 15th century, in great esteem, including him in many legends, prayers and their folklore.&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt; Throughout the 20th and since the 21st centuries, most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably; for example, the Tatar women in Poland do not practice and view veiling (wearing headscarf/hijab) as a mandatory religious obligation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe3UAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=tatars+in+poland+no+hijab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zXI6JUf2P7&amp;sig=V46CMkAlnUuXysa6fH2y8FOL6JM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH_eDX2snTAhXDnZQKHSEzABEQ6AEIbDAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tatars+in+poland+no+hijab&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Fashion and Anti-Fashion: New Perspectives from Europe and North America|first1=Emma|last1=Tarlo|first2=Annelies|last2=Moors|date=15 August 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|accessdate=31 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamicreligiouseducation.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/islamische_rel/ip-costance/Polish_Tatar_Women_ANalborczyk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but rather an influence of an Arabic culture on an Islamic customs. Many Polish Tatars, especially and mainly the youth, also drink alcohol.

===Timeline===
* '''1226:''' The Khanate of the White Horde was established as one of the [[successor state]]s to the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan. The first Khan, Orda was the second son of [[Jochi]], the eldest son of Genghis Khan. The White Horde occupied the southern Siberian [[steppe]] from the east of the [[Urals]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Mongolia]].
[[File:Bohoniki - Mosque 05.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mosque in [[Bohoniki]].]]
* '''1380:''' Khan [[Tokhtamysh]], the hereditary ruler of the White Horde, crossed west over the Urals and merged the White Horde with the Golden Horde whose first khan was Batu, the eldest son of Jochi. In 1382 the White and Golden Hordes sacked and burned Moscow. Tokhtamysh, allied with the great central Asian Tatar conqueror Tamerlane, reasserted Mongol power in Russia.
* '''1397:''' After a series of disastrous military campaigns against his former protector, the great Tatar warlord [[Tamerlane]], Tokhtamysh and the remnants of his clan were granted asylum and given estates and noble status in Grand Duchy of Lithuania by [[Vytautas the Great]]. The settlement of the Lipka Tatars in Lithuania in 1397 is recorded in the Chronicles of [[Jan Długosz]].
* '''1397:''' The Italian city state of [[Genoa]] funded a joint expedition by the forces of Khan Tokhtamysz and Grand Duke Vytautas against Tamerlane. This campaign was notable for the fact that the Lipka Tatars and Lithuanian armies were armed with handguns, but no major victories were achieved.
* '''15 July 1410:''' The [[Battle of Grunwald]] took place between the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on one side (c. 39,000 troops), and the [[Teutonic Knights]] on the other (c. 27,000 troops). The Teutonic knights were defeated and never recovered their former influence. After the battle, rumours spread across Europe that the Germans had only been defeated thanks to the aid of tens of thousands of heathen Tatars, though it is likely there were no more than 1,000 Tatar horse archers at the battle, the core being the entourage of [[Jalal ad-Din khan|Jalal ad-Din]], son of Khan [[Tokhtamysh]]. At the start of the battle, [[Jalal ad-Din khan|Jalal ad-Din]] led the Lipka Tatar and Lithuanian light cavalry on a suicide charge against the Teutonic Knights' artillery positions – the original "[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]". The Teutonic Knights' Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] responded by ordering his own heavy cavalry to pursue the Lipkas away from the field of battle, trampling through their own infantry in the process. The resulting destruction of the Teutonic Knights' line of battle was a major factor in their subsequent defeat. This incident forms one of the highlights of [[Aleksander Ford]]'s 1960 film ''Krzyżacy'' (''[[Knights of the Teutonic Order (film)|Knights of the Teutonic Order]]''), based on the historical novel [[The Teutonic Knights (novel)|of the same name]] by Nobel laureate [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]].
[[File:Rozmieszczenie Tatarów w Polsce.png|thumb|318x318px|Distribution of Lipka Tatars in Poland (1939)]]
* '''1528:''' The Polish ([[szlachta]]) and [[Lithuanian nobility]]'s legal right to retribution on the grounds of the wounding or killing of a nobleman or a member of his family is extended to the Lipka Tatars.
* '''1569:''' [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is founded at the [[Union of Lublin]]. Companies of Lipka Tatar light cavalry for a long time constituted one of the foundations of the military power of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Lithuanian Tatars, from the very beginning of their residence in Lithuania were known as the Lipkas. They united their fate with that of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the Battle of Grunwald onwards they participated in every significant military campaign.
* '''1591:''' The rule of the fervent Catholic [[Sigismund III]] (1587–1632) and the [[Counter-Reformation]] movement brought a number of restrictions to the liberties granted to non-Catholics in Poland, the Lipkas amongst others. This led to a diplomatic intervention by Sultan [[Murad III]] with the Polish king in 1591 on the question of freedom of religious observance for the Lipkas. This was undertaken at the request of Polish Muslims who had accompanied the Polish King's envoy to [[Istanbul]].
[[File:Jakub Szynkiewicz.png|thumb|210px|[[Jakub Szynkiewicz]], first mufti of interwar Poland]]
* '''1672:''' The [[Lipka Rebellion]]. As a reaction to restrictions on their religious freedoms and the erosion of their ancient rights and privileges, the Lipka Tatar regiments stationed in the [[Podolia]] region of south-east Poland abandoned the Commonwealth at the start of the late 17th century [[Polish–Ottoman Wars]] that were to last to end of the 17th century with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699. The Lipka Rebellion forms the background to the novel ''[[Pan Wolodyjowski]]'', the final volume of the historical ''[[Trylogia]]'' of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], the [[Nobel Prize]] winning author (1905) who was himself descended from Christianised Lipka Tatars. The 1969 film of ''Pan Wolodyjowski'', directed by [[Jerzy Hoffman]] and starring [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as Azja Tuhaj-bejowicz, still remains among the biggest box-office success in the history of Polish cinema.
* '''1674:''' After the famous [[Battle of Khotyn (1673)|Polish victory at Chocim]], the Lipka Tatars who held the Podolia for Turkey from the stronghold of Bar were besieged by the armies of [[Jan III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]], and a deal was struck that the Lipkas would return to the Polish side subject to their ancient rights and privileges being restored.
* '''1676:''' The [[Treaty of Zurawno]] that brought a temporary end to the Polish–Ottoman wars stipulated that the Lipka Tatars were to be given a free individual choice of whether they wanted to serve the [[Ottoman Empire]] or the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
* '''1677:''' The [[Sejm]] in March 1677 confirmed all the ancient Tatar rights and privileges. The Lipka Tatars were permitted to rebuild all their old mosques, to settle Christian labour on their estates and to buy up noble estates that had not previously belonged to Tatars. The Lipka Tatars were also freed from all taxation.
* '''1679:''' As a reward for their return to the Commonwealth the Lipka Tatars were settled by King Jan Sobieski on [[królewszczyzna|Crown Estates]] in the provinces of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Kobryn]] and [[Hrodna]]. The Tatars received land that had been cleared of the previous occupants, from 0.5 to 7.5 square kilometres per head, according to rank and length of service.
* '''1683:''' Many of the Lipka Tatar rebels who returned to the service of the Commonwealth in 1674 were later to take part in the [[Battle of Vienna|Vienna Campaign]] of 1683. This included the 60 Polish Tatars in the light cavalry company of Samuel Mirza Krzeczowski, who was later to save the life of King [[Jan III Sobieski]] during the disastrous first day of the [[Battle of Parkany]], a few weeks after the great victory of the [[Battle of Vienna]] that was to turn the tide of Islamic expansion into Europe and mark the beginning of the end for the Ottoman Empire. The Lipka Tatars who fought on the Polish side at the Battle of Vienna, on 12 September 1683, wore a sprig of straw in their helmets to distinguish themselves from the Tatars fighting under [[Kara Mustafa]] on the Turkish side. Lipkas visiting Vienna traditionally wear straw hats to commemorate their ancestors’ participation in the breaking of the [[Siege of Vienna]].
* '''1699:''' Some of the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec]]-based Lipka Tatars who had remained loyal to the Turkish [[Sultan]] were settled in [[Bessarabia]] along the borderlands between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as well as in the environs of [[Khotyn|Chocim]] and Kamieniec-Podolski and in the town known as [[Lipkany]]. A further large scale emigration of Lipkas to Ottoman controlled lands took place early in the 18th century, after the victory won by King [[Augustus II]] over the Polish-born King [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], whom the Lipkas had supported in his war against the Saxon King.[[File:Helena, Tamara i Hassan Konopaccy.png|thumb|Lipka Tatar family. Hassan Konopacki served as an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]]]
* '''1775:''' The Polish Lipkas came back into favour during the reign of the last King, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanislas Augustus]] (1765–95). In 1775 the [[Sejm]] reaffirmed the noble status of the Polish Lithuanian Tatars. After the [[Partitions of Poland]], the Lipkas played their part in the various national uprisings, and also served alongside the Poles in the [[Grande Armée|Napoleonic army]].
* '''1919:''' The Polish Lipkas joined the newly created [[Polish Army]] formations; [[:pl:Pułk Jazdy Tatarskiej|Pułk Jazdy Tatarskiej]] and later, [[13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans]].
* '''1939:''' With the [[Second Polish Republic|re-emergence of the Polish state]] after the First World War, a Polish Tatar regiment was re-established in the [[Polish Army]] which was distinguished by its own uniforms and banners. After the [[German invasion of Poland|fall of Poland in 1939]], the Polish Tatars in the [[Wilno]] (Vilnius) based 13th Cavalry Regiment were one of the last Polish Army units recorded carrying on the fight against the German aggressors while led by Major [[Aleksander Jeljaszewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Tyszkiewicz.

Today there are about 10,000–15,000 Lipka Tatars in the former areas of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The majority of descendants of Tatar families in Poland can trace their descent from the nobles of the early Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lipka Tatars had settlements in north-east Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, south-east [[Latvia]] and Ukraine. Today most reside in Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus. Most of the Lipka Tatars (80%) assimilated into the ranks of the nobility in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth while some lower noble Tatars assimilated to the [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] townsfolk and peasant populations.

A number of the Polish Tatars emigrated to the US at the beginning of the 20th century and settled mostly in the north eastern states, although there is also an enclave in Florida. A small but active community of Lipka Tatars exists in New York City. "The Islamic Center of Polish Tatars" was built in 1928 in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, and functioned until recently.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

After the annexation of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union following World War II, Poland was left with only 2 Tatar villages, [[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]. A significant number of the Tatars in the territories annexed to the USSR repatriated to Poland and clustered in cities such as [[Gdańsk]], [[Białystok]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] totaling some 3,000 people. One of the neighborhoods of [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] where relocated Tatar families resettled has come to be referred to as "the Tatar Hills", or in Polish "Górki Tatarskie".

In 1925 the [[Muslim Religion Association]] ({{lang-pl|Muzułmański Związek Religijny}}) was formed in Białystok, Poland. In 1992, the [[Organization of Tatars of the Polish Republic]] ({{lang-pl|Związek Tatarów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk, began operating.

In Poland, the 2011 census showed 1,916 people declaring Tatar ethnicity.&lt;ref name="ludnosc" /&gt;

In November 2010, a monument to Poland's Tatar populace was unveiled in the port city of [[Gdańsk]] at a ceremony attended by President [[Bronislaw Komorowski]], as well as [[Tatar]] representatives from across Poland and abroad. The monument is a symbol of the important role of Tatars in [[History of Poland|Polish history]]. "Tatars shed their blood in all national independence uprisings. Their blood seeped into the foundations of the reborn Polish Republic," President Komorowski said at the unveiling. The monument is the first of its kind to be erected in Europe.

'''Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen''' ({{lang-ps|منظور احمد پښتين/پاشتين}}) or '''Manzoor Pashtun''' ({{lang|ps|منظور پښتون}}) is a [[human rights activists|human rights activist]] from [[South Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/manzoor-pashteen-voice-pashtuns-pakistan-180314091327342.html|title=Manzoor Pashteen: The voice of Pashtuns for many in Pakistan|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has spent years lobbying to draw attention to the plight of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun people]], especially those from [[Waziristan]] and other parts of the former [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/pakistan-islambab-pashtun-protest/29021045.html|title=Pashtun Grievances Echo In Islamabad Protest|date=2018-02-05|work=Gandhara [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the chairman of the [[Pashtun Tahafuz Movement]] ("Pashtun Protection Movement").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-530749835.html|title=Call for Ending Discrimination against Pashtoons|date=11 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-530749926.html|title=PTM Leaders Reject Servitude Role for Pashtuns|date=12 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pashteen was born in 1994 in Shahur (or ''Shaheer''), Mawle Khan Sarai, a small village near the town of [[Sarwakai]] in [[South Waziristan]], Pakistan. The eldest of eight siblings, Pashteen belongs to the [[Shamankhel]] [[Mahsud]] tribe of the [[Pashtuns]]. His father, Abdul Wadud Mahsud, is a school teacher at his village.&lt;ref name="voa deewa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voadeewanews.com/a/manzoor-pashtoon-profile/4250116.html|title=د پښتنو د پاڅون مشر منظور پښتين څوک دی؟|date=2018-02-13|work=VOA Deewa|access-date=2018-02-13|language=ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashteen received his early education at his village's school in South Waziristan. In 2005, because of [[offensive (military)|military offensives]] by the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], Pashteen and his family were forced to flee Waziristan and temporarily settle in [[internally displaced person|IDP]] [[refugee camp|camps]] in [[Dera Ismail Khan]], Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;ref name="thefridaytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-mehsud-with-a-movement/|title=The Mehsud with a movement|date=2018-03-02|work=[[The Friday Times]]|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family fled their home in Waziristan for the second time in 2007, and returned in 2008, but fled again in 2008 due to [[Operation Zalzala]]. In 2009, because of [[Operation Rah-e-Nijat]], he and his family were forced to flee Waziristan for the fourth time. Pashteen completed his [[secondary education]] at [[Army Public Schools &amp; Colleges System|Army Public School]] in [[Bannu]] and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate|higher secondary]] education in [[Karak, Pakistan|Karak]]. His father was determined to ensure his education. "Only I know", Pashteen said, "my father borrowed money for my schooling and only I know how much we have suffered".&lt;ref name="thefridaytimes"/&gt; Pashteen received his [[veterinary physician|Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] degree in 2016 at [[Gomal University]], Dera Ismail Khan.&lt;ref name="voa deewa"/&gt; He and his family returned to Waziristan in 2016. They found that their books had been plundered, their house ruined, [[Land mine|landmines]] scattered over their lands and they were humiliated at [[Pakistan Army]] checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/04/07/598045758/caught-between-the-military-and-militants-pakistans-pashtuns-fight-for-rights|title=Caught Between The Military And Militants, Pakistan's Pashtuns Fight For Rights|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, during his studies at Gomal University, Pashteen founded the "Mahsud Tahafuz Movement",&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bbc.in/2p9q0vg|title=د پښتنو منظور پښتین له کومه راغی؟|date=2018-03-11|work=[[BBC Pashto]]|access-date=2018-03-12|language=ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[social movement]] mainly focused on removing landmines from [[Waziristan]] (especially [[Mahsud]] land). After gaining popularity among the Pashtuns in January 2018, its name was changed to the [[Pashtun Tahafuz Movement]] ("Pashtun Protection Movement").

In late 2017, Pashteen and his father were arrested by the security forces of Pakistan and Pashteen was beaten up for allegedly "damaging military morale". Pashteen said to the military, “you are building your morale by killing innocent children and then calling us terrorists.” As a result of the social media campaign for him, he was released by the military.&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/other/manzoor-pashteen-pakistan-social-media|title=Meet the 23-year-old activist who could change Pakistan|website=www.prospectmagazine.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pashtun Long March==
{{See also|Pashtun Tahafuz Movement#Pashtun Long March}}
On January 26, 2018, Pashteen led a protest march starting from [[Dera Ismail Khan]], consisting of only 22 people at the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1662900/1-pashtun-spring-bloom/|title=A ‘Pashtun spring’ bloom?|date=2018-03-17|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many peope joined the march along the way, and it reached [[Peshawar]] on January 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/191100/long-march-naqeeb-killing-reaches-peshawar/|title=Long march against Naqeeb killing reaches Peshawar|date=2018-01-29|work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then upon reaching [[Islamabad]] on February 1, the [[Pashtun Tahafuz Movement]] organized a [[sit-in]] called "All Pashtun National [[Jirga]]". The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun shopkeeper [[Encounter killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud|Naqeebullah Mehsud]] who was shot dead by police force in [[Karachi]] during an encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/pashtun-tribes-stage-unprecedented-protest-in-pakistan/|title=Pashtun Tribes Stage Unprecedented Protest in Pakistan|date=2018-02-08|work=[[The Diplomat]]|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other demands, the jirga also asked the government to set up a [[judicial inquiry]] for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered [[extrajudicial killing|extrajudicially]] in [[encounter killings by police|police encounters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theweek.in/news/world/why-are-the-pashtun-angry-durand-line-afghanistan-pakistan-anwarrao.html|title=Decades of suffering leave the Pashtun youth angry|date=2018-02-06|work=[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/asia/pakistan-pashtun-long-march.html|title=In Pakistan, Long-Suffering Pashtuns Find Their Voice|date=2018-02-06|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/pashtun-protest-islamabad/4248586.html|title=Pashtuns End Protest in Islamabad, Vow to Reconvene if Demands Not Met|date=2018-02-10|work=[[Voice of America]]|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Pashteen has rejected the allegation of being a foreign agent and condemned the labelling of the protesting Pashtuns as foreign agents working for [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) of India or the [[National Directorate of Security]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/10/pashtuns-will-approach-un-if-state-doesnt-give-due-rights-says-manzoor-pashteen/|title=Pashtuns will approach UN if state doesn’t give due rights, says Manzoor Pashteen|website=www.pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/manzoor-pashteen-protest-violent-constitutional-180409083747159.html|title=Manzoor Pashteen: Our protest is non-violent and constitutional|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pashteen cap==
{{Main|Pashteen hat}}
Pashteen usually wears the [[Pashteen cap]] (Mazari hat) at public events and rallies, leading to the hat becoming an iconic symbol of the [[Pashtun Tahafuz Movement]], and being widely renamed after him as the "Pashteen cap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alikozai|first1=Hasib Danish|title=Hats Proliferate as Symbol of Pashtun Protest Movement|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/hats-symbol-pashtun-protest-movement/4335923.html|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=6 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario Alberto''' "'''Popo'''" '''Peña''' (22 October 1980 – 19 March 2013) was a U.S.-born Mexican suspected drug lord and regional leader of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]]. He started his criminal career in a local Texan gang before joining the Gulf Cartel, where he worked as a regional leader in an area known as La Ribereña, across the border from [[Starr County, Texas]]. Though born in the U.S., Peña worked in Mexico and kept close ties with Texas. 

Known for his charisma and heavily tattooed body, Peña was viewed as a gangster folk hero on both sides of the [[Mexico–United States border]]. In 2013, he was betrayed and killed by an alleged member of the Gulf Cartel. According to his family, Peña was killed while guarding US$2&amp;nbsp;million in cash for the Gulf Cartel. Several people paid tribute to him online by creating a [[Facebook]] page and uploading photos and rap music videos in his memory.

==Early life and career==
Mario Alberto Peña, known as "Popo" or "Comandante Popo" (English: Commander Popo), was born in [[Rio Grande City, Texas]], United States on 22 October 1980.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He grew up in [[Roma, Texas]], and started his criminal career for a local Texan street gang. He eventually joined the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. In the Gulf Cartel, Peña was a regional leader in an area in Tamaulipas known as [[La Ribereña]], which sits across [[Starr County, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though born in the U.S., Peña operated primarily in Mexico and kept ties with the [[Rio Grande Valley]].&lt;ref name="xDl34" /&gt;{{sfn|Deibert|2014|p=83}}

On 16 August 2011, Peña and an accomplice Daniel Bazán committed a drive-by shooting at a residence in [[Alto Bonito Heights, Texas]]. According to eye-witnesses, both men arrived at a property in a vehicle and shot at the place using AR-15 assault rifles and other pistols. The Starr County Sheriff's Office issued a bulletin requesting the public to reach out with any information about Peña whereabouts. The wanted flyer said Peña was approximately {{height|ft=5|in=10}} and weighed {{convert|210|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}. He was described as having brown eyes and hair, a beard and mustache, and tattoos in multiple parts of his body. Deputy Erasmo Rios said that they believed Peña was hiding in the Starr County area, but recommended civilians to not try to apprehend them because they were considered armed and dangerous. The warrant against both men was for [[Attempted murder|attempted capital murder]].&lt;ref name="YFqIW" /&gt; Peña fled to Mexico shortly after he was charged.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Peña was killed in Comales, a rural community near [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo, Tamaulipas]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; on 19 March 2013.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to security forces, Peña was killed as part of an [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|internal strife within the Gulf Cartel]] that dates back to September 2011, when suspected Gulf Cartel leader [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (alias "Metro 3") was killed by members of his own criminal group. Peña was confirmed dead by U.S. federal authorities when his body was taken to the international crossing by his family members. Mexican authorities also confirmed his death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to Peña's sister, the family was able to recover the body with the help of another Gulf Cartel regional leader, [[Juan Francisco Sáenz Támez]], alias "Comandante Panochitas" (English: Commander Pussy).{{efn|Sáenz Támez was arrested in [[Edinburg, Texas]], in 2014 and sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2015 for money laundering and drug trafficking offenses.&lt;ref name="BOYch" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Peña was buried in a private ceremony in Texas. His family told the [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]]-based newspaper [[The Monitor (Texas)|''The Monitor'']] in an interview that Peña died "with honor".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Peña was alive, he was regarded as a charismatic gangster and folk hero on both sides of the [[Mexico–United States border]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Deibert|2014|p=83}}

Since his death, several have paid tribute to him online by creating a [[Facebook]] page and uploading photos and multiple rap music videos about him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This furthered Peña's image as some sort of gangster folk hero. Two of the music videos online tell the story of how Peña was killed, and claimed that he was betrayed by a former ally. Peña's sister claims that his murderer was suspected Gulf Cartel regional leader known as Eduardo Luna, who shot Peña from behind because Peña was guarding US$2&amp;nbsp;million in cash for the Gulf Cartel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She claimed that after he killed Peña, Luna fled to the U.S., where he was later arrested for another murder and corruption case involving the [[United States Border Patrol]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Peña's sister also claims that she had met Luna in Mexico, and that he killed several others before her brother. She said his alias in the Gulf Cartel was "Comandante Pájaro" (English: Commander Bird).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her claims were not independently verified by law enforcement, and she later declined an interview with ''[[The Texas Tribune]]''. Luna's defense did not comment on Peña's case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7464">'''Minorities At Risk (MAR)''' is a university-based research project that monitors and analyzes the status and conflicts of 283 politically-active communal groups in many countries throughout the world from 1945 to 2006.  Those minorities included have been deemed politically significant, meaning that the group collectively suffers or benefits from systematic discriminatory treatment at the hands of other societal groups and the group is the foundation of political mobilization and collective action in defense or promotion of self-defined interests.  MAR seeks to identify where the groups are located, what they do, and what happens to them. The project is designed to provide information in a standardized format that aids comparative research and contributes to the understanding of conflicts involving relevant groups. The MAR project was initiated by Ted Robert Gurr in 1986 and has been based at the University of Maryland's Center for International Development and Conflict Management (CIDCM) since 1988.

== Requirements ==

The [[dataset]] does not include all minority groups across the world. There are specific requirements that limit the number of groups analyzed.  Below are the seven database rules that must be met:

# They include groups only in countries with a population (within the year of interest) greater than 500,000;
# They include groups only if in the year of interest they numbered at least 100,000 or, if fewer, exceeded 1% of the population of at least one country in which they resided;
# They include groups separately in each country in which they meet the general criteria. For example, the Kurds are profiled separately in Turkey, Iraq, and Iran;
# They include advantaged minorities like the Sunni Arabs of Iraq and the Overseas Chinese of Southeast Asia, but exclude advantaged majorities;
# They exclude refugee and immigrant groups unless and until they are regarded by outside observers as permanent residents;
# They count and code groups at the highest level within-country level of aggregation that is politically meaningful. For example, all Hispanics in the U.S. are profiled as a single group because they are usually regarded and treated by Anglo-Americans as one collectivity; and,
# They estimate membership in a group using the widest demographic definition, even though not all people who nominally are members of a group necessarily identify with it.

== Group types ==

MAR groups are categorized into six groups which refer to the populations’ past and current struggles on the basis of racial/historical/ethnical variances from the majority population of their country.

1.	[[Ethnic nationalism|Ethnonationalist]]: regionally concentrated peoples with a history of organized political autonomy with their own state, traditional ruler, or regional government who have supported political movements for autonomy at some time since 1945.

2.	[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]]: conquered descendants of earlier inhabitants of a region who live primarily in conformity with traditional social, economic, and cultural customs that are sharply distinct from those of dominant groups.

3.	Ethnoclass: ethnically or culturally distinct, usually descended from slaves or immigrants, most of whom occupy a distinct social and economic stratum or niche.

4.	Communal Contender: culturally distinct peoples, tribes, or clans in heterogeneous societies who hold or seek a share in state power.

	-Disadvantaged: subject to some degree of political, economic, or cultural discrimination but lack offsetting advantages

	-Advantaged: those with political advantage over other groups in their society

	-Dominant: those with a preponderance of both political and economic power

5.	Religious Sect: communal groups that differ from others principally in their religious beliefs and related cultural practices, and whose 
political status and activities are centered on the defense of their beliefs.

6.	National Minority: segments of a trans-state people with a history of organized political autonomy whose kindred control of an adjacent state, but who constitute a minority in the state in which they reside.

== Phases ==

There are five phases completed thus far for the dataset. Phase I covered 227 communal groups, which met the criteria for classification as a minority at risk for the years 1945–90; Phase II covered 275 groups from 1990–96; Phase III covered 275 groups from 1996–9; Phase IV covered 283 groups from 1998–2003; and phase V covered 283 groups from 2003–06.  Also available is the Minorities at Risk Organizational Behavior (MAROB) which began in 2005 with the purpose of answering fundamental questions focusing on the identification of those factors that motivate some members of ethnic minorities to become radicalized, to form activist organizations, and to move from conventional means of politics and protest into violence and terrorism.

== How it is coded ==

The data is coded by-hand by undergraduate and graduate students under the direct supervision of directors. The information is culled from a variety of sources; journalistic accounts, government reports, group orgs, scholarly material.  Coders rely upon multiple sources for each code assigned as often as possible.  Variables are broken down into four categories: Group Characteristics, Group Status, External Support, and Group Conflict Behavior.  For all of the phases, there are a varying number of variables for which have been coded.  Phase V includes 71 core variables and 282 groups. There are codebooks for every phase of recorded data. The variables range from descriptive traits referring to their population and location in the world, to their active protests and rebellions, to the discriminatory practices that affect them. The data allows viewers to see trends by years, country, or conflict.

Such an analysis can be done over many years and at both the group and country level.  For example, here are the calculated means for three variables, including rebellion, protest, and political discrimination, for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Hawaiians within the United States.  The means for the years 1985–1993 can then be compared to the country's average as well as the overall average for all groups included in the database.

:[[African American]]s: 1.0 (political discrimination), 3.33 (protest), 0 (rebellion)
:[[Hispanic]]s: 1.0 (political discrimination), 3.00 (protest), 1.11 (rebellion)
:[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]: 1.00 (political discrimination), 2.56 (protest), 0 (rebellion)
:[[Native Hawaiians]]: 0 (political discrimination), 2.33 (protest), 0 (rebellion)
:United States aggregate level: 0.75 (political discrimination), 2.81 (protest), 0.28 (rebellion)
:Overall average for the database: 1.86 (political discrimination), 1.37 (protest), 0.92 (rebellion)

The codebooks allow for an understanding of what each number means (e.g., a 1 for political discrimination represents neglect/remedial policies and a 3 for protest represents small demonstrations numbering less than 10,000 actors).

The '''Mumuyes''' are a people of [[Nigeria]]. They speak the [[Mumuye language]]. They constitute the largest tribal group in [[Taraba State]] of [[Nigeria]] and form the predominant tribes found in [[Zing, Nigeria|Zing]], [[Yorro]], [[Jalingo]], [[Ardo-Kola]], [[Lau, Nigeria|Lau]], [[Gassol]], [[Bali]] and [[Gashaka]], all of which are local government areas of the state. Mumuyes are also widely found in many parts of the neighboring [[Adamawa State]].

==The Chiefdom of Kwajji==

===Introduction===

The chiefdom of Kwajji is a traditional administrative area created in the year 2005 by law of the Taraba state house of assembly along with a number of others in the state.

It forms with its counterpart the Mumuye chiefdom, a political territorial administrative area called Yorro local government council.

As a third class chiefdom, Kwajji is relatively little known both within the state and outside in greater Nigeria.

Kwajji in the chiefdom sense is a name connoting the amalgamation of several cultural, traditional and administrative areas into one entity. This comprises three distinctive clans of the Mumuye ethnic group namely Kwajji, Manang and Mika. The areas occupied by people of these three clans form the territorial entity of the chiefdom of Kwajji.  In this light, it may be noted that the chiefdom derives its name from that of one of its component clans.

The chiefdom comprises three districts which in turn go by the clan names Kwajji, Manang, and mika that occupy the distinctive areas.  By this development therefore, the name Kwajji may refer to either the district or its mother chiefdom. The persistence of this name Kwajji has its strength from the political evolution of the area that dates back the British colonial times. When they established at the beginning of the 20th century, all forms of administrative contact with this area in reference was centered in Kwajji village. It was from here that governance radiated to the two other clan areas of Manang and Mika.

===The name===

By way of historical analysis, several factors probably came into play for the adaptation and establishment of the name Kwajji.

The settlements of Kwajji clan people lay on the ancient Muri to Adamawa road cited by Ajayi Crowther in the 19th century. This made them an obvious point of contact with travelers of various nature, who came this way since those days.

Kwajji clan people were relatively the more docile and forthcoming in the area in government perception. This attracted the administration to use the village as a contact point being located on the plains near the Mumuye hills which by then was defined as a “closed territory”.

On being used as an administrative point it was natural that all areas around Kwajji as one were given its name to identify the whole area administratively. This is not new since the British used such policy elsewhere. For instance “Lagos protectorate”, defined almost all of the old Oyo Empire, as Prof. Elaigwu et al. cited. Adamawa Province also at the early time was known as Yola Province etc.

Being also ethnologically half-Zing and half-Pugong in origin and language affiliation, Kwajji as identified by the British anthropologist CK Meek, at the time served as a convenient balance in administrative circles.

This status quo was not upset even when in later colonial days the area came under various administrative spheres like Muri Fulani (“indirect rule”), Zing district, Mumuye district, Kwajji district etc.; over historical periods.

With the formation of Kwajji district in 1937, and  its headquarter sited at Kwajji village, the name became an indelible political dispensation as a reference to the area of this present day chiefdom.

Other later developments also were instrumental in engraving the name Kwajji to the whole the area. Such as:-

The location of schools of various nature in this place thereby making it a center of learning for generations of people of other areas.

A short-lived government Elementary school was brought along to Kwajji village with the creation of the district in late 1930s.

Then as well the Sudan United Mission (S.U.M) Christians arrived in the 1940s and 50s raising a church outpost there preaching their gospel.

The Roman Catholic Mission also came to establish a school in Kwajji in the late 1950s. This served as a center of learning to the neighboring people.

Muri local education Authority also raised a school several years later which drew pupils from all over the two other clan areas.

An area court, a police outpost and agricultural input/output center were located in the area all bearing the name Kwajji and which controlled all the areas. This made the name Kwajji more prominent record-wise, And a finality.

These historical antecedents however make no difference to the people of the chiefdom in terms of their unity and brotherliness. The identity of these people lies more on the traditional and cultural heritage they share which is more solid and dates back to times immemorial.

===Territory===

The area covered by the chiefdom of Kwajji is estimated at about 80&amp;nbsp;km square. It is approximately some 8&amp;nbsp;km from east to west, along the Zing-Jalingo road from Kan-iyaka mika to  Dideleng near Yorro junction (mararaba Yoro). Then on the north –south axis from Dandikulu to Danzang is about 12&amp;nbsp;km. Manang has the territorial area in the north, Mika in the south and Kwajji in the west of the chiefdom.

The chiefdom is bounded by Zing local government area /chiefdom to the east. Along the Kunini river to the south is the Mumuye chiefdom. Finally there is the Apawa to Mayo-lope area of Lau local government/chiefdom to the north.

The chiefdom headquarter is now located at Pupule town (pop.4, 000) which is about 30&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Jalingo, along Zing road. The palace of the chief of Kwajji is sited there. Pupule was over time purposely selected away from the village of Kwajji because of its relatively central location nearer to mika and Manang areas and the district headquarter was moved there after a palace was hand built by local masons in 1954. The name Pupule “ bu pule ” meaning “hill of the jar of water weed”(comelina weed)  which was abundant in that area of Kwajji cultivated by the Bolong, Laweki, and Dossa families. The name “Bu-pule” was corrupted in pronunciation by the British, Hausa/Fulani administration to “Pupule”. Even today the area of the palace location is known to Kwajji people as “Dan ja bu”.

When the palace was moved to Pupule there was already a small settlement around a local market organized by one Dossa clan elder named “Tukuru”. The old trunk “A” road passed through Kwajji by the Chief’s Palace and through the market in Pupule to Zing and onwards. Other secondary roads link Pupule to other areas of the chiefdom like Manang, mika and Danzang. On the Manang road, the road passes through Boli, Lakware, Jika, Mabang and ends up at Dandikulu the farthest town on that side of the chiefdom.

On the Mika side the road rings round from Zogimba market at Mararaba, through Tsohon gari, Layang koro, Danzang and back to Pupule. All these roads are motor able throughout the year.

The main population centers of the Chiefdom are Pupule, Lakware, Jika, Mabang, Sabongida-mika, Tsohongari Mika, and Old-Kwajji. All these have local weekly local markets of significance in the local government area.

The three areas of Manang, mika, and Kwajji respectively form the three councilor wards out of the eleven in Yoro local government area of Taraba state. The area of the chiefdom is located within confines of longitudes 11°33’ to 18°40’ E and latitudes 8° 55’ to 9° 15’ N. Pupule town on an elevation of about 1,240m above sea level, with a bearing of 11°36’E and 09°02’N.

===Population===

The statistical digest of the ministry of Economic Development, Yola (1978), gave the population of then Kwajji District the precursor of Kwajji chiefdom as 25,559. This was based on calculations with reference to the 1963 census. The same authority projected the population of the area by 1980 to a figure of 38,891 people.

The 1991 census is a controversial matter in the old district/chiefdom and indeed the entire LGA. This is because the LGA officially lodged a petition against the figures to the National Population Commission to the effect that many areas in the LGA, including then Kwajji District were not fully registered and counted. Therefore, the 1963 census remains the only reliable to used for projections. In this light the population of the chiefdom by 2013 stands probably at 83,516.

Kwajji chiefdom is Mumuye ethnically, traditionally, and culturally. This 3rd class chiefdom along with the 3rd Class chiefdom of Mumuye and the 1st Class Chiefdom of Zing form the three main entities that cover the Mumuye land proper. Overwhelmingly, the population of Kwajji chiefdom is made of ethnic Mumuye people. Kwajji generally is on a balancing position in Mumuye land. In geographical terms, it is midway between Zing in the East and Pugong in the west. Their language is a mixture of Zing, Yakoko, Pugong or so, in dialectical similarity. They tend to understand all the two extremes of Mumuye language even when the others don’t. In material culture they have adopted a balance of the variations found across the land, e.g. in wrestling, hunting festival Mantau, man hood ritual festival of Javah etc.

Not withstanding, there are like in other parts of Nigeria, traces of other ethnicities that dell amongst the people in the chiefdom. This community of settlers mostly around Pupule includes Hausa/Fulani, Jenjo, Chamba, Jukun, Bachama, Kilba, Ibo etc. each of them several families at a given time.

It should be noted that the three main clans of Kwajji, Manang and mika also have other Mumuye clansmen dwelling amongst them such as Zing, Yakoko, Pugong, Sagbe, Gomla, with households here and there. Most of these non-indigene ethnicities were attracted to the chiefdom especially around Pupule which came to be a widely known produce market in the north-east region of Nigeria. The brand of yam derived from this market is among the most cherished all over.

The people in this chiefdom are mostly small scale peasant farmers that produce such crops as yam, maize, g/corn, millet, g/nuts, rice, beans, and other cereals typical of this region.

Kwajji chiefdom is populated with people that are generally quite amiable and friendly. Their manners contributed to the attractiveness of the area and its settlements to earlier governments, since colonial times which gave rise to the area being among the first to be “opened” in Mumuye land. For its openness to visitors, this chiefdom was at the earliest of times connected to the main trunk ‘A’ road that linked the south to the north-east region of the country.

===Early history===

The Mumuye people of the Kwajji chiefdom, like their brethren elsewhere in zing, Yoro, and further wide; claim that the place where their ancestors originate is Yoro. This place Yoro is located high in the mountains of south eastern part of present-day Yoro local government area of Taraba state. There are some theories that they might have originated from further away out of places like “Kam Hills  “Cross river region”, etc. However, the most historically recent and undisputed place of origin for all Mumuye is Yoro.

Written records starting from the beginning of the twentieth century establish this later fact, from elders’ narrative and oral tradition. This coincides also more or less with scientific research on people of this region which confirms that they indeed are among the dwellers of these lands and region since ancient times.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth century when intertribal and jihadist warfare was rife, written records of the time and analysts show that like others of the Mumuye group all over they were never conquered or subject to anyone. They lived in their hill country, cultivating crops and foraging the jungles for game animals. Being warriors by nature, the clans frequently clashed among themselves. The Mumuye nonetheless came together collectively to fend off attacks from neighboring tribes. Oral history says that at different times there were clashes with Chamba/Dakka, Bachama, Fulani, etc. who later became friendly and partners in trade as well as marriage.

In terms of social organization Mumuye people were ruled by clan elders or extended family heads that also doubled in functions as the custodians of the traditional religion of “Vah”. When C K Meek a British Government Anthropologists toured the Mumuye land in the late 1920s he picked the Mika people extensively as a case study to represent Mumuye social organization and community life of that period. The clan heads in this chiefdom like all others in Mumuye land owed allegiance to the High Priest of Vah at old Yoro. They would from time to time visit to pay homage and consult.

This was the state the British found the people of Kwajji chiefdom when they arrived these lands to completely  colonize Nigeria at the beginning of the twentieth century. The very first contact with British administration came when that much flaunted expeditionary force led by Dr Cargill and Capt Ruxton passed through here from Yola to demand the submission of the Emir of Muri (Hassan) at Jalingo in October 1901.

===Under the British===

The end of the year 1901 brought the two Fulani Emirates of Adamawa and Muri on the north east and west, of Mumuye land respectively, firmly under British colonial hands. No attempt at the moment to interfere with the Mumuye people here was made by the new power and so they simply labeled them as “closed territory”. Captain Ruxton Resident in charge of Muri wrote that

“…it may be thought that a solution of the question of including the tribes within the Emirate after they had been well ‘reduced’ by military force, … whether such a policy would be right or not, … am sure the Emir Muri has neither the means nor organization to keep tribes in order and to compel them to pay their land taxes.”

This would remain the case for over a decade to come until the year 1914 when Nigeria where we are today came into the political identity we now know it.

Readjustments that led to the birth of Nigeria reached as far as the Mumuye land. Zing District was created as the first arm of government extending into the area. The main settlements of Kwajji being in close proximity to Zing were co-opted to the Chief of Zing for the purpose tax collection. This gave rise to the appointment of people of the Punya –Zing clan of Kwajji to serve as Village Heads. Punya-Zing of Kwajji were distant cousins of the ruling Kpana/Kodele clan in Zing.

By this extension of the administration of the chief of Zing[placed under Numan Division in Yola Province]he mandated the kpantis of Kwajji to collect taxes from Manang, Mika, Kwajji as well as in Pugong areas like  Lacheke and Dila across the river. By 1926 all the Mumuye people were united and placed under Muri Division. However Zing District was raised to the status of a subdivision directly ruled by British officers, while Kwajji and Pugong areas were merged into one District – Mumuye District with headquarters at Pantisawa, under the indirect rule of the Muri Emirate.

The district on the insistence of the British was headed by the Rainmaker the Chief Priest of Mumuye tradition at Yorro.   There was said to be a lack of enthusiasm to this position on the side of the Rainmaker and administration of the District faced difficulties.

In 1937, Kwajji District was carved out of the Mumuye District and its headquarters was established in Kwajji Village. The first person to head the district was Kpanti Yawai Sholoba a man from the Punya-Zing clan. He held court at Kwajji with assistance of the other two ward heads of Manang and Mika which comprised the area of the district. Kpanti Sholoba was deposed by the British in 1945. For five years no replacement was found from among the line of lineage of his clansmen. In their place the Emir of Muri sent down several caretakers [Wakilis] to man the district. In 1950 Kpanti Bello Toga from the household of Punya-Zing was appointed to take over the district. He oversaw the transfer of the palace and district office to its present location in Pupule.

===Under Independent Nigeria===

When the British departed, leaving the country independent in 1960, not much had changed in the social order of the area now known as the chiefdom of Kwajji. Within the decade of the 1960s however, Pupule was transformed slowly from a hamlet to a market town visited by many travelers. A mission [RCM] school was opened in 1958 in Kwajji and later transferred to Pupule in 1969. An Area court was established, with a Native Police [Dandoka] outpost. Later a health dispensary was built and an agricultural input and extension services office was also located there. There came a Works department road maintenance camp, cattle route rest house as well placed on the outskirts of town. The District was one of the favorites and the most peaceful in Muri Division and Emir Umaru Abba Tukur frequented it during the Civil war years.

District administration continued as it were under the British indirect rule. However now there was a semblance of democracy being that councilors were appointed to represent the interest of the various districts, peoples and clans such that there was one representative each for Manang, mika and Kwajji in the native Authority in Jalingo.

When General Murtala Mohammed seized government in Nigeria in 1975, the great purge of the public service he embarked upon was felt everywhere including Kwajji district. The district Head Bello Toga was removed from office under reasons beyond his people’s comprehension; shrouded by the mystery and secrecy that usually surrounds the pervasive power of government.

After a period of search for the successor of chief Toga, in 1976 Buba Nyala an area court judge of Mika extraction was appointed and filled the seat of the District Head. He too served under the tutelage of the Emir of Muri.

The creation of Gongola state out North Eastern State in 1976, Kwajji district fell under the new Jalingo local government area along with Pantisawa, Sunkani, Kona etc.

When the second republic was ushered in 1979, Abubakar Barde a popular Mumuye man, became the state's first elected Governor. The area of this chiefdom was represented politically in the Gongola state house of assembly by one member [Pupule constituency]. In the four year life of the House, the elected member Umaru Garba from Pupule served as the House committee chairman of finance and Appropriations.

In further development of infrastructure in the area within that period, a tarred trunk ‘A’ road which passed on the outskirts of Pupule replaced the former laterite one that bisected the town. Bore holes were sunk for the first time to serve the town all in the period of the first Republic.

In 1982, a new local government area and council was created to cover the area of Kwajji and Mumuye districts. This however was short lived as it was disbanded with other newly created ones in Gongola state when Gen. Muhammad Buhari and his government overthrew the second republic in 1984.

The status quo was reversed with Kwajji district falling back under Jalingo LGA.

The Buhari government gave way to General Ibrahim Babangida's regime in August 1987 with little or no change in the area.

Change came when Taraba state was created in August 1991. With this, a new Yorro LGA was created by incorporating Lau district to Kwajji and Mumuye with the headquarters at Lau. Not long after however there was a sigh of relieve when Lau was given its own LGA and the old Yorro LGA with its 1982 boundaries was re-established. Before the former LGA of Yoro was disbanded, a prominent politician Ayuba Alkali from Manang in the chiefdom became the first elected chairman in Lau.

Kwajji district was still represented by a member in the new Taraba state house of assembly in Jalingo. There still remained the three council wards of Manang, Mika, and Kwajji to represent the district in the present Yoro LGC.

When General Sani Abacha seized power from the ill-fated third republic, he embarked on reforms in the political system nationwide among which deprived the Kwajji area of its representation in Taraba state house of assembly. It also knocked out many polling units in the area which have never been rectified up to date.

The creation of Taraba state brought government so to say nearer to the people. Subsequently, Kwajji and other traditional institutions experienced rapid development. The election as Governor of an illustrious Mumuye man Rev. Jolly T. Nyame on various term periods brought untold progress to the Mumuye people’s quest for emancipation. In his first tenure the palaces were given befitting face lift. District Heads were for the first time allocated motor vehicles. He capped this with a masterstroke when he at last in the year 2005 gave the Mumuye full autonomy culturally and traditionally. In his administration’s reorganization of the state’s traditional institutions, he upgraded 3 Mumuye areas to various ranked graded chieftaincy positions. Kwajji district was upgraded to third class chiefdom with headquarters at Pupule.

The palace was again given a befitting outlook and people celebrated. The promoted chief Alhaji Buba Nyala was handed the staff of office at last in the year 2008 after a protracted personal difficulty with the state Government.

In their memorandum submitted to the Danladi Baido committee that considered the reorganization of the traditional institutions, the Kwajji people pleaded that they be granted their own chiefdom to enable the people obtain their autonomy and promote the affairs of their tradition and culture as guaranteed by Nigeria’s constitution.

Since the formal presentation of staff of office to His Royal Highness, the chiefdom operates on skeletal mode. Fiscal constraints probably have influenced the lack of full implementation of the appendages of the districts, under Kwajji chiefdom, as well as the statutes to guide its traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9039">The '''New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study''' ('''NZAVS''') is a [[longitudinal study]] conducted in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Psych"&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study |url= http://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/our-research/research-groups/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study |publisher=University of Auckland |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NZAVS was started in 2009 by [[Chris Sibley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/chris-sibley/ |title=Dr Chris G Sibley |publisher= University of Auckland |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor in psychology at the [[University of Auckland]]. The NZAVS was inspired by major social surveys conducted internationally, such as the [[National Election Studies]], the [[World Values Survey]] and the [[General Social Survey]], and aims to provide a similar resource for New Zealand. As of November 8, 2016, the NZAVS research team had published 100 [[peer review]]ed publications using data from the study.

==Sample details==

===Questionnaires===
The NZAVS uses a [[self-report inventory]] to collect information. The questionnaire is administered via both postal mail and an [[online survey]]. The NZAVS includes a large range of scales including those measuring [[self-esteem]], national and personal [[wellbeing]], [[satisfaction with life]], [[religious beliefs]], [[personality]], [[psychological distress]], [[ideologies]], [[political]] and [[environmental movement|environmental]] attitudes.

===Data structure===
The NZAVS has a [[nested data]] structure.&lt;ref name="Psych"/&gt; Participants are modeled as the Level 1 or lower-level unit. The NZAVS contains geographic information from [[mesh blocks]] for each participant. Mesh blocks contain information about each participants local neighborhood based on census data from each meshblock. This information is modeled as the Level 2, or higher-level unit in many of the NZAVS research papers. Mesh blocks are small geographic area units, each containing roughly 100 people, with defined boundaries. Each mesh block is in turn nested within larger census area units (CAU; roughly 1000 people in size). [[Statistics New Zealand]] provide detailed demographic information about the population  of each mesh block based on census data, such as median income, ethnic proportions and size, religious affiliation, etc. This information is integrated into the NZAVS datasets. Of particular note are the New Zealand Deprivation Index (an index of poverty or socio-economic status based on a principal components analysis of indicators of deprivation for each area unit);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/nzdep2006-index-deprivation |title=NZDep2006 Index of Deprivation &amp;#124; Ministry of Health NZ |publisher=Health.govt.nz |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073623/http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/nzdep2006-index-deprivation |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a CAU-based [[Gini coefficient]] derived by [[Chris Sibley]] for use in the NZAVS, which provides an indicator of the income disparity within each region of New Zealand.

===Data analysis===
The NZAVS is a [[quantitative study]], and data analysis for the NZAVS is conducted primarily in Mplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statmodel.com/ |title=Muthén &amp; Muthén - Home Page |publisher=Statmodel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scripts outlining the statistical models developed using data from the NZAVS are provided online at the official NZAVS website.&lt;ref name="Psych"/&gt; These scripts are provided to help promote research collaboration and transparency in data analysis. The study employs many different types of statistical analyses, including [[Latent Growth Modeling]], [[Bayesian Linear Regression]], [[Structural Equation Modeling]], and analyses employing [[Mixture model]] and [[Multilevel model]] designs.

==Key findings==
The NZAVS has been central in answering a variety of important research questions. This section lists research findings from the NZAVS that have received academic and media attention.

===Religion and the Christchurch earthquakes===
NZAVS researchers [[Joseph Bulbulia]] and [[Chris Sibley]] published a study in [[PLoS ONE]] looking at how the [[Christchurch earthquakes]] may be linked to change in [[religious affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, C. G., &amp; Bulbulia, J. (2012). Faith after an earthquake: a longitudinal study of religion and perceived health before and after the 2011 Christchurch New Zealand earthquake. PLoS ONE, 7, e49648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality in New Zealand===
Data from the NZAVS has also been used to help validate and extend a public domain [[personality test]] assessing the Big-Six dimensions of personality in New Zealand. This personality scale is known as the Mini-IPIP6, and is based on the [[International Personality Item Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipip.ori.org/ |title=International Personality Item Pool |publisher=Ipip.ori.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mini-IPIP6 is a 24-item self-report personality measure, which extends the original Big-Five Mini-IPIP scale&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, M.B., Frederick, L., Oswald, B.M.B, &amp; Lucas, R.E. (2006). The Mini-IPIP scales: Tiny-yet-effective measures of the Big Five factors of personality. Psychological Assessment, 18, 192-203.&lt;/ref&gt; to also include a sixth dimension of personality based on the [[HEXACO]] model of personality structure. The Mini-IPIP provides marker items for the following six dimensions of personality: [[Extraversion]], [[Agreeableness]], [[Conscientiousness]], [[Neuroticism]], [[Openness to Experience]], and [[Honesty-humility]]. The Mini-IPIP6 has been validated for use in New Zealand in a series of peer-reviewed publications,&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, C. G. (2012). The Mini-IPIP6: Item Response Theory analysis of a short measure of the big-six factors of personality in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 41, 21-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, C. G., Luyten, N., Purnomo, M., Moberly, A., Wootton, L. W., Hammond, M. D., Sengupta, N., Perry, R., West-Newman, T., Wilson, M. S., McLellan, L., Hoverd, W. J., &amp; Robertson, A. (2011). The Mini-IPIP6: Validation and extension of a short measure of the Big-Six factors of personality in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 40, 142-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, C. G., &amp; Pirie, D. J. (in press). Personality in New Zealand: Scale norms and demographic differences in the Mini-IPIP6. New Zealand Journal of Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; and is in the [[public domain]].

===The Multi-dimensional Model of Māori and Cultural Engagement===
NZAVS researchers, Carla Houkamau and Chris Sibley, have also used data from the NZAVS to help design programmes that benefit [[Māori people]] particularly in relation to health and education. They studied Māori identity and the factors that make Māori feel positive about themselves and [[Māori culture]]. This identity scale is known as the [[Multi-dimensional Model of Maori Identity and Cultural Engagement]] (MMM-ICE) and consists of six dimensions;(1) Group Membership Evaluation, (2) Socio- Political Consciousness, (3) Cultural Efficacy and Active Identity Engagement, (4) Spirituality, (5) Interdependent Self-Concept, and (6) Authenticity Beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Houkamau, C. A., &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2010). The Multi-Dimensional Model of Māori Identity and Cultural Engagement. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 39, 8–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale===
Sam Manuela, a doctoral candidate from the University of Auckland, used the NZAVS data to develop a culturally sensitive [[self-report inventory]] to assess [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[subjective well-being]] among Pacific populations in New Zealand. The measure, known as [[The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale]], assesses five distinct, yet interconnected dimensions of Pacific identity and wellbeing; (1) Group Membership Evaluation, (2) Pacific Connectedness and Belonging, (3) Religious Centrality and Embeddedness, (4) Perceived Familial Wellbeing, (5) Perceived Societal Wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2012). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS): A Culturally-Appropriate Self Report Measure for Pacific Peoples in New Zealand. Social Indicators Research, 1, 83-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pahang Malays''' ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]: ''Melayu Pahang'', [[Pahang Malay]]: ''Oghang Pahang'', [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: أورڠ ڤهڠ) are a sub-group of [[Malaysian Malay|Malay people]] native to the state of [[Pahang]], in the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. With population of approximately 1.08&amp;nbsp;million people, they constitutes 70% of Pahang state's population, making them the dominant ethnic group in the state.&lt;ref name="population"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epu.gov.my/epu-theme/pdf/1.2.5.pdf |title=Penduduk mengikut jantina, kumpulan etnik dan umur, Malaysia, 2010 |publisher=Economic Planning Unit |page=|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their language, [[Pahang Malay]] is one of many [[Malayan languages]] spoken in the region that belong to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their history goes back more than one millennium, the community came to prominence when the old [[Pahang Sultanate]] was established in 1470. The sultanate was merged with Johor in 1623, but later revived in 1881 and incorporated as protectorate of the [[British Empire]]. In 1948, it formed [[Federation of Malaya]] together with other [[Malay states|Malay Sultanates]] in the peninsular, that later reconstituted as [[Malaysia]].

The Pahang Malays, along with [[Terengganuan Malay people|Terengganuan Malays]] and [[Kelantanese Malay people|Kelantanese Malays]] (and sometimes [[Thai Malays]] and the Malays of [[Anambas islands]] and [[Natuna islands]] in [[Indonesia]]) are collectively referred to as the ''Orang Pantai Timur'' (People of the East Coast) due to their closely related history, cultures and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Tembeling Valley which constitutes the upper reaches of the [[Pahang River]] is an area of great historical significance to Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin||p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; There yielded many archeological relics of [[Paleolithic]], [[Hoabinhian]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin||p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Pahang sits astride the 'Austric marchland'- the territory where the [[Austroasiatic languages|Mon-Khmer-speaking]] (Austroasiatic) cultures meet up with the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] and pre-Malayic-speaking ([[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]]) cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin||p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early settlers lived by mining gold, tin and iron and planting rice. They left many traces; irrigation works, mine workings, remains of brick buildings, and probably the pottery industry at [[Kuala Tembeling]]. Ancient settlements can be traced from Tembeling to as far south as Merchong. Their tracks can also be found in deep hinterland of Jelai, along the [[Lake Chini]], and up to the head-waters of the [[Rompin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such settlement was identified as ''Koli'' from ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), a thriving port located on the estuary of [[Kuantan River]], where foreign ships stopped to barter and resupply.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known reference to [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]] – as the kingdom of 'Pohuang' (婆皇)- was found in the ''[[Book of Song]]'' from the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2014|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This polity is believed to be the southernmost extension of the federation of city states of [[Langkasuka]]-[[Kedah Kingdom|Kadaram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that later incorporated into an even larger federation of [[Srivijaya]] from the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear when [[Islam]] began to gain its foothold in Pahang, but historian like de Erédia mentioned that Islam already introduced in Pahang before it was accepted by Melaka in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahang, described by de Erédia as Pan, was one of the two kingdoms of ''[[Ethnic Malays|Malayos]]'' in the peninsula, in succession to [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]], that flourished before Melaka. The Pahang ruler then, titled [[Maharaja]], was also the overlord of countries of 'Ujong Tanah' (land's end), the southerly part of the peninsula including ancient Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old court name was [[Inderapura]], and the capital has always been known as 'the town'. The pre-Melakans calling it by Sanskrit name Pura, the Malays '[[Pekan]]', the [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese]] 'a Cidade', while the people of Rompin and Bebar described the Capital as ''Pekan Pahang''. Pura may have covered a much larger than the town known as Pekan today. In addition to modern Pekan, it appears to have comprised the land on the banks of Pahang river as far as Tanjung Langgar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Women in Pahang.jpg|thumb|right|Pahang Malay women wearing traditional dress in a rifle training during the [[Malayan Emergency]].]]
The [[Malayisation]] of Pahang intensified from the mid 15th century after the state was annexed by [[Melaka Sultanate]]. Following a brief period of being a [[governorate]], the state was established as a [[sultanate]] in 1470 by a Melakan prince, [[Muhammad Shah of Pahang|Muhammad Shah]], and remained a vassal of Melaka until the latter's demise in 1511. In 1624, Pahang was nominally merged with [[Johor]], when its 14th Sultan, [[Abdul Jalil Shah III]] was also proclaimed as the 7th [[Sultan of Johor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buyers|2009|loc=[http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/pahang2.htm Pahang – Genealogy of Melaka dynasty]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahang remained a constituent dominion ruled by the [[Bendahara]]s, until [[Johor Empire]]'s gradual dismemberment in late 18th century. In 1805, ruler of Pahang, [[Tun Ali of Pahang|Tun Ali]] formally proclaimed independence, ending more than two centuries of union with Johor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Sultan Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah|Tun Ahmad]], who won the bitter [[Pahang Civil War|civil war]] against his elder brother [[Tun Mutahir of Pahang|Tun Mutahir]], revived the Pahang Sultanate after proclaiming himself [[Sultan of Pahang]] in 1882. Not long after that, the British imperialism manifested itself in Pahang with the appointment of a British Resident to the Sultan of Pahang in 1888.

Like other [[Malay States]], Pahang also suffered during the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] until the year 1945. Then in 1948, it joined the [[Federation of Malaya]], which gained Independence in 1957. Today, Pahang is a prosperous state with an expanding economy, fuelled by agriculture, manufacturing and tourism.

==Language==
{{main|Pahang Malay}}
Pahang Malays are known for their unique spoken language called [[Pahang Malay]], and natively referred as ''Base Pahang'' (which means "Pahang language") or ''Cakak Pahang'' (which means "Pahang speech"). This form of [[Malayan language]] is closely related to [[Terengganu Malay]] (''Base Tranung'') and [[Kelantan Malay]] (''Baso Kelate'') due to their common origin. These east coast dialects demonstrate a number a shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations and their speakers can easily communicate with each other, although there are still some phonological and vocabulary differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Pahang Malay is predominantly in the Pahang state, although there are other Malayan language spoken, for example a unique dialect of [[Tioman Island]] closely related only to [[Sarawak Malay]] spoken across the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; An east coast dialect, Terengganu Malay is in fact native in certain areas primarily in narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang. This complicated spatial layering of different Malay variants, often within a few kilometres radius between hamlets of Pahang Malay speakers along the riverine systems and the Terengganu-speaking coastal fishermen villages, is influenced by the historical movement of Terengganu Malays to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are small Pahang-speaking community in the valley of the Lebir River in Kelantan and the upper portions of several rivers near the Perak and Selangor boundaries, descendants of fugitives from the [[Pahang Civil War|civil war]] that ravaged their homeland in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|pp=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main variants of Pahang Malay, spoken along the lining of the three main rivers; [[Pahang River]], [[Jelai River]] and [[Lipis River]], which differs between one another in phonological pattern and vocabulary. These variants have been classified further into two main sub-dialects; ''Hulu Pahang'' ('Upper Pahang') consisting Lipis and Jelai rivers variants, and ''Hilir Pahang'' ('Lower Pahang') consisting Pahang River variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:CO 1069-500-037 (7892850998).jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Pahang Malay style houses seen in Kampung Baharu, [[Pahang]], circa 1930–1940.]]
The ancestors of modern Pahang Malays, were a hybrid community of multiple origins and cultures. The early settlers consist primarily from both various Mon-Khmer speaking [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] tribes and [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] speaking [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin||p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early communities, were largely animists, believing in the existence of ''semangat'' (spirits) in everything. Around the opening of the common era, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced by Indian traders to the Malay Archipelago, where they flourished with the establishment of a Hindu-Buddhist state from the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2014|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift into the dominant Malayic cultures with Siamese influence, is believed to have taken place ''[[in situ]]'', involving such political processes as the establishment of a late Srivijayan outpost in the Ithmus, the fall of Srivijaya, the extension of Thai rule into the area and lastly the arrival of Islam in the region from as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin||p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malayisation]] intensified in Pahang after it was established as a Malay-Muslim Sultanate in 1470, and continued until as late as the 19th century. The development of many Malay-dominated centres in the state, drew many of the aboriginals to embrace [[Malayness]] by converting to Islam, emulating the Malay speech and their dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their closely related history, Pahang Malays share a similar culture with other sub-groups of [[Malay people]] native to the Malay peninsula. They are in particular closely affiliated to peoples of the east coast of the peninsula like [[Thai Malays]], [[Terengganuan Malay people|Terengganuan Malays]] and [[Kelantanese Malay people|Kelantanese Malays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are still aspects of Malay culture that unique to Pahang itself.

===Traditional dress===
In the pre-Islamic Pahang, like most of the tropical world, the early traditional costumes were simple, using a single piece of cloth. This was the description by [[Fei Xin]], a [[Chinese Muslim]] and an Arabic scholar who wrote in the ''[[Xingcha Shenglan]]'' in 1436. He wrote an interesting account of Pahang and its people, extract of the text of which are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;-
{{cquote|''Men and women have their hair in a knot, and are clad with a single piece of cloth. Girls of rich families wear four or five golden circles on their foreheads, and the daughters of the common people use strings of colored glass beads instead.''}}
The "knot" mentioned above actually refers to the [[Chignon (hairstyle)|chignons]] ('sanggul' in Malay). There are various ways of tying the hair in a chignon or locks, and one of the hairstyles of the Pahang women is called distinctively as the ''Sanggul Pahang'' (Pahang chignon).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/pahang-traditional-Malay-costumes.html Pahang Traditional Malay Costumes]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the trade with foreign countries flourished, the clothing styles began extensively accepting foreign influences and became more sophisticated. The 15th century was the time when Melaka Sultanate at its apex with Islam as its official religion. The strong Islamic influence had transformed the clothing styles in accordance to Islamic values. The early forms of [[Baju Melayu]] and [[Baju Kurung]] originated from this period, which both would become the primary traditional dress of Malay people for many centuries to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/pahang-traditional-Malay-costumes.html Pahang Traditional Malay Costumes]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, a distinctive style of Baju Kurung was developed in Pahang, commonly known as Baju Kurung Pahang or Baju Riau-Pahang, or sometimes called ''Baju Turki''. This is a long gown styled dress, cut at the front with 7 or more buttons and worn with a [[sarong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/pahang-traditional-Malay-costumes.html Pahang Traditional Malay Costumes]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay handloom industry traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under [[Song dynasty]]. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in Malay peninsular was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, the silk weaving industry in Pahang had perfected a style called ''[[Tenun Pahang Diraja|Tenun Pahang]]'', a special clothing fabric used in the special traditional Malay costumes and attires of Pahang rulers and palace officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/famous-woven-silk.html Tenun Pahang Diraja]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to silk weaving, [[Batik]] weaving has been part of the small cottage industry in the state. Although not as popular, Pahang batik has, nevertheless, thrived as a small industry in the periphery of the fame and popularity of the Trengganu and Kelantan batik.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/pahang-batik.html Pahang Batik]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martial arts===
[[Silat Melayu]] practiced in Pahang are diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods and philosophy across different schools and styles. The Silat Melayu of Pahang may generally be divided into two major groups. Styles like Lincah, Gayong and Cekak which are widely practiced at national level in Malaysia, coexist with eclectic local Pahang styles like Silat Terlak, Silat Lian, Silat Tari Pulut, Silat Melayu Lok Keris 9, Silat Sendeng 2 Beradik, Silat Tongkat Panding Juan, Silat Laksamana, Silat Sutan Muaakad, Silat Pedang, Silat Setimbun Tulang, Silat Carik Kapor and Silat Sangkar Maut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/self-defence-silat.html Self Defence Techniques of the Malay Silat]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of silat also exist especially in the very remote villages, with members consisting of a few students. The current law and regulations require that the silat bodies need to be registered as an association or club. Therefore, we find that those silat forms with very few members are those which are being practiced in a secretive way in remote areas and are taught only by invitation of the master.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/self-defence-silat.html Self Defence Techniques of the Malay Silat]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of styles of Silat Melayu not only demonstrated many different combat skills, but also the ability of the martial art itself in manifesting different personages and community in warrior traditions from various districts of Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/self-defence-silat.html Self Defence Techniques of the Malay Silat]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and folklore===
The literary tradition in Pahang traced back to the time of the old [[Pahang Sultanate]]. Contribution into the rich [[Classical Malay literature]] is attested in the form of legal literature like ''[[Hukum Kanun Pahang]]'' and historical literature like ''Hikayat Pahang''. Until the early 20th century, many of the literary works were the effort of individual writers specialized in certain subjects. Among notable writers were Shihabuddin Zainal Abidin whose  works are of religious literature in [[syair]] genre and [[Ibrahim Hj Yaacob]] whose works promote nationalistic sentiments in colonial Malaya. Other prominent literary figures include [[Ishak Haji Muhammad]] (Pak Sako), [[Keris Mas]], Hj Zakaria Hitam (Pak Zek) and Hj Ibrahim Omar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sayed Ahmad Syed Abdullah|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural setting of Pahang, its history, people and culture became important themes for the literature in Pahang. The famous fictional work of Ishak Haji Muhammad, ''Putera Gunung Tahan'' (1938) took [[Mount Tahan]] as its setting, while Keris Mas's ''Rimba Harapan'' set in Kampung Ketari, [[Bentong]]. There are also poems by Sahmad Malaya describing [[Janda Baik]], [[Mount Tahan]], [[Bukit Tinggi, Pahang|Bukit Tinggi]] and [[Chini Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|pp=14–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Zakaria Hitam was a notable Pahang-born scholar known for his collection of oral tradition of Pahang folklore. Prominent [[Malay folklore]] of Pahang origin, includes such bardic tales as the legends of Putri Walinong Sari, Sang Kelembai,''[[Seri Gumum Dragon]]'' of [[Chini Lake]], and the white crocodile ''Seri Pahang'' of Pahang River.

In 1957, the community of Pahang writers established ''Dewan Persuratan Melayu Pahang'' ('Institute of Pahang Malay Letters') as a platform to promote new generation of writers and to spread Pahang literary works to the Malaysian masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sayed Ahmad Syed Abdullah|2001|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk songs===
Pahang folk songs refer to the collection of songs of unknown origin, possibly in existence among Malay communities in Pahang since the animistic era. The songs may be classified as a type of old oral literature in poetic forms, which exist in several different genres. The most notable one is a set of 36 songs in ''Indung'' dance. The singing of ''Indung'' begin with the song ''Anak Indung'', and ends with the song ''Pulang Indung'', in which both songs share the same melody but different in their lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant genre is a set of healing songs in ''Saba'' dance commonly performed to celebrate the recovery of a patient by a Bomoh (Malay shaman). As ''Saba'' is a part of the traditional curing, the lyrics have many special terms used in shamanistic charms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other genres exist, among others are songs from traditional dances of ''Mayang''', ''Limbung'' and ''Lukah'', songs from ''Dikir Rebana'', ''Berdah'', ''Main Puteri'' and ''Ugam'' performances, as well as ''Lagu dodoi'' (lullabies), ''Lagu bercerita'' (story telling songs) and ''Lagu Permainan'' (children game songs).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aripin Said|1997|pp=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Pahang folk songs included; ''Walinung Sari'', ''Burung Kenek-Kenek'', ''Pak Sang Bagok'', ''Lagu Zikir'', ''Lagu Orang Muda'', ''Pak Sendayung'', ''Anak Ayam Turun Sepuluh'', ''Cung-Cung Nai'', ''Awang Belanga'', ''Kek Nong'' or ''Dayang Kek Nong'', ''Camang Di Laut'', ''Datuk Kemenyan Tunggal'', ''Berlagu Ayam'', ''Walida Sari'', ''Raja Donan'', ''Raja Muda'', ''Syair Tua'', ''Anak Dagang'', ''Puteri Bongsu'', ''Raja Putera'', ''Puteri Mayang Mengurai'', ''Puteri Tujuh'', ''Pujuk Lebah'', ''Ketuk Kabung'' (''Buai Kangkong'') and ''Tebang Tebu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aripin Said|1997|pp=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
Of the wide of Malay performing arts, many of are localized in particular regions, while others shared with a variety of local styles. Early forms of ritual theatre amongst the Pahang Malays include the ''Main Puteri'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saba''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many forms of ''Ugam'' performances. There are ''Ugam Mayang'', ''Ugam Lukah'', ''Ugam Kukur'' and ''Ugam Serkap'', all of which involve trance and serve as agents of healing through communication between a [[bomoh]] in trance and invisible beings who are believed to be one of the principal causes of diseases. ''Ugam Mayang'' is also popularly known in Terengganu and the rest of Malaysia as ''[[Ulek Mayang]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aripin Said|1997|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular dance theatre is [[Mak Yong]], which is also performed in Kelantan and Terengganu, and based on east coast mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performances involve about a dozen artists, accompanied by an ensemble of musicians playing the ''rebab'', gongs and drums (gendang). Popular dance forms also include ''Joget Pahang''( a local style of ''[[Joget]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zapin Pekan'' and ''Zapin Raub'' (local styles of ''[[Zapin]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dikir Pahang'' or ''Dikir Rebana'' (a modified and secularised form of [[dhikr]] or religious chanting, also performed in Kelantan as [[Dikir barat]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dikir Rebana'' which is further divided into ''Dikir Maulud'' and ''Dikir Berdah'', has many songs played by a group of 5 to 7 people and was historically performed in the royal court.

Pahang performing arts also include some native dance forms like ''Limbung'', ''Labi-Labi'', ''Pelanduk'' and ''Indung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indung'' is performed with a set of 36 songs traditionally sang by women while working in the paddy field, especially during grass cuting. Each song was attached with a specific ''[[pantun]]''. It is a group singing, in unison, where the form is an alternation between a solo singer and the whole group. There were no musical instruments involved in ''Indung'' singing. Within the ''Indung'' songs, there are many lullabies. On the other hand, there are also a few songs that are sung with dance movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct form of ''[[gamelan]]'' adopted from the Javanese culture during the time of [[Johor Empire]], known as [[Malay Gamelan]] or ''Gamelan Pahang'', forms the main musical ensemble heritage in the state and patronized by royal court of Pahang since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norazit Selat|2000|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
Traditional Pahang cuisine has a lot of similar features with other [[Malay cuisine]], and features a lot of [[seafood]]. From its rivers and lakes come the fresh water fish such as the ''patin'' (silver [[catfish]]). Certain dishes are shared with other Malay groups, like ''Singgang'', ''Tembosa'', ''[[Sata (food)|Satak]]'' and ''Lempeng Nyiur'' which also commonly found in Kelantan and Terengganu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hood Salleh|2011|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some other regional dishes are prepared in Pahang style like ''[[Ikan Bakar|Ikan Bakar Petai]]'' and ''[[Laksa|Laksa Pahang]]''. There are also popular foreign dishes prepared with the distinctly Pahang style like ''[[Murtabak|Murtabak Mengkasar]]'' and ''[[Puding Diraja]]'' ('Royal Pudding'), both can be found in Pahang's royal capital, [[Pekan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khor|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other Asian cultures, the staple food in a Pahang culinary tradition is rice, which is commonly served with ''[[gulai]]'' or ''singgang'', ''[[Ulam (salad)|ulam]]'' and ''[[sambal]]'' condiments. Popular ''sambals'' are ''sambal hitam'', ''sambal tempoyak'' and ''sambal belacan''. One of the most famous ''gulai'' in Pahang that has been established as the signature dish of the state, is ''Gulai Tempoyak Patin''. This is a traditional dish consists of juicy, tender patin fish cooked in curry made of ''[[tempoyak]]'' (fermented [[durian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khor|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable Pahang ''gulai'' are ''Gulai Patin Asam Rebus'' (a dish similar to the ''Gulai Tempoyak Patin'' but the watery soup or gravy, tastes a little sour and spicy) and ''Gulai Asam Rong'' (a sour and slightly bitter taste gulai made of processed rubber tree fruits).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khor|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular Pahang dishes are ''Nasi Kebuli'', ''Opor Daging'' and ''Paceri Nenas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khor|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005|p=[http://www.pahang-delights.com/food-and-dishes-of-pahang.html Traditional Food and Dishes of Pahang ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political methodology''' is a subfield of [[Political science]] that studies the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] methods used to study politics. It combines [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[formal theory (political science)|formal theory]]. Political methodology is often used for [[positive science|positive]] research, in contrast to [[normative]] research. It is similar to [[econometrics]].

== Journals ==

Political methodology is often published in the "top 3" journals ([http://www.apsanet.org/utils/journal.cfm?Journal=APSR&amp;CFID=31778852&amp;CFTOKEN=52017342 American Political Science Review], [http://ajps.org/ American Journal of Political Science], and [http://www.journalofpolitics.org/ Journal of Politics]), in sub-field journals, and in methods-focused journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22402">The '''Prix Pictet''' (Pictet prize) is an international award in photography and sustainability. It was founded in 2008 by the Geneva-based private [[The Pictet Group|Banque Pictet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/prixpictet The Financial Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the award is to use the power of photography to communicate messages about sustainability to a global audience. Its goal is to uncover photography of the highest order, applied to current social and environmental challenges. The prize is judged by an independent jury and carries a prize of [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 100,000. There is also a Commission, in which a nominated photographer is invited to document a sustainability project.

==Process==
Entry to the Prix Pictet is by nomination.&lt;ref name="vidal_watered"&gt;John Vidal, "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/24/prix-pictet-environment The strength of the Prix Pictet is in danger of becoming watered down]", ''The Guardian'', 24 October 2012. Accessed 1 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2013, there were over 200 Prix Pictet nominators, a group of industry experts from around the world consisting of photographers, gallerists, agency heads, academics, authors, publishers, curators, photography foundation and others. Each nominated photographer is asked to provide a series of pictures coherently defined, focused on the theme of the award and limited to ten images.

The judges do not discriminate between photographs of different genres, or make assumptions about the types of audience for any class of photograph. After arriving at a shortlist of 12 portfolios, the jury make their final decision in a gallery setting. The winner of the Prix Pictet receives a cash prize of CHF 100,000, announced at an opening ceremony of the exhibition of shortlisted artists. The second element of the prize is a Commission, awarded to one of the nominated photographers, not necessarily shortlisted, at the discretion of Pictet. The Commission is related to a sustainability project supported by Pictet.

The pictures chosen by the judges travel the world for a year in a major exhibition.

The Prix Pictet was first awarded in 2008 and operates on a cycle of about 18 months. Past themes were ''Water, Earth, Growth, Power'' and ''Consumption''. From May 2014 the prize has been presented in partnership with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Dalley, "[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d3626b94-e3e8-11e2-b35b-00144feabdc0.html Prix Pictet announces fifth cycle and international museum partnership]", ''Financial Times,'' 3 July 2013.

The '''''Shidduch''''' ({{lang-he-n|שִׁדּוּךְ}}, pl. '''''shidduchim''''' {{Hebrew|שִׁדּוּכִים}}, [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Aramaic]] {{lang|tmr|שידוכין}}) is a system of [[matchmaking]] in which Jewish singles are introduced to one another&lt;ref name=NYT.11&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=The New York Times

|date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities for the purpose of marriage.

==The practice==
In Orthodox Jewish circles, dating is limited to the search for a marriage partner. Both sides (usually the singles themselves, parents, close relatives or friends of the persons involved) make inquiries about the prospective partner, e.g. on his/her character, intelligence, level of [[Torah study|learning]], financial status, family and health status, appearance and level of religious observance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=She Pairs Up the 'Chabad Misfits'

|quote=New York Times reports ... Before making a shidduch, ... degree of religious practice, family background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''shidduch'' often begins with a recommendation from family members, friends or others who see matchmaking as a [[mitzvah]], or commandment. Some engage in it as a profession and charge a fee for their services. Usually a professional matchmaker is called a ''[[shadchan]]'', but anyone who makes a ''shidduch'' is considered the ''shadchan'' for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://torasavigdor.org/rav-avigdor-miller-on-finding-a-good-shidduch
|title=Rav Avigdor Miller on Finding a Good Shidduch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match has been proposed, the prospective partners meet a number of times to gain a sense of whether they are right for one another. The number of dates prior to announcing an engagement may vary by community. In some, the dating continues several months. In stricter communities, the couple may decide a few days after originally meeting with each other. Also the age when ''shidduchim'' start may vary by community. In [[frum]] circles, especially among [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidim]], [[18 (number)#In religion and literature|eighteen is the age]] when ''shidduchim'' start and ''shadchanim'' take notice.

Those who support marriage by shidduch believe that it complies with traditional [[Judaism]]'s outlook on ''[[Tzeniut]],'' modest behaviour in relations between men and women,&lt;ref name=NYT.11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"we abstain from touching before marriage."&lt;/ref&gt; and prevents [[promiscuity]]. It may also be helpful in small Jewish communities where meeting prospective marriage partners is limited, and this gives them access to a broader spectrum of potential candidates.

If the shidduch does not work out, then usually the shadchan is contacted and it is he/she that tells the other side that it will not be going ahead. If the shidduch works out then the couple inform the shadchan of its success.

In recent years, a number of shidduchim sites have appeared on the [[Internet]].

==Bashow==
The prospective partners either date each other or in stricter communities they go to a '''"bashow"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/zivug/bashow.htm
|title=Rabbi Forsythe on Finding Your Zivug - Bashow Minhag}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sit in.&lt;ref name=WordPress1&gt;They 
don't "go out." {{cite web
|url=https://orthodoxsunflower.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/the-hasidic-way-of-dating-and-marriage-in-honor-of-valentine  |title=Orthodox Sunflower}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has been called "a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] quasi-date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=What's the etymology of the Hassidic term "b'sho'ah" for a chaperoned quasi-date 
|url=https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5189/whats-the-etymology-of-the-hassidic-term-bshooh-for-a-chaperoned-quasi-date}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical ''bashow'' scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house (or that of someone hosting)&lt;ref name=WordPress1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We had made up to meet in a friend's house&lt;/ref&gt;, to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the ''shadchen'' or from other people. The number of ''bashow''s prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many ''bashow''s while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s.

==''Bashert''==
''Bashert'' (or ''Beshert''), ({{lang-yi|באַשערט}}), is a [[Yiddish]] word that means "destiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |website=NYTimes.com  |date=November 9, 2014
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/fashion/weddings/called-by-destiny-like-generations-before-them.html
|title=Called by Destiny, Like Generations Before Them 
|quote=word ... in Yiddish, to describe the encounter: "bashert,"” or destiny.
|author=Jane Gordon Julien}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to refer to one's divinely foreordained spouse or [[soulmate]], who is called one's "''basherte''" (female) or "''basherter''" (male). It can also be used to express the seeming fate or destiny of an auspicious or important event, friendship, or happening.

In modern usage, Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their ''bashert'', meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly, and whom they will complement perfectly. Since it is considered to have been foreordained by God whom one will marry, one's spouse is considered to be one's ''bashert'' by definition, independent of whether the couple's marital life works out well or not.

==Biblical matchmaking==
The first recorded ''shidduch'' in the Torah was the match that [[Eliezer]], the servant of the Jewish patriarch [[Abraham]], made for his master's son [[Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Ch. 24). Abraham gave him specific instructions to choose a woman from Abraham's own tribe. Eliezer traveled to his master's homeland to fulfill Abraham's wishes, arriving at a well. After a short prayer to God for guidance, describing how a virtuous woman might act toward a traveling stranger at the well, [[Rebekah]] appeared on the scene and did everything described in Eliezer's prayer.  Eliezer then went with Rebekah to her family and appealed to them for permission to take Rebekah back with him to be Isaac's wife. Once this permission was granted, Rebekah joined Eliezer on the road home to Isaac. Even so, Isaac gained his own impression of her before agreeing to marry her (Rashi, commentary to Genesis 24:67).

However, when Eliezer proposes to take Rebekah back to Isaac in [[Canaan]], he is told by Rebekah's family: "Let us ask the maiden" (''i.e.,'' Rebekah). This is taken as an instruction for Jewish parents to weigh their child's opinion in the balance during an [[arranged marriage]]. Regardless of whether proper procedure is followed, this is not the end of the decision - it is believed by Jews that the final say belongs to God, who may have different plans (compare with the match of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]]).

==Talmudic references==
The [[Talmud]] (Bavli [[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 12a, first version) states that academy head [[Abba Arika|Rav]] would give [[corporal punishment]] to a man who would marry without ''shidduchin'', that is,&lt;ref&gt;Rashi Kiddushin 13a, Bedishadich (בדשדיך)&lt;/ref&gt; without prearrangement by the couple. The text gives three versions of Rav's practice; the other two versions disagree. Some authorities rule according to the first version,&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Women, Laws of ''Ishut'', 3:22 and Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 21:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], [[Shulchan Aruch]], III:26:4&lt;/ref&gt; while others rule according to the other two versions.&lt;ref&gt;Hagahot Maimoniot on Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, ad. loc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rema on Shulchan Aruch ad. loc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kiddushin 41a states that a man should not marry a woman he has not seen, lest he come to violate ''Love your neighbour as yourself''.

The [[etymology]] of the words "shidduch" and "shadchan" is uncertain. The Medieval [[Rabbi]] [[Nissim of Gerona]] (commonly called ''Ran'') traces it back to the [[Aramaic]] word for "calm" (cf. [[Targum]] to [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 5:31), and elaborates that the main purpose of the ''shidduch'' process is for young people to "''settle down''" into marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nissim of Gerona | title=Commentary to [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi's]] ''Halachot'', Shabbat 5b s.v. ''ein meshadchin''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bat-Kohen==
{{Main|Bat-Kohen}}
Although Torah law allows for a ''bat-kohen'' to marry a [[challal]], convert, or freed slave (Hebrew ''eved meshukhrar''), the Midrash and Talmud cite [[Rabbi Yochanan]]'s view that a daughter of the kohen is best off marrying a kohen. Rabbi Yochanan maintains that in the event a ''bat-kohen'' marries a non-Kohen, undesired results for the groom are likely to surface, such as poverty or the demise of the groom. An exception to this taboo is if the groom is a ''[[Talmid Chacham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yalkut Shimoni]] to Leviticus p. 738 (HaMaor edition), Talmud[[Pesachim]] p. 49a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical aspects==
Considering the prevalence of a number of [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]]s in both the [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] communities, several organisations (most notably [[Dor Yeshorim]]) routinely screen large groups of young people anonymously, only handing them a telephone number and a PIN. When a ''shidduch'' is suggested, the candidates can phone the organisation, enter both their PINs, and find out whether their union could result in critically disabled children. Although the implementation has been controversial, there has been a sharp decrease in the number of children born with [[Tay–Sachs disease]] and other genetic disorders since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, Yehoshua. "Yosef Eckstein - Trailblazer in Genetics for the Jewish World and Beyond". Personal Glimpses, supplement to Hamodia, Pesach 5766 (April 2006), page 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LDSpolygamy}}
The '''Short Creek raid''' is the name given to the [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]] and [[Arizona National Guard]] action against [[Mormon fundamentalists]] that took place on the morning of July 26, 1953, at [[Short Creek, Arizona]]. The Short Creek raid was the largest [[mass arrest]] of [[polygamy|polygamists]] in American history. At the time, it was described as "the largest mass arrest of men and women in modern American history."&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Waters, ''Mohave Miner'', 1953-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Just before dawn on July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona officers of public safety and soldiers from the [[Arizona National Guard]] entered Short Creek. The community&amp;mdash;which was composed of approximately 400 Mormon fundamentalists&amp;mdash;had been tipped off about the planned raid and were found singing [[hymn]]s in the schoolhouse while the children played outside. The entire community was taken into custody, with the exception of six individuals who were found not to be fundamentalist Mormons.&lt;ref name = Driggs1&gt;Ken Driggs, "After the Manifesto: Modern Polygamy and Fundamentalist Mormons", ''Journal of Church and State'' '''32''':367 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Among those taken into custody were 263 children. One hundred and fifty of the children who were taken into custody were not permitted to return to their parents for more than two years, and some parents never regained custody of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Driggs, "Who Shall Raise the Children? Vera Black and the Rights of Polygamous Utah Parents", ''Utah Historical Quarterly'' '''60''':27 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and media reaction==
[[Governor of Arizona|Arizona Governor]] [[John Howard Pyle]] initially called the raid "a momentous police action against insurrection"&lt;ref name = Bradley&gt;Martha Sonntag Bradley (1993). ''Kidnapped from That Land : The Government Raids on the Short Creek Polygamists'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[University of Utah Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and described the Mormon fundamentalists as participating in "the foulest conspiracy you could possibly imagine" that was designed to produce "white slaves."&lt;ref name = Driggs1/&gt; More than 100 reporters had been invited by Pyle to accompany the police to observe the raid. However, the raid and its tactics attracted mostly negative media attention; one newspaper editorialized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By what stretch of the imagination could the actions of the Short Creek children be classified as insurrection? Were those teenagers playing volleyball in a school yard inspiring a rebellion? Insurrection? Well, if so, an insurrection with diapers and volleyballs!&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arizona Republic]]'', 1953-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same week that the [[Korean War Armistice Agreement]] was signed, the raid achieved notoriety in media across the United States, including articles in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The Great Love-Nest Raid |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822887,00.html |quote= Arizona's Governor Howard Pyle declared that the colonists were in a "state of insurrection." Authorities alerted newspapers and press services weeks ahead of time. "This is a white-slave factory," an assistant attorney general announced. "No woman has escaped this community for at least ten years. They are forced to submit to men old enough to be their grandfathers." Warrants charging 122 adults with conspiracy to commit such crimes as polygamy, rape, bigamy and misappropriation of school funds were carefully drawn up. |work= [[Time magazine]] |date= 1953-08-03 |accessdate= 2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"People: The Big Raid", ''Newsweek'', 1953-08-03, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; with many media outlets describing the raid as "odious" or "un-American."&lt;ref name = VanWagoner&gt;[[Richard S. Van Wagoner]] (1989). ''Mormon Polygamy : A History'' (2d ed) (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[Signature Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator has suggested that commentary on the raid was "probably the first time in history that American polygamists had received media coverage that was largely sympathetic."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eliot Smith, The "Mormon Question Revisited : Anti-polygamy Laws and the Free Exercise Clause ([[LL.M.]] thesis, [[Harvard Law School]], 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Another has suggested that the raid's "only American parallel is the federal actions against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], "Plural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism", ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', Summer 1998, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pyle lost his bid for re-election in 1954 to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Ernest McFarland]], Pyle blamed the fallout from the raid as having destroyed his political career.&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Gripman, [http://www.childpro.org/2001-2002%20media/2001-02%20media%2001.htm "Short Creek Raid Remembered"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130203/http://www.childpro.org/2001-2002%20media/2001-02%20media%2001.htm |date=August 17, 2007 }}, ''The Miner'', 2002-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from LDS Church==
One of the few media outlets to applaud the raid was the [[Salt Lake City]]-based ''[[Deseret News]]'', which was owned by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).&lt;ref&gt;By the 1950s, the LDS Church was opposed to the traditional Mormon practice of [[plural marriage]] and excommunicated any of its members that practiced it.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''News'' applauded the action as a needed response to prevent the fundamentalists from becoming "a cancer of a sort that is beyond hope of human repair."&lt;ref&gt;''Deseret News'', 1953-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; When the paper later editorialized its support for separating children from their polygamist parents, there was a backlash against the paper and the church by a number of [[Latter-day Saint]]s, including [[Juanita Brooks]], who complained that the church organization was approving of "such a basically cruel and wicked thing as the taking of little children from their mother."&lt;ref name = VanWagoner/&gt; The Short Creek raid was the last action against polygamous Mormon fundamentalists that has been actively supported by the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [[President of the Church|president of the LDS Church]], has stated that the decision whether or not to prosecute a Mormon polygamist is "entirely in the hands of the civil officers. It's a civil offence. It's in violation of the law. We have nothing to do with it. We're totally distanced from it. And if the state chooses to move on it, that's a responsibility of civil officers." : Gordon B. Hinckley on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', [[CNN]] tevevision broadcast, 1998-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the Short Creek raid, the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist colony at Short Creek eventually rejuvenated.&lt;ref name="slate-2008"&gt;Neil J. Young, [http://www.slate.com/toolbar.aspx?action=print&amp;id=2189274 "Short Creek's Long Legacy"] {{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''Slate'', April 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Short Creek was renamed [[Colorado City, Arizona|Colorado City]] in 1960. In 1991, the Mormon fundamentalists at Colorado City formally established the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS Church). The members of the sect did not face any prosecutions for its polygamous behavior until the late 1990s, when isolated individuals began to be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/polygamy/The_Primer.pdf "The Primer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111224555/http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/polygamy/The_Primer.pdf |date=2005-01-11 }} - Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities. A joint report from the offices of the Attorneys General of Arizona and Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, FLDS Church leader [[Warren Jeffs]] was placed on the [[FBI]] [[Ten Most Wanted List]]; he was arrested in 2007 and in 2011 was convicted in Texas of two counts of child sexual abuse.

On 3 April 2008, following allegations of [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] by an unidentified caller who claimed to be a 16-year-old girl, law enforcement officers raided a FLDS compound Jeffs had founded in Texas called the [[YFZ Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.thespectrum.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080405/NEWS01/804050310 | archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021182913/http://www.thespectrum.com/needlogin?type=login&amp;redirecturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thespectrum.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F20080405%2FNEWS01%2F804050310 | dead-url= yes | archive-date= October 21, 2013 | title= 52 children taken during raid | publisher= [[The Eldorado Success]] | date= April 4, 2008 | first=  | last=  | accessdate= 2008-04-06 | df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; As of 8 April, a total of 416 children had been removed from the compound by authorities.&lt;ref name=CNN2008-04-07&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/07/texas.ranch/ |title=Texas takes legal custody of 401 sect children |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 7, 2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411050954/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/07/texas.ranch/ |archivedate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former member of the FLDS Church, [[Carolyn Jessop]], arrived on-site 6 April and stated her opinion that the action in Texas was unlike the Short Creek raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8835442 | title= People who have left sect go to Texas to help | publisher= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= April 7, 2008 | first= Brooke | last= Adams | accessdate= 2008-04-07 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408041857/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8835442 | archivedate= April 8, 2008 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have drawn direct connections between the two events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Adams | first= Brooke | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8887264 | title= Polygamous crackdown echoes 1953 Short Creek arrests | publisher= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= 11 April 2008 | accessdate= 2008-04-18 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412122404/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8887264 | archivedate= 12 April 2008 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8908639 | title= Polygamy: Where religious liberty ends | publisher= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date= 13 April 2008 | accessdate= 2008-04-18 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080414230940/http://www.sltrib.com/polygamy/ci_8908639 | archivedate= 14 April 2008 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
In February 2017, [[Public.Resource.Org]] was sued by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]], the [[National Fire Protection Association]], the [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers]], and other entities for scanning and making available [[building code]]s and [[fire code]]s which these organizations consider their copyrighted property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/press/releases/publicresourceorg-fights-back-against-copyright-lawsuit |title=Public.Resource.Org Fights Back Against Copyright Lawsuit |authorlink=EFF |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dockets.justia.com/docket/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2013cv01215/161410 Docket] at Justia&lt;/ref&gt; Chutkan ruled against Public.Resource.Org, ordering all of the standards to be deleted from the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170203/00341736620/federal-court-basically-says-okay-to-copyright-parts-our-laws.shtml|title=Federal Court Basically Says It's Okay To Copyright Parts Of Our Laws|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|date=February 3, 2017|work=Techdirt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In summer 2017 Chutkan was presiding over the [[Imran Awan]] and Hina Alvi fraud case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truepundit.com/rigged-awan-judge-appointed-by-obama-after-giving-thousands-in-campaign-cash-her-husband-appointed-a-judge-by-obama-too/|title=‘Rigged’ Awan Judge Appointed By Obama After Giving Thousands in Campaign Cash; Her Husband Appointed a Judge by Obama Too|date=13 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Garza v.

The '''Tashons people''' (Chin language; Taisun (or) Tlaisun; Burmese:တာရွှန်း) are ethnic tribes that lives in the [[Falam Township]], in the central part of [[Chin State]], [[Myanmar]]. The Tashons were the most powerful tribes in the north of [[Chin Hills]], prior to the British Empire annexation of Chin Hills. Their influence reached over the borders of [[Manipur]] in the north, Lusai Hills in the west, Phau river in the south and [[Kalaymyo|Kalay-Kabaw valley]] in the east. They practiced democracy system where the position of Chief was attained not by the virtue of birth but by vote of the people. The Tashons tribe and their villages were ruled by the Fahlam Council (or) Tashon Council, locally known as “Nam Kap”. It was also called as The Tashon Democratic Council. The Tashons people have their own language, customs and culture.

==Origins of the Tashon== 
Legend has it that the original parents of Pu Tashon came out of a solid rock locally known as Lailun, located in [[Falam Township]]. Lailun is also believed to be the mythical birthplace of the Chin ancestors. Pu Thuan Kai believed to be one of the first settlers near Lailun had a son called Pu Tashon. Today, the descendent of Pu Tashon i.e. Hlampi, Hlawnmong, Tungsawh, Tothuang Upa, Tothuang Nauta, Zahre Upa, Zahre Nauta, Conthawng, Hringngen, Thla-um, Kaltsiing, Cawilawn and Saza are known as Tashons (Taisun Hrinkhat).&lt;ref name="Taisun Thuanthu le Hla"&gt;{{cite book |title=Taisun Thuanthu le Hla (The History of Tashon) |date=1957 |publisher=Chin Rural and Education Uplift Society |location=Falam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Founding of Fahlam== 
Around AD 1500, Pu Tashon moved out from Lailun and established a village in his name i.e. Tashon village. Tribal wars were common at that time and this village was attacked several times by various tribes. When this village was attacked, the Tashons usually hid their children and elders in a secure place, approximately a mile away from the village. There, the Tashons later established a village called Fa-Hlam. According to the hearsay of the Tashons “'''Fa'''” means “'''Children'''” and “'''Hlam'''” can be interpreted as “'''Secure place'''”, thus, the name Fa-Hlam could be literally translated as the secure place where people live peacefully.&lt;ref name="Falam Centenary Megazine"&gt;{{cite book |title=Falam Centenary Megazine |date=1992 |publisher=Falam Centenary Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tashon village and Fahlam village were separate villages.

Their old village Tashon was largely abandoned and the reason for its abandonment was due to superstition. The reason for its abandonment was that a beautiful Burmese maiden, finely dressed in silks and jewels, appeared in a cave in the rocks above the Tashon village. Whoever looked on this Burmese Medusa, however, quickly perished; hence they established a new village Fahlam and migrated there. The village of Fahlam had six quarters with 600 household prior to the British annexation. When the British entered the village in 1892, the household was recorded to be at approximately 500.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette"&gt;{{cite book |last1=B. S. Carey |first1=H. N. Tuck |title=The Chin Hills: A History Of The People, Our Dealings With Them, Their Customs And Manners, And A Gazetteer Of Their Country, Volume 1 |date=1896 |publisher=Nabu Press |isbn=978-1278247083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village was divided in to six quarters i.e. Butu, Laiko, Phangpho, Hliap, Khawthar, Lu-ung and the quarter chiefs were elected by the Fahlam council. Today, the Tashon village still has three quarters namely Butu, Phangpho and Khawthar. The Tashons were known in various names, such as ‘Tashon’ by the Burman and the British, ‘Phalamte’ after their principle village by the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] and [[Tedim]], ‘Fahlam’ or ‘Tlaisun’ by their neighbours, however, they called themselves ‘Tashons (or) Taisun’.

==Rise to the Power== 
After Fahlam was established by the Tashons, they gradually brought all their neighbours under their control. The Tashons were keen traders and they came to control the entire east and west trade between the Lushai, central Chin Hills and the Kalay Valley.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; They maintained a good relationship with the Swabwa of Kalay Valley where major goods such as salt, iron, ornaments and others were imported. They established a trade route between Fahlam and Kalay Valley and built the suspension bridge over the Manipur river. It was the only known established trade route between the northern Chin and the plain at that time.

[[File:Fahlam, The Tashons Capital.jpg|thumb|The Tashons capital, Fahlam 1892 (now Taisun village)]]

Before 1890, other Chin tribes raided the Kalay-Kabaw valleys and carried whatever they could, back to the Chin Hills. Being the most influential tribe, the Tashons could exercise their authority over other tribes in Chin Hills. During those days, the Sawbwa of Kalay and the Fahlam council made a defensive and offensive alliance. The Fahlam Council gave protection to the Kalay valley i.e. whoever raided the Kalay valley were severely punished by the Fahlam council. The Fahlam council destroyed Hrimpi (a Hakha village) because it raided the Burmese village of Kungyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788121201919|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the Kalay Sawbwa gave sole trading right to the Tashons which meant the Tashons got salts, irons and other items from the plains and distribute throughout Chin Hills which earned them large profit. This had enabled the Fahlam council to hold a monopoly of the trade in Chin Hills, as they are able to undersell all other traders; and to further ensure that there should be no competition, they put every obstacle in the way of other villages going to the plains. Their controlled over trade was also the key factor to hold their power. Their political system, their skilled in diplomacy and their alliance with the Shan of the Kale valley enabled them to become the most powerful tribes in Chin Hills. The tribes became very powerful and their ancestral song runs thus: 
:'''The great Fahlam has been born;
:'''No one will ever conquer us;'''
:'''Our fame spreads beyond the land we could reach;'''
:'''And it shines like the sun.'''
Although their influence reached over vast areas in the Chin Hills, their authority did not extend to administration of the vassal tribes but it did include “protective custody” of the whole area, so that if any tribe behaved badly the Tashons could and would organise a punitive expedition, composed of the toughest men in all the other tribes under their control, to smite the offender&lt;ref name="HNC Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Henry Noel C. |title=The Economic of Central Chin Tribes |publisher=Nabu Press (September 16, 2011) |isbn=978-1245796750}}&lt;/ref&gt; [HNC Stevenson]. They held a unique position in Chinland at that time. All the tribes from Manipur to [[Hakha]] and from Burma to [[Mizo people|Lushai]] owed them nominal allegiance. They hold their position in Chin Hills, not so much through their prowess in the field as through the ingenuity and thus uphold their rule over the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788121201919|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pu Con Bik.jpg|thumb|right|The Chin Leader, The Tashons Democratic Council leader Pu Con Bik aka Bo Son Pek]]

==Administration of The Tashon Chiefs (The Fahlam Council)==
Tashons were the only tribes who practiced democracy system prior to the British annexation, whereas, other tribes in Chin Hills practice feudalism. The Tashons area were administered by a council of five chiefs, who were all chosen from the villages such as Fahlam (Taisun), Conghte, Congheng and Zamual. The known councillors from the Fahlam Council are as follows:   
*Pu Bawi Khal (circa 1650-1700 AD), 
*Pu Hlawn Kim, Pu Lian Bik &amp; Pu Sang Rul (circa 1700-1750 AD), 
*Pu Lian Nawn &amp; Pu Hniar Vum (circa 1750 – 1820 AD), 
*Pu Kip Bik (father of Pu Con Bik), Pu Kha Lian &amp; Pu Hoi Hlum (circa 1820-1856 AD). 
From 1865 until the British annexation of Chin Hills i.e. 1892, the Fahlam Council was led by Pu Con Bik known by the Burmese and British as Son Pek. The other council members were Pu Mang Hlur, Pu Cong Khar, Pu Bawi Hmung and Pu Kha Lian. Pu Kha Lian and Pu Mang Hlur served in the council led by Pu Kip Bik. They continued to serve in the council led by Pu Con Bik.&lt;ref name="Taisun Thuanthu le Hla" /&gt; The post of councillor was attained, not by virtue of birth, but by the vote of the people. Only when a common man who is particularly conspicuous as a soldier, who shows his skills in trade and diplomacy, who attain the highest social class among the Tashons society was elected to be the Councillor. If one person was chosen to be a Councillor then they promoted him through marriage so that he belonged to the council families.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;

==Unity is Strength==
For the people of Tashons, the absolute power lies with the Fahlam council. “'''Unity is strength'''” was the Fahlam motto.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; Each day, the council met in the morning at the house of one of the council members and they discussed tribal affairs including making decisions on cases brought to the court, and matters related to revenue. The Fahlam council members always adopted a democratic procedure to elaborate matters concerning administration or judicial concern before coming to a decision. In Fahlam, none of the councillors alone had the power to decide any case. The council members had to discuss everything and the people are very envious of the power and prestige. E.B. Elles writes “The chiefs have more power in their tribe than any other Chin tribes. This is because they never act separately, but together after consultation&lt;ref name="Military Report"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elly |first1=E.B. |title=Military Report On The Chin-lushai Country |publisher=Andesite Press (August 24, 2017) |isbn=978-1376148671}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

In some important matters like going to war, the Fahlam council convened a federal council meeting in which not only the chief or council members but also elders of the main village and others satellite tribes participated.&lt;ref name="Pu Hrang Tar"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nawnkhar |first1=Pu Hrangtar |title=Chin National Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the British invaded Chin Hills, the Fahlam council had managed to raise 3,000 warriors from all tribes, all corners of Chin Hills and stood against the invading enemy. The use of their system allowed not only the Chin people to be united but also to show loyalty to each other, the recognize virtue of the Chin people. Tribal wars were fought numerous times among each other, however, in time of danger, the Fahlam council managed to unite the Chin people to fight side by side against the British Empire.

==Early Relations with the British== 
The Kingdom of Myanmar fell under the British Empire in 1885, however, Chin Hills did not fall automatically under the British colonial rule. Chin Hills at that time was independent nation and the Myanmar King Thibaw authority did not reach over Chin Hills. After the Burmese capital Mandalay was occupied, the British force then moved to the Burma western borders and annexed Kalay valley in 1886. The British administration in Burma disposed the Swabwa (ruler) of Mang Yit and appointed his nephew Sawbwa Maung Pa Gyi on 1 January 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chin Hills Gazetteer I}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British administration in Burma and their western neighbour, the Chin people started to have contact in 1887. The upper Burma political officer, Captain F.D. Raikes arrived in Kalaymyo on and sent out messengers to the chiefs of Fahlam (Tashon), Sizang, Kamhau, [[Sukte people|Sukte]], Zokhua and [[Hakha]] requesting them to come to the plains. Captain Raikes met with four Sizang Chiefs, Ton Suang, Hau Suang (brother of Sizang Chief Khup Pau), Do Son and Ten Sang on 26 December 1887 at Kalaymyo monastery. He also met with Kamhau delegate Pu Lun Sat on 8 March 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chin Raids in Kabaw Valley, File No. Acc 2714|year=1889|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Yangon, Myanmar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zokhua and Haka chiefs not only refused to meet Captain Raikes but also killed two messengers sent by him.

Capt. Raikes arrived at Indin (principal village of Kalay Sawbwa) on 17 March 1887 and held a meeting with Sawbwa Maung Pagyi. During that time, the Kalay valley was in turmoil as civil war broke out between the old Sawbwa (Maung Yit) and new Sawbwa Maung Pagyi. Moreover, the Sizang Chin taking advantage of the civil war, descended from the hills and raided the valley. Prior to the British annexation of the Kalay valley, the Sawbwa in the Kalay valley and the Fahlam council had defensive and offensive alliance. Consequently, Pu Con Bik (the leader of the Fahlam Council) gave protection to the valley and when other Chin tribes raided the plains, the Tashon army then punished those responsible for the raids. Captain Raikes and Sawbwa Maung Pa Gyi discussed ways to end the civil war and how they can protect Kalay valley from Chin raids. The British arrested old Sawbwa Maung Yit and his associates and sent them to Jail in Mandalay and to stop the Chins from raiding the plains, Captain Raikes noted in his diary&lt;ref name="Captain Raikes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raikes |first1=F.D. |title=Campaign diary of Capt (later Lt-Col) Frederick Duncan Raikes (1848-1915), British Army 1868-71, Bombay Army from 1871, Burma Commission 1873-1901, Assistant and later Deputy Commissioner, Upper Burma 1886-88, relating to the pacification of Upper Burma following the Third Burmese War.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as thus: ''To attain immunity from raids without recourse to assures it will be necessary to talk with the Chiefs of the Chin tribes of the five principal tribes within raiding distance of the Kale [Kalay] country. The Tashon tribe is the most powerful and the Tashon Mingyi is looked up to by the Chiefs of the remaining tribes; the Tashon tribe has fortunately been friendly towards Kale [Kalay], all raids have been confined to the Siyin [Sizang] and Sagyilain [Sakhiling] tribes. The Sawbwa has sent out a deputation to ascertain whether the Tashon Mingyi [Pu Con Bik] will meet him in the course of a few weeks when they prepare to go through the usual formal ceremonies which are customary when contract are made with the Chin tribes''. A messenger was sent to Fahlam (The capital of Tashon tribes) and Tashon Mingyi (Fahlam Chief) Pu Con Bik sent seven men as delegation to Indin (principal village of Kalay Swabwa).&lt;ref name="Captain Raikes" /&gt;

==Anglo – Tashon Conferences==  
The Tashon delegation and Capt. Raikes met on 21 March 1887 and Capt. Raikes said “''The British had permanently annexed upper Burma, that the Swabwa of Kale had been nominated by the British government and that raiding on villages in the Kale country and Kabaw valley on the right bank of the Chindwin between Kalay and Thaungthut must ceased''”. The delegate replied that “''As soon as the Kale Sawbwa has established his headquarter and a formal contract had been entered into, the chiefs of the Tashon tribe would call upon the chief of the sagyilian [Sakhiling], Kamhau tribe to agree to stop raid and in case of them failing to come in and agreeing to the raid the Tashons tribe would be willing to help the Sawbwa and to assist him in fighting tribes which continue raids in the kale country''”.&lt;ref name="Captain Raikes" /&gt; After the meeting, Capt. Raikes show the power of rifle to the Tashons delegation and they were astonished. Capt. Raikes remarks that “''I think this has a better effect than the present I gave them yesterday''”.&lt;ref name="Captain Raikes" /&gt; Captain Raikes then arranged further meeting with the Tashons principal Chief Pu Con Bik. The meeting was arranged at Indin but Pu Con Bik refused to go, instead, he asked Captain Raikes to come to Sihaung. Captain Raikes then ride to Sihaung which is 12.75 miles from Indin. When he arrived at Sihaung, Pu Con Bik then asked him to come to a small village within the Chin territory called Kaanhla, 2 miles south west of Sihaung. Captain Raikes and Pu Con Bik met on 3 January 1888.

The main discussion was about opening a trade route to India through Chin Hills. Pu Con Bik refused to agree and even reluctant to negotiate about a trade route.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; During the first Anglo–Tashon conference, Capt. Raikes successfully showed off the power of rifle guns. This time, he prepared a cannon and fire two volleys and five rounds of independent firing. Captain Raikes showed off the might and power of the British force and tried to scare off the Chin, however, it was a bad move as Pu Con Bik started to get doubt on the intention of the British. He realized that the British would invade eventually, thus, he prepared for war from this point on ward. Coincidentally, the old Sawbwa Maung Yit and his associates broke out of Mandalay prison and seek asylum in Tashon capital, Fahlam which they were all granted asylum. The Tashons were suspicious after their interview with Captain Raikes,and the Shan sawbwa persuaded them to espouse the cause of the Shwegyophyu Prince, and to aid him in fighting against the British Government. Pu Con Bik also granted political asylum to Shwegyopyu Prince (son of Kanung Mintha) who was wanted by the British for killing two British officers at the [[Burmese resistance movement 1885–95|Chinbyit Battle]].

==Raiding British Burma== 
A combine force of Tashons, Sizang, Kamhau, Sukte and the Burmese launched an offensive against the British by raiding Indin on 4 May 1888 and occupied Sihaung and Indin. They also attacked British military police posts at Kalaymyo and Kanpale (No.1 Stockades). This was followed by incursions into the plains in which the Yazagyo and Homalin were targeted. The Sizang warriors attacked Chitpauk on 17 October and Kantha on 22 September. Sukte and Kamhau tribes also attacked the Kabaw valley destroying Khampat in their wake. A combine force of Sizang warriors and Burman led by Sawbwa Maung Yit occupied Yazagyo. The British forces then quickly reinforced and counterattack the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors then retreated back to Chin Hills. Pu Con Bik also made alliance with tribes from Hakha, Zokhua and Sakta areas whom were to act in accord with the Tashons. The combine force of Chin warriors and Burman under the leadership of Tashons were as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. Acc 2714|year=1889|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Yangon, Myanmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;- 
:*14 October 1888 – Hmanbin was attacked by 30 Burmans led by Amatgyi Maung Tha Dun. Shwegyophyu led warriors attacked Minledaung (Minlaytaung). 
:*17 October 1888 - Chitpauk, 4 miles from Yazagyo was attacked by 100 Sizang warriors. Seven men were killed and 45 carried off.
:*17 October 1888 – Taungo was attacked by 14 Sizang warriors. 
:*20 October 1888 – Kalaymyo was attacked by 400 Sizang Chins at 4a.m. They burnt 35 houses, killed 3 Burmans, wounded 4, and carried away 40 men. Four Chins were killed and five badly wounded. A party of police from Kanbale followed Chins for 3 miles, but no come up with them. 
:*23 October 1888 – The Tashon force attack the British posts around Myitha valley. 
:*24 October 1888 - British post also known as No.1 Stockade, Kanbale was attacked by 50 Burmans which was held by Kabaw valley police. Two villagers were killed and six carried away. The village which is 50 yards from the stockade, was burnt. My report states that the sepoys neither went out to assit the villagers nor fired a shot. It was full moon. 
:*22 October 1888 – Kantha was attacked by Sizang. 32 captives taken. 
:*29 October 1888 – Chin numbering 300 attacked and burnt Khampat killing 7 and carried off 27. 
:*29 October 1888 – The Tashon force attacked Kanyi and Laungshe villages. 
:*30 October 1888 – 37 Burman led by Bo La headed for Sagaing.

As the Chins and Burman forces attacked across the Kalay and Kabaw valleys, the British Army then prepared for the annexation of Chin Hills. The British administration then sent ultimatum to the Sizang chief to deliver [[Khai Kam]] together with the captives whom he carried off. Ultimatum was also sent to the Fahlam Council to deliver the Shwegyophyu prince and his followers. The British believed that the invasions of the plains were instigated by fugitives Shwegyophyu Prince, old Shan Sawbwa. When those ultimatums were ignored by the Sizang and the Fahlam council, the British force then prepared to launch expedition known as The Chin-Lushai Expedition (1888-1889). The British spent the month of November 1888 preparing for the expedition. Brigadier-General Faunce and Captain Raikes, established defensive positions along the valley. A levy of Military Police (later 2nd Battalion of Burma Rifle) guarded the Yaw valley against the depredations of the Southern Chins. Capt. Raikes and his assistant Mr. Hall collecting intelligence about the Chin, their village and the routes into the hills. Hills coolies were collected in Assam and sent for the expeditions. The forces for expedition were gathered at Kanpale (Stockade No.1) and 42 Gurkha Battalion was added for the expeditions.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;

==The Chin – Lushai Expedition (1888-1889) – Eastern Chin Hills== 
The British army strategy was to first march against the Sizang head village Khuasak, then deal with the surrounding villages. The route selected for the advance of the column was from Kanpale to the summit of Leisan range. There was no road to the hills at that time, therefore, a road had to be constructed for the main invading force and their heavy weaponry. At the beginning of December 1888, the road (mule track) construction was completed until the foot of the hill, there they established No.2 Stockade i.e. Zawlkin (now Khai Kam Town). The road construction continued towards the hills and the reach at Phatzang where a rough No.3 stockade was established.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; On hearing the news of the British advance, the combine force of Sizang, Kamhau and Sukte attacked the British force. The Sizang were in constant co-ordination with the Tashons. On the 10 December 1888, the great force of Tashon made a simultaneous attack on the villages of Sihaung, Kyawywa and Kundu. At the same time, 80 Tashons warriors clashed head to head with 42 Gurkha Light infantry led by Captain Westmoreland. On the same date, the Sizang attacked Indin and a combined force of Sukte and Kamhau attacked the military post at Kangyi (20 miles north of Kalemyo). The Chins showed their planning abilities and military capabilities in this simultaneous attack to the various British positions. The British officers were impressed by the Chin capabilities as political officers B.S Carey &amp; H.N. Tuck wrote in the Chin Hills: ”''The Chins were in great force, and we now know that Tashons and Siyins (Sizang) were fighting side by side on this occasion. The Chins swooped down from the heights on to the party, which was working on a narrow spur, and attacked them from all four sides, fighting under cover of heavy undergrowth. The collies bolted and the troops fell back after holding their ground some little time. Whilst disputing every stage of our advance into their hills, the Chins showed considerable tactical ability by taking the offensive in the plains and attacking Shan villages and our posts in the rear of advancing column''”.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;
 
Since, the Chin showed their military skills by inflicting some losses on the invading forces, the British Army took the Chin seriously. General [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir. George White]] Commander-in-Chief of Burma, personally came to supervise the expedition. He arrived in Kanpale (near Kalaymyo) on the 30 December 1888 and accompanied the expedition forces. The Chin warrior built a stockade at Leisan Mual (Red Rocky Gate) and stood firm. On the 27 January 1889, the Chin warriors attacked the road workers and the British send their troops to engage with the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors gave them strong resistance but the British fire power forced the Chin warriors to retreat. The Chin warriors then stood firm at Leisen Mual stockade which is the last line of defence. The British couldn’t take the stockade so reinforced was then ordered then the British Force charged a gain and the stockade was occupied. As the last line of defence was breached by the superior British force, the door to the Sizang valley was wide open. The British forces march to Leisang range, from there they can see the villages within Sizang valley. General George White described his experience of the battles with the Chin as “'''''The most difficult enemy to see or hit I ever fought'''''" The British forces defeated the Sizang and established Fort White post, in honour of General George White. After the British force established Fort White post, Major Raikes remained as Political Officer and Colonel Skene in command of the troops in Chin Hills. After the villages of the Sizang and Kamhau were destroyed, they were living in encampments near their respective cultivation. Although they were beaten by a far superior force and driven by their village, they showed no sign of surrender and attack the British post whenever they had opportunity.  They ambushed the British, they cut telegraph cables and stole cattle from the British whenever possible. The Sizang resisted the British from the forest for two years.

After the Chin – Lushai Expedition of 1888-1889, Major Raikes then opened up negotiations wiih the Tashons, however, Pu Bawi Hmung from Fahlam Council informed the Major Raikes that the Tashons refused to surrender the Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates, and they were not in a position to enforce the surrender of the Burman captives held by the Sizang and Kamhau. The British wanted to advance to Tashon territory however, as the monsoon season was closing, the expedition to Tashons territory had to be postponed for the year. At the end of 1888-1889, the British force suffered 67 casualties during the expedition and the state of affairs was that all the Sizang and 18 of the Kamhau villages had been destroyed, and the British troops now occupied their tract (northern Chin Hills). The Tashons continued to grant political asylum to Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates. In the East, the Chin-Lushai Expedition 1888-1889 started in December 1888 and largely ended in May 1889 after the battle of [[Siallum Fort|Siallum]].

==The Chin – Lushai Expedition (1888-1889) – Western Chin Hills== 
The British army invaded Western Chin Hills which is now part of Mizoram, in 1871-72 known as the [[Lushai Expedition]] (1871–72). Then there was relative peaceful in the western border until the murder of Lt. J.F. Stewart, 1st Battalion of Leinster Regiment by Lungtian chief Hau Sata on 03 Feb 1888. Lt. Stewart with his bodyguards were surveying for the road construction at 18 miles east of [[Rangamati]] and were to work southward towards Bilaicharai. They were ambushed at their camp in the dawn of 03 Feb 1888, by 300-armed man led by Lungtian Chief called Hau Sata. They killed Lt.Steward and 3 of his bodyguards. Lt. Stewart head was cut off and taken to Thangzang village. Soon after the incident, the British army sent a punitive force to avenge the murder. In 15 March 1889, 1000 British soldiers led by Col. Tregear known as “The Chin-Lushai Expedition 1888-89” marched toward western Chin Hills to punish Hau Sata and Thantlang Chief Za Huat. This expedition started on 28 January 1889 and ended in April 1889. They conquered part of the Western Chin Hills including Hau Sata village of Lungtian and Fort Tregear was established at Darzo.

==The Chin – Lushai Expedition (1889-1890)== 
The Sizangs and Kamhau were active in the northern Chin Hills attacking the British posts whenever they had opportunity. The Tashons still giving protection to Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates. In August 1889, Chief Commissioner of the British Crown Colony of Burma Sir Charles Crosthwaite visited the Kalay area and after discussing matters with Major Raikes issued a proclamation to the Tashons. The Chief Commissioner Major Raikes declared to the Tashons that his intention of sending a force to their chief village [Fahlam] and promised the Tashons immunity from punishment and an amnesty for past offences on condition that they assisted the troops in their march and did their best to compel the Sizang and Kamhau to surrender their captives. The Chiefs were required also to meet the officer in command of the British force at the chief village [Fahlam], to deliver up all captives in possession of the tribe, and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000. The payment annually of two elephant tusks and ten silk sheets as tribute was made a further condition. Failure to comply with these terms would involve the severest punishment Being unwilling to drive the Tashons to extremities, the Chief Commissioner waived the condition previously imposed which required the surrender of the Shwe Gyo Byu Prince and made no mention of the demand for the delivery of guns by the Sukte and Sizang.

===Strategy for the operation===
Orders for an expedition known as The Chin-Lushai Expedition (1889-1890) from Burma and Chittagong were issued from Army headquarters in Burma and India on 5 September 1889. The troops operating from Burma were divided into two columns, one called the Fort White column (or) northern column operating from Fort White as a base against the Sizang and the tribes between the base and the Manipur river. The other called the Gangaw column (or) southern column starting from Gangaw as a base and advancing via Zokhua on Haka. A force called the Chittagong column was to march from Lunglei to Haka, making the road as it advanced. After the arrival of the force at Hakha, the columns were to move northward against the Tashons and in such other directions as the General Officer in command might decide in consultation with the Political Officers. The objects of the expedition were declared to be the punishment of tribes which had committed raids in British territory and had declined to make amends, the subjugation of neutral tribes which had come within our sphere of dominion, the exploration of the country between Burma and Chittagong, and the establishment, if necessary, of semi-permanent posts in the hills to ensure complete pacification and the recognition of British power. Brigadier- General W. P. Symons was placed in command of the expedition with full control in political as well as military matters.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;

===Final negotiation=== 
Prior to the launch of this Chin-Lushai Expedition, Major Raikes and the Tashons leaders held final negotiation at Sihaung. Major Raikes asked the Tashon leaders to accept the British proclamation, pay tributes annually to the British government, or the British army will annex the Tashons territory. The Tashons leaders imply refuse to accept the proclamation. As this final negotiation was not fruitful, both sides prepare for war.

===Military Operations=== 
While the Chittagong column and southern column were marching towards Hakha, the Fort White column launched operations from September 1889 until December 1889 to subdue the Sizangs, Kamhau and Sukte, however, they could not defeat them. They burned their houses and destroyed their crops, however, the Chin continued to fight from the jungle. The British realized that the Sizangs would not be defeated by merely burning their houses and destroying their crops, therefore, they started negotiation for them to surrender. Chin Hills political officers Mr. B.S. Carey managed to open communication channel with the Sakhiling Chief Mang Lun and he did surrender to the British on 17 January. His surrender was significant to the British and through him negotiations were carried out to others Sizangs leaders. Chief Mang Lun also informed the Political Officer that the conduct of the Sizang tribe would depend entirely on the result of the Tashon expedition, and that, if the Tashons did not fight, the Sizangs were not prepared to continue the struggle alone. The British then temporarily abandoned military operations to the Sizangs, who resisted under the leadership of Pu Khai Kam. Their focus turned to the invasion of Tashon territory. The British believed that Sizangs would also surrender if Tashon submit to the British.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; Meanwhile, The 3,400 strong Chittagong Column led by Brigadier Tregear marched from Lunglei and Fort Tregear and annexed the western Chin Hills i.e. Thantlang areas. The 1,869 strong Gangaw/Burma column led by General W. Symond marched from Kan – Pakokku towards Zokhua. Eventually Zokhua, Sakta and Hakha surrendered to General Symonds. The Chittagong column and the Southern column had got in touch via light signal at Thau, 53 miles west of Hakha. The two columns then met at Hakha and preparation were made to advance to the Tashons capital Fahlam.

==Three Pronged Invasion to the Tashon capital, Fahlam== 
The southern column consists of 100 rifle soldiers from King’s Own Scottish Borderers, 164 rifle soldiers from Second and Fourth Gurkha Rifles including two mountain guns led by General Symond marched towards Fahlam on 10 March 1890. The Southern column marched from Hakha via Mangkheng to Fahlam. When the column reached to Mangkheng, the Chief of Mangkheng chief Kawl Ul tried his utmost to dissuade the Southern column from advancing towards the Tashon capital, Fahlam. Again, when the southern column approaching Fahlam, Tashons leader’s Pu Con Bik and Pu Mang Hlur warned the column not to cross the area. The southern column advanced and camped at a place called Ngalzawl. Ngalzawl is midway between current Tashon village and Zamual village. The 1,622 strong Fort White Column led by Colonel Skene marched from Fort White – Bualkhua – Lati and camped at Parte village. At 8 a.m. on the morning of the 11 March 1890 signalling communication was established between the southern column and Fort White column. In order to let the Tashons know about the arrival of the British columns, the Fort White column fired three blank rounds from the gun, whilst three large dynamite cartridges were exploded by the Southern column. In the afternoon of the 11 March 1890, the Tashons leaders including Pu Con Bik, Pu Mang Hlur, Pu Kha Lian, Pu Bawi Hmung, Pu Vum Ceu and a minor official called Shin Lay and General Symons met at Ngalzawl and Gen. Symons read out the terms which had already been sent to the Tashons by Major Raikes. To the British intense surprise, the Tashon leaders firmly and politely declined to acknowledge the supremacy of the British Government. General Symons then gave a stern warning to carefully consider their final answer, which was to be given within two days.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; Surgeon Lt.Col. A.S. Reid remarked as thus ''their decision and straightforward boldness in giving it, when their capital was at the mercy of the united columns of the British troops, whom they had permitted and assisted to march on it, was a remarkable''.&lt;ref name="A.S. Reid"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Adam Scott |title=Chin Lushai Land |publisher=Palala Press (February 22, 2018) |isbn=978-1378512289 |pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3,000 Chin Warriors== 
The Fahlam Council managed to raise 3,000 Chin warriors to counterattack the invading British forces and gathered at Fahlam. The warriors were from all corners of Chin Hills and full of armed and prepared for the battle. Among the warriors was the Tashon Chiefs dressed in the gaudy tartan of the tribe, well-armed with bright guns, vermilion and black parti-coloured sword scabbards, and beautifully inlaid powder-horns. The Hualngo were conspicuous by their chignons, which contrasted with the lofty headdress of their neighbours, the Kamhau, who were present carrying the strange "Shendu" chopper-shaped sword in basketwork scabbards. The Sizangs, Khuangli, Tawyan, Minledaung and Sukte warriors were also present. The congregation was armed with a variety of weapons such as spears and flint-lock guns, bows and quivers of barbed arrows. The Tashons built fortifications along the Manipur River to intercept the northern column. The line of fortifications commenced on the river bank, the first stockade commanding the Lumbang stream. All fords in the river were commanded by sangars built with boulders and rocks, some of which exceeded 100 yards in length. From the river to Fahlam village the road passed through innumerable stockades, rifle-pits, and saagars which had been constructed with enormous labour. The Chin calculated that it was better to face the invaders halfway at Falam to deny further advance to the inner hills. Some must have taken the opportunity to be there to satisfy their curiosity about Fahlam, the centre of power at that time. The Fahlam could have asked help from all nooks and corners. It must have been an honour for some to have come to the side of Tashons in time of need. For some it could have been an obligation. Whatever the reason, 3000 Chins of various tribes under the leadership of Pu Con Bik stood against the invading enemy. The gathering for war was a show of loyalty to each other, the recognized virtue of Chins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Uppper Chindwin Gazette |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly of all it was a reunion of separated brethrens in time of danger to fight side by side against a foreign enemy. 
Seeing the mass number of warriors, the British political officers remarked as thus; ''Doubtless it was the presence of this large force drawn from so many tribes and from the very borders of the Lushai country that Position of the induced the Tashon Chiefs to show a bold front, fully believing that with our small force we should be alarmed at the display of the Chin strength. The Chiefs when they informed General Symons that they would not pay tribute were quite sincere and intended to fight rather than pay, though they preferred to gain their end without fighting if possible. It must be remembered that the Tashons held a unique position in Chinland at this time. Ail the tribes from Manipur to Haka and from Burma to Lushai owed them nominal allegiance and the Tashons, realized that their prestige would be gone and the name of Falam lowered in the eyes of Chinland if they in common with the petty clans had to pay tribute and acknowledge the supremacy of the white men''.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; Wooden stockades, blocking in reverse and in all directions the path of approach to the Fahlam from the north. Every point of vantage was protected with crow’s nest and masked stockade.

==Submission of the Tashons==
General Symons pressed to the Tashons leaders to decide on whether to accept the terms imposed by the British. The Tashons knew their situation best, while keeping the 3,000 warriors at Fahlam in line ready for combat they counselled patience and applied their tested tactics of negotiations in accordance with the changing events as dictated by the British. They refused to accept the terms of the British to pay a fine of ten thousand rupees, ten elephants tusk and ten silk sheets. The Tashons leaders said plainly that they would not pay annual tribute, nor were they sure whether they would pay the fine, or any portion of it. They had not used money and they had not got the money they asked. They would not be able to get the silks as the British prevented them from trading with Kalay valley so they could not get any. A great tension developed and the shadow of fighting loomed large. To convince the Chin war party the British troops at that juncture with primitive weapons amounted to self-annihilation. They decided to disperse but to resist the invaders at advantageous ground as the enemy advanced. The Chin defended their villages as much as they could. They harassed the British troops on the way. They did not give up easily. Only when the British resorted to destroying hidden stored grains and cutting up standing corps in the cultivation fields did the Chins started to negotiate for peaceful settlement.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; To come to Fahlam to face the enemy and to have come to a consensus resolution to disperse for the time being to gain far better fighting grounds and time to defend the land reflected the true spirit of nationalism.

At 1pm on 13 March 1890, the four leaders of Tashons including Pu Bawi Hmung and Pu Vum Ceu and some 20 men, the leaders of the war party, were in discussion with General Symons, General Commanding Officer Mr. Ross and Mr. B.S. Carey (political officer with the northern column). The Tashons leaders having doubtful to the result of the battle decide to accept the terms. The leaders said “We acknowledge that you have beaten us, that you are the conquerors, but as you are strong be merciful and reduce the fines which we can not pay, and the amount of tribute which we ask to be allowed to pay once in three years, we wish to accept your terms and be friends”. Eventually the reduced terms proposed by the Tahsons was accepted by Gen Symons as “''General Symons did not wish to be too severe on a tribe which acknowledged itself defeated''”. The tribute was to be 5050 rupees annually. The Tashons did not lose their prestige nor their position in Chin Hills as the terms was to only pay annual tribute to the British government. After the Tashon had agreed to pay tributes to the British, General Symons returned to Hakha and also the Northern column returned to Fort White. The Tashon leaders agreed to send representative men with the northern column to try and get the Sizangs and Kamhau to surrender. The norther column started on its return march to Fort White on the 15th March, taking two Tashons leaders with them. The Sizang and northern Chin also surrendered to the British on April 1890. However Tashon Chief Bawi Hmung and Khualsim Chief said that they would not give up Shwegyophyu prince nor way where he was, because they had sworn the oath of friendship with him. Shwegyophyu later returned to Burma and he was arrested, tried, and hanged in 1891.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;

==Second Expedition to Fahlam (March 1891)== 
Although, the Tashons accepted to give tributes to the British government in March 1890, the British did not rule the Tashons territory directly. The Tashons kept their power, prestige and continue to collect tributes from vassal tribes as before. The Tashons indirectly continued to oppose the British force. They themselves did not confront the British directly, however, they instigated the Chin people from the north and south to rebel against the British. Rebelling against the British force grew in 1891 and the British made Tashons accountable for every incident. To punish the Tashons for insurgents, the British troops then marched to the Tashons capital Fahlam in March 1891.

On 10 March 1891, the column consisted of 3 guns No. 3 Mountain Battery under Lieutenant O'Leary, 150 rifles, 3-4th Gurkhas under Captain Carnegy, 150 rifles, 30th Garhwal Rifles under Lieutenant Evatt, 35 rifles, 4th Madras Pioneers under Captain Stevens and 300 rifles and two guns under the command of Colonel Mainwaring accompanied by Mr. Ross and Lieutenant Macnabb, Political Officers, marched from Haka to Fahlam. They arrived at Ngalzawl on the 13 March. As in 1890, the northern column also marched to Fahlam from Fort White and camped at Parte. The Tashons also gathered a large force around their capital Fahlam and both the British columns were very closely monitored by the Chin warriors.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt;

On the 14 March 1891, a durbar was held at Ngalzawl and Captain Rundall (the Political Officer with the Fort White column), Mr. Ross and the Tashons chiefs were present at the durbar. The Tashons paid 5 mithun as tributes to the British. The question of the tribal responsibility of the Tashons for the Gungal, who had committed the murders on the Fort White-Kale road, was discussed. It was decided that the Tashons would deliver up the offenders, who were reported to have fled into the Lushai country, should they at any time return to their territory, and agree to pay a fine and be responsible for their future good behaviour. For that incident, the British political officers set fine at four mithun and two guns. The British columns wanted to enter the capital Fahlam, however, the Tashons chiefs objected, consequently, the troops did not march through Fahlam and returned to their respective bases i.e. Hakha and Fort White.

==The Fall of Fahlam (13 March 1892)== 
After the expedition of March 1891, the Tashons promised the British of good behaviours, however, Throughout 1891, the Chin people continued to rebel against the British. The British had it enough and prepared to rule the Tashons directly and put Chin Hills under their firm control. For this, they prepared the final expedition to the capital. In March 1892, the British force then prepared another expedition to the capital with two columns as in 1890 and 1891 expeditions. The political officer of Chin Hills Mr. B.S. Carey writes about the needs for the British to keep under their direct rule as thus: “''Throughout Chin Hills, Tashons were regarded as powerful rivals to ourselves, it was therefore necessary to bring this tribe under our control, so that our authority in the country might be universal and paramount. The Tashons had, however, never shown any active hostility towards us, and instructions were therefore issued to the effect that, while promptly suppressing any resistance that might be met with, every effort was to be used to carry out the programme peaceably and to avoid recourse to military force. As the Tashons and their tributaries were supposed to be able to muster 10,000 fighting men, two columns were told off for the expedition''”.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; The two columns consisted of the followings: 
:*The column from Hakha under Major Hewlett, and Burma Regiment, consisted of Royal Artillery, Section No. 8, B. M. B., Lieutenant Knapp, and 65 men. 
:*King's Royal Rifles, three officers and loo rifles under Major Gunning. 
:*10 rifles, 4th Madras Pioneers. 130 rifles and 20 mounted infantry, Burma Battalion, under Captain Presgrave. 
:*360 coolies and 200 mules, Darjeeling cooly corps, Lieutenant Watson, King's Royal Rifles, in charge. 
:*Staff Officer— Lieutenant Evatt, 39th Garhwal Rifles. 
:*Medical Officer— Surgeon-Captain Newland, I.M.S.
The column from Hakha was originally to have started in February 1892, however, they could only marched on 10 March 1892. For some time before the column started marching, the British sent spies and reported that the Tashons also prepare for war. Military intelligence from the Fort White column also reported the warlike intentions of the Tashons. At this points the Tashons tried to persuade the Hakha in the south and the Sizangs and Sukte in the north to bring about a general uprising, but failed to win over those tribes. Failing in the general uprising attempt, the Tashon Chiefs met with the Lt. Macnabb from the Hakha column at Mangkheng. Lt. Macnabb pointed out to the Tashons that resisting such the British columns will be catastrophic for the Tashons. The Hakha column arrived at Ngalzawl on 13 March 1892 and the northern column also arrived at Parte on 13 March 1892.&lt;ref name="A.S. Reid" /&gt; The Tashons chiefs were told that for the first time in their history that the British intended to occupy their proud capital Fahlam. The Tashons strongly objected. The Tashons thought that the British would camp at Ngalzawl for a few days and left as they had done in the previous two expeditions. However, the British troops marched towards Fahlam but the Tashons offered no resistance and the village was peacefully occupied by the British force.

[[File:British Column Halted Previous to Final Advance on Fahlam.jpg|thumb|British Column Halted Previous to Final Advance on Fahlam]]

On 14 March reinforcement from the Gungal column also marched to Fahlam, having camped the previous night 2 miles below the village. Mr. Carey then joined Lieutenant Macnabb and the Falam Chiefs were summoned to talk over affairs. The Tashon chiefs were informed that their village had been occupied as an imposition of punishment for their breach of faith, in attempting to instigate a general uprising against the British force and the British intend to establish a permanent post at Fahlam. The Tashons were forbidden in future to levy tribute from the Kamhau, Sizangs or Sakhiling. So long as the Chiefs were obedient and loyal their rights and privileges would be maintained and their authority assured both over the Tashons and over their tributaries. The Chiefs were warned that any tributary tribes who offered resistance when visited by our officers would be removed from their control and administered direct. The Government also reserved the right of taking over the direct administration of any tributaries who were un- willing to remain subject to the Tashon Chiefs or whom they were unable to control. Then, the British occupied the village of Tashon (approximately one mile to the west of Fahlam). The following day on 14 March 1892, the British force marched in Tashons to show the might of the British force.&lt;ref name="The Chin Hills Gazette" /&gt; [[File:King's Rifle Column.jpg|thumb|King's Rifle Column prepared to march to Fahlam, March 1892.]]

==The Founding of the current city of Falam (April 1892)== 
Though, the Tashons chiefs were defeated they still objected the British force to establish a post at Fahlam. The British then tried to make their temporary post i.e. Tashon village permanent which was garrisoned by 400 Garhwal rifles under Major Browne, D.S.O., with a small detachment of Madras Sappers under Lieutenant Ainslie, R.E., Mr. Tuck in political charge. However, the Tashon village was condemned on medical grounds in April 1892. The British decided to build a new post from scratch at three miles north west of Fahlam. The Tashon village was condemned and materials were used to build their new post. The Tashons supplied thirty thousand collies for the construction of their new post which is the current city of Falam. The British decided to name their newly built post Fahlam after the Tashons capital in order to demonstrate that they have conquered the Tashons. The Tashons were forced to rename their capital “Tashons” after the name of their tribes. The British had problems to pronounce Fahlam, hence, they called and wrote it as “Falam”, omitting (h) aspirated sound. Since then, it has been called and known as Falam. Falam was the administration centre of Chin Hills during the colonial era. It was the headquarter of Chin Hills Battalion. It was the capital of Chin Hills. In 1948, Chin State joined the Union of Burma and gained independence from the British government. Since independence it was the capital of Chin State until 1965. Falam was founded on mid-1892 and it had just celebrated its 125th anniversary in February 2017.

==Tashon Village== 
The Tashons capital Fahlam became Tashon village since 1892. The village is still standing and is very popular with tourist nowadays. The Tashon village was named Chin Heritage Village in 2016 and holding heritage status in Chin State.

'''''The Morning After: Sex, Fear and Feminism on Campus''''' is a 1993 book about [[date rape]] by author and journalist [[Katie Roiphe]]. Her first book, it was reprinted with a new introduction in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Roiphe, Katie. ''The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism''. Little, Brown and Company, 1994. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the book had previously been published as an essay, "The Rape Crisis, or 'Is Dating Dangerous?'" in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.

==Reception==
[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''The Morning After'' a "Book of the Times" and said "it is courageous of Ms. Roiphe to speak out against the herd ideas that campus life typically encourages."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D8113EF935A2575AC0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Divergent Views of Rape As Violence and Sex, ''The New York Times'', September 16, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a negative review by [[Katha Pollitt]] titled 'Not Just Bad Sex' was published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Pollitt's review was in turn criticized by [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] in ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Christina Hoff. ''Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994. p. 214, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Morning After'' received a positive response from [[Camille Paglia]], who called it "an eloquent, thoughtful, finely argued book that was savaged from coast to coast by shallow, dishonest feminist book reviewers".&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Vamps and Tramps: New Essays''. Penguin Books, 1995. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of the book is that it promotes victim-blaming.&lt;ref&gt;BRISON, SUSAN.

The '''Toronto Hunt Club''' was established by [[British Army]] officers of the Toronto garrison ([[Fort York]]) in 1843. It held [[gymkhana]] equestrian events at various sites around the city. In 1895 it acquired its first permanent home in a rural area east of the city between [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Kingston Road]] and the waterfront. In 1898 the streetcar was extended eastward to the site, and soon the area became a cottage district and then [[streetcar suburb]] of Toronto. This forced the equestrian activities to move further afield. In 1907 the horses were thus moved to a site in [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]] (Steeles' Corner at Steeles Avenue and Yonge Street).&lt;ref name="filey"&gt;{{cite book

 | location = Toronto }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 the club moved to a location closer to town at [[Eglinton Avenue]] and [[Avenue Road]]. Known as the Eglinton Hunt Club, a polo arena, clubhouses and other facilities were erected. The 1930s saw the club run into financial difficulties, however. In 1939, with the outbreak of the Second World War, the large site was purchased by the federal government and turned into a secret [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] research facility, the '''No. 1 Clinical Investigation Unit'''. Noted scientists [[Frederick Banting]] and [[Wilbur R. Franks]] were employed there, and it was at the CIU that Franks invented the anti gravity [[g-suit]].   The club was also home to RCAF '''No. 1 Initial Training School''', a unit of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]].&lt;ref name="hewer"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war it became the RCAF Staff School, and remained an officer training facility of the [[Canadian Forces]] until closed in 1994. By 1998 the Government of Canada transferred the property to the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] and the [[Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School]] was built there.   The area surrounding the old Eglinton Hunt Club is now an established residential neighbourhood of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]].

The original Hunt Club site in Scarborough was turned into a nine-hole golf course in the 1930s, and it remains an exclusive private golfing club today.

'''Trail commission''' (TC) is paid by [[investment management]] companies to [[financial adviser]]s, and is generally around 0.1% to 0.9% p.a. of the value invested by a [[Customer|client]].

If an investment is made directly through a financial adviser, TC is generally kept by the adviser. However, some agencies (for example [[Commsec]]) return half of the TC to the client.

A financial adviser should act purely in the investors' best interests. However, it is possible that the financial adviser may direct the investment towards funds that are most profitable in terms of TC. Supporters of the directing of investments into funds benefiting the financial adviser claim that it encourages the adviser to maintain the value of the portfolio, thus aligning their interests with those of their clients. Detractors suggest that investors are usually unaware of the practice and that it is ineffective as an [[incentive]].

Following the [[Retail Distribution Review]] in the United Kingdom, trail commission is banned on sales of new investment products as of April 6 2014 and will required to be completely phased out by April 6 2016. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftadviser.com/2013/04/29/investments/wraps-and-platforms/fca-platform-paper-deals-fatal-blow-to-adviser-trail-23EHoFMbEkAPNe0MKSfBRP/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in [[Madagascar]]''', also known as [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] women or Malgache women, generally live longer than men, whom they outnumber. Marrying young, they are traditionally subservient to their husbands. Roughly a third have their first child before the age of 19, and those who wish to delay having children may not have access to contraceptives. Abortion is common, with an estimated 24 percent of women having had one. Although they are constitutionally equal to men, they have unequal property rights and employment opportunities in certain areas.

==Health==
Malagasy women have a higher [[life expectancy]] than men, with an average of 61.3 years compared to 57.7 for men in 2010. There are [[Sex ratio|more women than men]]; women represent 50.3 percent of the country's 2010 population of 19,669,953.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=238}}

[[Anemia]] is prevalent in Malagasy women, with 36 percent suffering from it in some form, mostly mild. The prevalence has decreased in recent years.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=15}} The prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Madagascar is lower than the average for Africa, with the national rate estimated at 1 percent. Pregnant women had low rates. However, the rates of other sexually transmitted diseases, especially [[syphilis]], are high.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=17}}

==Family life==
[[File:Madagascar woman with child.jpg|thumb|left|A Malagasy woman with her child]]
Malagasy law requires women to be 14 years of age before they are married, lower than the minimum age for males. Before the age of 18, only parental consent is required for a woman to be married, while women over the age of 18 must give their own consent. According to the [[United Nations]], of women between the ages 15 and 19, 34 percent had already been married. Polygamy is forbidden, although it still happens.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=238}} The culture is traditionally patriarchal.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=239}}

==Fertility==
Although the [[total fertility rate]] in Madagascar is experiencing a decrease, the large number of women of child-bearing age has ensured that [[population momentum]] will cause the total number of births to increase. This effect is expected to have subsided within 30 years. Approximately a third of Malagasy women under the age 19 have already had at least one child,{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=6}} and most breastfeed, with 51 percent breastfeeding exclusively for six months.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=xv}}

Although Malagasy women have increasingly begun to use [[contraceptives]], both oral and injected, those used are not enough;{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=xvi}} only 1.5 percent of women use implanted contraceptives.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=38}} The abortion rate is estimated at 1 in 10, with 24 percent of women having undergone an abortion.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=43}} Fifteen percent of married women wishing to use contraceptives have no access to family planning initiatives.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=13}} In the majority of cases a woman's husband entirely or partially decides what actions should be taken. There is a minority opinion (held by 9 percent of women and 8 percent of men) that a husband may beat his wife if she refuses sex.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=14}}

The effect of education has been seen in Madagascar's [[infant mortality]] rate. According to Maryanne Sharp and Ioana Kruse of the [[World Bank]] note that mothers who have finished their secondary education experience fewer than forty to fifty percent of the infant deaths experienced by women with less education. Younger women are also less likely to have babies who die while young.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=9}} The average [[perinatal mortality]] rate has decreased since 2003.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=12}}

The [[maternal death]] figure for Madagascar is lower than average in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], at a total of 498 deaths per 100,000 live births. This death rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|pp=12-13}} Although 86 percent receive pre-natal checkups, 49 percent of them are not told if there are [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]].{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|p=14}} Approximately 46 percent of new mothers receive fewer than four [[Antenatal care#Post-Natal Care|post-natal care]] sessions. Most women give birth outside of [[health centre]]s, and the number of those who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor.{{sfn|Sharp|Kruse|2011|pp=12-13}}

==Economy==
[[File:Winnowing peanuts - Madagascar.jpg|thumb|A Malagasy woman preparing peanuts]]
Rich and middle-class Malagasy women spend much time cooking, and may work in [[cassava]], rice, and maize production. Poorer women often work in rice production together with male family members, although they most commonly work with dry-field crops. Outside of the harvesting season, they may produce and sell other items to earn income for their families.{{sfn|Jarosz|1997|p=133}}

Malagasy women participate in [[sharecropping]]. Some, including divorced, land-owning women without adequate male support, contract out the labour to relatives or other members of the community, while others may work sharecropped lands with their husbands. However, female sharecroppers are rarely counted separately from their husbands.{{sfn|Jarosz|1997|p=130}}

==Gender equality==
Discrimination based on gender is forbidden by the [[Constitution of Madagascar]]. However, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) notes that there are still reports of discrimination in inheritance law. The OECD has rated the degree of gender discrimination as medium on the [[Social Institutions and Gender Index]].{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=238}}

Women legally have equal [[Title (property)|ownership rights]], although in locations along the east coast of Madagascar they may be unable to own land. They are allowed to own their own businesses and do not require permission from their husband to acquire land. Their [[civil liberties]] are generally well-respected.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=239}} However, in cases of spousal abuse, women must report the crime themselves in order for the police to act. Although calling the police is rare, women also have a traditional right known as ''misintaka'' that allows them to leave their husbands and live with their families.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=238}}

There is a perception that women in Madagascar should focus on cooking, with farming handled by the men. As such, poorer Malagasy women are not allowed to assist in the farming on other people's land.{{sfn|Jarosz|1997|p=133}}

In a divorce, Malagasy women traditionally receive a third of the property acquired during their marriage, with their husband receiving the remaining two-thirds; they may also choose to keep their property separate during marriage.{{sfn|Jarosz|1997|p=130}}{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=239}} When the husband dies, a Malagasy widow who has borne a child receives half of the joint property. However, if the couple was childless then the husband's family received most of the inheritance.{{sfn|OECD|2010|p=238}}
