'''ADIME''', or '''Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention, and Monitoring/Evaluation''', is a process used to ensure high quality nutrition care to patients and clients from nutrition professionals, such as Registered Dietitians (RD) or Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).&lt;ref name="BauerLiou2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen Bauer|author2=Doreen Liou|author3=Carol Sokolik|title=Nutrition Counseling and Education Skill Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItNtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-70807-0|pages=128–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gresham2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara B Gresham|title=Today's Health Professions: Working Together to Provide Quality Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nj5dCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA164|date=8 January 2016|publisher=F.A.

*Assessment - This step involves collecting data pertinent to the patient, including nutrition-related History, anthropometric Measurements, biochemical data, nutrition-focused physical findings, client history and comparative standards.
*Diagnosis - Based on the assessment data collected, a nutrition problem may be diagnosed. Causes and contributing factors are identified. 
*Intervention - Based on the nutrition diagnosis, problems are addressed that aid in alleviation of the diagnosis’ signs and symptoms. Activities are constructed to enable the patient to work towards objectives set for them by themselves and their nutrition professional. 
*Monitoring/Evaluation - Progress made on goals and/or expected outcomes is tracked to ensure that nutrition problems are being addressed; adjustments in the Intervention step are made according to progress.&lt;ref name="Boyle2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie A.

'''Abortion in Bangladesh''' is illegal under most situations, but [[menstrual regulation]] is often used as a substitute. [[Bangladesh]] is still governed by the penal code from 1860, where induced abortion is illegal unless the woman in danger.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Menstrual Regulation and Induced Abortion in Bangladesh|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/menstrual-regulation-and-induced-abortion-bangladesh|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 March 2017|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="un2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ | chapter=Bangladesh | chapterurl=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/bangladesh1.doc |accessdate=14 March 2017 |year=2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Division |volume= |format=DOC |isbn= |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[abortion]] has been prevalent, especially during the years following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. For example, in 1972, the law allowed for abortion for those women who has been raped during the war.&lt;ref name="un2002"/&gt; In 1976, the Bangladesh National Population Policy unsuccessfully attempted to legalize abortion in the [[first trimester]].&lt;ref name=danger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asap-asia.org/country-profile-bangladesh/ |title=Country Profile – Bangladesh |website=Asia Safe Abortion Partnership |accessdate=14 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111125657/http://asap-asia.org/country-profile-bangladesh/ |archivedate=11 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1979, [[menstrual regulation]] has been the favored alternative to induced abortion, and it is legally permitted because pregnancy cannot be established.&lt;ref name=danger/&gt;&lt;ref name="un2002"/&gt; In 2012, the Drug Administration for Bangladesh legalised the combination of mifepristone and misoprotol for medical abortion.&lt;ref name="Zaidi, Shahida 2014"/&gt;

==Menstrual regulation==
Part of the family planning program in Bangladesh since 1979, [[menstrual regulation]] is a procedure that uses manual vacuum aspiration to make it impossible to be pregnant after missing a [[menstruation|period]].&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; It is simple and can be done with inexpensive equipment. Its procedure also goes without the use of [[anaesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laufe|first1=Leonard E.|title=The Menstrual Regulation Procedure|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=October 1977|volume=8|issue=10|pages=253–256|doi=10.2307/1966015|jstor=1966015|publisher=Population Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study about menstrual regulation in 2013 studied 651 consenting women from 10 different facilities in Bangladesh, who were seeking menstrual regulation and were about 63 days or less late of their menstrual cycle. They were given about 200&amp;nbsp;mg of [[mifepristone]], followed later by 800&amp;nbsp;mg of [[misoprostol]]. The researchers found that 93% of the women had evacuated the uterus without the use of the surgical intervention, and 92% of the women were satisfied with the pills and the rest of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Alam, Anadil 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alam|first1=Anadil|last2=Bracken|first2=Hillary|last3=Johnson|first3=Heidi Bart|last4=Raghavan|first4=Sheila|last5=Islam|first5=Noushin|last6=Winikoff|first6=Beverly|last7=Reichenbach|first7=Laura|title=Acceptability and Feasibility of Mifepristone-Misoprostol For Menstrual Regulation in Bangladesh|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=June 2013|volume=39|issue=2|pages=79–87|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|jstor=41959959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although menstrual regulation centers are centralized and free of charge, many women still lack access due to socioeconomic barriers and social stigma.&lt;ref name="Alam, Anadil 2013"/&gt; Centers charge additional fees if the pregnancy is beyond 10 weeks, and many women are unaware of menstrual regulation or face male opposition to the procedure. As a result, some women turn to illegal abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://aphanew.confex.com/apha/132am/techprogram/paper_80263.htm |title=Evaluation of reported induced abortion in Bangladesh: Evidence from the recent DHS |last1= Islam |first1=Mohammad Amirul |last2=Padmadas |first2=Sabu S. |last3=Kabir |first3=Mohammad |date=6–10 November 2004 |conference=132nd Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==
An abortion can be legally performed by a physician in a hospital, if it is necessary to save the life of the mother. A person who performs an abortion under any other circumstances, including a woman who [[self-induced abortion|self-aborts]], can be punished by a fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="un2002"/&gt;

Menstrual regulation allows a woman to terminate within 10 weeks of her last period, but unsafe methods to terminate pregnancy are widespread. In response, a hotline was created for women to get information about fertility control, including menstrual regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/safe-abortion-hotline-launched-for-menstrual-regulation-in-bangladesh/ |title=Safe Abortion Hotline Launched for Menstrual Regulation in Bangladesh |publisher=International Campaign for Women's Right to Safe Abortion |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024055955/http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/safe-abortion-hotline-launched-for-menstrual-regulation-in-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], which studied the rural district of [[Matlab, Bangladesh|Matlab]], illegal abortion is becoming increasingly prevalent despite the availability of safer methods of fertility control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=In Bangladesh, Unsafe Abortion is Common Despite Availability of Safer Pregnancy Termination Procedure

|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2014/bangladesh-unsafe-abortion-common-despite-availability-safer-pregnancy-termination |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |date=22 September 2014 |access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Mizanur Rahman and Julie DaVanzo showed that between 2000 and 2008, a woman was more likely to die from the complications of unsafe abortion than from childbirth itself, and that [[maternal death|death rates from childbirth]] were similar of the death rates for the complications of menstrual regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DaVanzo|first1=Julie|last2=Rahman|first2=Mizanur|title=Pregnancy Termination in Matlab, Bangladesh: Trends And Correlates of Use of Safer and Less-Safe Methods|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=September 2014|volume=40|issue=3|pages=119–126|doi=10.1363/4011914|publisher=Guttmacher Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study in [[Matlab, Bangladesh|Matlab]] found that between 1982 and 1998, abortion about 35 times more prevalent among unmarried adolescent girls than among married adolescent girls, and it was much higher among who were less than 18 years of age and those who passed or had more than primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kapil Ahmed|first1=M.|last2=Van Ginneken|first2=Jeroen|last3=Razzaque|first3=Abdur|title=Factors associated with adolescent abortion in a rural area of Bangladesh|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|date=28 January 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
{{As of|2014}}, the national rate that women participate in menstrual regulation as a post-contraceptive way to control their fertility was 10 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. The national rate for induced abortion was 29 per 1,000 women in the same age interval.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; The United Nations estimated that in 2000, the abortion rate was 4.0 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 42% of facilities that were expected to provide menstrual regulation services actually did so. Of the Union Health and Family Welfare Centres, which are especially relied upon in rural areas, half provided these services.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; According to Guttmacher, about 27% of women (about 105,000) are turned away annually. In addition, in 2014, about 50% of ever-married Bangladeshi women had not heard of menstrual regulation.&lt;ref name = factsheet/&gt;

In 2014, it was estimated that between 523,808 and 769,269 abortions occurred per year in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Zaidi, Shahida 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaidi|first1=Shahida|last2=Begum|first2=Ferdousi|last3=Tank|first3=Jaydeep|last4=Chaudhury|first4=Pushpa|last5=Yasmin|first5=Haleema|last6=Dissanayake|first6=Mangala|title=Achievements of the FIGO Initiative for the Prevention of Unsafe Abortion and its Consequences in South-Southeast Asia|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|date=30 March 2014|volume=126|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">The '''Act on Health Sector Database''', also known as '''Act on Health Sector Database, No. 139/1998''', the '''Health Sector Database Act''' and in media by other colloquial names, was a 1998 act of the [[Icelandic Parliament]] which allowed the Icelandic government to grant a license to a private company for the creation of a national [[biological database]] to store health information which could be used for research. The act was noted for boldly introducing policy related to [[biobanks]] and was the subject of controversy.

[[deCODE genetics]] did most of the lobbying for the act and was the beneficiary of the license to create the database.

==Controversies==

'''Alexandre Emile Jean Yersin''' (22 September 1863 – 1 March 1943) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and naturalized [[French people|French]] [[physician]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]]. He is remembered as the discoverer of the [[bacillus]] responsible for the [[bubonic plague]] or pest, which was later named in his honour (''[[Yersinia pestis]]'').

== Life ==

Yersin was born in 1863 in [[Aubonne]], [[Canton of Vaud]], [[Switzerland]], to a family originally from [[France]]. From 1883 to 1884, Yersin studied medicine at [[Lausanne]], Switzerland; and then at [[Marburg]], [[Germany]] and [[Paris]] (1884–1886). In 1886, he entered [[Louis Pasteur]]'s research laboratory at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], by invitation of [[Emile Roux]], and participated in the development of the anti-[[rabies]] serum. In 1888 he received his doctorate with a dissertation titled ''Étude sur le Développement du Tubercule Expérimental'' and spent two months with [[Robert Koch]] in Germany. He joined the recently created [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1889 as Roux's collaborator and discovered with him the [[Diphtheria|diphtheric toxin]] (produced by the ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' bacillus).

To practice medicine in France, Yersin applied for and obtained French nationality in 1888. Soon afterwards (1890), he left for [[French Indochina]] in [[Southeast Asia]] as a physician for the ''Messageries Maritimes'' company, on the [[Saigon]]-[[Manila]] line and then on the Saigon-[[Haiphong]] line. He participated in one of the [[Auguste Pavie]] missions. In 1894 Yersin was sent by request of the French government and the Pasteur Institute to [[Hong Kong]], to investigate the Manchurian pneumonic plague epidemic.

There, in a small hut (according to ''Plague'' by Wendy Orent) since he was denied access to English hospitals at his arrival, he made his greatest discovery: that of the [[pathogen]] which causes the disease. Dr [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]], also in Hong Kong, had identified a bacterium several days earlier. There is controversy whether this was the same pneumococci or a mix of the two. Because Kitasato's initial reports were vague and somewhat contradictory, some give Yersin sole credit for the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard-Jones|first=Norman|title=Was Shibasaburo Kitasato the Co-Discoverer of the Plague Bacilllus?|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|year=1973|issue=Winter|pages=292–307|doi=10.1353/pbm.1973.0034|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Tom|title=Hong Kong, 1894: the role of James A Lowson in the controversial discovery of the plague bacillus.|journal=Lancet|date=July 5, 1997|volume=350|issue=9070|pages=59–62|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)01438-4|pmid=9217728}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a thorough analysis of the morphology of the organism discovered by Kitasato has determined that "we are confident that Kitasato had examined the plague bacillus in Hong Kong in late June and early July 1894", only days after Yersin announced his own discovery on 20 June. Therefore, Kitasato "should not be denied this credit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bibel|first=DJ|author2=Chen, TH |title=Diagnosis of plaque: an analysis of the Yersin-Kitasato controversy.|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|date=September 1976|volume=40|issue=3|pages=633–651, quote p. 646|pmc=413974|pmid=10879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plague bacillus develops better at lower temperatures, so Yersin's less well-equipped lab turned out to be an advantage in the race with Kitasato, who used an incubator. Therefore, although at first named “Kitasato-Yersin bacillus” by the scientific community, the microbe will later assume only the latter’s name because the one identified by Kitasato, a type of streptococcus, cannot be found in the lymphatic glands. Yersin was also able to demonstrate for the first time that the same bacillus was present in the rodent as well as in the human disease, thus underlining the possible means of transmission. This important discovery was communicated to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in the same year, by his colleague [[Emile Duclaux]], in a classic paper titled "La peste bubonique à Hong-Kong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ann. Inst. Pasteur|volume=8|year=1894|pages= 662–667|title=La peste bubonique à Hong-Kong|author=Yersin, Alexandre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1895 to 1897, Yersin further pursued his studies on the bubonic plague. In 1895 he returned to the Institute Pasteur in Paris and with Émile Roux, [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Amédée Borrel]], prepared the first anti-plague serum. In the same year, he returned to Indochina, where he installed a small laboratory at Nha Trang to manufacture the serum (in 1905 this laboratory became a branch of the Pasteur Institute). Yersin tried the serum received from Paris in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and [[Amoy]], in 1896, and in [[Bombay]], [[India]], in 1897, with disappointing results. Having decided to stay in his country of adoption, he participated actively in the creation of [[Hanoi Medical University|the Medical School]] of [[Ha Noi]] in 1902, and was its first director, until 1904.

Yersin tried his hand at agriculture and was a pioneer in the cultivation of [[rubber tree]]s (''Hevea brasiliensis'') imported from [[Brazil]] into Indochina. For this purpose, he obtained in 1897 a concession from the government to establish an agricultural station at [[Suoi Dau]]. He opened a new station at [[Hon Ba]] in 1915, where he tried to acclimatize the [[quinine]] tree (''Cinchona ledgeriana''), which was imported from the [[Andes]] in [[South America]] by the [[Spaniards]], and which produced the first known effective remedy for preventing and treating [[malaria]] (a disease which prevails in Southeast Asia to this day).

Alexandre Yersin is well remembered in Vietnam, where he was affectionately called '''Ông Năm''' (Mr. Nam/Fifth) by the people.

On 8 January 1902, Yersin was accredited to be the first Headmaster of [[Hanoi Medical University]] by the [[List of Governors-General of French Indochina|Governor-General of French Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Phần 1: Thời kỳ thuộc Pháp (1902–1945)|url = http://hmu.edu.vn/LichSu/Lichsu-P1.htm|website = hmu.edu.vn|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the country's independence, streets named in his honor kept their designation and his tomb in Suoi Dau was graced by a pagoda where rites are performed in his worship. His house in Nha Trang is now the [[Yersin Museum]], and the epitaph on his tombstone describes him as a "Benefactor and humanist, venerated by the Vietnamese people". In [[Ha Noi]], a French lycée has his name. A private university founded in 2004 in [[Da Lat]] was named "Yersin University" in his honour.

In 1934 he was nominated honorary director of Pasteur Institute and a member of its Board of Administration. He died during [[World War II]] at his home in [[Nha Trang]], in 1943.

== Miscellaneous ==

Dr Yersin was credited for finding the site for the town of [[Đà Lạt|Dalat]] (300&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Saigon) in 1893. Because of the high altitude and European-like climate, Dalat soon became an R&amp;R spot for French officers. There was a high school named after him which was built in the 1920s, the [[Lycée Yersin]], aka Grand Lycée (grade 6 to 12), the Petit Lycée (elementary to grade 5) and a university named for him which was built in the 2000s.

While in Hong Kong, Yersin was helped in his research by an Italian priest of the [[Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions|PIME]] order, Bernardo Viganò (1837–1901). He provided dead bodies and assisted him in his quest for a remedy for the plague.

'''Alfredo Avelín''' (1 May 1927 – 26 January 2012) was an Argentine politician, physician and author. He served as Governor of his province of [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] and as a member of the [[Argentine Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]].

Avelín was born in San Juan Province to parents of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent. He earned a medical degree at the [[National University of Córdoba|University of Córdoba]], and later founded the Colegio Médico de la Provincia. Entering politics, he founded the [[Renewal Crusade]] party. He became Mayor of the provincial capital, [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], in 1958, and at the age of 31.

He was ultimately elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] in 1989, and to the [[Argentine Senate]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicaymunicipios.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_DES=2543&amp;ID_Seccion=49 Politica y Municipios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312131741/http://www.politicaymunicipios.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_DES=2543&amp;ID_Seccion=49 |date=2008-03-12 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1999, Avelín was elected as governor of his province with 55%, heading the list of the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]], which would win the presidency of Argentina later the same year. He defeated the incumbent Governor, [[Jorge Escobar]]. His period in office was marked by economic turbulence and public unrest in San Juan, not unlike the country as a whole; by 2001, provincial employees were not being paid, and the province was insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E7D7133BF93BA25752C1A9679C8B63 ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the downfall of the government of President [[Fernando de la Rua|de la Rua]], Avelín was a fierce opponent of the austerity measures proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]], saying, "The only thing lacking for us is to pull down the Argentine flag and replace it with the IMF's." In 2002, Avelín was impeached and deposed as governor by a majority of provincial deputies following massive demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=426029 ''La Nación''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avelín considered running again for the governorship in 2007 against the incumbent, [[José Luis Gioja]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=150081&amp;ID_Seccion=18 Derf] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, [[Nancy Avelín]], who also served as a senator, was eventually the candidate for the Renewal Crusade that year.

Alfredo Avelín died on 26 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/20-186293-2012-01-26.html Murió el exgobernador Alfredo Avelín] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audiometer''' is a machine used for evaluating hearing acuity. They usually consist of an embedded hardware unit connected to a pair of [[headphones]] and a test subject feedback button, sometimes controlled by a standard PC. Such systems can also be used with bone vibrators, to test conductive hearing mechanisms. 

Audiometers are standard equipment at [[Otolaryngology|ENT (ear, nose, throat)]] clinics and in [[audiology]] centers. 
An alternative to hardware audiometers are software audiometers, which are available in many different configurations.
Screening PC-based audiometers use a standard computer.
Clinical PC-based audiometers are generally more expensive than software audiometers, but are much more accurate and efficient. They are most commonly used in hospitals, audiology centers and research communities. These audiometers are also used to conduct industrial audiometric testing.  Some audiometers even provide a software developer's kit that provides researchers with the capability to create their own diagnostic tests.
==Functionality==
[[File:Vintage Maico Model F-1 Portable Audiometer Hearing Tester, Vacuum Tube Unit, Circa 1960s (16440624956).jpg|thumb|200px|Portable audiometer ''Maico'', circa 1960s]]
An audiometer typically transmits recorded sounds such as pure tones or speech to the headphones of the test subject
at varying frequencies and intensities, and records the subject's responses to produce an [[audiogram]] of threshold sensitivity, or speech understanding profile.

==Types==
Medical grade audiometers are usually an embedded hardware unit controlled from a PC.  Software audiometers which run on a PC are also commercially available, but their accuracy and utility for evaluating hearing loss is questionable due to lack of a calibration standard.

The most common type of audiometer generates pure tones, or transmits parts of speech.
Another kind of audiometer is the Bekesy audiometer, in which the subject follows a tone of increasing and decreasing amplitude as the tone is swept through the frequency range by depressing a button when the tone is heard and releasing it when it cannot be heard, crossing back and forth over the threshold of hearing. Bekesy audiometry typically yields lower thresholds and standard deviations than pure tone audiometry.

==Standards==
Audiometer requirements and the test procedure are specified in [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60645, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 8253, and [[ANSI]] isoS3.6 standards.

==History==
Cannabis is believed to have become commonly cultivated in Sierra Leone well before it became widespread in West Africa.&lt;ref name="AkyeampongHill2015"/&gt; Midwives used it as anaesthesia for childbirth, and fishermen used it to deal with their difficult labors.&lt;ref name="AkyeampongHill2015"/&gt; An 1851 journal article reported that cannabis had been "long in use" in the interior of Sierra Leone, and claimed that cannabis seeds were brought to the [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|colony]] by "Congoes captured by one of our cruisers."&lt;ref name="Hooker1851"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Jackson Hooker|title=Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FExWW9XkfJ0C&amp;pg=PA9|year=1851|publisher=Reeve, Benham, and Reeve|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leoneon sailors and stevedores played a role in disseminating cannabis regionally, spreading the use of the drug to Ghana and Gambia.&lt;ref name="Cargill2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kima Cargill|title=Food Cults: How Fads, Dogma, and Doctrine Influence Diet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIZwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222|date=16 December 2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-5132-8|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duvall2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Duvall|title=Cannabis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVU8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT99|date=15 November 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-386-4|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis was first banned in Sierra Leone in 1920, during the country's British colonial period; cannabis was included in that year as an addendum to the nation's 1913 Opium Act.&lt;ref name="AkyeampongHill2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Emmanuel Akyeampong|author2=Allan G.

==Cultivation==
The 2011 ''International Narcotics Control Strategy Report'' noted that cannabis is widely cultivated in Sierra Leone, to the degree that the national government was concerned that cannabis may be crowding out subsistence farming and threatening food security.&lt;ref name="Brownfield2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William R.

==Popularity==
A doctor stated to Sierra Leone's [[Truth and Reconciliation Committee]] in 2003: ''Cannabis sativa is so commonly used or abused in Sierra Leone... that I don't think people consider it a crime any more to use it... As you can see, it is grown nearly everywhere in Sierra Leone today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">The use of '''capital punishment in [[Italy]]''' has been banned since 1889, with the exception of the period 1926-1947, encompassing the rule of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism in Italy]] and the early restoration of democracy. Before the unification of Italy in 1860, capital punishment was performed in almost all pre-unitarian states, except for [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], where it was historically abolished in 1786. It is currently out of use as a result of the adoption of the current constitution, and defunct as of 1 January 1948.

==History==

In Italy, the first pre-unitarian state to abolish the [[death penalty]] was the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] as of November 30, 1786, under the reign of [[Pietro Leopoldo]], who later became [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. So Tuscany was the first modern European state in the world to do away with torture and capital punishment.

[[File:Esecuzione monti tognetti roma 1868.jpg|thumb|Execution of capital punishment by [[guillotine]] in 1868, shortly after the birth of modern Italy. The death penalty was subsequently abolished in 1889 and only revived under [[Italian Fascism]].]]
However, the death penalty was sanctioned in the codes of law of all the other pre-unitarian states, therefore when the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed in 1860, legislation was divided, since the death penalty was legal in all of Italy except for [[Tuscany]].

Afterwards, the death penalty was definitively abolished in the Penal Code in 1889 with the almost unanimous approval of both Houses of Parliament under suggestion of Minister Zanardelli.&lt;ref&gt;Indro Montanelli; Storia d'italia, vol 6, pag 215&lt;/ref&gt; However executions in Italy had not been carried out since 1877, when King [[Umberto I]] granted a general [[pardon]] (royal decree of pardon of January 18, 1878). Ironically, as a result of this pardon, [[Gaetano Bresci]] could not be sentenced to death after he assassinated Umberto I in 1900. The death penalty was still present in military and colonial penal codes.

In 1926, it was reintroduced by [[dictator]] [[Benito Mussolini]] to punish those who made an attempt on the king, the queen, the [[heir apparent]] or the Prime Minister as well as for [[espionage]] and armed rebellion. The [[Rocco Code]] (1930, in force from July 1, 1931) added more crimes to the list of those punishable with the death penalty, and reintroduced capital punishment for some common crimes. It was used sparsely, however; until the outbreak of war in 1940, a total of nine executions were carried out, allegedly not for political offenses, followed by another 17 until Italy's surrender in July 1943 (compared to almost 80,000 legal executions in [[Nazi Germany]], including courts martial).&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Fascism'', Stanley G. Payne, ''Italian Fascism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Peter (1977, 1996). The History of the German Resistance, 1933-1945 p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini - En Studie i Makt'', Göran Hägg, p. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The last people executed for civil crimes were three Sicilian [[robbery|robbers]], also convicted of [[murder]], who [[Villarbasse massacre|battered and threw into a well ten people]] (while still alive) on a farm near [[Villarbasse]] ([[province of Turin]]) in 1945. The [[President of the Italian Republic|president]], [[Enrico de Nicola]], declined to pardon them, and they were executed by a [[firing squad]] on March 4, 1947 at [[Basse di Stura]] riverside, in the suburbs of [[Turin]]. This was the last execution in Italy.

The [[Italian Constitution]], approved on December 27, 1947 and in force since January 1, 1948, completely abolished the death penalty for all common military and civil crimes during peacetime. This measure was implemented by the legislative decree 22/48 of January 22, 1948 (provision of coordination as a consequence of the abolishment of capital punishment). The death penalty was still in force in Italy in the military penal code, only for high treason against the Republic or for crimes perpetrated in war theatres (though no execution ever took place) until law 589/94 of October 13, 1994 abolished it completely from there as well, and substituted it with the maximum penalty of the civil penal code (imprisonment for life). In 2007 a constitutional amendment was adopted. Article 27 of Italian Constitution was changed to fully ban the death penalty.

Prior to abolition, the death penalty was sanctioned in article 21 of the Italian penal code. It stated that ''Death penalty is to be carried out by shooting inside a penitentiary or in any other place suggested by the Ministry of Justice. The execution is not public, unless the Ministry of Justice determines otherwise.''

A draft law to ratify the 13th Protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] had been approved by the Senate on October 9, 2008 (it was approved earlier by the Chamber of Deputies on September 24).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=10318705|title=Draft law|author=|date=|website=handsoffcain.info|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified on March 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=328|title=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty : uniting all those committed to the universal abolition of capital punishment|author=|date=|website=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

Fewer than half of Italians approved of the 2006 [[execution of Saddam Hussein]]. Italy proposed the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]], which urges states to establish a moratorium on executions with a view toward abolition and urged states around the world to approve it. The former Italian Foreign Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]] also stated that the next step was to work on abolishing the death penalty.

The 2008 European Values Study (EVS) found that 62.6% of respondents in Italy said that the death penalty can never be justified, while only 4.8% said it can always be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http://193.175.238.79:80/obj/fStudy/ZA4783&amp;variable=http://193.175.238.79:80/obj/fVariable/ZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en|title=GESIS: ZACAT|author=|date=|website=zacat.gesis.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical research]] and [[social science]], a '''cross-sectional study''' (also known as a '''cross-sectional analysis''', '''transverse study''', '''prevalence study''') is a type of [[observational study]] that analyzes data from a population, or a representative subset, ''at a specific point in time''&amp;mdash;that is, [[cross-sectional data]].

In [[economics]], cross-sectional studies typically involve the use of [[cross-sectional regression]], in order to sort out the existence and magnitude of causal effects of one or more [[independent variable]]s upon a [[dependent variable]] of interest at a given point in time. They differ from [[time series analysis]], in which the behavior of one or more [[aggregate data|economic aggregates]] is traced through time.

In medical research, cross-sectional studies differ from [[case-control studies]] in that they aim to provide data on the entire population under study, whereas case-control studies typically include only individuals with a specific characteristic, with a sample, often a tiny minority, of the rest of the population. Cross-sectional studies are descriptive studies (neither longitudinal nor experimental). Unlike case-control studies, they can be used to describe, not only the [[odds ratio]], but also [[absolute risk]]s and [[relative risk]]s from [[prevalence]]s (sometimes called ''prevalence risk ratio'', or PRR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=165–167 |doi=10.1007/s00038-008-7068-3|pmid=19127890|year=2008|last1=Schmidt|first1=CO|last2=Kohlmann|first2=T|title=When to use the odds ratio or the relative risk?|volume=53|issue=3|journal=International Journal of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/ije/23.1.201|title=Odds Ratio or Relative Risk for Cross-Sectional Data?|year=1994|last1=Lee|first1=James|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=23|pages=201–3|pmid=8194918|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may be used to describe some feature of the population, such as [[prevalence]] of an illness, or they may support inferences of cause and effect. [[Longitudinal studies]] differ from both in making a series of observations more than once on members of the study population over a period of time.

==Healthcare==

Cross-sectional studies involve data collected at a defined time. They are often used to assess the [[prevalence]] of acute or chronic conditions, but cannot be used to answer questions about the causes of disease or the results of intervention. Cross-sectional data cannot be used to infer causality because temporality is not known. They may also be described as [[census]]es. Cross-sectional studies may involve special data collection, including questions about the past, but they often rely on data originally collected for other purposes. They are moderately expensive, and are not suitable for the study of rare diseases. Difficulty in recalling past events may also contribute bias.

===Advantages===

The use of routinely collected data allows large cross-sectional studies to be made at little or no expense. This is a major advantage over other forms of epidemiological study. A natural progression has been suggested from cheap cross-sectional studies of routinely collected data which suggest hypotheses, to case-control studies testing them more specifically, then to [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] and trials which cost much more and take much longer, but may give stronger evidence. In a cross-sectional survey, a specific group is looked at to see if an activity, say [[alcohol]] consumption, is related to the health effect being investigated, say [[cirrhosis of the liver]]. If alcohol use is correlated with cirrhosis of the liver, this would support the hypothesis that alcohol use may be associated with cirrhosis.

===Disadvantages===
Routine data may not be designed to answer the specific question. 

Routinely collected data does not normally describe which variable is the cause and which the effect. Cross-sectional studies using data originally collected for other purposes are often unable to include data on [[confounding factor]]s, other variables that affect the relationship between the putative cause and effect. For example, data only on present alcohol consumption and cirrhosis would not allow the role of past alcohol use, or of other causes, to be explored.

Most case-control studies collect specifically designed data on all participants, including data fields designed to allow the hypothesis of interest to be tested. However, in issues where strong personal feelings may be involved, specific questions may be a source of bias. For example, past alcohol consumption may be incorrectly reported by an individual wishing to reduce their personal feelings of guilt. Such bias may be less in routinely collected statistics, or effectively eliminated if the observations are made by third parties, for example taxation records of alcohol by area.

====Weaknesses of aggregated data====

Cross-sectional studies can contain individual-level data (one record per individual, for example, in national health surveys). However, in modern epidemiology it may be impossible to survey the entire population of interest, so cross-sectional studies often involve secondary analysis of data collected for another purpose. In many such cases, no individual records are available to the researcher, and group-level information must be used. Major sources of such data are often large institutions like the [[Census Bureau]] or the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in the United States. Recent census data is not provided on individuals, for example in the UK individual census data is released only after a century. Instead data is aggregated, usually by administrative area. Inferences about individuals based on aggregate data are weakened by the [[ecological fallacy]].  Also consider the potential for committing the "atomistic fallacy" where assumptions about aggregated counts are made based on the aggregation of individual level data (such as averaging census tracts to calculate a county average).  For example, it might be true that there is no [[correlation]] between infant mortality and family income at the city level, while still being true that there is a strong relationship between infant mortality and family income at the individual level. All aggregate statistics are subject to compositional effects, so that what matters is not only the individual-level relationship between income and infant mortality, but also the proportions of low, middle, and high income individuals in each city. Because case-control studies are usually based on individual-level data, they do not have this problem.

==Economics==

In economics, cross-sectional analysis has the advantage of avoiding various complicating aspects of the use of data drawn from various points in time, such as [[serial correlation]] of residuals. It also has the advantage that the data analysis itself does not need an assumption that the nature of the relationships between variables is stable over time, though this comes at the cost of requiring caution if the results for one time period are to be assumed valid at some different point in time.

An example of cross-sectional analysis in economics is the regression of [[money demand]]&amp;mdash;the amounts that various people hold in highly liquid financial assets&amp;mdash;at a particular time upon their income, total financial wealth, and various [[demographics|demographic factors]]. Each data point is for a particular individual or family, and the regression is conducted on a [[statistical sample]] drawn at one point in time from the entire [[population (statistics)|population]] of individuals or families. In contrast, an intertemporal analysis of money demand would use data on an entire country's holdings of money at each of various points in time, and would regress that on contemporaneous (or near-contemporaneous) income, total financial wealth, and some measure of interest rates. The cross-sectional study has the advantage that it can investigate the effects of various demographic factors (age, for example) on individual differences; but it has the disadvantage that it cannot find the effect of interest rates on money demand, because in the cross-sectional study at a particular point in time all observed units are faced with the same current level of interest rates.

==History==
Together with the [[Bundesliga]], the DFB Sports Court was founded in 1963. It hears cases of misconduct by individual players, clubs or spectators. The court is a separate authority, responsible for the national and regional leagues. The [[judge]]s and staff are volunteers.

==Structure==
The structure resembles that of a normal court. The court is composed of a [[chief judge]], a deputy and 28 assessors. The chief judge and the deputy are elected by the [[DFB-Bundestag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/fileadmin/_dfbdam/66978-02_Satzung.pdf |title=Satzung|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-10-25 |website= |publisher=Deutscher Fussball-Bund|access-date=2015-10-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief judge is [[Hans Eberhard Lorenz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2478340/Hoffenheim-refused-Bayer-Leverkusen-rematch-Stefan-Kiessling-phantom-goal.html |title=Hoffenheim refused Leverkusen rematch by German sports court after Kiessling 'phantom goal' condemns them to defeat |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-10-28 |website= |publisher=Daily Mail |access-date=2015-10-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
The DFB Sports Court convenes when serious rule violations occur. This starts directly after a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] is given. The court determines the sentence depending on the hardness of the fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct. If the clubs in question agree, the sports court creates a written statement. Only 20% of procedures end with a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]].

[[Appeal]]s against decisions from the DFB Sports Court can be presented to the DFB Federal Court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35210">{{Disability}}
The world's poor are significantly more likely to have or incur a [[disability]] within their lifetime compared to more financially privileged populations. The rate of disability within impoverished nations is notably higher than that found in more [[developed countries]]. Though no one explanation entirely accounts for this connection, recently{{since when?|date=August 2014}} there has been a substantial amount of research illustrating the cycle by which poverty and disability are mutually reinforcing. Physical, cognitive, mental, emotional, sensory, or developmental impairments independently or in tandem with one another may increase one's likelihood of becoming impoverished, while living in poverty may increase one's potential of having or acquiring special needs in some capacity.

==Extent==
[[File:Disable begger in Dhaka.JPG|thumbnail|Man with disabilities in Bangladesh]]
A multitude of studies have been shown to demonstrate a significant rate of [[disability]] among individuals living in [[poverty]]. People with disabilities were shown by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] to comprise 15 to 20 percent of the poorest individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."&gt;Elwan, A. (1999). Poverty and disability: A review of the literature. The World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Former World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]] has stated that this connection reveals a link that should be broken. He stated, “People with disabilities in developing countries are over-represented among the poorest people. They have been largely overlooked in the development agenda so far, but the recent focus on poverty reduction strategies is a unique change to rethink and rewrite that agenda.”&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;The World Bank. (2011). Poverty and disability. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:20193783~menuPK:419389~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The link between disability and development has been further stressed by [[Judith Heumann]], the World Bank's first advisor for international [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]], who indicated that of the 650 million people living with disabilities today eighty percent live in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov"&gt;The Office of Policy Planning and Public Diplomacy. (2012). Special advisor Heumann's remarks on inclusive development. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311193836/http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some research investigations with proved social impact are opening venues that lead to establish enabling factors to break the cycle of deprivation faced by poor people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00450|title=It also helped refine international approaches to the education of the disabled. [Social Impact]. RECOUP. Research Consortium on Educational Outcomes and Poverty (2005-2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department for International Development|United Kingdom Department for International Development]], 10,000 individuals with disabilities die each day as a result of extreme poverty, showing that the connection between these two constructs is especially problematic and deep-seated.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is also present in developed countries, with the Disability Funders Network reporting that in the United States alone those with disabilities are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than those without special needs.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy"&gt;Dickson, J. (2011). Philanthropy's Blind Spot: The Disability Rights Movement. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the World Bank, “Persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as less education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and higher poverty rates.”&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). Disability: Overview. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:21151218~menuPK:282706~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have demonstrated that these reduced outcomes may be attributed to a myriad of institutional barriers and other factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of disabilities in impoverished populations has been predicted to follow a cyclical pattern by which those who live in poverty are more likely to acquire a disability and those who have a disability are more likely to become impoverished.

===The vicious circle===
Experts from the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council attribute the connection between disability and poverty to many systemic factors that promote a “vicious circle.”&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics affirm the mutually reinforcing nature of special needs and low socioeconomic status, showing that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to become impoverished and people who are impoverished are significantly more likely to become disabled. Barriers presented for those with disabilities can lead individuals to be deprived of access to essential resources, such as opportunities for education and employment, thus causing them to fall into poverty. Likewise, poverty places individuals at a much greater risk of acquiring a disability due to the general lack of health care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe working conditions that the poor are subject to.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt;

Experts assert that this cycle is perpetuated mainly by the lack of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] afforded to those living in poverty. The few options available to the poor often necessitate that these individuals put themselves in harms way, consequently resulting in an increase in the acquisition of preventable impairments.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Living in poverty is also shown to decrease an individual's access to preventative health services, which results in an increase in the acquisition of potentially preventable disabilities. In a study by [[Oxfam]], the organization found that well over half of the instances of childhood blindness and hearing impairment in Africa and Asia were considered preventable or treatable.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, H. (1999). Discussion paper for Oxfam: Disability as a development issue and how to integrate a disability perspective into the SCO. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate released by Oxfam provides further evidence of this vicious circle, finding that 100 million people living in poverty suffer from impairments acquired due to malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Discrimination
Prejudice held against individuals with disabilities, otherwise termed [[ableism]], is shown to be a significant detriment to the successful outcomes of persons in this population. According to one study following the lives of children with disabilities in South Africa, the children in the sample described "discrimination from other metal children and adults in the community as their most significant daily problem."&lt;ref name="Clacherty"&gt;Clacherty, G., Matsha, K., &amp; Sait, W. (2004). How do children with disabilities experience poverty, disability, and service? Cape Town, South Africa: Idasa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional forms of discrimination may lead disability to be more salient in already [[social exclusion|marginalized]] populations. Women and individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups who have disabilities have been found to more greatly suffer from discrimination and endure negative outcomes. Some researchers attribute this to what they believe is a “double rejection” of girls and women who are disabled on the basis of their sex in tandem with their special needs.&lt;ref name="Coleridge"&gt;Coleridge, P. (1993). Disability, liberation, and development. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes that accompany both of these attributes lead females with disabilities to be seen as particularly dependent upon others and serve to amplify the misconception of this population as burdensome.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; In a study done by Oxfam, the societal consequences of having a disability while belonging to an already marginalized population were highlighted, stating, “A disabled women suffers a multiple handicap. Her chances of marriage are very slight, and she is most likely to be condemned to a twilight existence as a non-productive adjunct to the household of her birth… it is small wonder that many disabled female babies do not survive.”&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Additionally, women with disabilities are particularly susceptible to abuse. A 2004 UN survey in Orissa, India, found that every women with disabilities in their sample had experienced some form of physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "&gt;United Nations. (2012). Fact sheet on persons with disabilities. Webaccessed: http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This double discrimination is also shown to be prevalent in more industrialized nations. In the United States, for example, 72 percent of women with disabilities live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The intensified discrimination individuals with disabilities may face due to their sex is especially important to consider when taking into account that, according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], women report higher incidences of disability than men.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Furthermore, the connection between disability and poverty holds particular significance for the world's women, with females accounting for roughly 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (2010). Integrating poverty and gender into health programs. The World Health Organization Webaccessed: http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/Nutritionmodule2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional discrimination also exists as there are policies existing in organizations that result in inequality between a disabled person and non-disabled person. Some of these organizations systematically ignore the needs of disabled people and some interfere in their lives as a means of social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Colin|date=1994|title=Institutional discrimination, disabled people and inter professional care|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2014.969831|journal=Journal of Interprofessional Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=203-212|doi=10.3109/13561829409010420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Another reason individuals living with disabilities are often impoverished is the high [[health care|medical costs]] associated with their needs. One study, conducted in villages in South India, demonstrated that the annual cost of treatment and equipment needed for individuals with disabilities in the area ranged from three days of income to upwards of two years' worth, with the average amount spent on essential services totaling three months worth of income.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, S., &amp; Harriss-White, B. (2001). ''The Economic Impact and Developmental Implications of Disability and Incapacity in Adulthood: a village study in South India''. Cambridge: Welfare, Demography, and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not take into account the unpaid work of caregivers who must provide assistance after these procedures and the opportunity costs leading to a loss of income during injury, surgery, and rehabilitation.
Studies reported by medical anthropologists Benedicte Ingstad and Susan Reynolds Whyte have also shown that access to medical care is significantly impaired when one lacks mobility. They report that in addition to the direct medical costs associated with special needs, the burden of transportation falls most heavily on those with disabilities. This is especially true for the rural poor whose distance from urban environments necessitates extensive movement in order to obtain health services.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;Ingstad, B. &amp; Whyte, S. R. (2007). ''Disability in Local and Global Worlds''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these barriers, both economic and physical, it is estimated that only 2 percent of individuals with disabilities have access to adequate rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Despouy, 1993, Human Rights and Disabled Persons (Study Series 6), Centre for Human Rights Geneva and UN New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaccessibility of health care for those living in poverty has a substantial impact on the rate of disability within this population.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Individuals living in poverty face higher health risks and are often unable to obtain proper treatment, leading them to be significantly more likely to acquire a disability within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Financial barriers are not the only obstacles those living in poverty are confronted with. Research shows that matters of geographic inaccessibility, availability, and cultural limitations all provide substantial impediments to the acquisition of proper care for the populations of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. H., Garg, A., Bloom, G., Walker, D. G., Brieger, W. R., &amp; Rahman, H. (2008). "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Brieger2/publication/229569366_Poverty_and_Access_to_Health_Care_in_Developing_Countries/links/59e39a3a458515393d5b8faf/Poverty-and-Access-to-Health-Care-in-Developing-Countries.pdf Poverty and access to health care in developing countries]". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. doi:10.1196&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-specific ailments are particularly harmful for women living in poverty. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that each year 20 million women acquire disabilities due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth that could be significantly mitigated with proper pre-natal, childbirth, and post-natal medical care.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"&gt;DFID (2000). Disability, poverty, and development. The Department for International Development. Webaccessed: http://www.handicap-international.fr/bibliographie-handicap/4PolitiqueHandicap/hand_pauvrete/DFID_disability.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers to care are present in the lack of treatments developed to target [[diseases of poverty]]. Experts assert that the diseases most commonly affecting those in poverty attract the least research funding. This discrepancy, known as the [[10/90 gap]], reveals that only 10 percent of global health research focuses on conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, P. (2004) Diseases of poverty and the 10/90 gap. The World Health Organization. Webaccessed: http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without a redistribution in research capital, it is likely that many of the diseases known to cause death and disability in impoverished populations will persist.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

===Institutional barriers===
Researchers assert that institutional barriers play a substantial role in the incidence of poverty in those with disabilities.

====[[Accessibility]]====
Physical environment may be a large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie, R. (1996). Disability and the city: International perspectives. London: Chapman.&lt;/ref&gt; This "apartheid" has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt; Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="Clacherty"/&gt; Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of [[Braille]], [[sign language]] and shortage of audio tape availability for those who are blind and deaf.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt;

====Education====
The roots of unemployment are speculated to begin with discrimination at an early age. [[UNESCO]] reports that 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are denied access to formal education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, at least 40 million children with disabilities do not receive an education thus barring them from obtaining knowledge essential to gainful employment and forcing them to grow up to be financially dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; This is also reflected in a finding obtained by the [[World Development Report]] that 77 percent of persons with disabilities are illiterate.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."/&gt; This statistic is even more jarring for women with disabilities, with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] reporting that the global literacy rate for this population is a mere 1 percent.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; This may be attributed to the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, boys with disabilities are significantly more likely to receive an education than similarly abled girls.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"/&gt; Beyond simply the skills obtained, experts such as former World Bank advisor [[Judith Heumann]] speculate that the societal value of education and the inability of schools to accommodate special needs children substantially contributes to the discrimination of these individuals.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; It is important to note that the deprivation of education to individuals with special needs may not be solely an issue of discrimination, but an issue of resources. Children with disabilities often require [[Special education|specialized educational]] resources and teaching practices largely unavailable in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action on Disability and Development (1998). ADD Uganda annual report. Kampala: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
Some sociologists have found a number of barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. These may be seen in [[workplace discrimination|employer discrimination]], architectural barriers within the workplace, pervasive negative attitudes regarding skill, and the adverse reactions of customers.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, W.H., &amp; Wilder, E.I.

(1999). Mind and body spaces: geographies of illness, impairment, and disability. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that roughly 386 million of the world's working age population have some form of disability, however, up to eighty percent of these employable individuals with disabilities are unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Statistics show that individuals with disabilities in both industrialized and developing countries are generally unable to obtain formal work. In India, only 100,000 of the country's 70 million individuals with disabilities are employed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; In the United States, 14.3 of a projected 48.9 million people with disabilities were employed, with two-thirds of those unemployed reporting that they were unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Similarly in Belgium, only 30 percent of persons with disabilities were able to find gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, R. (2000). [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf Disability issues, trends and recommendations for the World Bank]. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 45 percent of adults with disabilities were found to live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable data on the rate of unemployment for persons with disabilities has yet to be determined in most developing countries.

Sociologists Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer demonstrated that this exclusion of persons with disabilities from the paid labor market is a primary reason why the majority of this population experiences far greater levels of poverty and are more reliant on the financial support of others.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; In addition to the economic gains associated with employment, researchers have shown that participation in the formal economic sector reduces discrimination of persons with disabilities. One anthropologist who chronicled the lives of persons with disabilities in Botswana noted that individuals who were able to find [[informal sector|formal employment]] “will usually obtain a position in society equal to that of non-disabled citizens.”&lt;ref name="Ingstad"&gt;Ingstad, B. (1997). Community-based rehabilitation in Botswana. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the formal workplace is such a social space, the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from this realm is seen by some sociologists to be a significant impediment to social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Equity in employment has been strategized by some, such as sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters, to depend on heightened awareness of current barriers, wider use of assistive technologies that can make workplaces and tasks more accessible, more accommodating job development, and most importantly deconstructing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

Creating inclusive employment that better facilitates the participation of individuals with disabilities is demonstrated to have a significantly positive impact on not only the lives of these individuals, but also the economies of nations who implement such measures. The International Labour Organization estimates that the current exclusion of employable individuals with special needs is costing countries possible gains of 1 to 7 percent of their GDP.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;International Labour Office.

==Implications==
The relationship between disability and poverty is seen by many to be especially problematic given that it places those with the greatest needs in a position where they have access to the fewest resources. Researchers from the [[United nations|United Nations]] and the [[Yale School of Public Health]] refer to the link between disability and poverty as a manifestation of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the assumption that this population is a drain of resources leads society to deny them access to avenues of success. Such exclusion of individuals on the basis of their special needs in turn denies them the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that disprove these stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Chamie, M., Me, A., &amp; Groce, N.E. (2000). Measuring the quality of life: Rethinking the World Bank's disability adjusted life years. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914180312/http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |archivedate=2000-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam asserts that this negative cycle is largely due to a gross underestimation of the potential held by individuals with disabilities and a lack of awareness of the possibilities that each person may hold if the proper resources were present.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

The early onset of preventable deaths has been demonstrated as a significant consequence of disability for those living in poverty. Researchers show that families who lack adequate economic agency are unable to care for children with special medical needs, resulting in preventable deaths.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; In times of economic hardship studies show families may divert resources from children with disabilities because investing in their livelihood is often perceived as an investment caretakers cannot afford to make.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, B. (1999). Promoting the rights of the disabled children globally disabled children become adults: Some implications. Frome: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicte Ingstad, an anthropologist who studied families with a member with disabilities, asserted that what some may consider neglect of individuals with disabilities “was mainly a reflection of the general hardship that the household was living under."&lt;ref name="Ingstad" /&gt; A study conducted by Oxfam found that the rejection of a child with disabilities was not uncommon in areas of [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; The report went on to show that neglect of children with disabilities was far from a deliberate choice, but rather a consequence of a lack of essential resources. The study also demonstrated that services necessary to the well being of these children “are seized upon” when they are made available. The organization thus concludes that if families had the capacity to care for children with special needs they would do so willingly, but often the inability to access crucial resources bars them from administering proper care.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

==Current initiatives==
Initiatives on the local, national, and transnational levels addressing the connection between poverty and disability are exceedingly rare. According to the UN, only 45 countries throughout the world have anti-discrimination and other disability-specific laws.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Additionally, experts point to the Western world as a demonstration that the association between poverty and disability is not naturally dissolved through the development process. Instead, a conscious effort toward inclusive development is seen by theorists, such as Disability Policy expert Mark Priestley, as essential in the remediation process.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;Priestley, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrrpeMGQCLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Disability and the life course: Global perspectives]. NY, NY: University of Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights advocate [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] asserts that it is crucial to better incorporate the voices of individuals with disabilities into the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;Charlton, J.I. (2000). Nothing about us without us: Disability oppression and empowerment. London, England: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His literature on disability rights made popular the slogan, “Nothing about us without us,” evidencing the need to ensure those most affected by policy have an equitable hand in its creation. This need for agency is an issue particularly salient for those with special needs who are often negatively stereotyped as dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt; Furthermore, many who are part of the [[disability rights movement]] argue that there is too little emphasis on aid designed to eliminate the physical and social barriers those with disabilities face. The movement asserts that unless these obstacles are rectified, the connection between disability and poverty will persist.&lt;ref name=" Philanthropy "/&gt;

Employment is seen as a critical agent in reducing stigma and increasing capacity in the lives of individuals with disabilities. The lack of opportunities currently available is shown to perpetuate the vicious cycle, causing individuals with disabilities to fall into poverty. To address these concerns many recent initiatives have begun to develop more inclusive employment structures.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; One example of this is the Ntiro Project for Supported and Inclusive Employment.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"&gt;Parmenter,T.R.(2011). Promoting training and employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. International Labour Office. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_167316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located in South Africa, the project aims to eliminate the segragationist models prevalent in the country through coordinated efforts between districts, NGOs, and community organizations. The model stresses education and pairs individuals with intellectual disabilities with mentors until they have developed the skills necessary to perform their roles independently. The program then matches individuals with local employers. This gradualist model ensures that people who may have been deprived of the resources necessary to acquire essential skills are able to build their expertise and enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"/&gt;

The United Nations has been at the forefront of initiating legislation that aims to deter the current toll disabilities take on individuals in society, especially those in poverty. In 1982 the UN published the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]], which explicitly states "Particular efforts should be made to integrate the disabled in the development process and that effective measures for prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunities are therefore essential."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=23&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine set stage for the UN Decade of the Disabled Person from 1983 to 1992, where, at its close, the General Assembly adopted the [[Standard Rules of the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Rules encourages states to remove social, cultural, economic, educational, and political barriers that bar individuals with disabilities from participating equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations.

(2005). Disability, poverty, and the new poverty agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics assert that the relationship between disability and poverty may be overstated. Cultural differences in the definition of disability, bias leading to more generous estimates on behalf of researchers, and the variability in incidences that are not accounted for between countries are all speculated to be part of this mischaracterization.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; These factors lead some organizations to conclude that the projection asserting 10 percent of the global population belongs to the disabled community is entirely too broad. Speculation over the projection of a 10 percent disability rate has led other independent studies to collect varying results. The [[World Health Organization]] updated their estimate to 4 percent for developing countries and 7 percent for industrialized countries. [[USAID]] maintains the initial 10 percent figure, while the United Nations works off half of that rate with a projection of 5 percent.&lt;ref name="dfid" /&gt; The percentage of the world's population with disabilities remains a highly contested matter.

The argument that development should be channeled to better the agency of individuals with disabilities has been contested on several grounds. First, critics argue that development is enacted to harness potential that most individuals in this population do not possess.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Second, the case that health care costs for many persons with special needs are simply too great to be shouldered by the government or [[NGO]]'s has been made, especially with regard to emerging economies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that investing in an individual's rehabilitation will result in substantial change in their agency. Lastly is the proposition of priorities. It is argued that most countries in need of extensive development must focus on health ails such as infant mortality, diarrhea, and malaria that are widespread killers not limited to a specific population.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

Critique with respect to potential solutions has also been made. In regards to implementing change through policy, critics have noted that the weak legal standing of United Nations' documents and the lack of resources available to aid in their implementation have resulted in a struggle to achieve the goals set forth by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="dfid_a" /&gt; Other studies have shown that policy on a national level has not necessarily equated to marked improvements within these countries. One such example is the United States where sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters purport that “the employment of disabled individuals has increased only marginally since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.”&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; The smaller than anticipated impact of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] and other policy-based initiatives is seen as a critical flaw in legislation. This is because many issues surrounding disability, namely employment discrimination, are generally reconciled through the legal system necessitating that individuals engage in the often expensive process of litigation.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

[[File:1904 Claim of Alcoholism Being Disease4.jpg|thumb|A 1904 advertisement labeling alcoholism a "disease"]]

The modern '''disease theory of alcoholism''' states that problem drinking is sometimes caused by a [[Neurological disorder|disease of the brain]], characterized by altered brain structure and function.

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) declared that alcoholism was an illness in 1956.  In 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the [[International Classification of Diseases]] under both [[psychiatric]] and [[medical]] sections.

== Theory ==

[[Alcoholism]] is a [[chronic (medical)|chronic]] problem.  However, if managed properly, [[brain damage|damage to the brain]] can be stopped and to some extent reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Andreas J.

The risk of developing alcoholism depends on many factors, such as environment.  Those with a family history of alcoholism are more likely to develop it themselves (Enoch &amp; Goldman, 2001); however, many individuals have developed alcoholism without a family history of the disease.  Since the consumption of alcohol is necessary to develop alcoholism, the availability of and attitudes towards alcohol in an individual's environment affect their likelihood of developing the disease. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60% genetically determined, leaving 40-50% for environmental influences.&lt;ref name="The Genetics of Alcohol Dependency"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1 | last1 = Dick | first1 = DM | last2 = Bierut | first2 = LJ | year = 2006 | title = The Genetics of Alcohol Dependency | url = | journal = Current Psychiatric Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 151–7 |pmid=16539893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in 2001, McLellan et al. compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. They found that genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders, providing  evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.284.13.1689 | last1 = McLellan | first1 = AT | last2 = Lewis | first2 = DC | last3 = O'Brien | first3 = CP | last4 = Kleber | first4 = HD | title = Drug dependence, a chronic medical illness: implications for treatment, insurance, and outcomes evaluation | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 284 | issue = 13 | pages = 1689–95 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11015800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics and environment ==
According to the theory, genes play a strong role in the development of alcoholism.

[[Twin studies]], adoption studies, and artificial selection studies have shown that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for [[monozygotic twins]] than [[dizygotic twins]]—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins.&lt;ref name="Carlson et al. 2005 75–76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |last2=Buskist |first2= William |last3=Enzle |first3= Michael E. |last4=Heth |first4=C. Donald |title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour 3rd Canadian Edition|year=2005|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-205-45769-X|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males.&lt;ref name="Carlson et al. 2005 75–76" /&gt; Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~engs/articles/gender90.htm |title=Differences in drinking among male and female students: Dr. Engs |publisher=Indiana.edu |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin studies suggest that males are more likely to have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Adoption studies also suggest a strong genetic tendency towards alcoholism. Studies on children separated from their biological parents demonstrates that sons of alcoholic biological fathers were more likely to become alcoholic, even though they have been separated and raised by non alcoholic parents.&lt;ref name="Carlson et al. 2005 75–76" /&gt; Female show similar results, but to a lesser degree.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In artificial selection studies, specific strains of rats were bred to prefer alcohol. These rats preferred drinking alcohol over other liquids, resulting in a tolerance for alcohol and exhibited a physical dependency on alcohol.&lt;ref name="Carlson et al. 2005 75–76" /&gt; Rats that were not bred for this preference did not have these traits.&lt;ref&gt;Lumeng, Murphy, McBride, &amp; Li, 1995{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlson et al. 2005 75–76" /&gt; Upon analyzing the brains of these two strains of rats, it was discovered that there were differences in chemical composition of certain areas of the brain. This study suggests that certain brain mechanisms are more genetically prone to alcoholism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The convergent evidence from these studies present a strong case for the genetic basis of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Born To Do Drugs: Overcoming A Family History Of Addiction |work=DrugRehab.com |first=Chris |last=Elkins |date=2016-06-22 |accessdate=2016-07-11 |url= https://www.drugrehab.com/born-to-do-drugs/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historians debate who has primacy in arguing that habitual drinking carried the characteristics of a disease.  Some note that Scottish physician [[Thomas Trotter (physician)|Thomas Trotter]] was the first to characterize excessive drinking as a disease, or medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, T. (Porter, R., ed.), ''An Essay, Medical, Philosophical, and Chemical, on Drunkenness and Its Effects on the Human Body'', Routledge, (London), 1988. (This a facsimile of the first (1804) London edition. The book itself was based on the thesis "''De ebrietate, ejusque effectibus in corpus humanum''" that Trotter had presented to [[Edinburgh University]] in 1788.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point to American physician [[Benjamin Rush]] (1745–1813), a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] — who understood drunkenness to be what we would now call a "loss of control" — as possibly the first to use the term "addiction" in this sort of meaning.&lt;ref name=auto1&gt;Levine, H.G., "The Discovery of Addiction: Changing Conceptions of Habitual Drunkenness in America", ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', Vol.39, No.1, (January 1978), pp.143-174. (Reprint: ''Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment'', Vol.2, No.1, (1985), pp.43-57.) Available at [http://soc.qc.cuny.edu/Staff/levine/doa.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415000151/http://soc.qc.cuny.edu/Staff/levine/doa.htm |date=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|My observations authorize me to say, that persons who have been addicted to them, should abstain from them suddenly and entirely. 'Taste not, handle not, touch not' should be inscribed upon every vessel that contains spirits in the house of a man, who wishes to be cured of habits of intemperance.|Levine, H.G.|The Discovery of Addiction: Changing Conceptions of Habitual Drunkenness in America &lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;}}

Rush argued that "habitual drunkenness should be regarded not as a bad habit but as a disease", describing it as "a palsy of the will".&lt;ref&gt;Valverde (1998, p.2) {{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rush expounded his views in a book published in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, B., ''An Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind: With an Account of the Means of Preventing, and of the Remedies for Curing Them'', Thomas Dobson, (Philadelphia), 1808.&lt;/ref&gt; His views are described by Valverde&lt;ref&gt;Valverde, M., ''Diseases of the Will: Alcohol and the Dilemmas of Freedom'', Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Levine:&lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;

Swedish physician Magnus Huss coined the term "alcoholism" in his book ''Alcoholismus chronicus'' (1849).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasso Spode]] has championed the work of C. von Brühl-Cramer on addiction (''Trunksucht'') from 1819 to be seen as the first consistent "paradigm" of alcohol addiction. See the discussion in the ADHS Forum in the ''Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal'' 20 (2005): 105-40 where several addiction historians discuss the changing attitudes of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and the origins of their ideas&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue he was the first to systematically describe the physical characteristics of habitual drinking and claim that it was a disease.  However, this came decades after Rush and Trotter wrote their works, and some historians argue that the idea that habitual drinking was a diseased state emerged earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Along with Levine, see Roy Porter ("Drinking Man's Disease: the 'Pre-History' of Alcoholism in Georgian Britain," ''British Journal of Addiction'' 80 (1985): 385-96) who places the idea to emerge with Trotter, Jessica Warner ["'Resolved to Drink No More': Addiction as a preindustrial construct" ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' 55 (1994): 685-91] who uses a narrow reading of 17th century sermons to place it in the 1600s, Peter Ferentzy ["From Sin to Disease: Differences and similarities between past and current conceptions on 'chronic drunkenness'" ''Contemporary Drug Problems'' 28 (2001): 362-90] who successfully challenges Warner's argument by showing that the term "disease" was applied to many conditions that had little to do with physical debility, and James Nicholls ["Vinum Britannicum: The 'Drink Question' in Early Modern England" ''Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An interdisciplinary Journal'' 22 (2008): 6-25] who draws it together and argues that the idea emerged at different times in different places.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this controversy, the best one can say is that the idea that habitual alcohol drinking was a disease had become more acceptable by the middle of the nineteenth century, although many writers still argued it was a vice, a sin, and not the purview of medicine but of religion.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, books with such telling titles as John Edwards Todd, ''Drunkenness, a Vice--not a Disease'' (1882).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1991, medical organizations, including the AMA, worked together to establish policies regarding their positions on the disease theory. These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third-party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease. The policies of the AMA, formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates, state, in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies, including alcoholism, are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.

== Controlled drinking ==
The disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to 'normal' problem free drinking, and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence. Some critics have used [http://findings.org.uk/count/downloads/download.php?file=cont_drink.hot evidence of controlled drinking] in formerly dependent drinkers to dispute the disease theory of alcoholism.

The first major empirical challenge to this interpretation of the disease theory followed a 1962 study by Dr. D. L. Davies.&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = D.L. | year = 1962 | title = Normal drinking in recovered alcohol addicts | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 94–104 | pmid = 13883819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davies' follow-up of 93 problem drinkers found that 7 of them were able to return to "controlled drinking" (less than 7 drinks per day for at least 7 years).

This modern longitudinal [http://www.spectrum.niaaa.nih.gov/archives/v1i1Sept2009/features/alcoholism-2.html study] surveyed more than 43,000 individuals representative of the U.S. adult population, rather than focusing solely on those seeking or receiving treatment for alcohol dependence.

The second RAND study, in 1980, found that alcohol dependence represents a factor of central importance in the process of relapse.&lt;ref name=rand&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R2433.html|title=The Course of Alcoholism: Four Years After Treatment|date=7 September 1980|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among people with low dependence levels at admission, the risk of relapse appears relatively low for those who later drank without problems.  But the greater the initial level of dependence, the higher the likelihood of relapse for nonproblem drinkers.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt;&lt;!--Table 7.8  pg. 152--&gt;  The second RAND study findings have been strengthened by subsequent research by Dawson ''et al.'' in 2005 which found that severity was associated positively with the likelihood of abstinent recovery and associated negatively with the likelihood of non-abstinent recovery or controlled drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm|title=NIAAA Publications|website=pubs.niaaa.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other factors such as a significant period of abstinence or changes in life circumstances were also identified as strong influences for success in a book on Controlled Drinking published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heather|first1=Nick|last2=Robertson|first2=Ian|title=Controlled Drinking|publisher=Methuen young books|isbn=0-416-71970-8|id= {{ASIN|0416719708|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal considerations ==

In 1988, the [[US Supreme Court]] upheld a regulation whereby the [[Veterans' Administration]] was able to avoid paying benefits by presuming that primary alcoholism is always the result of the veteran's "own willful misconduct." The majority opinion written by Justice Byron R. White echoed the District of Columbia Circuit's finding that there exists "a substantial body of medical literature that even contests the proposition that alcoholism is a disease, much less that it is a disease for which the victim bears no responsibility".&lt;ref name="TraynorTurnage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/485/535/case.html|title=Traynor v.

However, the majority opinion stated in conclusion that "this litigation does not require the Court to decide whether alcoholism is a disease whose course its victims cannot control. It is not our role to resolve this medical issue on which the authorities remain sharply divided." The dissenting opinion noted that "despite much comment in the popular press, these cases are not concerned with whether alcoholism, simplistically, is or is not a "disease.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n18_v133/ai_6690283 | work=Science News | title=Alcoholics lose some VA benefits – Veterans Administration | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcoholism is a disease with a known [[pathology]] and an established biomolecular [[signal transduction]] pathway&lt;ref name="Alcoholism ΔFosB" /&gt; which culminates in [[ΔFosB]] overexpression within the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neurons]] of the [[nucleus accumbens]];&lt;ref name="Alcoholism ΔFosB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt; when this overexpression occurs, ΔFosB induces the addictive state.&lt;ref name="Alcoholism ΔFosB"&gt;{{cite web | title=Alcoholism – Homo sapiens (human) + Disease/drug | url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=hsadd&amp;mapno=05034&amp;mapscale=&amp;show_description=y | work=KEGG Pathway | accessdate=6 April 2015 | author=Kanehisa Laboratories | date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 428–437 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25083822 | doi = 10.3109/00952990.2014.933840 | quote = Using control drugs implicated in both ΔFosB induction and addiction (ethanol and nicotine), similar ΔFosB expression was apparent when propofol was given&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB as a therapeutic biomarker&lt;br /&gt;The strong correlation between chronic drug exposure and ΔFosB provides novel opportunities for targeted therapies in addiction (118), and suggests methods to analyze their efficacy (119). Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying ΔFosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker. If ΔFosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cellular basis"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published a detailed report on alcohol and other psychoactive substances entitled "Neuroscience of psychoactive substance use and dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/Neuroscience.pdf|title=Pagetit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that this was the "first attempt by WHO to provide a comprehensive overview of the biological factors related to substance use and dependence by summarizing the vast amount of knowledge gained in the last 20-30 years. The report highlights the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms of action of different types of psychoactive substances, and explains how the use of these substances can lead to the development of dependence syndrome." The report states that "dependence has not previously been recognized as a disorder of the brain, in the same way that psychiatric and mental illnesses were not previously viewed as being a result of a disorder of the brain. However, with recent advances in neuroscience, it is clear that dependence is as much a disorder of the brain as any other neurological or psychiatric illness."

The [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] and the [[American Medical Association]] both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism.  The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognizes the existence of "alcoholism" as the equivalent of alcohol dependence. The [[American Hospital Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] classify "alcoholism" as a [[disease]].

In the US, the [[National Institutes of Health]] has a specific institute, the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA), concerned with the support and conduct of biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States. The official NIAAA position is that "alcoholism is a disease. The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person's lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms. The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person's genes and by his or her lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm FAQs for the General Public&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165736/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Some physicians, scientists and others have rejected the disease theory of alcoholism on logical, empirical and other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Heavy Drinking, Fingarette, Herbert, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-06754-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robinroom.net|title=Robin Room|work=robinroom.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peele, S.

Some critics of the disease model argue alcoholism still involves choice, not total loss of control, and stripping alcohol abusers of their choice, by applying the disease concept, is a threat to the health of the individual; the disease concept gives the substance abuser an excuse. A disease cannot be cured by force of will; therefore, adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the abuser to caregivers. Inevitably the abusers become unwilling victims, and just as inevitably they take on that role.  They argue that the disease theory of alcoholism exists only to benefit the professionals' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services, and the disease model has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use.&lt;ref name="baldwinresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baldwinresearch.com/alcoholism.cfm |title=Alcoholism: A disease of speculation |publisher=Baldwinresearch.com |date=2002-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics hold that by removing some of the stigma and personal responsibility the disease concept actually increases alcoholism and drug abuse and thus the need for treatment.&lt;ref name="baldwinresearch" /&gt;  This is somewhat supported by a study which found that a greater belief in the disease theory of alcoholism and higher commitment to total abstinence to be factors correlated with increased likelihood that an alcoholic would have a full-blown relapse (substantial continued use) following an initial lapse (single use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller WR, Westerberg VS, Harris RJ, Tonigan JS  | title = What predicts relapse?

Lynn Appleton says that "Despite all public pronouncements about alcoholism as a disease, medical practice rejects treating it as such. Not only does alcoholism not follow the model of a 'disease,' it is not amenable to standard medical treatment." She says that "Medical doctors' rejection of the disease theory of alcoholism has a strong basis in the biomedical model underpinning most of their training" and that "medical research on alcoholism does not support the  disease model."&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M.

"Many doctors have been loath to prescribe drugs to treat alcoholism, sometimes because of the belief that alcoholism is a moral disorder rather than a disease," according to  Dr. [[Bankole Johnson]], Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, William [http://articles.courant.com/2007-10-10/news/0710100012_1_heavy-drinking-days-topiramate-five-drinks/2  Headache pill eases alcohol cravings] ''Hartford Courant'', October 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Johnson's own pioneering work has made important contributions to the understanding of alcoholism as a disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/bankolejohnson.page|title=Butler Center for Research – Bankole Johnson, Ph.D., 2001 -- Hazelden|author=1379|work=hazelden.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequency and quantity of alcohol use are not related to the presence of the condition; that is, people can drink a great deal without necessarily being alcoholic, and alcoholics may drink minimally or infrequently.&lt;ref name="MORSE1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Esser2014"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5888/pcd11.140329| title = Prevalence of Alcohol Dependence Among US Adult Drinkers, 2009–2011| journal = Preventing Chronic Disease| volume = 11| year = 2014| last1 = Esser | first1 = M.

'''[[Pregnancy]] when coupled with [[domestic violence]]''' is a form of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) where [[health]] risks may be amplified. Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces many adverse [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological]] effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence in pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.K., F. Haider, K. Ellis, D.M. Hay, S.W. Lindow. "The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 110.3 (2003): 272-75. Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women.&lt;ref name="Stephenson, Rob 2008"&gt;Stephenson, Rob, Michael A. Koenig, Rajib Acharya and Tarun K. Roy. "Domestic Violence, Contraceptive Use, and Unwanted Pregnancy in Rural India." Studies in Family Planning. 39.3 (2008): 177-86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for healthcare workers to screen women for domestic violence though a recent review found that the best way in which to do this is unclear.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahanfar|first1=S|last2=Howard|first2=LM|last3=Medley|first3=N|title=Interventions for preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 November 2014|volume=11|pages=CD009414|pmid=25390767|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009414.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing domestic violence in pregnancy should improve outcomes for mothers and babies though more good quality studies are needed to work out effective ways of screening pregnant women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Causes and triggers ==

Domestic abuse can be triggered by pregnancy for a number of reasons. Pregnancy itself can be used a form of coercion and the phenomenon of preventing an intimate partner's reproductive choice is referred to as [[reproductive coercion]]. Studies on [[birth control sabotage]] performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between domestic violence and birth control sabotage.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"&gt;[http://www.impactresearch.org/documents/birthcontrolexecutive.pdf Domestic Violence and Birth Control Sabotage: A Report from the Teen Parent Project], Center for Impact Research, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of domestic violence for pregnant women is greatest immediately after [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Mezey, Gillian C., and Bewley Susan. "Domestic Violence and Pregnancy: Risk Is Greatest after Delivery." BMJ: British Medical Journal. 314.7090 (1997): 1295. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence can increase a woman's chances of becoming pregnant and the number of children she has, both because the woman may be coerced into sex and because she may be prevented from using birth control.&lt;ref name=Krug2002&gt;{{cite book

|ref={{sfnref|Krug|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been shown between large families and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Krug2002/&gt; Whereas previously it was thought that having many children and the resultant stress of large families increased likelihood domestic violence, it has been shown that the violence commonly predates the births.&lt;ref name=Krug2002/&gt;

==Birth control sabotage==
{{Main|Birth control sabotage|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Birth control sabotage]], or reproductive coercion, is a form of coercion where someone manipulates another person's use of birth control - weakening efforts to prevent an [[unwanted pregnancy]]. Replacing [[birth control pill]]s with fakes, puncturing [[condom]]s, and threats and violence are examples of prevention of an individual's attempt to avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy-promoting behavior of abusive male partners is one method of domestic violence and is associated with unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Miller, Elizabeth, Decker, Michelle, Reed, Elizabeth, Male Partner Pregnancy-Promoting Behaviors and Adolescent Partner Violence: Findings from a Qualitative Study with Adolescent Females.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion itself is a form of domestic violence because it results from unwanted sexual activity and hinders a woman’s ability to control her body. [[Forced pregnancy]] can also be a form of financial abuse when a woman becomes trapped in a relationship because the pregnancy has led to economic dependence for new mothers.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"&gt;[http://irishexaminer.com/ireland/pregnancy-offers-no-protection-from-abuse-123232.html Pregnancy offers no protection from abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended pregnancies are 2 to 3 times more likely to be associated with abuse than intended pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hathaway, L.A. Mucci and J.G. Silverman et al., Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse, Am J Prev Med 19 (2000), pp. 302–307.&lt;/ref&gt; Research among adolescent populations shows females who experience IPV use condoms at low rates and are fearful of negotiating the use of condoms.&lt;ref&gt;A. Raj, M.C. Santana and A. La Marche et al., Perpetration of intimate partner violence associated with sexual risk behaviors among young adult men, Am J Public Health 96 (2006), pp. 1873–1878.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of sexually experienced women 15-19 in Uganda, surveys found that fourteen percent of women’s first [[sexual intercourse]] had been coerced. Of those fourteen percent, the women were far more likely to be having unprotected sex without the use of modern contraceptives and to have had unintended pregnancies within the last six months compared to women who had not been sexually coerced.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Koenig, Iryna Zablotska, Tom Lutalo, Fred Nalugoda, Jennifer Wagman and Ron Gray. “Coerced First Intercourse and Reproductive Health among Adolescent Women in Rakai, Uganda.”&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, over 80% of rural women believe that beatings are sometimes justified&lt;ref&gt;
El-Zanaty F et al. Egypt demographic and health survey 1995. Calverton, MD, Macro International, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most common reasons given as a just cause for beatings is refusing a man sex.&lt;ref&gt;El-Zanaty F et al. Egypt demographic and health survey 1995. Calverton, MD, Macro International, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David F, Chin F. Economic and psychosocial influences of family planning on the lives of women in Western Visayas. Iloilo City, Central Philippines University and Family Health International, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the ability of women to protect themselves from unwanted sexual contact and the consequences of sexual intercourse, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="Violence by Intimate Partners"&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap4.pdf Violence by Intimate Partners] WHO: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the Center for Impact Research on young mothers classified birth control sabotage into two categories: verbal and behavioral. Verbal sabotage is verbal or emotional pressure not to use birth control, or pressure to become pregnant. Behavioral sabotage is the use of force to prevent the use of birth control, or to have unprotected sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
In most cases, domestic violence can be prompted by or intensified by pregnancy, but in some cases domestic violence ends during pregnancy because the abuser makes a conscious effort to not harm the [[fetus]].&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"&gt;Campbell, JC, Oliver C, Bullock L. “Why battering during pregnancy?” AWHONN's clinical issues in perinatal and women's health nursing. 4.3 (1993.) 343. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decreased violence===
Domestic violence does not always increase during pregnancy and can even lead to a hiatus in violence. This phenomenon can provide protection for both the woman and child.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt; Because this can lead to decreased violence, some women use pregnancy as a means of protection against domestic abuse. Since abuse generally restarts after the pregnancy ends, women may get pregnant intentionally to prevent violence. However, since women who have been abused before getting pregnant are more likely to experience violence during pregnancy, this is not a reliable means of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchus, Loraine,, Gill Mezey, Susan Bewley, and Alison Haworth. "Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 111.5 (2004): 441-45. Web. 22 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased violence===
Although pregnancy can be a protective period for some women, either in terms of a hiatus of pre-existing violence, for others it is a risk period during which abuse may begin or escalate. Women with violent partners have a hard time protecting themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexual violence can directly lead to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Heise LL, Ellsberg M, Gottemoeller M. Ending violence against women. Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Center for Communications Programs, 1999 (Population Reports, Series L, No. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Studies consistently indicate that domestic violence is more common in large families.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence, and consequences of violence against women: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt; However, international studies show that 25% of women are abused for the first time during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"/&gt;

In one study conduct by Campbell ''et al.'', women were asked to speculate on why they thought they were abused during their pregnancies. The answers were categorized into four categories:&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt;
*[[Jealousy]] towards the unborn child
*[[Anger]] towards the unborn child
*Pregnancy specific violence not directed toward the child
*“Business as usual."

==Effects==
There are many dangerous effects that violence during pregnancy can cause for both the mother and child. A violent pregnancy is considered high risk because verbal, emotional, and physical abuse all lead to adverse health consequences for both the mother and fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.K., F. Haider, K. Ellis, D.M. Hay, S.W. Lindow. "The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 110.3 (2003): 272-75. Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence during pregnancy has been associated with [[miscarriage]], late [[prenatal care]], [[stillbirth]], [[preterm birth]], fetal injury (including bruising, broken and fractured bones, stab wounds&lt;ref&gt;Mezey, Gillian C., and Bewley Susan. "Domestic violence and pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 104.5 (1997): 528-531. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and low birth weight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Violence during pregnancy also leads to additional risks for the mother such as increased [[psychiatric disorders of childbirth|mental health problems]], suicide attempts, worsening of chronic illness, injury, [[substance abuse]], anxiety, stress, chronic pain, and gynecological problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/ 0014/71240/MPS_GEM_ MDA_ new.pdf] WHO Europe. “Making Pregnancy Safer &amp; Gender Maisntreaming: Response to domestic violence in pregnancy”&lt;/ref&gt; Women battered during pregnancy were more frequently and severely beaten throughout the course of their relationship compared to women who were not abused during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt; IPV also accounts for a large portion of maternal mortality. [[Homicide]] is the second leading cause of injury related deaths in pregnant and post-partum women in the United States&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Public Health, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a study conducted in hospital in India found that 16% of all deaths during pregnancy were a result of partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;Too far, too little, too late: a community-based case–control study of maternal mortality in rural west Maharashtra, India. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found a correlation between domestic violence and increased use of [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Amaro et al. “Violence during pregnancy and substance abuse.” Am J Public Health. May 1990. 575-9&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant abused women are less likely to report abuse or leave their abuser because of added financial and housing security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawc.org/atf/cf/{CE32CB3730BB42828F80EDC059FE3ED6}/DV%20and%20Pregnancy%20Snapshot.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Houston Area Women’s Center. “Dangers of Domestic Violence during Pregnancy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
Certain women are more likely to be abused during pregnancy than others. Women who have been abused before getting pregnant are at higher risk of violence during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"&gt;Bacchus, Loraine, Gill Mezey, Susan Bewley, and Alison Haworth. "Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 111.5 (2004): 441-45. Web. 22 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse is not restricted to a specific socio-economic or demographic group of women or to a specific period in a woman’s reproductive life.&lt;ref&gt;(Hedin-Widding L. Postpartum, also a risk period for domestic violence. Eur J Obstet Gynecol 2000;89:41 – 45. 24. McLeer SV)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the rate of physical violence during pregnancy decreases as household income increases. Women whose total household income was less than $16,000 were much more likely to experience physical or sexual violence during pregnancy than women with a total household income over $16,000.&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. “Physical Violence: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring system [www.schs.state.nc.us/SCHS/data/prams.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partner violence in a relationship increases the chances of unintended pregnancy. A Canadian study that outlined causes of physical abuse identified “social instability” (e.g. low age, unmarried, lower level of education, and unemployment) as a trigger for violence and used unplanned pregnancies as an example. This suggests that partner violence can lead to increased unintended pregnancies which, in turn, increases physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart DE, Ceccutti A. Physical abuse in pregnancy. Can Med Assoc J 1993;149: 1257–1263&lt;/ref&gt; Younger women are statistically more susceptible to reproductive coercion and this may be due to less experience in relationships and, for minors, less access to doctor’s appointments and emergency contraception. Adolescents are especially at risk and [[teenage pregnancy]] is correlated with increased rates of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Young women with older boyfriends are more likely to experience domestic violence.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"/&gt; Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are less likely to use contraception and more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Stephenson, Rob 2008"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
A study done on reporting rates of domestic violence concluded that a woman’s risk of physical and sexual violence during pregnancy is under-reported and underestimated.&lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"/&gt; Each year, over 324,000 pregnant women are victims of domestic violence in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CDC, “Safe Motherhood", U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of countries have sought to statistically estimate the number of adult women who have experienced domestic violence during pregnancy:
*United Kingdom prevalence: 3.4% &lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"/&gt;
*United States prevalence: 3.4 – 33.7% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huth-Bocks AC, Levendosky AA, Bogat GA |title=The effects of domestic violence during pregnancy on maternal and infant health |journal=Violence Vict |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=169–85 |date=April 2002 |pmid=12033553 |doi=10.1891/vivi.17.2.169.33647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Torres S |author2=Campbell J |author3=Campbell DW |author4=''et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">'''Dorothy Tennov''' (August 29, 1928 – February 3, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] who, in her 1979 book ''Love and Limerence – the Experience of Being in [[Love]]'' introduced the term "[[limerence]]".  During her years of research into [[romantic love]] experiences, she obtained thousands of personal testimonies from questionnaires, interviews, and letters from readers of her writing, in an attempt to support her [[hypothesis]] that a distinct and involuntary psychological state occurs identically among otherwise normal persons across cultures, educational level, gender, and other traits. Tennov emphasized that her data consist entirely of verbal reports by volunteers who reported their love experiences.

==About==
Dorothy Tennov was born in [[Montgomery County, Alabama]]. She received her [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Brooklyn College]] and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Connecticut]]. She was a professor of [[psychology]] at the University of Bridgeport for twenty years. In addition to being a professor of psychology she was also a student of the [[philosophy of science]].

She had three sons: Randall Hoffman (d. Nov. 19, 1994), Ace Hoffman and Daniel Hoffman. Since 1986 she lived in Millsboro, Delaware, where she lectured at the local senior learning academy and worked as a volunteer at the nursing home. She was passionate about music, especially classical. She could play the piano, which she did in a local church. She volunteered at the community theatre, Possum Point Players. Tennov died in [[Harbeson, Delaware]] at the age of 78 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.parsellfuneralhomes.com/sitemaker/sites/parsel0/obit.cgi?user=tennov ''In memoriam'' Dorothy Tennov (August 29, 1928 - February 3, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715044926/http://www.parsellfuneralhomes.com/sitemaker/sites/parsel0/obit.cgi?user=tennov |date=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
She was an author of three published nonfiction books, including ''Love and Limerence,'' ''Psychotherapy: The Hazardous Cure,'' and ''Super Self: A woman's guide to self-management.''  Among her other writings were a prize-winning play about life in a [[nursing home]], reviews of books on scientific subjects, presentations at scientific meetings, and essays. Her television credits included a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview with the late French novelist and essayist, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and appearance in a 1998 [[BBC]] documentary, ''The Evolution of Desire''. She participated in Internet discussions on scientific and political topics while conducting research for a forthcoming book in which she planned more fully to analyze the methodologies and philosophies of the human sciences.

==The origins of EMBRACE==

In 2007 [[HPfHR]] was established in an effort to advise politicians on healthcare issues from the point of view of healthcare professionals. They felt that the only effective way to fix the American healthcare system was with a complete overhaul based on science-based guidelines, also known as [[evidence-based medicine]].

The group identified five important parts of the American healthcare system that they felt needed to be addressed in their new system. These included  inefficiencies in medical offices and hospitals due to a cumbersome insurance and reimbursement system; coverage of the entire United States population for basic healthcare services while preserving the quality and feel of the current delivery system of healthcare; promotion and integration of scientifically validated diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into the system so it becomes the driving force of the healthcare system; and depoliticizing healthcare and allowing for a more manageable way to finance it. In addition, the group felt that it was important that the plan was completely portable throughout the country and did not depend on income, age or employment status.

==The scope of reform under EMBRACE==

The EMBRACE system would require a comprehensive reorganization of the entire [[United States]] [[healthcare system]], but would attempt to preserve important elements of the current infrastructure. [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) and [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD) codes that are currently being used to report services and determine reimbursement to doctors, hospitals and other care providers would be maintained. There would also be an attempt to allow doctors and other healthcare providers to keep private offices and clinics as independent businesses.&lt;ref name=article-main /&gt;

The new system would change 4 fundamental things: It would classify diseases and their therapies into 3 distinct tiers,  separate private insurance from public insurance but keep them in the same system, create a politically quasi-independent ‘healthcare board’ funded by Congress to supervise the U. S. healthcare system, and develop a simplified web-based electronic billing and reimbursement system. These fundamental reforms would change many other aspects of the current healthcare system. For example, healthcare coverage would be completely portable from job to job and from state to state and would not be tied to employment.

==The Tier system==

EMBRACE would establish 3 tiers of diagnoses and treatments founded on [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM), and its funding will be tier-specific and separate:

The base level ('''Tier 1''') would cover all medical, surgical and psychiatric therapies shown to be life saving, life sustaining and/or preventative and would cover the entire population “from cradle to grave” without registration, deductibles or fee payments. It would also be completely portable and independent of employment status, economic status, race, gender or pre-existing conditions.

Funding of Tier 1 services would be overseen by a healthcare board (see below) that is in turn funded by Congress.  The method of raising this revenue could be similar to the present funding of Medicare (e.g. [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]]) and Medicaid. Since there will be no requirement for employer-based insurance under EMBRACE, [[payroll taxes]] (indexed to salary), a tax on businesses based on the number of employees (and their wages) or a combination of these could also be considered.

'''Tier 2''' would cover all conditions affecting quality of life and their therapies.  In addition, this tier will include all services of Tier 1 conditions and treatments that do not have sufficient evidence for a Tier 1 indication.

Private insurance carriers would be invited to cover Tier 2 services through a menu of plans developed by the Board that is similar to the [[Medigap]] Plans A to N&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|title=2011- Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02110.pdf|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)|accessdate=2011-05-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085139/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02110.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; now offered through the [[Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]]. Although each insurance carrier does not have to offer all the plans listed on the menu, the plans that are offered by the insurance carrier must cover all the services stipulated by the Board. This assures that consumers (whether state governments, unions, employers or individuals) can compare the price of the plans and can be confident of the scope of their coverage. In addition, if an insurance provider offers a specific plan in one state, it will be required to offer it in all other states; assuring portability of all tier 2 coverage. Except for these two stipulations, the private insurance provider will be free to set their fee (on an individual basis), set deductibles and co-pays and even deny coverage. 
The Tier 2 plans can be broad (covering most Tier 2 services) or can be customized for specific groups: a geriatric plan that covers extended care facilities but not fertility care, a heavy laborer plan that includes chiropractic therapy, or a Workman’s Compensation plan purchased by employers, employees or unions.

'''Tier 3''' would apply to all medical and surgical issues considered luxury or cosmetic (examples are [[Lasik]] surgery or [[Botox]] treatments). Funding for Tier 3 would not be covered under this system (as is true in the current system) and all bills would go to the patient. However, billing would still be made through the web-based universal billing form discussed below.

Pharmaceuticals will have similar Tier assignments as medical coverage: Tier 1 would be formulations and therapies that have good evidence-based data for treatment or prevention of Tier 1 illnesses and would mostly be paid by public funds or be heavily subsidized. Tier 2 would apply to those drugs and therapies that enhance quality of life or have not yet had adequate evidence for effectiveness for a particular condition. These Tier 2 pharmaceuticals would be covered by private insurance or out of pocket. Tier 3 would be for “luxury” items and would likely be ‘out of pocket’.

==Oversight==

The entire health system would be overseen by a healthcare panel known as “The Board”. Although the details of the exact composition of the Board has not been discussed in detail by HPfHR, it would be composed of physicians and other healthcare professionals, public health experts, economists specializing in health care, business representatives, insurance representatives, representatives from the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and representatives of patients.  This Board’s mission would be to promote the health of Americans in a socially responsible and economically sound way. Similar to the “Federal Health Board” proposed by Tom Daschle,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Daschle, Scott S. Greenberger, and Jeanne M. Lambrew, Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis, Thomas Dunne, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-312-38301-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would be a quasi-independent organization resembling the Federal Reserve, which it is hoped would make it less beholden to political pressures. It would be headed by a chairperson who would be appointed to a 10-year term by the president and require Senate confirmation. 
The Board would have oversight of a significantly revised Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and input into the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. It would use the already established [[Diagnosis-related group]] (DRG), [[Ambulatory Payment Classification]] (APC) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The Board would decide which diagnoses and services are covered by Tier 1, 2 or 3 based on the medical importance (using evidence-based data such as practice guidelines developed by expert medical panels, [[Cochrane Library]] database reviews and other sources), public health considerations and economic impact. This would be updated periodically as more evidence and research becomes available. 
When evidence is not available, the Board would have the option to commission the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to direct research focused specifically to use in the Tier assignments. 
Among the prerequisites to the implementation of this system would be delineation of the specific relationships between the Board and existing agencies within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], in particular the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Some reorganization of these government agencies might be warranted to optimize inter-agency interactions. 
To address local variations in health and social concerns, the health Board would establish several local health-boards (possibly in each state). These local branches would not only handle local health issues, but may be used to establish peer review boards to hear ethical and malpractice issues.

==Hospital and office billing==

To simplify claim submissions by healthcare providers ([[physicians]], and [[hospitals]]), a “Universal Reimbursement Form” would be created by the Board and would be implemented electronically using a web-based tool available to hospitals and physician offices. This Universal Reimbursement Form (URF) will be the only form of billing for all providers, will be internet-based and will be simple to use. It will transmit data to a “Central Billing System”, which will decide if the condition/service is Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. Tier 1 services will be reimbursed directly to the provider. Tier 2 services will trigger a search (by the computer) for insurance coverage; if insurance is found the insurance carrier would be billed, if not the patient would be billed. Bills for Tier 3 would be sent directly to the patient. 
To help in cases where there is some question about which tier a particular service will be charged, there will be a “Billing Inquiry” feature on the Central Billing System available to providers and consumers that allows inquiries of tier assignment in advance. 
Although the CBS will be secured with encryption and other anti-hacking devices, the internet platform that the URF is based on will be open-sourced and available for entrepreneurial development. Similar to the open sourced platform of the [[iPhone]], the URF platform would allow for the development of “[[Health Information Technology]]” on a single fully interactive web-based platform.

==Financing the EMBRACE healthcare system==

The budget for the EMBRACE system will be determined by the [[United States Congress]], with one comprehensive bill a year that will fund the entire public healthcare system in the United States. Because the Healthcare Board will have to justify the budget, Congress will continue to have full control on expenditures for the healthcare system.

[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|Sir Edwin Chadwick]]
'''Sir Edwin Chadwick''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (24 January 1800 – 6 July 1890) was an English social reformer who is noted for his leadership in reforming the [[Poor Law]]s in England and instituting major reforms in urban [[sanitation]] and [[public health]].  A disciple of Utilitarian philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], he was most active between 1832 and 1854; after that he held minor positions, and his views were largely ignored. Chadwick pioneered the use of scientific surveys to identify all phases of a complex social problem, and pioneered the use of systematic long-term inspection programmes to make sure the reforms operated as planned.

==Early life==
Edwin Chadwick was born on 24 January 1800 at [[Longsight]], [[Manchester]], to James Chadwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finer|first=Samuel Edward|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|year=1952|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5 |p=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was still a young child, yet to be named. His father, James Chadwick, tutored the scientist [[John Dalton]] in music and botany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schiff |first=Andrew |year=2008 |title="The Father of Baseball": A Biography of Henry Chadwick |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3216-5 |p=25 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered an advanced liberal politician, thus exposing young Edwin to political and social ideas. His grandfather, Andrew Chadwick, had been a close friend of the Methodist theologian [[John Wesley]].{{sfn |Schiff |2008 |p=24}}

He began his education at a small school in [[Lancashire]] and moved to a boarding school in [[Stockport]], where he studied until he was 10. When his family moved to London in 1810, Chadwick continued his education with the help of private tutors, his father and a great deal of self-teaching.

His father remarried in the early 1820s and Edwin's younger half-brother was baseball icon [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], born in 1824.&lt;ref name="Birkett"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-33239318 | title=The Englishman dubbed 'the father of baseball' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=6 July 2015 | accessdate=6 July 2015 | author=Birkett, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18, he decided to pursue a career in law and undertook an apprenticeship at an attorney's office. In 1823, he enrolled in law school at [[Inns of Court|The Temple in London]]. On 26 November 1830 he was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]], becoming a [[barrister]], also known as a court lawyer.

Called to the bar without independent means, he sought to support himself by literary work such as his work on ''Applied Science and its Place in Democracy'', and his essays in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', mainly on different methods of applying scientific knowledge to the practice of government. He became friends with two of the leading philosophers of the day, [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Bentham engaged him as a literary assistant and left him a large legacy.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} He also became acquaintances with [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], [[Neil Arnott]], and [[James Kay-Shuttleworth]], all doctors.

From his exposure to social reform and under the influence of his friends, he began to devote his efforts to sanitary reform. In 1832, Chadwick began on his path to make improvements with sanitary and health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunkley, Peter. |title=England's "Prussian Minister": Edwin Chadwick and the Politics of Government Growth, 1832–1854|doi=10.1086/ahr/95.4.1194 |journal=American Historical Review|volume= 95|issue=4|year=1990|pages=1194–1195|jstor=2163556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformer==
[[File:Chadwick's Bethnal Green Parish map. Wellcome L0009782.jpg|thumb|Chadwick's 1838 [[Bethnal Green]] parish map showing mortality from four diseases]]
In 1832, he was employed by the [[Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832|Royal Commission]] appointed to inquire into the operation of the [[Poor Law]], and in 1833, he was made a full member of that commission. Chadwick and [[Nassau William Senior]] drafted the famous report of 1834, recommending the reform of the old law. Under the 1834 system, individual parishes were formed into [[Poor Law Unions]], and each Poor Law Union was to have a union [[workhouse]]. Chadwick favoured a more centralised system of administration than the one adopted, and he felt the [[Reform movement|Poor Law reform]] of 1834 should have provided for the management of poor law relief by salaried officers controlled from a central board, with the boards of guardians acting merely as inspectors.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

In 1834, he was appointed secretary to the Poor Law commissioners. Unwilling to administer an act of which he was largely the author in any way other than as he thought best, he found it hard to get along with his superiors. The disagreement, among others, contributed to the dissolution of the [[Poor Law Commission]] in 1847. His chief contribution to political controversy was his belief in entrusting certain departments of local affairs to trained and selected experts instead of to representatives, elected on the principle of local self-government.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

===Sanitation===
Following a serious outbreak of [[typhus]] in 1838, Chadwick convinced the Poor Law Board that an enquiry was required, and this was initially carried out by his doctor friends Arnot and Southwood Smith, assisted by another doctor from Manchester, James Kay Shuttleworth. This was the first time in British history that doctors were employed to look at the conditions which might contribute to ill health in the population. Chadwick sent questionaires to every Poor Law Union, and talked to surveyors, builders, prison governors, police officers and factory inspectors to obtain additional data about the lives of the poor. He edited the information himself, and prepared it for publication.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=4-5}} His ''Report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'',&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Finer, ''The life and times of Sir Edwin Chadwick'' (1952) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nOQcDQAAQBAJ  excerpt] 209-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1842"&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report... from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369–372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html| last=Chadwick| first=Edwin | chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web  | location=added by Laura Del Col| pages=|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1839 and published in 1842,&lt;ref name=rh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Richard W.|title=The Aesthetic Interior as Incubator of Health and Well-Being|journal=Architectural History|volume=60|year=2017|pages=277–301|issn=0066-622X|doi=10.1017/arh.2017.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was researched and published at his own expense, and became the best-selling publication produced by [[Office of Public Sector Information|the Stationery Office]] to date.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=5}} A supplementary report was also published in 1843.&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1843"&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

Clowes &amp; Sons, for Her Majesty's Stationery Office| location= London| page=|accessdate=8 November 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

He employed John Roe, the surveyor for the district of Holborn and Finsbury who had invented the egg-shaped sewer, to conduct experiments on the most efficient ways to construct drains, the results of which were incorporated into the report, and the summary included eight points, including the absolute necessity of better water supplies and of a drainage system to remove waste, as ways to diminish premature mortality.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=7-8}} Evidence given by Dr Dyce Guthrie convinced Chadwick that every house should have a permanent water supply, rather than the intermittent supplies from standpipes that were often provided.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=9}} The report caught the public imagination, and the government had to set up a Health of Towns Commission to consider the issues and recommend legislation. Its chairman was the Duke of Baccleuch, and there were thirteen members, including then engineers [[Robert Stephenson]] and [[William Cubitt]]. Chadwick acted as secretary in an unofficial capacity, and seems to have dominated the proceedings.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=8}}

The Commission took evidence from [[Robert Thom (engineer)|Robert Thom]], who had designed a water supply system for [[Greenock]], [[Thomas Wicksteed]], who was the engineer for the [[East London Waterworks Company]], and [[Thomas Hawksley]] from the Trent Waterworks, [[Nottingham]].{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=10-11}} These confirmed his ideas about constant water supplies, and he developed a model which he called the "venous and arterial system." Each house would have a constant water supply, and [[water-closet]]s would ensure that soil was discharged into egg-shaped sewers, to be carried away and spread on the land as manure, preventing rivers from becoming polluted.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=12}} Followed the publication of the Commission's report, the [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed and various city-based branches were created.&lt;ref name="Ashton-Ubido"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick later helped to ensure that the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 became law, to limit the profits that water supply companies could make to 10 percent, and requiring them to comply with reasonable demands for water. This included a constant supply of wholesome water for houses, and a supply for cleansing sewers and watering streets.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=11}}

Chadwick wanted to see his ideas implemented over a wide area, and set about forming a company to supply water to towns, to ensure their drainage and cleansing, and to use the refuse for agricultural production. It was to have the grandiose title "The British, Colonial and Foreign Drainage, Water Supply and Towns Improvement Company", with an initial capital of £1 million, but it was the time of the [[Railway Mania]], and he struggled to raise the finance against such competition. The company when it was eventually registered became the more modest Towns Improvement Company.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=17-19, 27}} Railways continued to dominate the money market, and the company was wound up after just three years.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=30}} Chadwick understood that both water supply and drainage were important, since replacing [[earth-closet]]s with water closets resulted in cesspools overflowing and making sanitary conditions worse, unless there were sewers to carry the waste away. This let to a rift forming between him and Hawksley, who had initially worked closely with him but who later took on water supply projects which did not include any requirement for drainage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=22-23}}

===Public Health Act===
Chadwick's report led to the [[Public Health Act 1848]], which was the first instance of the British government taking responsibility for the health of its citizens.&lt;ref name=rh/&gt; It had been introduced by Lord Morpeth in 1847, with the aim or requiring every town to supply water to every house, which they could do by building their own waterworks or by liaising with water companies, and to undertake drainage, sewerage and street paving projects. Most of its grand aims were considerably watered down by the time it became law, but it established a Central Board of Health, whose members were [[Lord Morpeth]], [[Lord Shaftesbury]], and Chadwick. They were later joined by Southwood Smith, who acted as a medical advisor. Districts could pay for a survey from an inspector employed by the Board, and could then proceed without the need to obtain a costly local Act to authorise the work. Chadwick chose all of the inspectors himself, ensuring that they shared his views on glazed sewer pipes, constant water supply and arterial drainage. They worked enthusiastically, ensuring that districts considered comprehensive schemes for water supply, drainage and sewerage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=31}}

Ratepayers in a district could request an inspector to attend if ten percent of them signed a petition. The Board could also hold an enquiry if the death rate of a district exceeded 23 per 1000, but gauged the level of local support, and formed a local Board if there was support, and withdrew tactfully if there was opposition. By 1853, they had received requests for inspections from 284 towns, and 13 combined water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes had been completed under the legislation.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=31-32}} Relationships with engineers were not always easy, with [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|J M Rendel]] calling Chadwick's ideas "sanitary humbug" and Robert Stephenson stating that he hated the ideas of pipes, rather than brick-built sewers. Even [[Joseph Bazalgette]], who went on to design London's trunk sewer network, spoke out against glazed sewer pipes.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=36}} As time went by, there was growing opposition to what was seen as central control by the Board. The rift between Chadwick and Hawksley had become open hostility, and Hawksley made serious complaints against Chadwick and one of the Board's inspectors to a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1853.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=37-38}} Opposition from engineers increased, and a "Private Enterprise Society" was formed by Hawksley and [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]], with the intent of bringing down the Board. Shaftsbury, Chadwick and Southwood Smith all had to resign in 1854, and the Board did not last for long afterwards. Chadwick lived to see his position vindicated, when the Local Government Board was established in 1871, which led to the formation of the Ministry of Health. Since then, it has been widely acknowledged that public health is a matter of government responsibility, working through local authorities.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=41-42}}

In 1851, Chadwick made a recommendation that a single authority should take over the nine separate water supply companies that operated in London. Although this idea was rejected by the Government, the Metropolitan Water Supply Act 1852 forced the companies to move the intakes for their water to locations above [[Teddington Lock|Teddington weir]], to filter water before it was used for domestic supply, to cover filtered water reservoirs, and to ensure that there was a constant water supply to all users by 1857. This was not achieved until 1899, and Chadwick's recommendation for a single authority was eventually implemented in 1902, with the formation of the Metropolitan Water Board.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=12-13}}
   
In 1852, Chadwick conversed with [[Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn]] in relation to the construction of a sewerage system in Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University, LAC/26/D/61&lt;/ref&gt;

Chadwick's efforts were acknowledged by at least one health reformer of the day: [[William James Erasmus Wilson]] dedicated his 1854 book ''Healthy Skin'' to Chadwick "In admiration of his strenuous and indefatigable labors in the cause of Sanitary Reform".&lt;ref name="ErasmusWilson1854"&gt;{{cite book | title=Healthy Skin: A Popular Teatise on the Skin and Hair, their Preservation and Management |url=https://archive.org/details/healthyskinapop04wilsgoog| last= Wilson| first= Erasmus| edition=2nd American, from the 4th Revised London | year=1854| publisher=Blanchard &amp; Lea | location= Philadelphia| page=|accessdate=8 November 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

He  corresponded with [[Florence Nightingale]] on methodology. He encouraged her to write up her research into the book ''Notes on Nursing.'' He promoted it among well placed intellectuals, making her more visible.&lt;ref&gt;Joann G. Widerquist,  "Sanitary Reform And Nursing: Edwin Chadwick and Florence Nightingale." ''Nursing History Review.'' (1997), Vol. 5, p149-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Chadwick was a commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] in London from 1848 to 1849. He was also a commissioner of the [[Local board of health#General Board of Health|General Board of Health]] from its establishment in 1848 to its abolition in 1854, when he retired on a pension. He occupied the remainder of his life in voluntary contributions to sanitary, health and economic questions.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}}

In January 1884, he was appointed as the first president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]]. Its head office, in [[Waterloo, London]], is named Chadwick Court, in his honour.

While he is well known for his work with the Poor Law and with sanitation, he also contributed to other areas of public policy. These included tropical hygiene, criminal justice institutions, policy regarding funerals and burials in urban areas, school architecture, utilisation of sewage, military sanitation and the education of paupers. He was involved in investigations into child labour in factories, the organisation of the police force, drunkenness, the treatment of labourers on the railways, the building and maintenance of roads, organisation of the civil service, and various aspects of education. Most of these benefitted from his use of statistical methods to collect and organise data, and of the use of anecdotal evidence to support his conclusions. He was involved in a number of organisations, including the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Institute of Civil Engineers]], the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science]], the [[Royal Society of Arts]], the [[Royal Statistical Society]], the [[London Debating Societies|London Debating Society]] and the [[Political Economy Club]].{{sfn |Ekelund |Price |2012 |pp=4-5}}

In recognition of his public service, he was [[knight]]ed in 1889. He served in his post until his death, at 90, in 1890,{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}} at [[East Sheen]], [[Surrey]].

Chadwick is remembered at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] where his name appears among the names of 23 pioneers of public health and tropical medicine  chosen to be honoured when the School was built in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|title=Behind the Frieze - Sir Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890) {{!}} London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine {{!}} LSHTM.|website=www.lshtm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032848/http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also commemorated at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland for the engineering building.

According to Priti Joshi in 2004 the evaluation of his career has drastically changed since the 1950s:
:The Chadwick that emerges in recent accounts could not be more different from the mid-century Chadwick. The post-war critics saw him as a visionary, an often-embattled crusader for public health whose enemies were formidable but whose vision, extending the liberal and radical tradition, ultimately prevailed. Cultural critics, on the other hand, present a Chadwick who misrepresented (if not outright oppressed) the poor and who was instrumental in developing a massive bureaucracy to police their lives. Thus, while earlier accounts highlighted Chadwick’s accomplishments, the progress of public health reforms, and the details of legislative politics, more recent ones draw attention to his representations of the poor, the erasures in his text, and the growing nineteenth-century institutionalization of the poor that the Sanitary Report promotes. Chadwick, in other words, is portrayed as either a pioneer of reform or an avatar of bureaucratic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Priti |last=Joshi |title=Edwin Chadwick's Self-Fashioning: Professionalism, Masculinity, and the Victorian Poor |work=Victorian Literature and Culture |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pp=353–370 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/victorian-literature-and-culture/article/edwin-chadwicks-selffashioning-professionalism-masculinity-and-the-victorian-poor/896F815307412B1ACD57604A503CC6F9}}, quoting p 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such views are not universally held. Thus Eckland and Price in their assessment of Chadwick's economic policies in 2012 can write:
:It is no exageration to note that Chadwick is an almost singular progenitor of public health in the UK and elsewhere. The one hundredth anniversary of his death (1990) and the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the first Public Health Act (1848) was an occasion of serious and deserved plaudits for him in the United States and abroad. His prowess in sanitation engineering has also been duly noted. These excellent works appropriately feature Chadwick's role as one of the two or three most important policy makers of nineteenth century England.{{sfn |Eckland |Price |2012 |p=viii}}

Essiac may cause headache, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, low blood sugar, liver damage, and kidney damage. Allergic rashes are possible. Rarely, serious allergic reactions have been reported."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The exact composition of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains [[burdock]] (''[[Arctium lappa]]''), [[sheep sorrel]] (''[[Rumex acetosella]]''), [[slippery elm]] bark (''[[Ulmus rubra]]''&lt;!--note: Ulmus fulva is an old synonym of Ulmus rubra--&gt;), and [[Rheum officinale|Indian rhubarb (''Rheum officinale'')]] or [[Rheum palmatum|turkey rhubarb (''Rheum palmatum'')]].&lt;ref name=hfi&gt;"[http://www.healthfreedom.info/turkey%20rhubarb%20v.%20indian%20rhubarb.htm What kind of rhubarb root did Rene Caisse use in Essiac tea?] Turkey Rhubarb v. Indian Rhubarb" - HealthFreedom.info. Retrieved 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some formulations may also contain [[watercress]], [[blessed thistle]], [[red clover]], and [[kelp]].&lt;ref name="nci"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | title = Patient Information: Essiac/Flor Essence | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/essiac/patient/page1 | date = July 21, 2010 | accessdate = July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, who claimed that it had been given to her by an [[Ojibwe people|Ontario Ojibwa]] patient she treated.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;&lt;ref name="nci"/&gt; However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or [[First Nations]] remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture. Several of the plants in the mixture ([[Arctium lappa|burdock]], [[Rumex acetosella|sheep sorrel]], [[Rheum officinale|Indian rhubarb]] and [[Rheum palmatum|turkey rhubarb]]) are not indigenous to the Americas, and were not growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario during the time Caisse began prescribing this tea.&lt;ref name=hfi/&gt; The name "Essiac" is Caisse's name spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt;

In 1977, Caisse sold the Essiac formula and trademark rights to Respirin Corporation (a Canadian company and predecessor in title to Essiac Products Inc.), which attempted to commercialize the product. However, the company was unable to show any efficacy of Essiac against cancer. Repeated laboratory tests showed that Essiac failed to slow tumor growth and, in large doses, killed test animals. In a number of studies, Essiac actually ''increased'' the rate of cancer growth.&lt;ref name="nci-pdq"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/essiac/patient/Page2 | title = Questions and Answers About Essiac and Flor Essence | date = February 19, 2013 | accessdate = May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both the U.S. and Canadian governments refused to approve Essiac as a medical treatment. Essiac was instead marketed by Essiac Products Inc. and others as a [[dietary supplement]], subject to much looser regulation and not required to show any proof of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="nci"/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Essiac's purported effect on cancer has been reviewed by several major medical and scientific bodies, including the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA),&lt;ref name=USFDA&gt;{{cite web|title=187 Fake Cancer "Cures" Consumers Should Avoid|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/ucm171057.htm|work=Guidance, Compliance &amp; Regulatory Information|publisher=USFDA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref name="nci"/&gt; and the [[American Cancer Society]].&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; The American Cancer Society states that "Reviews of medical records of people who have been treated with Essiac do not support claims that this product helps people with cancer live longer or that it relieves their symptoms."&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;  The NCI states "Essiac and Flor Essence have not reported clear evidence of an anticancer effect",&lt;ref name=nci/&gt; and the FDA described Essiac as a "Fake Cancer 'Cure' Consumers Should Avoid".&lt;ref name="USFDA"/&gt; Researchers at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] have written that Essiac continues to be a popular cancer therapy despite unsubstantiated claims of its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] | title = Essiac | date = March 10, 2011 | accessdate = December 15, 2012 | url = https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/essiac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cancer Research UK]] also notes that there is "no scientific evidence that Essiac can help to treat cancer or control its symptoms" and cautions that "Essiac may interact with some types of cancer treatment so it is very important to tell your doctor if you are thinking of taking Essiac."&lt;ref name=cruk&gt;{{cite web

With nearly 10,000 members from 121 countries and over 50 National Allergy Societies, EAACI is the primary source of expertise in Europe for all aspects of allergy.

Allergic and immunologic diseases (such as [[asthma]], [[rhinitis]], [[eczema]] and occupational allergy, [[Food allergy|food]] and [[drug allergy]], severe [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]], [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorders]], and [[Immunodeficiency|immunodeficiencies]]) represent current crippling or life threatening conditions, and are a cause of worldwide concern. EAACI’s mission is to provide the most efficient platform for scientific communication and education in the field of allergy and immunology, ultimately striving to ease the lives of patients suffering from these diseases.

In pursuit of our mission, we seek to accomplish the following aims:

* Promoting basic and clinical research

* Collecting, assessing and disseminating scientific information

* Functioning as a scientific reference body for other scientific, health and political organisations

* Encouraging and providing training and continuous education

* Promoting good patient care in this important area of medicine

EAACI is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisation]]. Income is derived from fees; congress and meetings profits are devoted to current activities, research and travel, awards, and initiatives of interest to members.

==History==
EAACI was founded in 1956 in Florence, its Constitution and By-Laws were registered in Utrecht in 1957. Since then, it has grown to become the largest medical association in Europe in the field of allergy and clinical immunology.  

== The Annual Congress ==
This is the flagship meeting of the academy and the world’s largest [https://www.eaaci.org/eaaci-meetings/eaaci-congresses/upcoming-congress.html congress] specializing in the field of allergy and clinical immunology*. A wide range of sessions, including interactive formats, provide optimal learning for all tastes. Attracting in the region of 7000-8000 participants and experts from across the globe, the congress is a key annual event to interact with peers, leading scientists and practitioners over five days.

(*based on 2017 delegate attendance)

== Focused Meetings ==
These [https://www.eaaci.org/eaaci-meetings/focused-meetings/upcoming-focused-meetings.html mid-size events] address particular key areas in the field of allergy, and provide knowledge sharing and training using various session formats, attracting delegates and speakers from around the world. Due to the attendee size of between 250 -1500 participants, depending on the topic area, these meetings also provide an excellent platform for networking with peers over a three day period.

== Allergy Schools ==
These [https://www.eaaci.org/eaaci-meetings/allergy-schools/upcoming-allergy-schools.html training courses] focus on a specific topic within allergy and are built to offer a solid foundation in this area. They are therefore attractive to experienced individuals who are new to the particular field, for fellows in training and EAACI Junior Members, as well as professionals with a particular interest in the chosen topic. Limited group sizes of around 120 international participants enable great dialogue throughout the typically three day courses.

== EAACI Resources ==
EAACI makes available to all members multiple resources namely: journals ([https://www.eaaci.org/resources/journals/allergy.html Allergy], [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/journals/pai.html PAI] and [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/journals/clinical-and-translational-allergy.html CTA]), [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/books/white-paper.html books], [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/bibliographic-updates.html bibliographic updates], [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/position-papers.html position papers], [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/eaaci-newsletter.html newsletter], [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/guidelines/ait-guidelines-part-1.html guidelines] and an open access [https://www.eaaci.org/resources/eaaci-media-library.html EAACI media library].

'''The Feeling Nuts movement''' is a social media campaign created by Check One Two in [[London]], to encourage young men to regularly check their testicles for early signs of testicular cancer.&lt;ref name="Age19102012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mashable.com/2014/10/01/feeling-nuts-testicular-cancer/|title=Celebrities Start #FeelingNuts for Testicular Cancer Awareness|publisher=Mashable|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign went [[viral phenomenon|viral]] when the public and celebrities began sharing pictures and videos of crotch grabs using the hashtag #feelingnuts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/health/feeling-nuts-challenge/|title=Feeling Nuts Challenge for men goes viral|publisher=CNN|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an annual TV event on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a597384/jack-whitehall-to-host-channel-4s-feeling-nuts.html#~pajyBFD1YWvIs2|title=Jack Whitehall to host Channel 4's Feeling Nuts|publisher=Digital Spy|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign involves both [[social media]] and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1318751/|title=Testicular cancer awareness campaign launches comedy show|publisher= campaignlive.co.uk|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Feeling Nuts was created by brothers and founders of Salter Brothers Entertainment, Simon and Andrew Salter after being inspired by Wendy Gough, a mother who lost her son to testicular cancer in 1998 simply because he was too embarrassed to discuss it. Gough has conducted awareness talks in schools ever since her son's death which left a lasting impression on the Salter brothers.&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-feeling-nuts-comedy-night-how-two-brothers-helped-a-bereaved-mothers-message-about-testicular-cancer-go-global-9814829.html|title=The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night: How two brothers helped a bereaved mother's message about testicular cancer go global|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They realised that raising money wasn’t necessary to stop men dying of testicular cancer and therefore created a new currency through social awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Check One Two teams with Brandwatch to launch #feelingnuts campaign {{!}} Charity Digital News|url = http://www.charitydigitalnews.co.uk/2014/09/24/check-one-two-teams-with-brandwatch-to-launch-feelingnuts-campaign/|accessdate = 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', the brothers stated that "young guys don’t want to listen to charities lecturing them so we took a different approach" creating the social movement organisation Check One Two and devising its first campaign 'Feeling Nuts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article4231094.ece|title = The rise of the clicktivists, the new power elite|last = Pattenden|first = Mike|date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' Andrew explained: "Our mission is to empower people to spread awareness of this preventable cancer and change behavior to check themselves regularly. We firmly believe that this social movement, designed to save lives, will get the nation talking about this taboo subject and by using entertainment around the #feelingnuts campaign, ultimately, save lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/23/feeling-nuts-cara-delevingne-ricky-gervais-check-one-two-pics_n_6035406.html|title = #FeelingNuts: Cara Delevingne And Ricky Gervais Lead Celebs Doing The 'Crotch Grab' For Check One Two To Raise Awareness Of Testicular Cancer (PICS)|last = Welsh|first = Danniel|date = 23 October 2014|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2014, Check One Two launched the hashtag #FeelingNuts to promote the Testicular Cancer Awareness Month and encouraged men to regularly check themselves for testicular cancer.

On 12 June 2014, the Check One Two YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Are You #FeelingNuts", challenging viewers to share pictures of themselves grabbing their crotch with the hashtag #FeelingNuts to raise awareness about testicular cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc3VcIiGO7s|title = Are you #Feelingnuts?|date = 12 June 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tipping point for Feeling Nuts arrived in August 2014 when the brothers dropped their trousers in [[Oxford Street]] in London and took a [[selfie]] grabbing their crotches, receiving 4,864 [[retweet]]s and 13,507 favourites on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/check_one_two/status/512223843130540032|title = Check One Two Twitter|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using #feelingnuts, they started a monthly call to action for men to check themselves regularly and then issued an online challenge to boyband [[5 Seconds Of Summer]] and [[Richard Branson]]'s son Sam Branson, who took it up.&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; Soon more celebrities started to challenge each other including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[William Shatner]], [[Ricky Gervais]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/10/hugh-jackman-feeling-nuts|title=Feeling Nuts: Hugh Jackman Helps Raise Awareness of Testicular Cancer|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; chef [[Jamie Oliver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/6025542/Jamie-Oliver-joins-host-of-celebrities-in-testicular-cancer-campaign-TV-special-Feeling-Nuts.html|title=What’s Jamie doing?l|publisher=The Sun|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and super model [[Cara Delevingne]].

In October 2014 the campaign went viral and social media monitoring company [[Brandwatch]] estimated that within 3 months, the campaign had reached at least 750 million people globally in addition to thousands of media stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industry.shortyawards.com/nominee/7th_annual/oIT/feeling-nuts?category=social-good-campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2014 it was announced that the brothers had joined forces with Channel 4 to launch an annual 90-minute comedy TV event called ''The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night'' designed to raise awareness of testicular cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/c4-joins-a-new-movement-dedicated-to-eradicating-testicular-cancer|title=C4 joins a new movement dedicated to eradicating testicular cancer|publisher=Channel 4|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural show premiered on 24 October 2014 and was hosted by comedian [[Jack Whitehall]] as well as featuring comedy sketches from [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[One Direction]] and musical performances from [[James Corden]] and [[Rizzle Kicks]]. The show also reunited [[Martin Clunes]] and [[Neil Morrissey]] for a new [[Men Behaving Badly]] sketch for the first time in over 15 years. The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night inaugural event was a success, easily beating and over doubling the channel’s slot average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/feeling-nuts-comedy-night-peaks-with-900k/5079048.article|title=Feeling Nuts Comedy Night peaks with 900k|publisher=Broadcast|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Food and Fuel Control Act''', {{USStatute|65|41|40|276|1917|08|10}}, also called the '''Lever Act''' or the '''Lever Food Act''' was a [[World War I]] era [[United States|US]] law that among other things created the [[United States Food Administration]] and the [[Federal Fuel Administration]].

==Legislative history==
The act was a very controversial piece of legislation. The act was sponsored by Rep. [[Asbury Francis Lever|Asbury F. Lever]], a Democrat from South Carolina. President Wilson urged its passage as a wartime emergency measure. Some opposed the authority that would rest in the person of the "Food Administrator." Others opposed language that empowered the president to limit or prohibit the use of agricultural products in the production of alcoholic beverages, thereby establishing a form of national prohibition. Senators proposed alternatives, including a prohibition on the production of whiskey alone for the duration of the war. Republican Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] objected to the language that authorized the president to "use any agency or agencies, to accept the services of any person without compensation, to cooperate with any person or persons in relation to the processes, methods, activities of and for the production manufacture, procurement, storage, distribution, sale, marketing, pledging, financing, and consumption of necessaries which are declared to be affected with a public interest."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1917/06/17/archives/lever-bill-before-senate-reported-by-committee-and-battle-may-begin.html "Lever Bill Before Senate," June 17, 1917], accessed March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also had to fight off the proposal of Massachusetts Republican Senator [[John W. Weeks]] to establish instead a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.&lt;ref name="KennedyP123"&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First World War and American Society'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Its official name was "An Act to Provide Further for the National Security and Defense by Encouraging the Production, Conserving the Supply, and Controlling the Distribution of Food Products and Fuel" and became law on August 10, 1917. It banned the production of "distilled spirits" from any produce that was used for food.&lt;ref&gt;David Pietrusza, ''1920: The Year of Six Presidents'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007), 159-60. Congress passed the Prohibition Amendment, which became the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, on August 1, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, faced with complaints from farmers that the Food Administration created under the Act had set the minimum price of wheat too low, Congress passed an amendment increasing that level from $2.20 to $2.40 per bushel. The President's veto out of concerns about inflation and the impact on the British, is credited with producing disastrous results for Democrats in the 1918 elections in the states of the grain belt.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First World War and American Society'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 242-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1919, after the end of hostilities, President Wilson asked Congress to extend the life of the Act to allow his administration to address widespread and dramatic increases in the prices of commodities. He requested amendments to include clothing and to set increased penalties for profiteering. Opponents delayed passage for months while berating the administration for its failure to control prices and then granted the authority the President requested in October. In the House of Representatives, the President's chief critic complained of the administration's priorities: "Where there is one man in a thousand who cares a rap about the League of Nations, there are nine hundred and ninety-nine who are vitally and distressingly concerned about the high cost of living." The Department of Justice launched 179 prosecutions under the amended Act in the first two months following its passage.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coben, ''A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 1963), 160-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:Poster - Food will win the war.jpg|250px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;"Food will win the war"&lt;br&gt;United States Food Administration poster&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Act, an emergency wartime measure, was designed to expire at the end of [[World War I]] or shortly thereafter. It created two agencies, the Food Administration and the Fuel Administration.

To head the Food Administration, the President named [[Herbert Hoover]] who had handled Belgian relief at the beginning of the war and had coordinating food and fuel supplies since May 1917 on Wilson's personal authority.&lt;ref name="KennedyP123"/&gt; As United States Food Administrator he had the authority to fix food prices, license distributors, coordinate purchases, oversee exports, act against hoarding and profiteering, and encourage farmers to grow more crops. He emphasized the needs of America's allies, both those under arms and the civilian populations, for American produce. He encouraged American households to consume less meat and bread.

Wilson issued a proclamation in January 1918 calling upon Americans to demonstrate their patriotism by following Hoover's guidelines. There were voluntary "meatless Tuesdays" and "sweetless Saturdays." Tuesdays and Saturdays were "porkless." Both Mondays and Wednesday would be "wheatless." Compliance was voluntary, though the baking industry, including hotels and restaurants, was limited to the production of war bread and rolls called "victory bread." Initially it was made from at least 5% of grains other than wheat and that amount increased to 20% by February 24. His agency asked households to pledge their support and some 13 million of 18 million did so. Hoover's call for the conservation of the nation's produce emphasized voluntary compliance:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1918/01/27/archives/hoover-decrees-victory-bread-and-cut-rations-calls-for-two.html "Hoover Declares 'Victory Bread' and Cut Rations," January 27, 1917], accessed March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The effectiveness of these rules is dependent solely upon the goodwill of, and the willingness to sacrifice by, the American people. In the last analysis, the success or failure of any plan such as that here outlined rests with the people. We are dependent upon the cooperation of the trades. We have but one police force{{spaced ndash}}the American woman{{spaced ndash}}and we depend upon her to organize in co-operation with our State and local Food Administrators to see that these rules are obeyed by that small minority who may fail.

Part of the rules will be enforced under the Lever Food act; other parts are voluntary, and will depend for their success upon public sentiment. Our experience hitherto has shown a willingness of the vast majority of consumers, and a full co-operation of the trades, to undergo the self-sacrifice necessary to render such measures effective. The small minority who refuse to cooperate should not be allowed to defeat the nation's necessities.}}

Children were organized into the "United States School Garden Army." When eating apples, Boy Scouts were urged to be "patriotic to the core."  Citizens were encouraged to grow "[[victory garden]]s" of vegetables in their backyards and vacant lots. Slogans like "By all means, save the beans" became popular. The Food Administration also fixed the price of a bushel of wheat, the price floor being $2 a bushel and the ceiling at $2.20. One of its posters said: "FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR; DON’T WASTE IT." By the end of 1918, about one-fourth of all American production was diverted to the war effort.

[[File:Oscar Cesare, This may be ordered cph.3a00902.jpg|thumb|January 1918 editorial cartoon by [[Oscar Cesare]] showing the U.S. Capitol boarded up and signs reading, "Closed; no fuel; all business conducted at White House."]]
The [[Federal Fuel Administration|Fuel Administration]] under [[Harry Garfield]], the President of [[Williams College]], directed efforts to save coal. Nonessential factories were closed, and the Federal government had complete control over all aspects of the coal industry including production, pricing, sale, shipment, and distribution. Although the Act also included oil and natural gas, it gave the government less authority over those energy sources and no ability to control the price of oil and gas. Copying the methods of the Food Administration, citizens were encouraged to save fuel with "gasless Sundays," "heatless Mondays," and "lightless nights."

Garfield's most dramatic action was an attempt to speed fuel to eastern ports where ships were idled for lack of fuel. On January 17, 1918, he order the closing of all factories east of the Mississippi. That accomplished his goal, but exposed the Wilson administration to criticism both from its usual opponents and members of the President's own party.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First World War and American Society'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 124-5&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1918, Garfield announced rules to govern the distribution of fuel oil that defined priority classes starting with railroads, then exports to the American armed forces, exports to America's allies in the war, hospitals, and several other classes.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/05/archives/fuel-oil-placed-under-license-transportation-shortage-makes-doling.html "Fuel Oil Placed under License," February 5, 1918], accessed March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In November 1919, Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer]] sought and won an injunction against a strike in the coal industry under the Act. He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President Wilson in the presence of his doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 178-9. On the President's role, see also Kenneth D. Ackerman, ''Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007), 100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Gompers]], President of the [[American Federation of Labor]], protested that President and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]]. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act's provisions.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/23/archives/gompers-repeats-injunction-charge-produces-notes-and-statements-to.html "Gompers Repeats Injunction Charge," November 23, 1919], accessed March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point Palmer asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were [[Palmer raids#Aftermath|frustrated by the Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus Daniels]], ''The Wilson Era: Years of War and After, 1917-1923'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 546-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer used the Act again in April 1919 against 38 of the leaders of a walkout by railroad workers.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 185-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The amended Act's attempt to limit profits was found unconstitutional in February 1920 by a federal court that found its language "vague, indefinite, and uncertain."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/02/27/archives/amendment-that-limits-profits-is-declared-unconstitutional.html "Amendment that Limits Profits is Declared Unconstitutional," February 27, 1920], accessed March 11, 2010; Coben, 303n. The case was United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Company, 255 U.S. 81 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court struck down the provisions of the Act that allowed the Food Administrator to set maximum prices and fine those who violated the levels he set in 1921. That same year, the Supreme Court upheld the Act's imposition of rent control in the District of Columbia, which had not been repealed along with the bulk of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: A Life'' (NY: Pantheon Books, 2009), 851n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
The work of the Fuel Administration ended in May 1919. The activities of the Food Administration declined quickly after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] and all but disappeared by July 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burl Noggle]], ''Into the Twenties: The United States from Armistice to Normalcy'' (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1974), 60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of August 10, 1917, as amended, was repealed along with a number of other authorized-for-wartime measures in a joint resolution of Congress on March&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;1921 by effectively declaring the wartime emergency still in effect at the time as formally over.&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Public Resolution 66-64|Joint Resolution of March 3, 1921]]'', c. 136, Public Res., No. 64., H.J. Res. 382., [[s:Index:United States Statutes at Large Volume 41 Part 1.djvu|41]] Stat. [[s:Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 41 Part 1.djvu/1379|1359]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m-I4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66  Federal Statutes Annotated Supplement, 1921., p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;

Court cases brought under the Act, both before and after its repeal, continued to work their way through the courts.

'''Geatnjajávri''' is a [[lake]] in [[Berlevåg Municipality]] in [[Finnmark]] county, [[Norway]].  The lake is located just north of the border with [[Tana Municipality]], along the road between the villages of [[Berlevåg (village)|Berlevåg]] and [[Båtsfjord (village)|Båtsfjord]].  The [[Norwegian County Road 890]] crosses over the lake on a [[causeway]] and bridge on the western side of the lake.  The lake has a [[dam]] on the northern end and the water eventually flows out into the river [[Kongsfjordelva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Finnmark/Berlev%C3%A5g/Geatnjaj%C3%A1vri/|title=Geatnjajávri |publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition''' ('''GAIN''') is an independent non-profit foundation based in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. GAIN was developed at the [[UN]] 2002 Special Session of the General Assembly on Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GAIN|url=http://www.gainhealth.org/about-gain|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218180509/http://www.gainhealth.org/about-gain|archivedate=2012-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision and mission==

GAIN is an organization driven by the vision of a world without [[malnutrition]]. To achieve its goal, GAIN mobilises public-private partnerships and provides financial and technical support to deliver nutritious foods to those people most at risk of malnutrition.

==Work==

GAIN works with diverse partners – governments, UN agencies, [[non-governmental organizations]], and businesses worldwide. As of 2015, GAIN reached an estimated 900 million people including 330 million women, adolescent girls and children 6–59 months:
51% of these were in [[Africa]], 44% in [[Asia]] and 5% in the rest of the world.

GAIN's collective impact approach in the nutrition sector has been recognised by the [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford Social Innovation Review. Fay Hanleybrown, John Kania, &amp; Mark Kramer "Channeling Change: Making Collective Impact Work". 26 Jan. 2012.|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/channeling_change_making_collective_impact_work}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a model of collaboration that achieves large scale progress in the face of the urgent and complex problems of our time. The ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Business Review. V. Kasturi Rangan, Michael Chu and Djordjija Petkoski "Segmenting the Base of the Pyramid". June 2011|url=http://hbr.org/2011/06/the-globe-segmenting-the-base-of-the-pyramid/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has also recognized GAIN's innovation in pushing businesses to develop nutritious food products for the [[base of the pyramid]].

GAIN supports market-based nutrition solutions in nutrition interventions areas including: large scale food fortification; maternal, infant and young child nutrition; and agriculture and nutrition.

* '''Large Scale [[Food fortification]]'''. Fortification of staple foods and condiments is a proven, cost-effective and simple nutrition intervention to tackle micronutrient malnutrition, or the lack of the essential micronutrients people need to grow and live healthy lives. GAIN works with governments to fortify everyday staple foods and condiments such as flour, salt and oil with vitamins and minerals, like iron, vitamin A, iodine and folic acid, that help prevent disease and encourage good health.
* '''Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition'''. GAIN works to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and stunting, by focusing on the first 1,000 days, from conception to 24 months, and supporting improved complementary feeding practices – within the context of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and continued breastfeeding to two years of age and beyond. The program in 2014-15 reached over 580,000 women and children, with a cumulative reach since its inception of over 19 million.
* '''Agriculture and Nutrition'''. GAIN uses the agriculture value chain to identify opportunities for nutrition intervention at each stage – from food production to storage, processing to distribution, retail, marketing and food preparation. The marketplace is seen as a pivotal entry point for improving dietary diversity.
* '''Business Partnerships and Alliances'''. GAIN tries to build stakeholder partnerships with governments, civil society and the private sector. The work with businesses take place at the global level and at the local level. In developing countries, GAIN works with the small and medium-sized enterprises that play a crucial role in the local food systems.
* '''Monitoring Learning and Research'''. Through this unit, the organization seeks to strengthen the impact of its programs through better design and implementation, based on the review, generation, translation, and use of evidence for decision making. The unit also identifies and addresses priority evidence gaps related to programming areas, with the ultimate goal of informing GAIN's strategy, supporting advocacy and contributing to the global evidence base.

==Programs==

GAIN's program portfolio is based on proven and cost-effective approaches. Programs support large-scale [[food fortification]], multi-nutrient supplements, nutritious foods for mothers and children, and enhancement of the nutritional content of agriculture products.

===More nutritious staple foods for populations at large===
GAIN's [https://www.gainhealth.org/programs/initiatives/ Large Scale Food Fortification Program] aims to increase sustainable consumption of staple foods and condiments fortified with essential vitamins and minerals among populations at large in target countries. Key goals include increasing coverage of key [[micronutrients]] (vitamin A, iodine, iron, zinc, [[folic acid]]) to more than 500 million women and children and reduction of key deficiencies by 20–30 percent. Projects fortify staple foods and condiments including vegetable oil, maize meal, rice, wheat flour, vegetable oil, salt, sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce – relying on business to fortify products and governments to establish appropriate legislation and regulation. The program supports innovative ways of reaching the hard to reach through market-based channels and public distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAIN National Food Fortification Program|url=http://www.gainhealth.org/programs/gain-national-food-fortification-program|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903012217/http://www.gainhealth.org/programs/gain-national-food-fortification-program|archivedate=2012-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good nutrition for mothers and children===
GAIN's efforts in this area support in-country production and distribution of high-quality, affordable, low-cost fortified foods for young children which complement breast milk, and development and improved access to nutritious foods for pregnant and breastfeeding women. The focus is placed in particular on the development of adequate delivery models to ensure access to, and demand for and use of, products by target populations.

===Agriculture and nutrition===
Supporting the production, processing and use of more nutritious agricultural crops and enhancing the quality of staple foods (through improved seeds, fertilizers and milling and storage practices) are two strategies for bringing better nutrition to vulnerable populations in a sustainable way. Taken together these efforts can also increase effective yields for poor farmers and improve their health and livelihoods.

Ensuring that the food system works to improve nutritional value means more than simply increasing production and making sure there is enough food to feed the world's population. Nutritional quality needs to become a measurable objective in agricultural programs, and embedded within the pillars of food security. Strategies for integrating health, nutrition and agriculture are reflected in the [http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/ Scaling Up Nutrition] movement, and are gaining momentum both nationally and in global thinking.

==Building a global nutrition movement==

===Engaging the global community===
A critical component of GAIN's efforts has been positioning nutrition as central to the global health and development platform, as poor nutrition is clearly an impediment for achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. GAIN supports enhanced advocacy efforts at the national, regional and international levels, to enhance the policy environment to reach scale, raise the profile of nutrition and ultimately increase human and financial resources to address malnutrition.

In 2011, as part of its expanded advocacy program, GAIN launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005227/http://futurefortified.org/ Future Fortified], a global campaign to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through support for GAIN programs and related global nutrition advocacy efforts.

GAIN is also a strong supporter of the [http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/ Scaling Up Nutrition] movement (SUN) and, together with the [[World Food Programme]], is a co-convener of the [http://sunbusinessnetwork.org/ SUN Business Network]. GAIN joined with partners to establish the [http://www.thousanddays.org/ 1,000 Days Partnership] and supports the implementation of its programs.

===Building public and private partnerships===
Market-based approaches to nutrition are an essential part of the way GAIN does business. Over 90 percent of food and beverages in the developed world, and increasingly in emerging markets too, are produced or delivered by the private sector. GAIN engages with the private sector to improve efficiency and effectiveness of markets.

The SUN Business Network (SBN) co-convened by GAIN and the UN World Food Programme – is one of the four global networks that support SUN countries – along with UN, Civil Society and Donor Networks. The SBN was established to bring business together behind the SUN Movement and its aim to ensure that all people realise their right to good food and nutrition. In 2015,the SBN surpassed its target of 99 companies,with 160 now making public commitments to improving nutrition,and tracking their progress annually.These commitments range from increasing reach in
broadcasting mobile phone nutrition messages,all the way to providing 60 million people each year with fortified staple foods.In total,commitments from member companies amount to reaching 125 million consumers every year by 2020.The SBN is now supporting ten SUN countries to develop national platforms and strategies to engage business in country-led national nutrition strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://sunbusinessnetwork.org/business-commitment/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110814070133/http://www.gainhealth.org/partnerships/amsterdam-initiative-against-malnutrition-aim Amsterdam Initiative against Malnutrition] (AIM) is a coalition of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Unilever]], [[DSM (company)|DSM]], [[AkzoNobel]], [[Wageningen University]], [[International Cocoa Organization|ICCO]] and GAIN that aims to work with others to end malnutrition in [[Africa]] by 2015 through initially targeting six countries: [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]] and [[Mozambique]]. In [[Kenya]], AIM has initiated a milk fortification project and a market study to get insight into consumer attitudes towards fortified milk. AIM partners have also identified distribution channels for nutritious foods that reach base of the pyramid populations, including safe water kiosks, milk bars, and school feeding programs. The initiative also began supporting the Kenya Nutritionists and Dieticians Institute, to create demand for nutrition through strengthening capacity development, policy and advocacy, and public engagement. Going forward, AIM will increase focus on market insight and BOP consumer aspirations to ensure nutritious products are not only accessible and affordable, but also in high demand.

The [http://www.gainhealth.org/about/global-platforms/#gain-nordic-partnership- GAIN Nordic Partnership] is a multi-sector platform with an ambition to facilitate scalable and inclusive business models that enhance the nutritional value of food in developing countries. It was established in 2014 by the five founding partners: [[Arla Foods Ingredients]], [[Tetra Pak]], [[DanChurchAid]], the Confederation of Danish Industry and GAIN. The platform brings together Nordic companies, civil society, academia and the public sector in a forum for collaboration, action and knowledge sharing. Together, we co-create solutions that address undernutrition but at the same time are affordable, tasty and attractive for low income consumers living on a budget of a few dollars a day. The first focus area of the GAIN Nordic Partnership is the development of sustainable initiatives along the dairy value chain in Ethiopia and East Africa. The goal is to reach low-income consumers with an income of US$2 to US$5 a day.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20111205150801/http://www.gainhealth.org/business-alliance/access-nutrition-index Access to Nutrition Index], which started in 2009, tracks how well the food and beverage industry provides nutritious products to consumers. The methodology was developed by GAIN, and is jointly funded by GAIN, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], and the [[Wellcome Trust]]. The index aims to increase consumers' access to more nutritious products and ultimately contribute to addressing the serious global problems of both undernutrition and [[obesity]]. It will allow food and beverage companies to benchmark their performance on nutrition against their peers, and it will serve as a platform that provides stakeholders – from investors to consumers and policymakers – with information that they can use to inform their decisions and their programs. The index also seeks to promote nutrition as an investible theme within the investment community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About - Access to Nutrition Index (ATNI)|url=http://www.accesstonutrition.org/about-atni|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227080148/http://www.accesstonutrition.org/about-atni|archivedate=2011-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4450">'''Healthcare in [[Tripura]]''' features a [[universal health care]] system run by the state government. The [[Constitution of India]] charges every [[states and territories of India|state]] with "raising of the level of [[nutrition]] and the [[standard of living]] of its people and the improvement of [[public health]] as among its primary duties". [[Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (Tripura)|Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare]] of the [[Government of Tripura]] is responsible for healthcare administration in the state.

The health care infrastructure is divided into three tiers&amp;nbsp;— the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing specialty and super specialty care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5877">The aim of medical [[regulation]] is to ensure that [[medicine]] is only practised by qualified and suitable people. The history of regulating doctors in the UK dates back around 600 years. The earliest licensing procedures were administered by the Church, with professional associations and universities also playing a role. Modern regulation of doctors is carried out by the [[General Medical Council]].

==Early licensing==

The earliest reference to medical regulation in the UK dates from 1421, when physicians petitioned parliament to ask that nobody without appropriate qualifications be allowed to practise medicine. The doctors said that unqualified practitioners caused "great harm and slaughter of many men".&lt;ref name="Raach"&gt;{{cite journal |author=John H. Raach |year=1944 |title=English medical licensing in the early seventeenth century |journal=[[Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=267–288 |pmid=21434148 |pmc=2601475 |ref=Raach}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|274}}

Despite agreement in principle from parliament, little more appeared to happen until 1511, when a statute placed regulation of the medical profession in the hands of the bishops. John Raach wrote that "the Church was apparently considered the one institution whose influence was extensive and potent enough to be effective in suppressing quacks and licensing the members of the medical profession". Raach further suggested that as a learned profession, medicine "could not be relegated to regulation by the average county official". Clerics, often the most highly educated members of society, were better suited to the task. Medicine and religion were also closely entwined: healing had long been associated with the supernatural, while the events of birth and death involved both medics and clerics.&lt;ref name="Raach"/&gt;{{rp|277–278}}

The purpose of the 1511 statute was to eliminate unqualified practitioners, and to that end it provided for a financial reward for those who reported them.

In 1518, the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]] was founded and took over licensing of doctors in London. The College was founded by physicians themselves, meaning that in London the licensing of medicine was in the hands of the profession, rather than the bishop. Various disputes arose between the College, universities, and bishops over their authority to license and recognise each other's qualifications.

As doctors often covered large areas, crossing diocesan boundaries, they often required licenses from several bishops. At some point – it is unclear precisely when – archbishops were empowered to issue licenses for multiple dioceses. In the early seventeenth century, nearly a quarter of doctors received their licenses from archbishops.&lt;ref name="Raach"/&gt;{{rp|287}}

'''Apothecaries Act 1815'''

{{main|Apothecaries Act 1815}}

The Apothecaries Act introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for [[apothecary|apothecaries]], in modern terms [[general practitioners]], under the license of the [[Society of Apothecaries]].

==General Medical Council==

{{main|General Medical Council}}

The [[Medical Act 1858]] marks the start of the modern period of medical regulation in the UK. The purpose of the Act was to create the body now known as the General Medical Council – then known as The General Council of Medical Education and Registration of the United Kingdom. Explaining its purpose, the Act says "it is expedient that Persons requiring Medical Aid should be enabled to distinguish qualified from unqualified Practitioners".

The Act created the position of Registrar of the General Medical Council – an office still in existence today – whose duty is to keep up-to-date records of those registered to practise medicine and to make them publicly available.

The '''1950 Medical Act''' introduced disciplinary boards and a right of appeal to the General Medical Council. It formally renamed the Council to the name that had informally been used for some time: the General Medical Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1950/apr/18/medical-bill-hl#column_913 Hansard, HL, 18 April 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced a compulsory year of training for doctors after their university qualification, a training position which has developed into the current [[Foundation House Officer]] role.

Summing up the Act, the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' wrote, "In future, the GMC will be possessed of wider powers, improved machinery, and a better status, all serving to ensure the continued and enhanced confidence of the profession and the public alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/2/4674/337.full.pdf |title=The Medical Act, 1950 |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |date=5 August 1950 |issue=2 |page=337 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4674.337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medical Act 1983''' provides the current statutory basis for the General Medical Council's functions. The Council is also bound by laws that implement a European directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications from [[European Economic Area]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/about/legislation/european_legislation.asp |title=Legislation: European legislation |publisher=General Medical Council |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi''' (25 December 1977 – 30 December 2009) was a Jordanian doctor and a triple agent [[suicide bomber]] loyal to Islamist extremists who carried out the [[Camp Chapman attack]], a [[suicide attack]] against a [[CIA]] base near [[Khost]], [[Afghanistan]] on 30 December 2009.

==Biography==
Al-Balawi was born in [[Kuwait]] on 25 December 1977.&lt;ref name="National Triple"/&gt; He grew up in a middle-class family of nine other children, including an identical twin brother, and lived in Kuwait until [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's 1990 invasion]] of the country, when the family moved to [[Jordan]]. He graduated with honors from an [[Amman]] high school.&lt;ref name="AP Coerced"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=CIA Bomber Coerced to Work for Jordan Spy Agency|date=5 January 2010|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=9480958|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Balawi studied medicine for six years in Turkey at [[Istanbul University]] and graduated in 2002. He also received medical training at the [[University of Jordan]] Hospital and at the Islamic hospital run by Jordan’s [[Muslim Brotherhood#Jordan|Islamic Brotherhood]] in Amman. He was married to Dafinah Bairak (Defne Bayrak), a Turkish journalist and translator, with whom he had two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011504068_pf.html|title=In Afghanistan attack, CIA fell victim to series of miscalculations about informant|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=15 January 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010|first1=Peter| last1=Finn|first2=Joby|last2=Warrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in the lower-income Amman suburb of Jabal Nuzhah.&lt;ref name="National Triple"/&gt;

Al-Balawi had a history of supporting [[islamic extremism|violent Islamist]] causes.&lt;ref name="WP Trusted"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warrick |first1=Joby |last2=Finn |first2=Peter |newspaper=Washington Post |title=Suicide bomber who attacked CIA post in Afghanistan was trusted informant from Jordan |date=5 January 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/04/AR2010010402150.html |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tagged by the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization of Turkey]] as having a relation with the [[Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haber.mynet.com/detay/guncel/ibda-cci-diye-fislenmis/489751|title=IBDA-C diye fişlenmiş (Tagged as IBDA-C)|publisher=MYNET|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether this information was shared with other intelligence organizations. According to the [[SITE Intelligence Group]], which monitors extremist websites, he was a well-known contributor to [[al-Hesbah]], an online forum run by Islamist extremists.&lt;ref name="WP Trusted"/&gt; He also ran his own Islamist blog.&lt;ref name="AFP Triple"/&gt;

Al-Balawi was arrested by the Jordanian security service in late 2007 and was believed to have been transformed into a [[double agent]] loyal to the U.S. and to Jordan.&lt;ref name="AFP Triple"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Agence France Press|title=CIA Afghan base bomber was Qaeda triple agent: militants|date=January 5, 2010|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ivp6IShp_hcFWMwqs0XccsWEYBDA|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Jordanian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windrem|first1=Robert|last2=Engel|first2=Richard|publisher=NBC News|title=Jordanian double-agent killed CIA officers|date=4 January 2010|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34687312/ns/world_news-south_and_central_asia/|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Western government officials, al-Balawi had been recruited by Jordan's [[Dairat al-Mukhabarat al-Ammah|General Intelligence Directorate]] and taken to Afghanistan. The Jordanian intelligence service is one of the CIA's closest allies in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="NYT Loyalties"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oppel |first1=Richard A. |last2=Mazzetti |first2=Mark |last3=Mekhennet |first3=Souad |newspaper=New York Times |title=Behind Afghan Bombing, an Agent with Many Loyalties |date=4 January 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/world/asia/05cia.html |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to intelligence officials, al-Balawi had been invited to [[FOB Chapman]] after claiming to have information related to senior [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]].&lt;ref name="FT Bomber"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Matthew|journal=Financial Times|title=CIA bomber said to be al Qaeda double agent|date=5 January 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2eafc82-f9c3-11de-adb4-00144feab49a.html|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not closely searched because of his perceived value as someone who could infiltrate the ranks of senior al-Qaeda leaders. The CIA had come to trust the informant, and the Jordanian spy agency vouched for him, according to officials.&lt;ref name="NYT Loyalties"/&gt;

According to a Jordanian report, al-Balawi was an "informant, who offered dangerous and important information which the authorities said they had to take seriously", but not recruited by the CIA or Jordanian intelligence. He was "only a trusted source who went onto the base without inspection" the official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/01/06/Report-Attacker-was-informant-not-spy/UPI-63581262791294/ |title=Report: Attacker was informant, not spy|publisher=UPI|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last Statement==
Al-Balawi appeared in a video released after his death and was shown saying that the attack was carried out in revenge for the 2009 killing of the [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[Taliban]] leader [[Baitullah Mehsud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen| last=Farrell|author2=Reem Makhoul|title=Bomber That Killed C.I.A.

In his last statement issued by the Al Qaeda's media wing [[As-Sahab]], he revealed that Jordanian intelligence was co-operating with the CIA to kill or capture senior Al-Qaeda and other militant group leaders. He further claimed that the Jordanian Intelligence Directorate assisted the CIA in killing [[Imad Mughniyah]], a senior [[Hizbullah]] militant killed in [[Lebanon]], and [[Abdullah Azzam]], senior Afghan jihad leader, as well as assisting them to eliminate [[Abu Musab Zarqawi]], who was the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27777898/CIA-Base-Bomber-s-Last-Statement-The-Raid-of-the-Shaheed-Baytullah-Mehsud |title=CIA Base Bomber's Last Statement.

==Interrogation of Al-Balawi's wife==
After Al-Balawi's death, his wife Defne Bayrak was interrogated for almost five hours by Istanbul Security Directorate (Turkish police).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyazgazete.com/video-haber-atv-defne-bayrak-polise-5-saat-ifade-verdi-haberi-v12774.html|title=Defne Bayrak gave testimony to the police for 5 hours|publisher=Beyaz Gazete|accessdate=25 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304035124/http://www.beyazgazete.com/video-haber-atv-defne-bayrak-polise-5-saat-ifade-verdi-haberi-v12774.html|archivedate=4 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the leaked information, the first question asked during the interrogation was how they had met each other to which she replied that they met in a chat room on a website that she accessed to learn Arabic. It is also said that CIA officials brought a file, containing information on al-Balawi and questions to ask during interrogation, and gave it to Istanbul Anti-Terror Branch Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porttakal.com/haber-sorular-cia-dan-sorgu-polisten-601318.html|title=|publisher=Porttakal|accessdate=25 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Istanbul Security Directorate denied any CIA involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberler.com/emniyet-sorgu-icin-cia-ajanlari-gelmedi-haberi/ |title=No CIA agents came for the interrogation|publisher=Haberler|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she gave extensive interviews to ''[[Newsweek Turkey]]'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/229792|title=The Bomber’s Wife |publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweekturkiye.com/haberler/detay/35331/Donum-noktasi-Irak full interview] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweekturkiye.com/haberler/detay/35331/Donum-noktasi-Irak |title=Dönüm Noktası Irak |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweekturkiye.com/haberler/detay/35318/CIA-i-vuran-Balavi-yi-esi-anlatti|title=Wife told of Balawi that hit CIA|publisher=Newsweek Turkiye|date= January 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.haberturk.com/video/index/40605 |title=Turkish wife of the bomber on live TV |publisher=Haberturk|year=2009|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetport.com/news/117/ARTICLE/16935/2010-01-07.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111212622/http://www.hurriyetport.com/news/117/ARTICLE/16935/2010-01-07.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 January 2010|title=Interview of the wife, Defne Bayrak|publisher=Hurriyet|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Nic Robertson]], CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/20/turkey.widow/|title=CIA bomber's widow: No tears for killed mom |publisher=CNN|date=21 January 2010|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also complained to The  Association of Human Rights and Solidarity of Oppressed People in Turkey about being constantly bothered by reporters.

Her main point during interviews was that al-Balawi never really worked for CIA or Jordanian intelligence, wasn't their agent, and only used them by pretending to work for them. In the interviews al-Balawi comes out as someone who was obsessed about Jihad and felt guilty for not doing anything despite constantly writing on the subject. He was very affected by the occupation of "Islamic lands" by United States. She said that he had wanted to go to the conflict areas before but was unable because Jordanian intelligence strictly controls access of suspicious people to these areas. According to her he wasn't tortured during the 3 day arrest and was given a Quran to read but was prohibited from reading it out loud. She says it is probable that it was during interrogation that he convinced the intelligence agencies and gained easy exit to Pakistan. She denies knowing anything about his connection to intelligence services but admits concealing from his parents that he was in Pakistan and not in Turkey.  She also expressed great pride in her husband's suicide attack.

'''Lactation''' describes the secretion of [[milk]] from the [[mammary gland]]s and the period of time that a [[mother]] lactates to feed her young. The process can occur with all post-[[pregnancy]] [[female mammals]], although it predates mammals.&lt;ref name=Capuco_2009&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the process of feeding milk is also called ''[[breastfeeding]]'' or ''nursing''. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as [[witch's milk]].

In most species, milk comes out of the mother's [[nipples]]; however, the [[monotremes]], egg-laying mammals, lack nipples and release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one [[species]] of mammal, the [[Dayak fruit bat]], is milk production a normal male function.

''Galactopoiesis'' is the maintenance of milk production. This stage requires [[prolactin]]. [[Oxytocin]] is critical for the ''milk let-down reflex'' in response to [[suckling]]. [[Galactorrhea]] is milk production unrelated to nursing. It can occur in males and females of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances such as [[hyperprolactinaemia]].

==Purpose==
The chief function of a lactation is to provide [[nutrition]] and immune protection to the young after birth. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of [[infertility]] (in humans, [[lactational amenorrhea]]), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1026340606252 | last1 = McNeilly | first1 = A.

[[File:Breastfeeding(milkfinal).png|frame|right|When the baby sucks its mother's breast, a hormone called oxytocin compels the milk to flow from the alveoli, through the ducts (milk canals) into the sacs (milk pools) behind the areola and then into the baby's mouth]]

===Hormonal influences===
From the eighteenth week of [[pregnancy]] (the second and third [[Physiology of pregnancy|trimester]]s), a woman's body produces [[hormone]]s that stimulate the growth of the [[milk duct]] system in the [[breast]]s:

*[[Progesterone]] influences the growth in size of [[alveolar gland|alveoli]] and lobes; high levels of progesterone inhibit lactation before birth. Progesterone levels drop after birth; this triggers the onset of copious milk production.&lt;ref name=Mohrbacher_2003&gt;{{cite book | last= Mohrbacher | first= Nancy |author2=Stock, Julie | title = The Breastfeeding Answer Book | edition = 3rd ed. (revised) | publisher = La Leche League International | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-912500-92-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Estrogen]] stimulates the milk duct system to grow and differentiate. Like progesterone, high levels of estrogen also inhibit lactation. Estrogen levels also drop at delivery and remain low for the first several months of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=Mohrbacher_2003 /&gt; Breastfeeding mothers should avoid estrogen-based birth control methods, as a spike in estrogen levels may reduce a mother's milk supply.
*[[Prolactin]] contributes to the increased growth and differentiation of the alveoli, and also influences differentiation of ductal structures. High levels of prolactin during pregnancy and breastfeeding also increase insulin resistance, increase growth factor levels (IGF-1) and modify lipid metabolism in preparation for breastfeeding. During lactation, prolactin is the main factor maintaining [[tight junction]]s of the ductal epithelium and regulating milk production through osmotic balance.
*[[Human placental lactogen]] (HPL) – from the second month of pregnancy, the [[placenta]] releases large amounts of HPL. This hormone is closely associated with prolactin and appears to be instrumental in breast, nipple, and areola growth before birth.
*[[Follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), and [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), through control of estrogen and progesterone production, and also, by extension, prolactin and growth hormone production, are essential.
*[[Growth hormone]] (GH) is structurally very similar to prolactin and independently contributes to its galactopoiesis.
*[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[glucocorticoid]]s such as [[cortisol]] have an important lactation inducing function in several animal species, including humans. Glucocorticoids play a complex regulating role in the maintenance of tight junctions.
*[[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH) are very important galactopoietic hormones whose levels are naturally increased during pregnancy.
*[[Oxytocin]] contracts the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[uterus]] during and after birth, and during orgasm(s). After birth, oxytocin contracts the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly produced milk into the duct system. Oxytocin is necessary for the ''milk ejection reflex'', or ''let-down'', in response to suckling, to occur.

It is also possible to [[#Lactation without pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation|induce lactation]] without pregnancy. Protocols for inducing lactation are called the Goldfarb protocols. Using birth control pills to mimic the hormone levels of pregnancy, then discontinuing the birth control, followed by use of a double electric breast pump for 15 minute sessions at regular 2-3 hour intervals (100+ minutes total per day)_ helps induce milk production.

====Secretory differentiation====
During the latter part of pregnancy, the woman's breasts enter into the ''Secretory Differentiation'' stage. This is when the breasts make [[colostrum]] (see below), a thick, sometimes yellowish fluid. At this stage, high levels of progesterone inhibit most milk production. It is not a medical concern if a pregnant woman leaks any colostrum before her baby's birth, nor is it an indication of future milk production.

====Secretory activation====
At [[Childbirth|birth]], prolactin levels remain high, while the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone, estrogen, and HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels stimulates the copious milk production of ''Secretory Activation''.

When the breast is stimulated, prolactin levels in the blood rise, peak in about 45 minutes, and return to the pre-breastfeeding state about three hours later. The release of prolactin triggers the cells in the alveoli to make milk. Prolactin also transfers to the breast milk. Some research indicates that prolactin in milk is greater at times of higher milk production, and lower when breasts are fuller, and that the highest levels tend to occur between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.&lt;ref name="Cregan_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cregan M, Mitoulas L, Hartmann P |title=Milk prolactin, feed volume and duration between feeds in women breastfeeding their full-term infants over a 24 h period |journal=Exp Physiol |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=207–14 |year=2002 |pmid=11856965 |doi=10.1113/eph8702327|last2=Mitoulas |last3=Hartmann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hormones&amp;mdash;notably insulin, thyroxine, and cortisol&amp;mdash;are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Secretory Activation begins about 30–40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk "coming in the breast") until 50–73 hours (2–3 days) after birth.

[[Colostrum]] is the first milk a breastfed baby receives. It contains higher amounts of white blood cells and [[antibody|antibodies]] than mature milk, and is especially high in [[immunoglobulin A]] (IgA), which coats the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and helps to prevent pathogens from invading the baby's system. Secretory IgA also helps prevent food allergies.&lt;ref name="Sears_2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sears | first = Martha |author2=Sears, William |authorlink2=William Sears (physician) | title = The Breastfeeding Book | publisher = Little, Brown | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0316779241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the first two weeks after the birth, colostrum production slowly gives way to mature breast milk.&lt;ref name="Mohrbacher_2003" /&gt;

====Autocrine control - Galactapoiesis====
The hormonal [[endocrine]] control system drives milk production during pregnancy and the first few days [[postpartum|after the birth]]. When the milk supply is more firmly established, [[autocrine]] (or local) control system begins.

During this stage, the more that milk is removed from the breasts, the more the breast will produce milk.&lt;ref name=deCarvalho_1985&gt;{{cite journal |author=deCarvalho M, Anderson D, Giangreco A, Pittard W |title=Frequency of milk expression and milk production by mothers of non-nursing premature neonates |journal=Am J Dis Child |volume=139 |issue=5 |pages=483–5 |year=1985 |pmid=3984973 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1985.02140070057033|last2=Anderson |last3=Giangreco |last4=Pittard Wb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hopkinson_1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hopkinson J, Schanler R, Garza C |title=Milk production by mothers of premature infants |journal=Pediatrics |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=815–20 |year=1988 |pmid=3368280|last2=Schanler |last3=Garza }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that draining the breasts more fully also increases the rate of milk production.&lt;ref name=Daly_1993&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daly S, Owens R, Hartmann P |title=The short-term synthesis and infant-regulated removal of milk in lactating women |journal=Exp Physiol |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=209–20 |year=1993 |pmid=8471241|last2=Owens |last3=Hartmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Low supply can often be traced to:
* not feeding or [[breast pump|pumping]] often enough
* inability of the infant to transfer milk effectively caused by, among other things:
** jaw or mouth structure deficits
** poor latching technique
* rare maternal endocrine disorders
* hypoplastic breast tissue
* inadequate calorie intake or malnutrition of the mother

===Milk ejection reflex===

This is the mechanism by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple. Suckling by the baby stimulates the [[paraventricular nuclei]] and [[supraoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]], which signals to the posterior [[pituitary gland]] to produce [[oxytocin]]. Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the [[myoepithelial cells]] surrounding the alveoli, which already hold milk. The increased pressure causes milk to flow through the duct system and be released through the nipple. This response can be [[classical conditioning|conditioned]] e.g. to the cry of the baby.

Milk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Once a woman is conditioned to nursing, let-down can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including the sound of any baby. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. However, this and other problems often settle after two weeks of feeding. [[stress (medicine)|Stress]] or anxiety can cause difficulties with breastfeeding. The release of the hormone [[oxytocin]] leads to the ''milk ejection'' or ''let-down reflex''. Oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Some feel a slight tingling, others feel immense amounts of pressure or slight pain/discomfort, and still others do not feel anything different.

A poor milk ejection reflex can be due to sore or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, a history of breast [[surgery]], or tissue damage from prior [[breast trauma]]. If a mother has trouble breastfeeding, different methods of assisting the milk ejection reflex may help. These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mechanoreceptor]]s that are densely packed around the [[areola]]r region. The electrical impulse follows the [[spinothalamic tract]], which begins by innervation of fourth [[intercostal nerve]]s. The electrical impulse then ascends the [[posterolateral tract]] for one or two vertebral levels and synapses with second-order neurons, called tract cells, in the posterior dorsal horn. The tract cells then decussate via the [[anterior white commissure]] to the anterolateral corner and ascend to the [[supraoptic nucleus]] and [[paraventricular nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]], where they synapse with oxytocinergic third-order neurons. The somas of these neurons are located in the hypothalamus, but their axon and axon terminals are located in the [[Pituitary stalk|infundibulum]] and [[pars nervosa]] of the [[posterior pituitary]], respectively. The oxytocin is produced in the neuron's soma in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is then transported down the infundibulum via the [[hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract]] with the help of the carrier protein, [[neurophysin I]], to the pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary, and then stored in [[Herring bodies]], where they are stored until the synapse between second- and third-order neurons.

Following the electrical impulse, oxytocin is released into the bloodstream. Through the bloodstream, oxytocin makes its way to [[myoepithelial cells]], which lie between the extracellular matrix and luminal epithelial cells that also make up the alveoli in breast tissue. When oxytocin binds to the myoepithelial cells, the cells contract. The increased intra-aveolar pressure forces milk into the lactiferous sinuses, into the lactiferous ducts (a study found that lactiferous sinuses may not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramsey|first1=DT|last2=Kent|first2=JC|last3=Hartmann|first3=RA|last4=Hartmann|first4=PE|title=Anatomy of the lactating human breast redefined with ultrasound imaging|journal=Journal of Anatomy|date=2005|pmid=15960763|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00417.x|volume=206|issue=6|pmc=1571528|pages=525–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true then milk simply enters the lactiferous ducts), and then out the nipple.

===Afterpains===
A surge of oxytocin also causes the uterus to contract. During breastfeeding, mothers may feel these contractions as ''afterpains''. These may range from period-like cramps to strong labour-like contractions and can be more severe with second and subsequent babies.

==Without pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation==
In humans, induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in some cultures, and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers.

== Evolution ==

{{further information|Evolution of mammals#Lactation}}
{{further information|Mammary gland#Evolution}}
[[Charles Darwin]] recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands, and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in [[brood pouch (fish)|brood pouch]]es of fish, where they would provide nourishment for eggs.&lt;ref name=Capuco_2009 /&gt; The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early [[synapsid]]s.&lt;ref name=Oftendal_2002&gt;{{Cite journal

As all mammals lactate, lactation must have evolved before the last common ancestor of all mammals, which places it at a minimum in the Middle or Late Triassic when monotremes diverged from therians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Rheede|first=Teun|last2=Bastiaans|first2=Trijntje|last3=Boone|first3=David N.|year=2006|title=The platypus in its place: nuclear genes and Indels confirm the sister group relation of Monotremes and Therians|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=23|issue=3|pages=587–97|doi=10.1093/molbev/msj064 |pmid=16291999}}&lt;/ref&gt; O. T. Oftedal has argued that [[Therapsida|therapsids]] evolved a proto-lacteal fluid in order to keep eggs moist, an adaption necessitated due to diapsids parchment shelled eggs which are more vulnerable to evaporation and dehydration than the mineralized eggs produced by some sauropsids.&lt;ref name="Oftendal_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oftedal|first=Olav T.|year=2002|title=The Origin of Lactation as a Water Source for Parchment-Shelled Eggs|journal=Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia|volume= 7| issue = 3 |pages=253–66| doi = 10.1023/A:1022848632125 |pmid=12751890}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protolacteal fluid became a complex, nutrient-rich milk which then allowed a decline in egg size by reducing the dependence on a large yolk in the egg.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt; The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth.&lt;ref name="Oftendal_2002" /&gt;

During early evolution of lactation, the secretion of milk was through pilosebaceous glands on mammary patches, analogous to the areola, and hairs on this patch transported the nourishing fluids to the hatchlings as is seen in [[monotreme]]s.&lt;ref name="Oftedal2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Oftedal|first1=O.

Another well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the [[crop milk]] of [[Columbiformes|columbiform]] birds. Like in mammals, this also appears to be directed by prolactin.&lt;ref name="Horseman_1995"&gt;{{Cite journal

''[[Toxeus magnus]]'', an ant-mimicking [[jumping spider]] species of Southeast Asia, also lactates. It nurses its offspring for about 38 days, although they are able to forage on their own after 21 days. Blocking nursing immediately after birth resulted in complete mortality of the offspring, whereas blocking it 20 days after birth resulted in increased foraging and reduced survival. This form of lactation may have evolved from production of [[trophic egg]]s.&lt;ref name="Chen2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chen|first1= Z.|last2= Corlett|first2=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5582">'''Margaret Drummond''' (c. 1475 &amp;ndash; 1501) was a daughter of [[John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond]], and a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of King [[James IV of Scotland]].  She was a great-great-great-great-niece of the [[Margaret Drummond (Queen)|Margaret Drummond]] who was King [[David II of Scotland|David II]]'s second queen.

Her death has been the subject of a very persistent romantic [[legend]].

==Relationship with the king==
[[File:James IV King of Scotland.jpg|thumb|King James IV of Scotland]]
She was definitely the mistress of James IV during 1496-97, and possibly as early as 1495. Records show her living at [[Stirling Castle]] from 3 June 1496, and from 30 October to March 1497 at [[Linlithgow Palace]]. Her presence, and a previous similar arrangement for another mistress in the royal houses, was also noted by the Spanish ambassador [[Pedro de Ayala]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Thomas, ed., ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.1 (1877), pp.cxxii-cxxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala later wrote of James IV:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I arrived, he was keeping a lady with great state in a castle. He visited her from time to time. Afterwards he sent her to the house of her father, who is a knight, and married her [to a third party]. He did the same with another lady, by whom he had had a son."&lt;ref&gt;Bergenroth, G., ed. &amp; trans., ''Calendar of State Papers, Spain'', vol. 1, (1862), no.210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the king had a number of mistresses in his time, and this relationship seems to have been shorter than those he had with either [[Marion Boyd (mistress)|Marion Boyd]] or [[Janet Kennedy]].

==Family==
Margaret and James IV had a daughter, Margaret Stewart. She married firstly [[John Gordon, Lord Gordon]], and secondly [[Sir John Drummond 2nd of Innerpeffray|Sir John Drummond of Innerpeffray]].

==Circumstances of death==
It is definitely known that in 1501 she died of [[food poisoning]], along with her sisters Eupheme and Sibylla, while staying at Drummond Castle.  As a general rule, claims of poisoning made in relation to a historical figure who died after a sudden illness should be treated with caution, but in this case, with three people who presumably died shortly after eating the same meal, the contemporary judgement should be accepted.  The three sisters are buried together in [[Dunblane Cathedral]], their graves can still be seen in front of the altar.  This did not cause a great deal of suspicion at the time; standards of food hygiene are unlikely to have been very good then, and cases of accidental food poisoning have happened in any period.

After her death the king paid for [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] to be said for her soul, and continued to support their daughter.

==Murder theories==
It has been widely suggested in more recent years that Margaret Drummond was murdered, either by [[Kingdom of England|English]] agents or by pro-English elements in the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] [[nobility]].  Many believe that James IV was planning to or had already secretly married Drummond, and her death was necessary in order to allow or force the King to marry the English princess [[Margaret Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VII of England]] and [[Elizabeth of York]].  The (comparatively recent) plaque on her grave in Dunblane Cathedral claims that she was commonly believed to be "privately married" to the king, and that she was murdered by Scottish nobles who supported the English marriage.

Furthermore, the "Marriage of the Rose and Thistle", as the poet [[William Dunbar]] described it, brought about the [[Union of the Crowns]] exactly 100 years later, as it enabled their great-grandson [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] to claim the English throne upon the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] through his descent from Henry VII.

Had James IV married Margaret Drummond instead of Margaret Tudor, the Union of the Crowns might never have taken place and Scotland might have remained an independent country. This idea has been the theme of numerous historical novels and popular histories.

Serious historians are skeptical of the theory.  It is not supported by the contemporary evidence, and originates in a history of the Drummond family written by Viscount Strathallan in 1681.  Her death was probably a case of accidental food poisoning, a common cause of death at that time. The idea that James had to be pressured to marry Margaret Tudor is dubious. As Scotland was the less important and poorer country, it is more likely that James IV pressured Henry VII to give him his daughter. It is also clear that negotiations for the marriage had been taking place before Margaret Drummond died.

His guilty verdict, death sentence, and execution were controversial, because he suffered from [[leprosy]] and the Japanese government discriminated against people with leprosy at that time.

On August 1, 1951, a dynamite charge was set in the house of a functionary who supported the segregation of leper patients. The police arrested Matsuo Fujimoto and he was detained at a [[leper colony]], [[Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium]], in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]. He escaped from the hospital on June 16, 1952. On July 6, the functionary was murdered. The police announced that Matsuo had killed him, and shot and captured him on July 12. Although there was none of the victim's blood on his dagger, the police extracted a confession from Matsuo.

Fujimoto's trial was abnormal, taking place in a special isolated court because of his condition. His first lawyers agreed with the prosecutors, and his supporters, including [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonta13.at.infoseek.co.jp/newpage299.htm|script-title=ja:藤本事件|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewed his trials as unfair. Kumamoto district court [[capital punishment|sentenced him to death]] on August 29, 1953, and he was eventually executed by hanging on September 14, 1962, after [[Kunio Nakagaki]] signed his death warrant. 

Later, when Japanese policy against lepers was criticised as unethical, the case came under review. In March 2005, a verification committee established by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] concluded that "Fujimoto's case did not even come close to satisfying the constitutional requirements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/01/pdf/01.pdf Verification Committee Concerning Hansen's Disease Problem: Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medical laboratory scientist''' ('''MLS'''), also traditionally referred to as a '''clinical laboratory scientist''' ('''CLS'''), is a [[healthcare professional]] who performs [[biochemistry|chemical]], [[hematology|hematological]], [[immunology|immunologic]], [[histopathological]], [[Cytopathology|cytopathological]], [[microscopy|microscopic]], and [[microbiology|bacteriological]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] analyses on [[body fluids]] such as [[blood]], [[urine]], [[sputum]], [[feces|stool]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), [[peritoneal fluid]], [[pericardial fluid]], and [[synovial fluid]], as well as other specimens. Medical laboratory scientists work in [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] at [[hospital]]s, reference labs, [[biotechnology]] labs and non-clinical industrial labs.

==Educational requirements==
Educational and licensing requirements vary by country due to differing scopes of practice and legislative differences.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, medical laboratory scientists complete a four-year undergraduate degree program in medical laboratory science or Master of Medical Laboratory science . These programs should be accredited by the Australian Institute of Medical Scientists (AIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aims.org.au/services/accredited-degrees|title=Undergraduate Courses|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Institute of Medical Scientists|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, three-year college or technical school programs are offered that include seven semesters, two of them comprising an unpaid internship. The student graduates before taking a standard examination (such as the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science, or CSMLS, exam) to be qualified as a medical laboratory technologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascp.org/PDF/BOC-PDFs/Guidelines/ExaminationContentGuidelineMLT.aspx|title=Medical Laboratory Technician, MLT (ASCP) Examination Content Guide|publisher=American Society of Clinical Pathology|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many MLTs go on to receive a bachelor of science degree after they are certified, but a few university programs affiliated with a college MLT program to allow students to graduate with both MLT certification and a degree such as the [[University of New Brunswick]]'s Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences program.

Canada is currently experiencing an increasing problem with staffing shortages in medical laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.cfnc.org/Plan/For_A_Career/Career_Cluster_Profile/Cluster_Article.aspx?articleId=mrIsdkdKHN11p9WusrheogXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX&amp;cId=0q3r9oTaRaM7wIWlpu1rhQXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX&amp;sectionId=3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, a medical laboratory scientist must complete a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science or biological or chemical science recognized by the Medical Sciences Council of New Zealand. Once they graduate they must have worked at least six months under supervision, be registered with the Medical Sciences Counsel of New Zealand, and hold a current Annual Practicing Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/science/science/medical-laboratory-scientist/|title=Medical Laboratory Scientist|last=|first=|date=|website=Careers NZ|publisher=New Zealand Government|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
In Ghana, a doctor of medical laboratory scientist (MLS.D) is a professional with a six (6) years professional [[doctorate degree]] in medical laboratory science, the medical laboratory scientist (MLS) has four (4) years [[bachelor's degree]] in medical laboratory science and the technicians has three (3) years [[diploma]] in  medical laboratory science.

The curriculum for the programme include clinical rotations, where the students get hands-on experiences in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad is the pioneer in Laboratory Sciences, College of Medical Lab Technology, (CMLT), NIH, Islamabad offers 2 years F.Sc in Medical Lab Technology (MLT), Previously 2 Years B.Sc (MLT) that was discontinued and replaced by 4 years Bachelor Program in Medical Lab Sciences. University of Health Sciences, Lahore also offering 4 year Bachelor program in Medical Lab Sciences through approved colleges. University of Lahore, University of Faisalabad, University of Sargodha and Superior University Lahore offering 5-years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) Program; Eligibility criteria for 4 years BS Medical Lab Sciences and 5 years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) is F.Sc Pre-Medical.

===United States===
In the United States, a medical laboratory scientist (MLS), medical technologist (MT), or a clinical laboratory scientist (CLS) typically earns a [[bachelor's degree]] in medical laboratory science, clinical laboratory science, or medical technology.  Other routes include attaining a degree in biomedical science or in a life / biological science (biology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.), in which a case certification from an accredited training program is also required.

Common comprehensive Medical laboratory scientist degree programs are set up in a few different ways. 
* In 3+1 programs, the student attends classroom courses for three years and complete a clinical rotation their final year of study. 
* In 2+2 programs, students have already completed their lower division coursework and return to complete their last two years of study in a CLS program.  
* In 4+1 program, students who have already completed an undergraduate program return to complete a year of medical laboratory training. The training is typically completed at a clinical site rather than a college.
The core curriculum in medical technology generally comprises 20 credits in clinical chemistry, 20 credits in hematology, and 20 credits in clinical microbiology.

During clinical rotations, the student experiences hands-on learning in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. With limited or no compensation, a student in the clinical phase of training usually works 40 hours per week for 20 to 52 weeks. Some programs in the United States have had the time students spend completing their clinical rotation reduced due to staffing shortages. For example, in 2015, the MLS program at the University of Minnesota reduced the clinical rotation portion of the program from 22 weeks to 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/november/the-laboratory-workforce-shortage-demands-new-solutions|title=The Laboratory Workforce Shortage Demands New Solutions|last=Scott|first=Kimberly|date=2015-11-01|website=AACC|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a two year academic program ([[associate's degree]]) qualifies the graduate to work as a medical laboratory technician (MLT). MLTs receive training more exclusively in laboratory sciences without the basic science coursework often required by MLS programs; however, there are many MLT training programs that require substantial basic didactic science course work prior to entry into a clinical practicum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/the-hidden-profession-that-saves-lives|title=The hidden profession that saves lives|last=Rohde|first=Rodney|date=2014-02-11|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the didactic coursework may be less for the MLT, the clinical practicum, in many cases, is similar to that of the MLS student's. This equates to MLTs who are well equipped to enter the work force with relevant and knowledge based practical application.  The shorter training time may be attractive to many students, but there are disadvantages to this route. MTs, MLSs and CLSs usually earn higher salaries and have more responsibilities than MLTs.  In 2018, medical laboratory technicians earned an average salary of $51,219, while medical laboratory scientists earned a salary of $67,888.&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.salary.com/medical-laboratory-technician-Salary.html&lt;/ref&gt; An added disadvantage for MLTs is that some institutions will only employ MLSs, although that practice is starting to change due to recent efforts in cost reduction, and due to staffing shortages. 

In practice, the term ''medical laboratory technician'' may apply to persons who are trained to operate equipment and perform tests, usually under the supervision of the certified medical technologist or laboratory scientist. Depending on the state where employment is granted, the job duties between MLSs and MLTs may or may not be similar. For example, in Florida, an MLT may only perform highly complex testing while under the direct supervision of a clinical laboratory technologist, a clinical laboratory supervisor, or a clinical laboratory director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fshgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rules-and-Regulations-2014-NT.pdf Board of Clinical Laboratory Personnel&lt;/ref&gt; This may make it impractical for an MLT to lawfully work in a Florida blood bank. California has similar restrictions on MLTs. To accommodate California's restrictions, the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) developed a separate certification examination for California licensure. However, this exam does not include material covering the areas of immunohematology or microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aab.org/aab/California_CLS_and_MLT.asp ABOR Certification California&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the typical entry-level academic requirement for most MLTs is an associate degree, a 60 credit certificate program exists through military training programs; such as the U.S. Army's 68K military occupational specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/medical-and-emergency/medical-laboratory-specialist.html|title=Medical Laboratory Specialist|last=|first=|date=|website=Go Army|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As in other countries, staffing shortages have become a major issue in many clinical laboratories in the United States.  Due to several factors, including boomer retirement, and inadequate recruitment and retention efforts, the medical laboratory workforce is shrinking. For the decade 2010-2020, workforce needs are expected to grow by 13%.  This translates into about 11,300 positions per year that will need to be filled, with only about 5000 new graduates per year coming out of various programs.  By 2025, it is estimated that the shortage of medical laboratory professionals will reach 98,700 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/04/news/economy/health-care-workers-shortage/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.labtestingmatters.org/responding-to-the-continuing-personnel-shortages-in-laboratory-medicine/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom (UK) there are two varieties of registered healthcare scientist in hospitals - Clinical Scientists and Biomedical Scientists (BMS). There is a strict and formal post graduate training programme for both careers followed by statutory registration for each with the Health &amp; Care Professions Council UK (HCPC):[1], for the safety and assurance of the customers - the patients. They are two similar but distinct careers with parallel but different training paths and different entry requirements.

The role of Clinical Scientists is to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public by practising alongside doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals in the delivery of healthcare. Their aim is to provide expert scientific and clinical advice to clinician colleagues, to aid in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patient care.

'''Examples of the type of work they undertake include:'''

* Advising, diagnosing, interpreting, and treating patients.
* Advising health and social care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
* Researching the science, technology, and practise used in healthcare to innovate and improve services.
* Designing, building, and operating technology for diagnosing and treating patients.
* Ensuring the safety and reliability of tests and equipment used in healthcare.

Trainee Clinical Scientist posts are advertised nationally, usually between November and February on the Clinical Scientists Recruitment webpages where application forms may be obtained and electronic submission of applications can be made. These posts are for the approved Pre-registration Training Programme, designed to prepare entrants for higher professional qualifications, further clinical training and eventual Consultant responsibility.

Clinical Scientist training involves enrolment of graduates (1st or 2nd class honours degree or better is essential due to the high competition for limited training places) into an intensive 3-year training scheme leading to certification and eventual registration before starting the higher career structure. The basic qualification for becoming a Clinical Biochemist, Clinical Immunologist or Clinical Microbiologist is a good Honours degree in an appropriate subject: for Clinical Biochemistry, that subject might be Biochemistry or Chemistry (or another life science subject which contains a substantial Biochemistry component); for Clinical Immunology, that subject might be any life science degree with an immunology component; for Clinical Microbiology that subject might be any life science degree with a microbiology component.

Although not essential, some candidates will apply with higher degrees in an to attempt to improve their chances of selection for training and several universities currently offer MSc courses in Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology which have been approved by the ACB or the AHCS. Full-time and 'sandwich' courses are available, and further information may be obtained from individual programmes, although the level of financial support provided varies, and should be clarified at interview. Some entrants to the profession will already have obtained a PhD, and the training and research experience that this provides is invaluable to the work of the Clinical Scientist. In larger Departments, there may be opportunities to study for a research degree after entering the profession and acquiring registration, but since this has to be fitted in with other responsibilities, it may take some years to complete. It should be clearly understood that the major role of the profession is patient care and that research, management and all the other aspects will come as side issues and not be the predominating factor in the career path. The work of Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of almost every patient admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom is facing a shortage of qualified Clinical and Biomedical Scientists.  The Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Physicians have pointed out the need for increased government funding for medical training programs to prevent diagnostic facilities and medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.darkdaily.com/pathologists-and-physicians-in-united-kingdom-comment-on-how-shortage-of-medical-laboratory-professionals-could-soon-delay-essential-diagnostic-therapeutic-testing-206/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification and licensing==
[[File:Lab tech at microscope 2.jpg|thumb|225px|A Lab tech uses a microscope for a [[Cell counting|cell count]].]]

===United States===

There are currently three major certification agencies in the United States of America for clinical laboratory scientists. They are the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). All three national accrediting agencies will certify scientists in the clinical laboratory as generalist (chemistry, hematology, immunology, immunohematology/blood bank, and microbiology).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanmedtech.org/Get-Certified/MT-Eligibility AMT Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ascp.org/BOCRouteFinder/BOCCertificationEligibility/Index&lt;/ref&gt; The American Association of Bioanalysts and the American Medical Technologists certifications continue to use the traditional designation Medical Technologist (MT), while the American Society for Clinical Pathology has adopted the designation of Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS). Regardless of terminology, these highly qualified individuals serve as scientists in the clinical laboratory.

There are two other organizations that have previously provided proficiency examinations to clinical laboratory scientist. The first, is the US Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/HHS+sets+August+date+for+proficiency+exam.-a04788724 HHS sets August date for proficiency exam]&lt;/ref&gt; The second, is the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA). The NCA was absorbed by the American Society for Clinical Pathology in 2009 and promptly dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.darkdaily.com/single-certification-means-good-bye-to-med-techs-mts-and-clinical-lab-scientists-clss/ Dark Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]] (CLIA '88) define the level of qualification required to perform tests of various complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/clia/ Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical Laboratory Scientists, Medical Technologists and Medical Laboratory Scientists are near the highest level of qualification among general testing personnel and are usually qualified to perform the most complex clinical testing including [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] testing (also known as tissue typing) and [[blood type|blood type reference]] testing.

In addition to the national certification, 12 states (California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia and New York) and Puerto Rico also require a state license. Puerto Rico, in order to provide the state license, requires either a local board certification with a state examination, or any of both the ASCP and the NCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= AN ACT TO REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, Act No. 167 of August 11, 1988 |publisher= LexJuris |date= 1997 |url=http://www.lexjuris.com/lexmate/profesiones/lex013.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont, Washington, New Jersey, Iowa, Utah, Ohio, South Carolina, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Dakota, Delaware, Missouri, and Alaska are currently attempting to obtain licensure. All states require documentation from a professional certification agency before issuing a state certification. A person applying for state certification may also be expected to submit fingerprints, education and training records, and competency certification. Some states also require completion of a specified number of continuing education contact hours prior to issuing or renewing a license.

Some states recognize another state's license if it is equal or more stringent, but currently California does not recognize any other state license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascls.org/jobs/grads/personnel_licensure.asp ASCLS licensing information]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom all clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have had to be registered with the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) in order to work unsupervised, to develop through the careers grades of their profession and to use the protected titles of "Clinical Scientist" or "Biomedical Scientist". The HCPC registers nearly 200,000 healthcare professionals[3] and while success in an approved degree course from an accredited University is sufficient for all other professions, both clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have post graduate training and no approved degree courses. Autonomous assessment of applicants in these two professions with subsequent certification for successful ones, is the only approved UK route to registration for them.

"Clinical Scientist", just as "Biomedical Scientist", is a protected title under the law (there is a £5000 fine for transgressors who fraudulently use the title without being registered by the state). The HCPC can strike people off the register for malpractice in just the same way as for doctors with the General Medical Council (GMC).

Those who are working in "Trainee" positions in the profession are permitted to use the title with an appropriate caveat, for example – "Pre-registration Clinical Scientist", Trainee Clinical Scientist, etc. Alternatively some may use titles specific to the discipline they train in, such as Trainee Clinical Biochemist", "Clinical Immunologist in Training" or “ Pre-Registrant Clinical Microbiologist” which is also perfectly acceptable since it is not implying the protected "Clinical Scientist" title of fully qualified and registered practitioners. It is against the law to formally work with the title of “Clinical Scientist” without professional registration[4].

==Specialty areas==
Many Medical Laboratory Scientists are ''generalists'', skilled in most areas of the clinical laboratory. However some are specialists, qualified by unique undergraduate education or additional training to perform more complex analyses than usual within a specific field. Specialties include [[clinical chemistry|clinical biochemistry]], [[hematology]], [[coagulation]], [[microbiology]], [[bacteriology]], [[toxicology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], [[mycology]], [[immunology]], [[immunohematology]] ([[blood bank]]), [[histopathology]], [[histocompatibility]], [[cytopathology]], [[genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[IVF]] labs. Medical Technologists specialty may use additional credentials, such as "SBB" (Specialist in Blood Banking) from the American Association of Blood Banks, "SM" (Specialist in Microbiology) from the American Society for Microbiology, "SC" (Specialist in Chemistry) from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or "SH" (Specialist in Hematology) from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). These additional notations may be appended to the base credential, for example, "MLS(ASCP)SBB".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ascp.org/PDF/BOC-PDFs/procedures/Citation-of-Credentials.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Additional information can be found in the ASCP Procedures for Examination &amp; Certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ascp.org/pdf/boc-pdfs/procedures/examination-procedures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrology Laboratory Scientist, Embryology Laboratory Scientist, and Molecular Diagnostics Technologist certifications are provided by the American Association of Bioanalysts; those with the certifications are classified as ALS(AAB), ELS(AAB), and MDxT(AAB) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aab.org/aab/Certification-Qualifications.asp|title=BOR Certification/Qualifications - ABOR|website=ABOR|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certified Histocompatibility Associate, Certified Histocompatibility Technologist, Certified Histocompatibility Specialist, and Diplomate of the ABHI are titles granted by the American Board of Hisocompatibility and Immunogenetics after meeting education and experience requirements and passing the required examination; those individuals would hold the credentials CHA(ABHI), CHT(ABHI), CHS(AHBI), and D(ABHI) upon passing the corresponding examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aab.org/aab/Certification-Qualifications.asp|title=BOR Certification/Qualifications - ABOR|website=ABOR|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashi-hla.org/images/uploads/ABHIhandbookJanuary2015CM1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Medical Laboratory Scientists can be certified and employed in [[infection control]]. These professionals monitor and report infectious disease findings to help limit [[iatrogenic]] and [[nosocomial infections]]. They may also educate other healthcare workers about such problems and ways to minimize them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbic.org/certification/candidate-handbook/eligibility-requirements Infection Control Certification&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the number of Clinical Scientists in a pathology discipline are typically greater, where less medically qualified pathologists train as consultants. Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Immunology and Genomic Medicine are specialities with an abundance of UK Clinical Scientists, and where the role is well established. Infection services in the United Kingdom are generally undertaken by medically qualified Microbiologists, who may have overall responsibility for laboratory services in addition to Infection Prevention and Control responsibilities, and may be required to contribute to ward rounds and patient clinics. Therefore, the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians have developed Combined Infection Training[10], that medical trainees gain a much more patient focused experience, and undertake Physician examinations in addition to Pathology training. The end result of this is that several regional medical deaneries no longer permit Medical Doctors to train in Microbiology or Virology as single disciplines, and instead advocate dual-specialisation as Infectious Disease/Microbiology or Infectious Disease/Virology [11]. Simultaneously the expansion of higher specialist scientist trainees in microbiology mean that many of the laboratory and scientific responsibilities of medical doctors may be taken on my Clinical Scientists, and medical doctors will instead be expected to perform a much more patient facing role. The exception in Microbiology is the sub-discipline of Virology, which is well suited to the expertise of clinical scientists due to reliance on cutting edge scientific methods, increasing use of specialised genetic technologies, and a technical understanding of virus biology, with a reduced emphasis on patient management compared with Microbiology as a whole[12].

It is therefore likely that many patients in UK hospitals may come into contact with Clinical Scientists working in a patient facing speciality, who may be confused with medical doctors due to the complex nature of their role.

== Further education ==
As in many healthcare professions, a Medical Laboratory Scientist may pursue higher education to advance or further specialize in their career.
*[[Master of Science]], [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Health Administration]], [[Doctor of medical laboratory science]] for specialization, education and management roles.
*[[Pathologists' assistant]]
*[[Doctor of Philosophy]] for management and directorship roles in the clinical laboratory as well as for academic research and professorship.  Doctors of Philosophy holding a degree in a biological science, and who are board certified by a CLIA-approved entity, are qualified as a medical laboratory director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certification Boards for Laboratory Directors of High Complexity Testing|url=https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Certification_Boards_Laboratory_Directors.html|website=cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of clinical laboratory Science - this is the position that qualifies an individual to oversee or direct almost all types of clinical laboratories. Under U.S. CLIA laws, a requirement of at least year of clinical laboratory experience (any MD) or pathology residency must be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012        ANNUAL  EDUCATION          CONFERENCE © Copyright, The Joint Commission  Lab Central Connect  –   1  CLIA Required Personnel  Qualifications|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/CLIA_required_personnel_qualifications.pdf|website=jointcommission.org|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom The Modernising Scientific Careers (MSC) programme sets out for the first time a comprehensive training and career framework for the whole healthcare science workforce inclusive of the more than 50 different scientific professional specialisms. In its conception it aimed to provide a coherent framework that was accessible, affordable and designed specifically to both capture scientific and technological advances and to provide improved outcomes for patients, the service and professionals. A key aspect of the framework from the start was the formalisation of training to develop talented clinical scientists to undertake quality assured Higher Specialist Scientist Training (HSST) programmes to prepare them for roles as Consultant Clinical Scientists. It is envisaged that Consultant Clinical Scientists will work synergistically and in partnership with their medical colleagues and within multiprofessional clinical teams to support clinical scientific practice aimed at quality improvement, innovation and world-class outcomes for patients. This scientific expertise and leadership will provide important benefits and added value to patients and to the service as it moves forward through the 21st century. This will bring to fruition the vision of science and realise the potential of scientific and technological advances for both translational and personalised medicine.

Training through the Higher Specialist Scientist Training pathway is discipline specific. For life science disciplines (Immunology, Microbiology, Virology, Haematology, Biochemistry) the training curriculum and formal examinations are administered by the Royal College of Pathologists. The life science training pathway for Clinical Scientists follows a similar pathway to that undertaken by medically qualified specialist registrars in pathology. Clinical Scientists are therefore the only discipline of non-medical healthcare professionals examined by a Medical Royal College. Clinical Scientists who attain both part 1 examination certification and part 2 certification are awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and are deemed to have the knowledge and expertise expected of a consultant level scientist. Consultant Clinical Scientist posts generally require candidates to have completed FRCPath qualification to be eligible.

All Clinical Scientists regardless of seniority or specialisation may have other responsibilities including academic appointments, responsibilities as clinical lead for a pathology service, or may have wider hospital responsibilities such as Directorship of Infection Prevention and Control, or responsibility for the hospital's Research and Development strategy. Junior clinical scientists may become involved in academic research, working towards award of a Ph.D. or DClinSci

==Job duties==
[[File:Lab tech.JPG|thumb|200px|MLS in his work environment]]
Medical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests – from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325091551/http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx |date=March 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical Laboratory Scientist analyzes human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician.

Medical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, "STAT" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results.

A typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP), electrolyte panel, [[liver function tests]] (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), [[urinalysis]], coagulation profile, lipid profile, [[blood type]], semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine [[Microbiology|cultures]]. In some facilities that have few [[phlebotomist]]s, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training.

Because medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter-relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings.

In the United Kingdom and the United States, senior laboratory scientists, who are typically post-doctoral scientists, take on significantly greater clinical responsibilities in the laboratory. In the United States these scientists may function in the role of clinical laboratory directors, while in the United Kingdom they are known as consultant clinical scientists.

Though clinical scientists have existed in the UK National Health Service for ~60 years, the introduction of formally trained and accredited consultant level clinical scientists is relatively new, and was introduced as part of the new Modernising Scientific Careers framework.

Consultant clinical scientists are expected to provide expert scientific and clinical leadership alongside and, at the same level as, medical consultant colleagues. While specialists in healthcare science will follow protocols, procedures and clinical guidelines, consultant clinical scientists will help shape future guidelines and the implementation of new and emerging technologies to help advance patient care.

==Role in the healthcare process==
A Medical Laboratory Scientist's role is to provide accurate laboratory results in a timely manner. An estimated 70 percent of all decisions regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatment, hospital admission and discharge are based on laboratory test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acla.com/importance-of-clinical-lab-testing-highlighted-during-medical-lab-professionals-week/|title=Importance of Clinical Lab Testing Highlighted During Medical Lab Professionals Week|last=|first=|date=2014-04-17|website=American Clinical Laboratory Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in the United Kingdom, Healthcare Scientists including Clinical Scientists may intervene throughout entire care pathways from diagnostic tests to therapeutic treatments and rehabilitation.  Although this workforce comprises approximately 5% of the healthcare workforce in the UK, their work underpins 80% of all diagnoses and clinical decisions made.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/careers-in-healthcare-science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job title==
[[File:Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg|thumb|right|Russian MLS prepares the analyses in ELISA laboratory]]
The informal abbreviations of job titles may be a source of confusion. In the United States Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) and Medical Technologists (AMT) or (AAB) are often called "med techs" (based on the era in which they were known as "medical technologists"), but this shorthand term is shared by other healthcare employees, including [[pharmacy technician|pharmacy techs]], [[radiographers]] (also known as radiologic technologists), and [[respiratory therapists]].

In the United States there is a formal distinction between an MLT and a MT/MLS. Often, MT/MLS have at least a bachelor's degree, while MLT have an associate degree. However, due to grandfathering rules and certification requirements between the boards of registry, some MT/MLS may only have an associate degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists and technologists generally earn a higher income than technicians, have more responsibilities, and have more opportunities for advancement.

In the United Kingdom, there are defined training pathways leading to professional registration as either a Clinical Scientist, or as a Biomedical Scientist. The role descriptions for these healthcare scientists are very different, where clinical scientists generally undertake non-routine research and development, as well as improving and providing clinical service using scientific expertise. Biomedical Scientists in the United Kingdom are similar to the role of MLT and MT/CLS described above, and have similar regulatory requirements for professional regulation. Clinical Scientists in the United Kingdom may struggle with a lack of professional recognition. This is in part due to the myriad job titles used to describe them including Clinical Physiologists, Medical Physicists, and Clinical Biochemists, which generally mean the public and other healthcare workers assume Clinical Scientists to be medically qualified doctors, due to the sometimes complex nature of the role.

[[Fly-in fly-out]] (FIFO) work practices in [[Australia]] occur amongst various professions primarily associated within the [[Resources Industry Development Board|resources industry]] as well as medical and related health services. Following the recession of the 1980s, Australia has experienced a resources boom that has seen thousands of families impacted by FIFO work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fly-in fly-out workforce practices in Australia: The effects on children and family relationships - History and definitions {{!}} Child Family Community Australia|url = https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/fly-fly-out-workforce-practices-Australia-effects/history-and-definitions|website = aifs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FIFO lifestyle often sees workers on a scheduled roster flying to remote locations. Workers live in serviced accommodation, working long days.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

While working in the [[mining]] and resource sector is financially rewarding, the type of lifestyle it leads is far different than the life workers have at home. As a result of this type of work, there is an impact on individuals, couples and family units that can account for the [[Mental health|emotional health]] and [[well-being]] seen in workers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;[[File:Strip coal mining.jpg|thumb|The multibillion-dollar Galilee basin coal mine, rail and port development in Queensland]]

== Background of mining in Australia ==
Australia is one of the leading mining nations in the world, with large scale extraction of [[mineral sands]], [[brown coal]], [[nickel]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australia's Identified Mineral Resources - Geoscience Australia|url = http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources/aimr|website = www.ga.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in worldwide demand for resources have resulted in Australia's annual mining production has more than doubling in the 20 years up to 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; There are approximately 365 operating mines in Australia, and as for the employment of up to 269,000 people, the mining and resource industry contributes 121.5 billion dollars to the economy. Thus plays a significant role to Australia’s wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mining’ year book Australia, 2012|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Mining%20Industry~150|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of mental health in workers ==
[[Mental health]] has been described by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] (WHO) as “a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises his or her potential, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Mental health: a state of well-being|url = http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014). It is acknowledged that people working in rural and remote mining and resource operations confront psychological and emotional demands that will create unique challenges for both men and women. [[File:WHO.svg|thumb|The World Health Organization (WHO) logo. The organisation was officially established in 1948 by the United Nations]]The key mental health issues across the resource mining sector includes feelings such as isolation and loneliness, due to the remoteness of living on-site and from family and friends.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Submission to the Health and Education Standing Committee of the Legislative Assembly Inquiry into mental illness in Fly-In FlyOut workers|last = Vojnović|first = Philippa|publisher = FIFO Australian Community of Excellence|year = 2014|isbn = |location = Perth, Australia.|pages = 5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stress (psychological)|Stress]], [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] are major factors which are likely to influence employment performance and antisocial conduct. This is predicted to get worse for some people during the transition period from home to work, and can potentially increase the risk of [[self-harm]] and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Types of stress experience in FIFO workers ===
Along with the stresses of being away from home, other stresses FIFO workers experience include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = FIFO/DIDO Mental Health Research Report 2013|last = |first = |publisher = Lifeline WA|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Western Australia|pages = 77|url = http://www.lifelinewa.org.au/download/FIFO+DIDO+Mental+Health+Research+Report+2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On-site physical exertion and fatigue
* On-site extreme heat
* Staying hydrated 
* Adapting to night shifts and between day and night shifts
* Job insecurity
* Following on-site safety rules
* Transitioning back home
* Maintaining home (i.e. gardens, bills) during work absences
* Minimal communication and/or internet access on some sites

=== Factors influencing FIFO mental health and suicide ===
* Employment, living and working conditions
* Physical health, fatigue and sleep problems
* Family imbalance
* Substance misuse 
* Financial issues 
* Domestic violence 
* Sexual health issues 
* Male dominance in workplace culture 
* Non effective coping strategies

== Challenges of the FIFO work system ==

=== Rosters and fatigue ===
The FIFO lifestyle is based upon a roster, typically a fortnight on and one week off. However, more remote mining sites require month on and month off rosters, attributable to the incremented time and costs of flying to and from remote areas. As expected, FIFO workers are implemented work long shifts, usually ranging from 12- up to 18-hour shifts.

As reported by Meredith, Rush &amp; Robinson (2014) it is notable that the longer work length than to time on leave has more deleterious effects on the workers' wellbeing and can lead to a vulnerable mental state.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Inquiry into mental health impacts of fly-in, fly-out worker arrangements|last = |first = |publisher = Australian Association of Social Workers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = West Perth, Australia|pages = 4–5|url = http://www.aasw.asn.au/document/item/7666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical health allows for a positive mental health as well as the capability to handle the demands of FIFO work. The length of 12 hour or more shifts with short breaks, make is arduous for workers to relax and involve themselves in effective coping strategies such as getting enough sleep, exercising and socialising, in dealing with daily stresses. In conclusion occupational [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] may occur as frequent recovery is confined.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

=== Workplace culture ===
On-site mining workplace culture is considered a problem in reinforcing positive mental health and seeking support behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Unfortunately many workers do not seek formal help due to the general outlook held by the wider population of fear and stigma in seeking support for mental health issues.

Male dominancy significantly contributes to the mining workplace culture, where females may experience tensions fitting within the FIFO civilisation. The masculine culture consequently effects the relationships with other workers, negative feelings suppression or [[bullying]] behavior that is a negative subside of poor mental health.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Commendations include creating a fair and just workplace environment for both men and women, for instance The Australian Mines and Metal Sodality are taking action to improve the amount of women to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Workers who do not seek emotional support may experience adverse impacts and result in poor work output and increased isolation. An organisational culture is vital, in order to proposer relevant approaches for workers in acknowledging when to seek help.

=== Personal relationships ===
Over the past 20 years FIFO had become a prevalent mining industry practice, however on the subject matter there is a scarcity of Australian research. According to Arnold (1995) studies resulted in FIFO being problematic for some families, in an analysis of the impacts on the lifestyle and families of workers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The psychosocial well-being of children from Australian military and fly-in/fly-out (FIFO) mining families|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13668800801890129|journal = Community, Work &amp; Family|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1366-8803|pages = 297–312|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13668800801890129|first = Elizabeth A.|last = Kaczmarek|first2 = Anne M.|last2 = Sibbel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian FIFO personnel indicate the benefits of leisure, access to services and facilities swell as friends and extended family from relatively high earnings from working in the industry. However, observation conducted by Gillies et al. (1997) involved surveying fifteen Australian FIFO operations and out of a study sample of 227 employees, a total of 30% employees stated their families were not in favour of the FIFO lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally results included 25% of employees believed their family relationships had been earnestly disadvantaged by the FIFO employment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The structure of rostered schedules and continuous cycles such as four weeks away and one week home, the long separations and short homecomings provoke an increased amount of conflict between work and home. In accordance to Torkington, Larkins &amp; Sen Gupta (2011) “ Miners reported that when they were away their partner described: being upset or lonely; the stresses of dealing with busy roles, such as parenting, alone; the challenge of changing routines; and having to managing practical tasks (e.g. mechanical repairs), which fell outside their normal role.” (2011).&amp;nbsp;As a result, the family structure is altered, especially for those with younger children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The psychosocial impacts of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out mining on mining employees: A qualitative study|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1584.2011.01205.x/abstract|journal = Australian Journal of Rural Health|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 1440-1584|pages = 135–141|volume = 19|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1584.2011.01205.x|first = Amanda May|last = Torkington|first2 = Sarah|last2 = Larkins|first3 = Tarun Sen|last3 = Gupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Millennium Cohort Study (United States)}}
The '''Millennium Cohort Study''' (MCS) is a [[longitudinal survey]] conducted by the [[Institute of Education#Centre for Longitudinal Studies|Centre for Longitudinal Studies]] (CLS) at the [[University of London]], following the lives of a sample of about 18,818 babies born in the [[UK]] in the year 2000–2001. 

==History==
The MCS is the fourth longitudinal birth cohort study conducted in the UK. Its aim is to create a multi-purpose data-set that describes the diversity of backgrounds into which children are born in the beginning of the 21st century. The information collected includes topics such as child development, [[social stratification]] and family life in order to identify possible advantages and disadvantages that the children are facing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5795&amp;amp;key=/&amp;amp;flag=true Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), MCS catalogue record entry], retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey is conducted in different sweeps with the first one concentrating on the circumstances of the pregnancy and birth as well as the first few months of life. This first part of the survey is also important to record the socio-economic background of the family into which the child is born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/mcs/l33359.asp ESDS Longitudinal, MCS dataset guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218005601/http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/mcs/l33359.asp |date=18 February 2009 }}, retrieved 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second sweep took place when the children were about 3 years of age&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=853&amp;sitesectiontitle=MCS2+(2004%2f5) Centre for Longitudinal Study (CLS), MCS webpages], retrieved 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  and the main focus was on continuity and change in the family as well as the parenting environment to extract information about the child’s development. In the third sweep in 2006, the children were at the age of starting primary school.  The fourth sweep took place in 2008, the fifth was in 2012&lt;ref&gt;ESDS, MCS catalogue record entry&lt;/ref&gt; and the sixth in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=1109&amp;sitesectiontitle=The+age+14+survey+of+the+MCS+(2015)|title=The age 14 survey of the MCS (2015) -|last=|first=|date=|website=Centre for Longitudinal Studies|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following sweep was planned for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=2371&amp;sitesectiontitle=+MCS7+%25282015%2529|title=The age 17 survey of the MCS (2018)|last=Smith|first=Kate|date=|website=Centre for Longitudinal Studies|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MCS is funded mainly by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and various government departments, such as the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]] (DH) and the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DfWP). The [[Scottish Government]], the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] have also contributed to fund the survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/mcs.asp MCS dataset guide], retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and scope==
The sample is structured by geographical clusters, allowing certain areas with significant [[ethnic minorities]] (in England), high levels of [[child poverty]], as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be overrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/mcs/l33359.asp ESDS Longitudinal, MCS dataset guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218005601/http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/mcs/l33359.asp |date=18 February 2009 }}, retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey results==
By 2016 the MCS findings have already been included in over 700 journal articles, books, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=953&amp;sitesectiontitle=Published+work CLS, MCS webpages, results overview], retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/Bibliography.aspx?sitesectionid=647&amp;sitesectiontitle=Bibliography&amp;d=1&amp;yf=&amp;yt=&amp;a=&amp;s=MCS&amp;o=&amp;j=|title=Bibliography - MCS|last=|first=|date=2016-08-30|website=Centre for Longitudinal Studies|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Red Cross Society''' (NRCS) was founded in 1960 and it has its headquarters in [[Abuja]].

It has over 500,000 volunteers and 300 permanent employees.
The Nigerian Red Cross Society was established by an Act of Parliament in 1960 and became the 86th Member – National Society of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (Now [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]) on 4 February 1961.

Its mandate originates from:

- The Movement Statutes
- Main Movement Resolutions
- RCRC Statutes and Byelaws
- [[Geneva Conventions]] and
- Nigerian Red Cross Act 1960

Its driving principles are humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">The term '''nonpuerperal mastitis''' describes inflammatory lesions of the breast ([[mastitis]]) that occur unrelated to [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]].

It is sometimes equated with [[duct ectasia]], but other forms can be described.&lt;ref name="pmid2918655"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peters F, Schuth W |title=Hyperprolactinemia and nonpuerperal mastitis (duct ectasia) |journal=JAMA |volume=261 |issue=11 |pages=1618–20 |date=March 1989 |pmid=2918655 |doi= 10.1001/jama.1989.03420110094030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Duct ectasia—periductal mastitis complex===
{{main|Duct ectasia of breast|Subareolar abscess|Zuska's disease}}
''Duct ectasia'' in the literal sense (literally: duct widening) is a very common and thus rather unspecific finding, increasing with age. However, in the way in which the term is mostly used, [[duct ectasia]] is an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition of the larger-order [[lactiferous duct]]s.&lt;ref name="Stavros2004-p372"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Thomas Stavros|title=Breast Ultrasound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkGtw5VI15sC&amp;pg=PA372|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-397-51624-7|pages=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considered likely that the condition is associated with aseptic (chemical) inflammation related to the rupture of ducts or [[Breast cyst|cysts]]. It is controversial whether duct dilation occurs first and leads to secretory [[Stasis (medicine)|stasis]] and subsequent periductal inflammation or whether inflammation occurs first and leads to an inflammatory weakening of the duct walls and then stasis.&lt;ref name="Stavros2004-p372"/&gt; When the inflammation is complicated by [[necrosis]] and secondary bacterial infection, [[breast abscess]]es may form.&lt;ref name="Stavros2004-p372"/&gt; [[Subareolar abscess]], also called [[Zuska's disease]] (only nonpuerperal case), is a frequently aseptic inflammation and has been associated with [[squamous metaplasia of the lactiferous ducts]].

The duct ectasia—periductal mastitis complex affects two groups of women: young women (in their late teens and early 20s) and [[Perimenopause|perimenopausal]] women.&lt;ref name="Stavros2004-p373"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Thomas Stavros|title=Breast Ultrasound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkGtw5VI15sC&amp;pg=PA373|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-397-51624-7|pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the younger group mostly have [[inverted nipple]]s due to [[squamous metaplasia]] that lines the ducts more extensively compared to other women and produces [[keratin]] plugs which in turn lead to duct obstruction and then duct dilation, secretory stasis, inflammation, infection and abscess. This is not typically the case for women in the older group; in this group, there is likely a multifactorial etiology involving the balance in [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]] and [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name="Stavros2004-p373"/&gt;

Treatment of mastitis and/or abscess in nonlactating women largely the same as that of lactational mastitis, generally involving antibiotics treatment, possibly surgical intervention by means of [[fine-needle aspiration]] and/or [[incision and drainage]] and/or interventions on the lactiferous ducts (for details, ''see also'' the articles on treatment [[Mastitis#Treatment|of mastitis]], [[Mastitis#Treatment of breast abscess|of breast abscess]] and [[Subareolar abscess#Treatment|of subareolar abscess]]). Additionally, an investigation for possible malignancy is needed, normally by means of [[mammography]], and a pathological investigation such as a biopsy may be necessary to exclude malignant mastitis.&lt;ref name="LiongHong2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liong|first1=Yee|last2=Hong|first2=Ga|last3=Teo|first3=Jennifer Gek|last4=Lim|first4=Geok|title=Breast ductal carcinoma in situ presenting as recurrent non-puerperal mastitis: case report and literature review|journal=World Journal of Surgical Oncology|volume=11|issue=1|year=2013|pages=179|issn=1477-7819|doi=10.1186/1477-7819-11-179|pmid=23924035|type=review|pmc=3765146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no ''causal'' relation with breast cancer has been established, there appears to be an increased statistical risk of breast cancer, warranting a long-term surveillance of patients diagnosed with non-puerperal mastitis.&lt;ref name="PetersKießlich2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Friedolf|last2=Kießlich|first2=Anja|last3=Pahnke|first3=Volker|title=Coincidence of nonpuerperal mastitis and noninflammatory breast cancer|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|volume=105|issue=1|date=October 2002|pages=59–63|issn=0301-2115|doi=10.1016/S0301-2115(02)00109-4|pmid=12270566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonpuerperal breast abscesses have a higher rate of recurrence compared to puerperal breast abscesses.&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2013-abstract"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L |title=Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up |journal=Radiographics |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=1683–99 |date=October 2011  |pmid=21997989 |doi=10.1148/rg.316115521 |type=review}}, abstract&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high statistical correlation of nonpuerperal breast abscess with [[diabetes mellitus]] (DM).

===Granulomatous mastitis===
{{main|Granulomatous mastitis}}
Characteristic for granulomatous mastitis are [[multinucleated giant cells]] and [[epithelioid histiocyte]]s around lobules. Often minor ductal and periductal inflammation is present. The lesion is in some cases very difficult to distinguish from [[breast cancer]].

===Comedo mastitis===

Comedo mastitis is a very rare form similar to granulomatous mastitis but with [[tissue necrosis]]. Because it is so rare it may be sometimes confused with [[comedo carcinoma]] of the breast although the conditions appear to be completely unrelated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39926">'''Nutrition transition''' is the shift in dietary [[food consumption|consumption]] and [[energy expenditure]] that coincides with economic, [[demographic change|demographic]], and [[epidemiological]] changes. Specifically the term is used for the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to more [[Western pattern diet]]s high in [[sugar]]s, fat, and animal-source food.

==Historical framework==
The nutrition transition model was first proposed in 1993 by [[Barry Popkin]], and is the most cited framework in literature regarding the nutrition transition,&lt;ref name=Popkin1993&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1993 | title = Nutritional Patterns and Transitions | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 138–157 | doi=10.2307/2938388}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been subject to some criticism for being overly simplified.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C | title = Uneven dietary development: linking the policies and processes of globalization with the nutrition transition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16569239 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lang2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lang T, Rayner G | title = Overcoming policy cacophony on obesity: an ecological public health framework for policymakers | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 165–81 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17316322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789x.2007.00338.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin posits that two other historic transitions affect and are affected by nutritional transition. The first is the [[demographic transition]], whereby a pattern of high fertility and high mortality transforms to one of low fertility and low mortality. Secondly, an [[epidemiological transition]] occurs, wherein a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s associated with [[malnutrition]], and with periodic famine and poor environmental sanitation, to a pattern of high prevalence of chronic and [[degenerative disease]]s associated with urban-industrial lifestyles is shown. These concurrent and dynamically influenced transitions share an emphasis on the ways in which populations move from one pattern to the next. 
Popkin used five broad patterns to help summarize the nutrition transition model.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt; While these patterns largely appear chronological, it is important to note that they are not restricted to certain periods of human history and still characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic subpopulations. The first pattern is that of collecting food, a characterization of hunter-gatherers, whose diets were high in carbohydrates and low in fat, especially saturated fat. The second pattern is defined by famine, a marked scarcity and reduced variation of the food supply. The third pattern is one of receding famine. Fruits, vegetables, and animal protein consumption increases, and starchy staples become less important in the diet. The fourth pattern is one of degenerative diseases onset by a diet high in total fat, cholesterol, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. This pattern is often accompanied by an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. The fifth pattern, and most recently emerging pattern, is characterized by a behavioral change reflective of a desire to prevent or delay degenerative diseases. Recent and rapid changes seen in developing countries from the second and third pattern to the fourth is the common focus of nutrition transition research and desire for policy that would emphasize a healthier overall diet characterizes the shift from the fourth to the fifth pattern.

==Relation to economic development==
The nutrition transition has much of its roots in economic factors related to the development of a nation or subpopulations within a nation. It was once believed that current nutrition transition was endemic only to [[industrialized nations]] like the United States, but increasing research has indicated that not only is nutrition transition occurring most rapidly in low- and middle-income [[developing countries]], the stress of its effects stands to burden the poorest populations of these countries the most as well.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chopra M, Galbraith S, Darnton-Hill I | title = A global response to a global problem: the epidemic of overnutrition | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 952–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12571723 | pmc = 2567699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2001 | title = The Nutrition Transition and Obesity in the Developing World | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 871–873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2003 | title = The Nutrition Transition in the Developing World | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 581–597 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00225.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prentice2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prentice AM | title = The emerging epidemic of obesity in developing countries | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16326822 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyi272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidhuber2005&gt;{{cite report | vauthors = Schmidhuber J, Shetty P | title = The Nutrition Transition to 2030: Why Developing Countries Are Likely to Bear the Major Burden. | work = 97th Seminar of the European Association of Agricultural Economists. | publisher = University of Reading | location = England | date = 21 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This shift is attributable to many causes. [[Globalization]] has played a large role in altering the access and availability of foods in formerly undeveloped nations. Demographic shifts from rural to urban areas are central to this as well as the liberalization of food markets, global food marketing, and the emergence of transnational food companies in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1999 | title = Urbanization, Lifestyle Changes and the Nutrition Transition | journal = World Development | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1905–1916 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007&gt;Hawkes C. "Globalization, Food, and Nutrition Transitions." Washington, DC: IFPRI, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; All these forces of globalization are creating [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes that contribute to the nutrition transition. Technological advancements are making previously arduous labor less difficult and thus altering energy expenditure that would have helped offset the caloric increases in the diet.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b/&gt; Daily tasks and leisure are also affected by technological advancements and contributing to greater rates of inactivity. The aforementioned increases in calorie are due to increased consumption of [[edible oils]], animal-source foods, caloric [[sweetener]]s, accompanied by reduced consumption of [[grain]]s and fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Nutrition in transition: the changing global nutrition challenge | journal = Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 10 | issue =  Supplement | pages = S13–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11708577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = An overview on the nutrition transition and its health implications: the Bellagio meeting | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 93–103 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027297 | doi = 10.1079/phn2001280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Does global obesity represent a global public health challenge? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21159790 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.110.008458 | pmc = 3021421 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes play into human biological preferences seen across the world.&lt;ref name=Drewnowski1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | title = The nutrition transition: new trends in the global diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 31–43 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9155216 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic factors also play an important role as do cultural values tied to appearance and status.

===Globalization and economic factors ===
The current nutrition transition seen in the [[emerging market]]s of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa is largely a product of globalization. International [[food trade]], investment, [[commercialization]] and [[food marketing|marketing]] are drastically impacting the availability of and access to energy-dense, but nutrient-deficient foods causing the aforementioned shift from traditional diet.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Another byproduct of globalization has been a marked demographic transition in these countries from rural areas to urban ones. Urban populations are more susceptible to current trends in nutrition transition because of the improved transportation, commercial food distribution and marketing, less labor-intensive-occupations, and changes in household eating habits and structure.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt;
The [[liberalization]] of food markets has had a drastic effect on [[consumption pattern]]s across the globe. Liberalization and commercialization of domestic agricultural markets are opening up food trading since this is needed to compete in the world market.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Eckhardt C, Ruel M, Minot N | year = 2005 | title = Diet Quality, Poverty, and Food Policy: A New Research Agenda for Obesity Prevention in Developing Countries | url = https://www.unscn.org/web/archives_resources/files/scnnews29.pdf | journal = SCN News | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to changes in the types of food produced, and increases in amounts of food imported into developing countries, which affects the relative availability and [[food prices|prices of different foods]]. 
Food demand is being shaped by increases in income and [[urbanization]]. As these rapidly developing nations continue to accrue high incomes per capita, their food spending is increasing as well. They elect to use these higher incomes on more calorically-dense foods that are sweeter and higher in fats.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; For example, in China, for the same extra dollar of income, an average Chinese person is purchasing higher calorie food today than that person would have done for the same extra yuan in 1990.&lt;ref name=Shufa2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Du S, Mroz TA, Zhai F, Popkin BM | title = Rapid income growth adversely affects diet quality in China--particularly for the poor! | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1505–15 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15246178 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid [[urbanization]] has also shaped food demand globally. The [[demographic transition]] from rural areas to urban populations is a well documented byproduct of globalization and technological advancements. This is because agro-food systems have replaced local subsistence farming in many rural areas.&lt;ref name=Brody2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody J | year = 2002 | title = The Global Epidemic of Childhood Obesity: Poverty, Urbanization, and Nutrition Transition | journal = Nutrition Bytes | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The supply of food is directly sculpted by increasing demand in these areas with growing income. Urbanization is increasing access to new foods and therefore altering the supply chain. This is why transnational food companies have grown so rapidly over the past few decades. These companies are making processed and fast foods much cheaper and more widely available through the growth of transnational supermarkets and chain restaurants. Food is not only easier to obtain in urban areas; it is also cheaper and less time-consuming to acquire which creates an imbalance between energy intake and output.&lt;ref name=Caba2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = The global epidemic of obesity: an overview | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17569676 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their advertising and promotional strategies have a strong effect on consumer choices and desire. Foreign direct investment is also stimulating processed food sales in these supermarkets by lowering prices and creating incentives for advertising and promotion. A large proportion of this advertising is for energy-dense processed foods and is being directed at children and youth.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;
Technological and transportation advancements are reducing the barriers that once limited global food trade. These techniques are critical to facilitating the production and distribution needed in a global market.  Better preservation techniques are helping to reduce waste which contributes to lower prices for consumers. Technology is creating higher yields which also reduce prices.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;

===Lifestyle changes===
The forces of globalization are strongly influencing many lifestyle changes in developing countries. Major changes in economic structures from agrarian economies to industrialized economies are reducing physical activity levels in occupations around the world.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt; Even in agricultural work, gas-powered technologies are helping reduce the energy expenditure needed to perform pertinent farming tasks. These reduced activity levels are not just seen in the workplace, but in homes as well. Daily tasks that were once laborious engagements are now much easier with the help of technological advancements, with examples being appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and stoves. Also, recent leaps in the efficiency of food production (canning, refrigeration, freezing, and packaging being a few of the most notable) and improvements in cookware, such as the introduction of improved metal stoves which use fossil fuels and microwave ovens, have helped reduce domestic efforts greatly.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt;

Leisure is being greatly impacted as well. Activities such as playing sports outside are being replaced with television watching and computer games.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; Decreasing physical leisure activities can also be contributed to urbanization wherein access to fields needed to play such games as soccer are not available due to such dense populations and their subsequent demand for land.&lt;ref name=Brody2002/&gt; Other important lifestyle changes fueling the nutrition transition relate to the composition of diets. These dietary shifts have been mentioned previously several times but deserve greater scrutiny. Diets rich in legumes, other vegetables, and coarse grains are disappearing in all regions and countries. Taking their place are diets characterized by fat-rich edible and vegetable oils, cheap animal-source foods high in fat and protein, and artificially sweetened foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. Consumption of caloric beverages such as soda represented 21% of all calorie intake in Mexico from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; Processes of globalization that have influenced food markets have made these products much cheaper, flavorful, and easier to produce which has in turn driven up their demand. So while globalization and the accompanying economic development has created higher levels of food security for developing countries, the ongoing trend of eating in a more Western fashion has caused increased rates of adverse health and childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | year = 1997 | title = The Nutrition Transition: New Trends in the Global Diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 31–43 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopsychosocial forces===
The desires for these new diets and lifestyles are very understandable from a biological and psychosocial perspective. For example, humans have an innate preference for sweets dating back to [[hunter-gatherer]] populations. These sweets signaled a good source of energy for hunter-gatherers that were not food secure. This same concept also relates to human predisposition for energy-dense fatty foods. These foods were needed to sustain long journeys and provided a safety net for times of famine. Humans also desire to eliminate physical exertion. This can explain the shift to more sedentary lifestyles from occupational, domestic, and leisurely activities that were previously much more physical taxing.&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; 
Socioeconomic and cultural influences also contribute to lifestyle changes associated with nutrition transition. The transfer of tastes by means of [[tourism]] and open food trade has introduced developing nations to foods previously enjoyed only by industrialized countries. Global food [[advertising]] and promotion has only further cemented these dietary changes.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Additionally some cultures view obese body types in high regard as they relate them to power, beauty and affluence.&lt;ref name=Prentice2006/&gt; Several studies suggest that [[socioeconomic status]] contributes greatly to nutrition transition wherein there is a lack of [[healthy diet|healthy food]] alternatives completely or a lack of affordable healthy food alternatives.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mont2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monteiro CA, Conde WL, Lu B, Popkin BM | title = Obesity and inequities in health in the developing world | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1181–6 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15211362 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franco2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco M, Diez Roux AV, Glass TA, Caballero B, Brancati FL | title = Neighborhood characteristics and availability of healthy foods in Baltimore | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 561–7 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18842389 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and economic outcomes==
While increased [[food security]] is a major benefit of global nutrition transition, there are a myriad of coinciding negative health and economic consequences. Rates of obesity are soaring across the world and recent trends suggest that incidences of [[overnutrition]] in coming decades will overtake that of [[undernutrition]] in the developing world. As well there will be a marked [[epidemiological transition|epidemiological shift]] from [[infectious disease]] to degenerative, [[noncommunicable disease]], NCDs in these countries.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt; As it stands now these countries face a unique paradox in having to deal with both over- and undernutrition, a dual burden of malnutrition, that will inevitably be accompanied by both infectious and noncommunicable diseases, a dual burden of disease.&lt;ref name=Caba2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = A nutrition paradox--underweight and obesity in developing countries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 15 | pages = 1514–6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15829531 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp048310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanu2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanumihardjo SA, Anderson C, Kaufer-Horwitz M, Bode L, Emenaker NJ, Haqq AM, Satia JA, Silver HJ, Stadler DD | title = Poverty, obesity, and malnutrition: an international perspective recognizing the paradox | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 1966–72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17964317 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vonke2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vonke D | year = 2011 | title = The Paradox of Malnutrition in Developing Countries | journal = African Research Review | volume = 5 | issue = 19| pages = 40–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uauy R, Albala C, Kain J | title = Obesity trends in Latin America: transiting from under- to overweight | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 893S–899S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238781 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.893S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic impact will be enormous as well.

===Health outcomes===
The foremost health outcome of the global nutrition transition will be an increased prevalence of obesity across the world. Obesity prevalence in developing countries increased from 2.3% in 1988 to 19.6% in 1998.&lt;ref name=Popkin1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM, Doak CM | title = The obesity epidemic is a worldwide phenomenon | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 106–14 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9584495 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1998.tb01722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidences are highest among women and children, indicating health inequities across global populations.&lt;ref name=Misra2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Misra A, Khurana L | title = Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 93 | issue = 11 Suppl 1 | pages = S9-30 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987276 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2008-1595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity is strongly linked to degenerative, NCDs such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. WHO estimates place NCDs as the principal global cause of morbidity and mortality,&lt;ref name=WHR1997&gt;{{cite book | title = World Health Report 1997: Conquering Suffering, Enriching Humanity | location = Geneva | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and global prevalence of chronic diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; Between 1990 and 2020, mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]], CVDs, in developing countries is expected to increase 120% for women and 137% for men compared to 29 and 49% respectively in industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; In many of the countries facing epidemics of overnutrition, there is still widespread undernutrition.

===Dual burden of disease===
Deemed as a developmental challenge of epidemic proportions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm | title = Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |publisher=Un.org |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the double burden of disease (DBD) is an emerging global health challenge, that exists predominately in low-to-middle income countries. More specifically, the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and [[non-communicable disease]]s(NCD). Today, over 90 per cent of the world’s disease burden occurs in developing regions, and most are attributed to communicable diseases.  Communicable diseases are [[infectious disease]]s that  “can be passed between people through proximity, social contact or intimate contact.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vancouver Coastal Health |url=http://www.vch.ca/your_health/communicable_diseases/ |title=Communicable Diseases -Vancouver Coastal Health |publisher=Vch.ca |date=2013-01-16 |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, malaria, influenza (the flu), and mumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boutayeb A, Boutayeb S | title = The burden of non communicable diseases in developing countries | journal = International Journal for Equity in Health | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 2 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15651987 | pmc = 546417 | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-4-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
As low-to-middle income countries continue to develop, the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, to primarily non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity.  This shift is increasingly being referred to as the risk transition.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases |title=WHO/Europe &amp;#124; Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=Euro.who.int |date=2013-06-14 |access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as globalization and the proliferation of pre-packaged foods continues, traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries.  As such, it is becoming increasingly common to see low-to-middle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and under nutrition, in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes.  Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations, are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many low-to-middle income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/2_background/en/index1.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; 2. Background |publisher=Who.int |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact===
The economic impact of these rising rates and dual burdens of disease looks to be tremendous. Disability, decreased quality of life, greater use of health care facilities, and increased absenteeism are strong associated with obesity.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt;  With inadequate resources, poorly construed health systems, and a general lack of expertise to address the burden of infective diseases, the disease burden for low-to-middle countries is exacerbated by the rising rate of non-communicable diseases. This is often attributed to the fact that these countries by nature have ill-health systems that possess inadequate resources to detect and prevent many non-communicable diseases.”&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  Social constructs within these countries often amplify the risk of the double burden, as inequality, gender, and other social determinants often have a role to play in disparate access and allocation of health services and resources.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  If current trends are maintained, the World Health Organization predicts that low-and-middle income countries will be unable to support the burden of disease within the foreseeable future.

==Implications for policy==
Countries worldwide have made several, varied efforts to address the consequences of the nutrition transition. These policies target the food environment, governance, food system, or education and can be generally classified into the following categories:

=== Public Nutrition Education Policy ===
[[Nutrition Education|Nutrition education]] intends to facilitate healthy behavioral changes, at the individual level. Dietary guidelines, specifically, promote public awareness of nutritional needs. Over 60 countries in the Global North and South have established national dietary guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Liu S, Liu R, Xue H, Wang Y | title = Food Policy Approaches to Obesity Prevention: An International Perspective | journal = Current Obesity Reports | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–82 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25705571 | doi = 10.1007/s13679-014-0099-6 | pmc = 4333683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition Labeling Policy ===
Nutrition labeling for food packages and in restaurants may encourage consumers to choose healthier foods. Nutrition labeling has been emphasized as important in influencing food choices and potentially reducing the intake of fat, sugar, and sodium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== School-focused Policy ===
Schools are viewed as a primary target of intervention for implementing nutrition-related policies. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to exposure to unhealthy foods before, during, and after school. Children are more susceptible to developing early obesity and are likely to remain obese throughout adulthood. School policies are varied and specific to the political, economic, and social climates of a place. They can focus on increasing nutritional standards, promoting active lifestyles, regulating school meal programs, and banning the sale of certain foods and beverages in and around schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Marketing Regulation ===
[[Food marketing]], via several media outlets - television, the Internet, packaging, popular culture - has been an effective strategy for influencing and changing consumers' food choices, particularly among children. Several studies have indicated the association between exposure to food advertising and food choices and beliefs. The impact of advertising has led to support for government level regulation of food marketing. Countries have implemented voluntary or mandatory restrictions on advertisements of unhealthy food products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Food companies are also urged to implement responsible food marketing strategies. Efforts by corporations should reverse drivers of food consumption, including convenience, low cost, good taste, and nutritional knowledge. Recommendations include downsizing packaging, reducing serving sizes, and recreating formulas to decrease caloric content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witkowski|first=Terrence H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007|title=Food Marketing and Obesity in Developing Countries: Analysis, Ethics, and Public Policy|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|volume=27.2|pages=126-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxation ===
Stemming from the success of taxation of tobacco products in reducing tobacco usage, policy makers and researchers have adopted a parallel approach for reducing obesity. The WHO supported economic policies as a method of influencing food prices and promoting healthy eating in public spaces (cite, 2008). Tax policies, in the form of [[Sin tax|sin taxes]] or [[Pigovian tax|Pigovian taxes]], generally target unhealthy food and drink products, including the "[[fat tax]]," "junk food tax," and of particular popularity, the [[Sugary drink tax|tax on sugar-sweetened beverages]] (SSBs). Taxation is intended to combat obesity by increasing the price of SSBs and unhealthy foods and in turn, reducing their consumption, as well as generating revenue that may be used towards obesity prevention programs or promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the effectiveness of taxation remains under scrutiny - economists argue that taxes are inefficient for combating obesity and can result in greater losses for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=Stefan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=Framing Obesity in Economic Theory and Policy| jstor = 29770461 |journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=66|issue=2|pages=163–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehensive Approach ===
The literature suggests that it may be ideal for governments to adopt a holistic policy approach to address the obesity epidemic, given the associated social conditions.&lt;ref name="Weiler_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiler R, Stamatakis E, Blair S | title = Should health policy focus on physical activity rather than obesity?

For example, the NOURISHING framework summarizes key avenues for action and policy but is flexible to suit a range of national and local contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Jewell J, Allen K | title = A food policy package for healthy diets and the prevention of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases: the NOURISHING framework | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 159–68 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24103073 | doi = 10.1111/obr.12098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has called for governments to have multi-faceted interventions, focusing on food security, food safety, healthy lifestyle, and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roussev|first=Leslie | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014|title=The WHO's CRASH DIET: The role of governments in the international obesity crisis and why the global strategy falls short| jstor = 24889898 |journal=The International Lawyer|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the scope of the pandemic but the diverse place-based trends and risk factors, appropriate and adequate intervention calls for policy change across multiple levels - population and individual - and the need for international collaboration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malik VS, Willett WC, Hu FB | title = Global obesity: trends, risk factors and policy implications | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Case studies==
Case studies for individual nations are plentiful. The [[BRICS]] countries are specifically studied in great depth because of their rapidly transitioning economies, but more slowly developing nations are well studied too.

===Industrialized nations===
Case studies in the United States and United Kingdom are particularly bountiful.&lt;ref name=Lang2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Recent dynamics suggest selected countries catching up to US obesity | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 284S–288S | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19906804 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28473C | pmc = 2793114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Reports based in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa can be found in a wide range of academic literature.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shufa2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mok2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mokhtar N, Elati J, Chabir R, Bour A, Elkari K, Schlossman NP, Caballero B, Aguenaou H | title = Diet culture and obesity in northern Africa | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 887S–892S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238780 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.887S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = The shift in stages of the nutrition transition in the developing world differs from past experiences! | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 205–14 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027286 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riosmena F, Frank R, Akresh IR, Kroeger RA | title = U.S. Migration, Translocality, and the Acceleration of the Nutrition Transition in Mexico | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

===Aboriginal populations===
Worldwide, [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal populations]] have experienced radical changes in diet. Traditional diets and food intakes have been replaced by diets consisting of foods high in fat, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S | title = Assessing diet and lifestyle in the Canadian Arctic Inuit and Inuvialuit to inform a nutrition and physical activity intervention programme | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 23 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 5–17 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21158957 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2010.01093.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in diet is related to the life-style changes during the last century: for example, Hunter-gatherer communities became more settled, and traditional food gathering methods changed. The nutrition transition has been linked to increased rates of [[non-communicable diseases]] amongst Aboriginal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhnlein HV, Receveur O, Soueida R, Egeland GM | title = Arctic indigenous peoples experience the nutrition transition with changing dietary patterns and obesity | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447–53 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15173410 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.6.1447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization introduced a less complicated way to access food; a protein rich diet was replaced by white bread, processed food and sugary beverages.

Traditional food of [[First Nations]] included [[burbot]] filet (or muscle) and [[moose]] liver. Food consumption provided essential fats (i.e., fatty acids) and proteins that played a key medicinal role in the prevention and reduction of obesity and obesity-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robidoux MA, Haman F, Sethna C | title = The relationship of the burbot (Lota lota L.) to the reintroduction of off-the-land foods in the Sandy Lake First Nation Community | journal = Biodemography and Social Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–29 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19835098 | doi = 10.1080/19485560903054630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Patrick Blair''', M.D. (c.1680–1728) was a Scottish surgeon and botanist, a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] from 1712.

==Life==
He was born at [[Dundee]], where he practised as a doctor. He was introduced to [[Hans Sloane]] by [[Charles Preston (botanist)|Charles Preston]] in 1705.{{sfn|Guerrini|2004}} Being a [[nonjuring schism|nonjuror]] and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], he was imprisoned as a suspect at the time of the [[1715 Jacobite Rising]]. He subsequently moved to London, then settled at [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].{{sfn|Bettany|1886}}

==Works==
In 1706 Blair dissected and mounted the bones of an elephant, and contributed a description, under the title of ''Osteographia Elephantina'', to the Royal Society of London, published in 1713. He delivered some discourses before the Royal Society on the sexes of flowers.{{sfn|Bettany|1886}}

Blair published ''Miscellaneous Observations on the Practice of Physick, Anatomy, and Surgery'' in 1718, ''Botanick Essay'' in 1720, and ''Pharmaco-botanologia'' in 1723–8, which ended with the letter H. His ''Botanick Essays'' were his major work. In them he expounded the progress of the [[classification of plants]] up to his time, and the then novel views as to the [[sexual characters of flowering plants]], adding his own observations.{{sfn|Bettany|1886}}

Nearly half of all [[refugee]]s are children, and almost one in three children living outside their country of birth is a [[refugee]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Emily Garin, Jan Beise, Lucia Hug, and Danzhen You. 2016. “Uprooted: The Growing Crisis for Refugee and Migrant Children.” UNICEF. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.unicef.org/videoaudio/PDFs/Uprooted.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers encompass children whose [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] has been formally confirmed, as well as children in refugee-like situations.

In addition to facing the direct threat of violence resulting from conflict, forcibly displaced children also face various health risks, including: disease outbreaks&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and long-term [[psychological trauma]],&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; inadequate access to water and sanitation,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; nutritious food,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and regular vaccination schedules.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; '''Refugee children''', particularly those without documentation and those who travel alone, are also vulnerable to [[Child abuse|abuse]] and exploitation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Although many communities around the world have welcomed them, forcibly displaced children and their families often face [[discrimination]], [[poverty]], and social marginalization in their home, transit, and destination countries.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Language barriers and legal barriers in transit and destination countries often bar refugee children and their families from accessing education, healthcare, social protection, and other services.&amp;nbsp;Many countries of destination also lack intercultural supports and policies for social integration.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Such threats to safety and well-being are amplified for refugee children with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==Legal protection==
{{see|Refugee law}}
The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, includes four articles that are particularly relevant to children involved in or affected by forced displacement:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF. "Convention on the Rights of the Child."&amp;nbsp;''Child Labor'' (1989): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the principle of non-discrimination (Article 2)
* best interests of the child (Article 3)
* right to life and survival and development (Article 6)
* the right to child participation (Article 12)
States Parties to the Convention are obliged to uphold the above articles, regardless of a child's migration status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of November 2005, a total of 192 countries have become States Parties to the Convention.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html|title=Frequently asked questions|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia and the United States are the only two countries that have not ratified it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|United Nations 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees]] is a comprehensive and rigid legal code regarding the rights of refugees at an international level and it also defines under which conditions a person should be considered as a refugee and thus be given these rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steinbock, Daniel J. "The refugee definition as law: issues of interpretation."&amp;nbsp;''Refugee Rights and Realities: Evolving International Concepts and Regimes''&amp;nbsp;(1999): 13-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention provides protection to forcibly displaced persons who have experienced persecution or torture in their home countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For countries that have ratified it, the Convention often serves as the primary basis for refugee status determination, but some countries also utilize other refugee definitions, thus, have granted refugee status not based exclusively on persecution. For instance, the African Union has agreed on a definition at the [[1969 Refugee Convention]], that also accommodates people affected by external aggression, occupation, foreign domination, and events seriously disturbing public order.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;“Refugee Status Determination: Identifying Who Is a Refugee.” 2005. Geneva: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa has granted refugee status to Mozambicans and Zimbabweans following the collapse of their home countries’ economies.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Joanne.&amp;nbsp;''I am an African: stories of young refugees in South Africa''. New Africa Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other international legal tools for the protection refugee children include two of the Protocols supplementing the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] which reference child migration:
* the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children;&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. "Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime."&amp;nbsp;''GA res''&amp;nbsp;55 (2000): 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. "Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime." (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]] covers the rights of the children of migrant workers in both regular and irregular situations during the entire migration process.

== Stages of the refugee experience ==
Refugee experiences can be categorized into three stages of migration: home country experiences (pre-migration), transit experiences (transmigration), and host country experiences (post-migration).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Richard J., and Dennis Moore, eds.&amp;nbsp;''Educational interventions for refugee children: Theoretical perspectives and implementing best practice''. Psychology Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Lustig, Stuart L., Maryam Kia-Keating, Wanda Grant Knight, Paul Geltman, Heidi Ellis, J. David Kinzie, Terence Keane, and Glenn N. Saxe.

"WPA guidance on mental health and mental health care in migrants."&amp;nbsp;''World Psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;10, no. 1 (2011): 2-10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the large majority of refugees do not travel into new host countries, but remain in the transmigration stage, living in refugee camps or [[urban refugee|urban centres]] waiting to be able to [[voluntary return|return]] home.

===Home country experiences (pre-migration)===
[[File:DRC- Child Soldiers.jpg|thumb|Former child soldiers in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
The pre-migration stage refers to home country experiences leading up to and including the decision to flee. Pre-migration experiences include the challenges and threats children face that drive them to seek refuge in another country.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Will H., and Stephen M. Shellman. "Refugee or internally displaced person? To where should one flee?."&amp;nbsp;''Comparative Political Studies''&amp;nbsp;39, no. 5 (2006): 599-622.&lt;/ref&gt; Refugee children migrate, either with their families or unaccompanied, due to fear of persecution on the premise of membership of a particular social group, or due to the threat of [[forced marriage]], [[Child labour|forced labor]], or conscription into armed forces.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hamilton, Carolyn, Kirsten Anderson, Ruth Barnes, and Kamena Dorling. "Administrative detention of children: a global report."&amp;nbsp;''Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, Nueva York''&amp;nbsp;(2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Others may leave to escape famine or in order to ensure the safety and security of themselves and their families from the destruction of war or internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Achvarina, Vera, and Simon F. Reich. "No place to hide: Refugees, displaced persons, and the recruitment of child soldiers."&amp;nbsp;''International Security''&amp;nbsp;31, no. 1 (2006): 127-164.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2016 report by UNICEF found that, by the end of 2015, five years of open conflict in the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]] had forced 4.9 million Syrians out of the country, half of which were children. The same report found that, by the end of 2015, more than ten years of armed conflict in Afghanistan had forced 2.7 million Afghans beyond the country's borders; half of the refugees from Afghanistan were children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During times of war, in addition to being exposed to violence, many children are abducted and forced to become soldiers.&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/ODAPublications/OccasionalPapers/PDF/OP14.pdf|title=Conflict of Interests: Children and Guns in Zones of Instability|last=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs: Panel Discussion at the United Nations.|date=February 2009|publisher=UNODA Occasional Papers No. 14: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.1}} According to an estimate, 12,000 refugee children have been recruited into armed groups within South Sudan.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Davies, Susanna, and Carol Batchelor. "Resettlement as a protection tool for refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''Forced Migration Review'' 54 (2017): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; War itself often becomes a part of the child's [[Identity (social science)|identity]], making [[Social integration|reintegration]] difficult once he or she is removed from the unstable environment.&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}}

Examples of children's pre-migration experiences: 
* Some Sudanese refugee children reported that they had either experienced personally or witnessed potentially traumatic events prior to departure from their home country, during attacks by the Sudanese military in [[Darfur]]. These events include instances of sexual violence, as well as of individuals being beaten, shot, bound, stabbed, strangled, drowned, and kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, Andrew, Basila Katoni, Allen S. Keller, and John Wilkinson. "Posttraumatic idioms of distress among Darfur refugees: Hozun and Majnun."&amp;nbsp;''Transcultural Psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;48, no. 4 (2011): 392-415.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some [[Burma|Burmese]] refugee children in Australia were found to have undergone severe pre-migration traumas, including the lack of food, water, and shelter, forced separation from family members, murder of family or friends, kidnappings, sexual abuse, and torture.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Schweitzer, Robert D., Mark Brough, Lyn Vromans, and Mary Asic-Kobe. "Mental health of newly arrived Burmese refugees in Australia: contributions of pre-migration and post-migration experience."&amp;nbsp;''Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'' 45, no. 4 (2011): 299-307.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 the President of [[Honduras]] testified in front of the [[United States Congress]] that more than three-quarters of unaccompanied child migrants from Honduras came from the country's most violent cities.&lt;ref&gt;“Central America and Mexico Unaccompanied Child Migration Situation Report No. 1.” 2014. United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 58 percent of 404 unaccompanied and separated children interviewed by the UN Refugee Agency, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], about their journey to the United States indicated that they had been forcibly displaced from their homes because they had either been harmed or were under threat of harm.&lt;ref&gt;“Unaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the Need for International Protection.” 2014. Washington, DC: UNHCR.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, children may also cross borders for economic reasons, such as to escape poverty and social deprivation, or some children may do so to join other family members already settled in another State. But it is the involuntary nature of refugees' departure that distinguishes them from other migrant groups who have not undergone forced displacement.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bemak, Fred, Rita Chi-Ying Chung, and Paul Pedersen.&amp;nbsp;''Counseling refugees: A psychosocial approach to innovative multicultural interventions''. No. 40. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Refugee]]s, and even more so their children, are neither psychologically nor pragmatically prepared for the rapid movement and transition resulting from events outside their control.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Any direct or witnessed forms of violence and sexual abuse may characterize refugee children's pre-migration experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Schininà, Guglielmo, Sonali Sharma, Olga Gorbacheva, and Anit Kumar Mishra. "Who am I? Assessment of psychosocial needs and suicide risk factors among Bhutanese refugees in Nepal and after the third country resettlement."&amp;nbsp;''International Organization for Migration (IOM)''&amp;nbsp;(2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transit experiences (transmigration) ===
The transmigration period is characterized by the physical relocation of refugees. This process includes the journey between home countries and host countries and often involves time spent in a refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, Dinesh, and Peter Jones. "Migration and mental illness."&amp;nbsp;''Advances in Psychiatric Treatment''&amp;nbsp;7, no. 3 (2001): 216-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Children may experience arrest, detention, sexual assault, and torture during their translocation to the host country.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Kaplan, Ida. "Effects of trauma and the refugee experience on psychological assessment processes and interpretation."&amp;nbsp;''Australian Psychologist''&amp;nbsp;44, no. 1 (2009): 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Children, particularly those who travel on their own or become separated from their families, are likely to face various forms of violence and exploitation throughout the transmigration period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The experience of traveling from one country to another is much more difficult for women and children, because they are more vulnerable to assaults and exploitation by people they encounter at the border and in refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;Kira, Ibrahim A., Iris Smith, Linda Lewandowski, and Thomas Templin. "The effects of gender discrimination on refugee torture survivors: A cross-cultural traumatology perspective."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association''&amp;nbsp;16, no. 5 (2010): 299-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trafficking ====
[[People smuggling|Smuggling]], in which a smuggler illegally moves a migrant into another country, is a pervasive issue for children travelling both with and without their families.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While fleeing their country of origin, many unaccompanied children end up travelling with [[Human trafficking|traffickers]]  who may attempt to exploit them as workers.&lt;ref name="Kielburger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/globalvoices/article/587381--refugee-children-can-feel-abandoned-in-new-land|title=Refugee Children can Feel Abandoned in New Land|last=Kielburger|first=C.|work=The Star Online|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including adults, sex trafficking is more prevalent in Europe and Central Asia, whereas in East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific labour trafficking is more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;“Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016.” Vienna, Austria: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many unaccompanied children fleeing from conflict zones in [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[China]], [[Afghanistan]] or [[Sri Lanka]] are forced into [[sex trafficking|sexual exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Not for Sale: The Return of the Global Slave Trade—and How We Can Fight It|last=Batstone|first=David|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-202372-8}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrunnisa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unaccompanied / separated children seeking refugee status in Ontario : a review of documented policies and practices|last1=Ali|first1=Mehrunnisa|last2=Gill|first2=Jagjeet Kaur|last3=Taraban|first3=Svitlana|year=2003|oclc=246931353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Especially vulnerable groups include girls belonging to single-parent households, unaccompanied children, children from child-headed households, orphans, girls who were street traders, and girls whose mothers were street traders.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While refugee boys have been identified as the main victims of exploitation in the labor market, refugee girls aged between 13 and 18 have been the main targets of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In particular, the number of young [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] women and girls brought into [[Italy]] for exploitation has been increasing: it was reported that 3,529 Nigerian women, among them underage girls, arrived by sea between January and June 2016. Once they reached Italy, these girls worked under conditions of slavery, for periods typically ranging from three to seven years.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;“Young Invisible Enslaved: The Child Victims at the Heart of Trafficking and Exploitation in Italy.” Save the Children Italia Onlus, November 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/libraries/young%20invisible%20enslaved%204%20low.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Detention ====
Children may be [[administrative detention|detained]] in prisons, military facilities, immigration detention centers, welfare centers, or educational facilities. While detained, migrant children are deprived of a range of rights, such as the right to physical and mental health, privacy, education, and leisure. And many countries do not have a legal time limit for detention, leaving some children incarcerated for indeterminate time periods.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Flynn, Michael.&amp;nbsp;''An introduction to data construction on immigration-related detention''. Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some children are even detained together with adults and subjected to a harsher, adult-based treatment and regimen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In [[North Africa]], children travelling without legal status are frequently subjected to extended periods of immigration detention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Children held in administrative detention in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] only receive a limited amount of education, and those held in interrogation centers receive no education at all. In two of the prisons visited by Defense for Children International Palestine, education was found to be limited to two hours a week.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It has also been reported that child administrative detainees in Palestine do not receive sufficient food to meet their daily nutritional requirements.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Documented cases of child detention are available for more than 100 countries, ranging from the highest to the lowest income nations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Even so, a growing number of countries, including both [[Panama]] and [[Mexico]], prohibit the detention of child migrants.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Mitchell, Grant. "Engaging Governments on Alternatives to Immigration Detention."&amp;nbsp;''Global Detention Project''&amp;nbsp;(2016).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Yemen]] has adopted a community-driven approach, using small-group alternative care homes for child refugees and asylum-seekers, as a more age-appropriate way of detention.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the United States unaccompanied children are placed in single purpose non-secure “children’s shelters” for immigration violations, rather than in juvenile detention facilities. However, this change has not ended the practice of administrative detention entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Fazel, Mina, Unni Karunakara, and Elizabeth A. Newnham. "Detention, denial, and death: migration hazards for refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''The Lancet Global Health''&amp;nbsp;2, no. 6 (2014): e313-e314.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although there is commitment by the Council of Europe to work toward ending the detention of children for migration control purposes, asylum-seeking and migrant children and families often undergo detention experiences that conflict with international commitments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Refugee camps ====
Some [[refugee camp]]s operate at levels below acceptable standards of environmental health; overcrowding and a lack of wastewater networks and sanitation systems are common.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Randa. "A report on the psychological effects of overcrowding in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."&amp;nbsp;''Prepared for the Expert and Advisory Services Fund—International Development Research Centre, Canada: IDRC'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Bruijn, Bart.&amp;nbsp;''The Living Conditions and Well-being of Refugees''. No. 19208. University Library of Munich, Germany, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Cronin, A. A., D. Shrestha, N. Cornier, F. Abdalla, N. Ezard, and C. Aramburu. "A review of water and sanitation provision in refugee camps in association with selected health and nutrition indicators–the need for integrated service provision."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of water and health''&amp;nbsp;6, no. 1 (2008): 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardships of a refugee camp may also contribute to symptoms following a refugee child's discharge from a camp. A small number of [[Cubans|Cuban]] refugee children and adolescents, who were detained in a refugee camp, were assessed months after their release, and it was found that 57 percent of the youth exhibited moderate to severe [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Rothe, Eugenio M., John Lewis, Hector Castillo-Matos, Orestes Martinez, Ruben Busquets, and Igna Martinez. "Posttraumatic stress disorder among Cuban children and adolescents after release from a refugee camp."&amp;nbsp;''Psychiatric Services''&amp;nbsp;53, no. 8 (2002): 970-976.&lt;/ref&gt; Unaccompanied girls at refugee camps may also face harassment or assault from camp guards and fellow male refugees.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Asaf, Yumna. "Syrian Women and the Refugee Crisis: Surviving the Conflict, Building Peace, and Taking New Gender Roles."&amp;nbsp;''Social Sciences''&amp;nbsp;6, no. 3 (2017): 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having poor infrastructure and limited support services, there are a few refugee camps that can present danger to refugee children and families by housing members of armed forces. Also, at a few refugee camps, militia forces may try to recruit and abduct children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Host country experiences (post-migration)===
The third stage, host country experiences, is the integration of refugees into the social, political, economic, and cultural framework of the host country society. The post-migration period involves adaptation to a new culture and re-defining one's identity and place in the new society.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This stress can be exacerbated when the children arrive in the host country and are expected to adapt quickly to a new setting.&lt;ref&gt;Marar, Marianne Maurice. "I know there is no justice: Palestinian perceptions of higher education in Jordan."&amp;nbsp;''Intercultural Education'' 22, no. 2 (2011): 177-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only a minority of refugees who travel into new host countries and who are allowed to start a new life there. Most refugees are living in refugee camps or urban centres waiting to be able to return home. For those who are starting a new life in a new country there are two options:
 
==== Seeking asylum ====
[[Asylum seeker]]s are people who have formally applied for asylum in another country and who are still waiting for a decision on their status.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Sarah. "Something to smile about: Promoting and supporting the educational and recreational needs of refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''Refugee Council''&amp;nbsp;(2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Once they have received a positive response from the host government, they will legally be considered as refugees. Refugees, like citizens of the host country, have the rights to education, health, and social services, whereas asylum seekers do not.&lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, Dinesh. "Migration and mental health."&amp;nbsp;''Acta psychiatrica scandinavica''&amp;nbsp;109, no. 4 (2004): 243-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the majority of refugees and migrants who arrived in Europe in 2015 through mid-2016 were accommodated in overcrowded transit centers and informal settlements, where privacy and access to education and health services were often limited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some accommodation centers in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], where asylum seekers stayed until their claims were processed, separate living spaces for women, as well as sex-separated latrines and shower facilities, were unavailable.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

[[Unaccompanied minor|Unaccompanied children]] face particular difficulties throughout the asylum process. They are minors who are separated from their families once they reach the host country, or minors who decide to travel from their home countries to a foreign country without a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Meda, Lawrence. 2013. “Refugee Learner Experiences : A Case Study of Zimbabwean Refugee Children.” Thesis. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/handle/10413/12135&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; More children are traveling alone, with nearly 100,000 unaccompanied children in 2015 filing claims for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in 78 countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bhabha (2004) argues that it is more challenging for unaccompanied children than adults to gain asylum, as unaccompanied children are usually unable to find appropriate legal representation and stand up for themselves during the application process.&lt;ref&gt;Bhabha, Jacqueline. "Seeking Asylum Alone: Treatment of separated and trafficked children in need of refugee protection."&amp;nbsp;''International migration''&amp;nbsp;42, no. 1 (2004): 141-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], for instance, unaccompanied children, who usually do not have any kind of legal assistance, must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that they are in need of the country's protection.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;Crock, Mary.&amp;nbsp;''Seeking asylum alone: A study of Australian law, policy and practice regarding unaccompanied and separated children''. Federation Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many children do not have the necessary documents for legal entry into a host country, often avoiding officials due to fear of being caught and deported to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn, H., C. Gladwell, and S. Lyall. "I Just Want to Study: Access to Higher Education for Young Refugees and Asylum Seekers."&amp;nbsp;''London, Refugee Support Network''&amp;nbsp;(2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Without documented status, unaccompanied children often face challenges in acquiring education and healthcare in many countries. These factors make them particularly vulnerable to hunger, homelessness, and sexual and labor exploitation.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Vandenhole, Wouter, Ellen Desmet, Didier Reynaert, and Sara Lembrechts, eds.&amp;nbsp;''Routledge international handbook of children’s rights studies''. Routledge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Displaced youth, both male and female, are vulnerable to recruitment into armed groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lischer, Sarah Kenyon. "War, displacement, and the recruitment of child soldiers."&amp;nbsp;''Child Soldiers Initiative Working Group Session Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania''&amp;nbsp;(2006): 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Unaccompanied children may also resort to dangerous jobs to meet their own survival needs.&lt;ref&gt;Bhabha, Jacqueline, and Susan Schmidt. "Seeking asylum alone: Unaccompanied and separated children and refugee protection in the US."&amp;nbsp;''The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth''&amp;nbsp;1, no. 1 (2008): 126-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Some may also engage in criminal activity or drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Yee, Barbara WK, and Nguyen Dinh Thu.

"The relationship of trauma to mental disorders among trafficked and sexually exploited girls and women."&amp;nbsp;''American Journal of Public Health''&amp;nbsp;100, no. 12 (2010): 2442-2449.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refugee resettlement ====
[[Third country resettlement]]&amp;nbsp;refers to the transfer of refugees from the country they have fled to another country that is more suitable to their needs and that has agreed to grant them permanent settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/resettlement.html|title=Resettlement|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the number of places available for resettlement is less than the number needed for children for whom resettlement would be most appropriate.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Some nations have prioritized children at risk as a category for resettlement:

The United States established its Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program in 1980 to support unaccompanied children for resettlement. The [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]] (ORR) by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] currently works with state and local service providers to provide unaccompanied refugee children with resettlement and foster care services. This service is guaranteed to unaccompanied refugee minors until they reach the age of majority or until they are reunited with their families.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, Julia, Niranjan S. Karnik, Sabine Voelkl-Kernstock, Elisabeth Granditsch, Kanita Dervic, Max H. Friedrich, and Hans Steiner. "Mental health issues in unaccompanied refugee minors."&amp;nbsp;''Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health''&amp;nbsp;3, no. 1 (2009): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some European nations have established programs to support the resettlement and integration of refugee children.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The European countries admitting the most refugee children in 2016 via resettlement were the United Kingdom (2,525 refugee children), Norway (1,930), Sweden (915), and Germany (595). Together, these accounted for 66% of the child resettlement admissions to all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;“Refugee and Migrant Children in Europe: Accompanied, Unaccompanied, and Separated (Quarterly Overview of Trends: January - March 2017).” UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/58431&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] also established a new initiative in 2016 to support the resettlement of vulnerable refugee children from the Middle East and North Africa, regardless of family separation status.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; It was reported in February 2017 that this program has been partially suspended by the government; the program would no longer accept refugee youth with "complex needs," such as those with disabilities, until further notice.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;Agerholm, Harriet. "Disabled child refugees entry to UK through resettlement scheme suspended by Home Office." The Independent. February 09, 2017. Accessed December 05, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/disabled-child-refugees-uk-suspend-entry-home-office-resettlement-unhcr-united-nations-lord-dubs-a7571451.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Refugee children without caretakers have a greater risk of exhibiting psychiatric symptoms of mental illnesses following traumatic stress.&lt;ref name="Lustig"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lustig| first = Stuart L.| title = Review of Child and Adolescent Refugee Health | publisher = National Child Traumatic Stress Network: USA| year = 2003 | url = http://www.evasp.eu/attachments/117_Review%20of%20Child%20and%20Adolescent%20Refugee%20Mental%20Health.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Unaccompanied refugee children display more behavioral problems and emotional distress than refugee children with caretakers.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Parental well-being plays a crucial role in enabling resettled refugees to transition into a new society. If a child is separated from his/her caretakers during the process of resettlement, the likelihood that he/she will develop a mental illness increases.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.17}}

==Health==
{{See also|Refugee health|l1=Refugee Health}}

This section covers health throughout the different stages of the refugee experience.

=== Health status ===

==== Nutrition ====
Refugee children arriving in the United States often come from countries with a high prevalence of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="Lutfy, Caitlyn 2014"&gt;Lutfy, Caitlyn, Susan T. Cookson, Leisel Talley, and Roger Rochat. "Malnourished children in refugee camps and lack of connection with services after US resettlement."&amp;nbsp;''[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]''&amp;nbsp;16, no. 5 (2014): 1016-1022.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly half of a sample of refugee children who arrived to the American state of Washington, the majority of which were from Iraq, Somalia, and Burma, were found to have at least one form of malnutrition. In the under five age range refugee children had significantly higher rates of [[wasting syndrome]] and [[stunted growth]], as well as a lower prevalence of obesity, in comparison to low-income non-refugee children.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth E., Suzinne Pak-Gorstein, Andrea J. Hoopes, and Jasmine Matheson. "Comparison of the nutritional status of overseas refugee children with low income children in Washington state."&amp;nbsp;''PLOS One''&amp;nbsp;11, no. 1 (2016): e0147854.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some time after they arrived in the United States and Australia, many refugee children demonstrated an increasing rate of overnutrition. An Australian study, assessing the nutritional status of 337 sub-Saharan African children aged between three and 12 years, found that the prevalence rate for overweight amongt refugee children was 18.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Renzaho, Andre, Carl Gibbons, Boyd Swinburn, Damien Jolley, and Catherine Burns. "Obesity and undernutrition in sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee children in Victoria, Australia." PhD diss., Healthy Eating Club, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence rate of overweight and obesity among refugee children in [[Rhode Island]], increased from 17.3% at initial measurement at first arrival to 35.4% at measurement three years after.&lt;ref&gt;Heney, Jessica H., Camia C. Dimock, Jennifer F. Friedman, and C. Lewis. "Pediatric refugees in Rhode Island: increases in BMI percentile, overweight, and obesity following resettlement."&amp;nbsp;''RI Med J''&amp;nbsp;98, no. 1 (2015): 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the nutritional profiles of refugee children also often vary by their country of origin. A study involving Syrian refugee children in Jordanian refugee camps found them to be on average more likely overweight than acutely malnourished. The low prevalence of acute malnutrition among them was attributed, at least partly, to UNICEF's infant and child feeding interventions, as well as to the distribution of food vouchers by the World Food Programme (WFP).&lt;ref&gt;Bilukha, Oleg O., Douglas Jayasekaran, Ann Burton, Gabriele Faender, James King'ori, Mohammad Amiri, Dorte Jessen, and Eva Leidman. "Nutritional Status of Women and Child Refugees from Syria—Jordan, April–May 2014."&amp;nbsp;''MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep''&amp;nbsp;63, no. 29 (2014): 638-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among newly arrived refugees in Washington state, significantly higher rates of obesity were observed among Iraqi children, whereas higher rates of stunting were found among Burmese and Somali children. The latter also had higher rates of wasting.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Such variation in the nutrition profiles of refugee children may be explained by the variance in refugees' location and time in transition.&lt;ref&gt;Yun, Katherine, Jasmine Matheson, Colleen Payton, Kevin C. Scott, Barbara L. Stone, Lihai Song, William M. Stauffer, Kailey Urban, Janine Young, and Blain Mamo. "Health profiles of newly arrived refugee children in the United States, 2006–2012."&amp;nbsp;''American journal of public health''&amp;nbsp;106, no. 1 (2016): 128-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communicable diseases ====
Communicable diseases are a pervasive issue faced by refugee children in camps and other temporary settlements. Governments and organizations are working to address a number of them, such as measles, rubella, diarrhea, and cholera. Refugee children often arrive in the United States from countries with a high prevalence of [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]].&lt;ref name="Lutfy, Caitlyn 2014"/&gt;

[[Measles]] has been a major cause of child deaths in refugee camps and among [[internally displaced people]]; measles also exacerbates malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Toole, Michael J., and Ronald J. Waldman. "The public health aspects of complex emergencies and refugee situations."&amp;nbsp;''Annual review of public health''&amp;nbsp;18, no. 1 (1997): 283-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toole, Michael J., Richard W. Steketee, Ronald J. Waldman, and Phillip Nieburg. "Measles prevention and control in emergency settings."&amp;nbsp;''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' 67, no. 4 (1989): 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Kenya, have developed preventative, detective, and curative programs to specifically target measles within the refugee children population. Kenya has reached over 20 million children with a measles and rubella immunization campaign carried out at the national level in May 2016. In 2017 the Kenya Ministry of Health even reported a routine vaccination coverage of 95 percent in the [[Dadaab refugee camp]]. As of April 2017, in response to the first confirmed cases of measles in the camp, UNICEF and UNHCR have collaborated with the Kenya Ministry of Health to swiftly implement an integrated measles vaccination program in Dadaab. The campaign, which has been targeting children aged six to 14 years, also includes screening, treatment referrals for cases of malnutrition, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/kenya/media_20054.html|title=UNICEF Kenya responds to measles outbreak in Dadaab Refugee Camp – Over 61,000 children immunized|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2017|work=UNICEF Kenya|access-date=November 26, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarrhea, acute watery diarrhea, and [[cholera]] can also put children's lives at risk. Countries, such as Bangladesh, have identified the introduction and development of proper sanitation habits and facilities as potential solutions to these medical conditions. A 2008 study comparing refugee camps in Bangladesh reported that camps with sanitation facilities had cholera rates of 16%, whereas camps without such facilities had cholera rates that were almost three times higher.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; In a single week in 2017, 5,011 cases of diarrhea in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh were reported. In response, UNICEF started a year-long cholera vaccination campaign in October 2017, targeting all children in the camps. At health centers in the refugee camps, UNICEF has been screening for potential cholera cases and providing oral rehydration salts. Community-based health workers are also going around the camps to share information on the risks of acute watery diarrhea, the cholera vaccination campaign, and the importance and necessity of good hygiene practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/blog/preventing-cholera-in-rohingya-refugee-camps/|title=Racing to prevent cholera in Rohingya refugee camps|last=Reilly|first=Hugh|date=October 9, 2017|work=UNICEF|access-date=November 26, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Noncommunicable diseases ====
During all points of the refugee experience, refugee children are often at risk of developing several noncommunicable diseases and conditions, such as lead poisoning, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and pediatric cancer.

Many refugee children come to their host countries with elevated blood lead levels; others encounter lead hazards once they have resettled. A study published in January 2013 found that the blood lead levels of refugee children who had just arrived to the state of New Hampshire were more than twice as likely to be above 10&amp;nbsp;µg/dL as the blood lead levels of children born in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Jaime S., Chinaro Kennedy, and Mary Jean Brown. "Blood lead level analysis among refugee children resettled in New Hampshire and Rhode Island."&amp;nbsp;''Public Health Nursing''&amp;nbsp;30, no. 1 (2013): 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the United States also found that nearly 30% of 242 refugee children in New Hampshire developed elevated blood lead levels within three to six months of their arrival to the United States, even though their levels were not found to be elevated at initial screening.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC. "Elevated blood lead levels in refugee children--New Hampshire, 2003-2004."&amp;nbsp;''MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report''&amp;nbsp;54, no. 2 (2005): 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study reported that refugee children in Massachusetts were 12 times more likely to have blood lead levels over 20&amp;nbsp;µg/dL a year after an initial screening than non-refugee children of the same age and living in the same communities.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Katherine W., Edwin van Wijngaarden, Susan G. Fisher, Katrina S. Korfmacher, James R. Campbell, I. Diana Fernandez, Jennifer Cochran, and Paul L. Geltman. "Blood lead levels of refugee children resettled in Massachusetts, 2000 to 2007."&amp;nbsp;''American journal of public health''&amp;nbsp;101, no. 1 (2011): 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study analyzing the medical records of former refugees residing in Rochester, New York between 1980 and 2012 demonstrated that former child refugees may be at increased risk of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and [[hypertension]] following resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;Golub, Natalia. "Longitudinal Health Outcomes in Former Refugees." PhD diss., University of Rochester, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Afghan children lack access to urban diagnosis centers in Pakistan; those who do have access have been found to have various types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sher Mohammad, Jawad Gillani, Shagufta Nasreen, and Salar Zai. "Pediatric tumors in north west Pakistan and Afghan refugees."&amp;nbsp;''Pediatric hematology and oncology''&amp;nbsp;14, no. 3 (1997): 267-272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that, within Turkey's Syrian refugee population, 60 to 100 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Overall, the incidence rate of pediatric cancers among Turkey's Syrian refugee population was similar to that of Turkish children. The study additionally noted, however, that most refugee children affected by cancer were diagnosed when the tumor was already at an advanced stage. This could indicate that refugee children and their families often face obstacles such as poor prognoses, language barriers, financial problems, and social problems in adapting to a new setting.&lt;ref&gt;Kebudi, Rejin, Ibrahim Bayram, Begul Yagci-Kupeli, Serhan Kupeli, Gulay Sezgin, Esra Pekpak, Yesim Oymak et al. "Refugee children with cancer in Turkey."&amp;nbsp;''The Lancet Oncology''&amp;nbsp;17, no. 7 (2016): 865-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health and illness ====
Traditionally, the mental health of children experiencing conflict is understood in terms of either post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or toxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Thabet, A.A. and P. Vostanis, Post-traumatic stress reactions in children of war. J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 1999. 40(3): p. 385-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged and constant exposure to stress and uncertainty, characteristic of a war environment may result in toxic stress that children express with a change in behavior that may include anxiety, self-harm, aggressiveness or suicide.&lt;ref name="SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds 2017"&gt;SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds: The impact of six years of war on the mental health of Syrian children. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study conducted in Syria by Save the Children determined that 84% of all adults and most children considered ongoing bombing and shelling to be the main psychological stressor, while 89% said that children were more fearful as the war progressed, and 80% said that children had become more aggressive. These stressors are leading causes of the symptoms described above, which lead to diagnosis of PTSD and toxic stress, among other mental conditions. These issues may then be further exacerbated by a forced migration to a foreign country, and the beginning of the process of refugee status determination.&lt;ref name="SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds 2017"/&gt;

Refugee children are extremely vulnerable during migration and resettlement, and may experience long-term pathological effects, due to "disrupted development time." Psychoanalysts of refugee health have proposed that refugee children experience mourning for their culture and countries, despite the fact that the war-torn state of their homes is unsafe. This sudden loss of familiarity places children at a greater risk for mental dysfunction. In addition, studies have shown that refugee children show a higher vulnerability to stress when separated from their families.&lt;ref name=":27"/&gt; Studies from treatment facilities and small community samples have confirmed that refugee youth are at higher risk for psychopathologic disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and problems resulting from substance abuse. However, it is important to note that other large-scale community surveys have found that the rate of psychiatric disorder among immigrant youth is not higher than that of native-born children.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Theresa Stichick, and Kashif Tanveer Khan. "The mental health of children affected by armed conflict: protective processes and pathways to resilience."&amp;nbsp;''International review of psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;20, no. 3 (2008): 317-328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Cécile, Aline Drapeau, and Sadeq Rahimi. "The complexity of trauma response: a 4-year follow-up of adolescent Cambodian refugees."&amp;nbsp;''Child abuse &amp; neglect''&amp;nbsp;27, no. 11 (2003): 1277-1290.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, experiments have shown that these adverse outcomes can be prevented through adequate protective factors, such as social support and intimacy.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Eisenbruch, Maurice. “The Mental Health of Refugee Children and Their Cultural Development.” ''The International Migration Review'', vol. 22, no. 2, 1988, pp. 282–300. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2546651.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, effective adaptation strategies, such as absorption in work and creation of pseudofamilies, have led to successful coping in refugees. Many refugee populations, particularly Southeast Asian, undergo a secondary migration to larger communities of kinfolk from their countries of origin, which serve as social support networks for refugees. Research has shown that family reunification, formation of new social groups, community groups, and social services and professional support have contributed to successful resettlement of refugees.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Refugees can be stigmatized if they encounter mental health deficiencies prior to and during their resettlement into a new society.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.14}} Differences between parental and host country [[values]] can create a rift between the refugee child and his/her new society.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyman|first1=Ilene|last2=Beiser|first2=Morton|last3=Vu|first3=Nhi|year=1996|title=The Mental Health of Refugee Children in Canada|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/refuge/article/view/21885|journal=Refuge|volume=15|issue=5|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 5}} Less exposure to stigmatization lowers the risk of refugee children developing PTSD.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.14}}

===Access to healthcare===
Cognitive and structural barriers make it difficult to determine the medical service utilization rates and patterns of refugee children. A better understanding of these barriers will help improve mental healthcare access for refugee children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2009|title=Help-seeking for mental health problems in young refugees: a review of the literature with implications for policy, practice, and research|journal=Transcult Psychiatry|volume=46|issue=4|pages=584–607|doi=10.1177/1363461509351363|pmid=20028678|vauthors=de Anstiss H, Ziaian T, Procter N, Warland J, Baghurst P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive and emotional barriers ====
Many refugees develop a mistrust of authority figures due to repressive governments in their country of origin. Fear of authority and a lack of awareness regarding mental health issues prevent refugee children and their families from seeking medical help.&lt;ref name="McBriden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03057925.2010.523168 |title=The importance of context: Vietnamese, Somali, and Iranian refugee mothers discuss their resettled lives and involvement in their children's schools |year=2011 |last1=McBrien |first1=J. Lynn |journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=75–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.76}} Certain cultures use informal support systems and self-care strategies to cope with their mental illnesses, rather than rely upon biomedicine.&lt;ref name="Donelly"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3109/01612840.2010.550383 |title=If I Was Going to Kill Myself, I Wouldn't Be Calling You.

Other factors that delay refugees from seeking medical help are:&lt;ref name="Donelly"/&gt;{{rp|p.284}} 
* Fear of discrimination and stigmatization
* Denial of mental illness as defined in the Western context
* Fear of the unknown consequences following diagnosis such as [[deportation]], separation from family, and losing children
* Mistrust of Western biomedicine

====Language barriers====
A broad spectrum of translation services are available to all refugees, but only a small number of those services are government-sponsored. Community health organizations provide a majority of translation services, but there are a shortage of funds and available programs.&lt;ref name=McKeary&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jrs/feq038 |title=Barriers to Care: The Challenges for Canadian Refugees and their Health Care Providers |year=2010 |last1=McKeary |first1=Marie |last2=Newbold |first2=Bruce |journal=Journal of Refugee Studies |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=523–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since children and adolescents have a greater capacity to adopt their host country's language and cultural practices, they are often used as [[linguistics|linguistic]] intermediaries between service providers and their parents.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt; This may result in increased tension in family dynamics where culturally sensitive roles are reversed. Traditional family dynamics in refugee families  disturbed by cultural adaptation tend to destabilize important cultural norms, which can create a rift between parent and child. These difficulties cause an increase of depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns in culturally-adapted adolescent refugees.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt;

Relying on other family members or community members has equally problematic results where relatives and community members unintentionally exclude or include details relevant to comprehensive care.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt; Healthcare practitioners are also hesitant to rely on members of the community because it is breaches confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fowler N |title=Providing primary health care to immigrants and refugees: the North Hamilton experience |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=388–91 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9732723 |pmc=1229607}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.174}} A third party present also reduces the willingness of refugees to trust their healthcare practitioners and disclose information.&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; Patients may receive a different translator for each of their follow-up appointments with their mental healthcare providers, which means that refugees need to recount their story via multiple interpreters, further compromising confidentiality.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;

====Culturally competent care====
Culturally competent care exists when healthcare providers have received specialized training that helps them to identify the actual and potential cultural factors informing their interactions with refugee patients.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.524}} Culturally competent care tends to prioritize the social and cultural determinants contributing to health, but the traditional Western biomedical model of care often fails to acknowledge these determinants.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.527}}

To provide culturally competent care to refugees, mental healthcare providers should demonstrate some understanding of the patient's background, and a sensitive commitment to relevant cultural manners (for example: privacy, gender dynamics, religious customs, and lack of language skills).&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.527}} The willingness of refugees to access mental healthcare services rests on the degree of cultural sensitivity within the structure of their service provider.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.528}}

The protective influence exercised by adult refugees on their child and adolescent dependents makes it unlikely that young adult-accompanied refugees will access mental healthcare services. Only 10-30 percent of youth in the general population, with a need for mental healthcare services, are currently accessing care.&lt;ref name="Bean"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bean T, Eurelings-Bontekoe E, Mooijaart A, Spinhoven P |title=Factors associated with mental health service need and utilization among unaccompanied refugee adolescents |journal=Adm Policy Ment Health |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=342–55 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16755395 |doi=10.1007/s10488-006-0046-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.342}} Adolescent ethnic minorities are less likely to access mental healthcare services than youth in the dominant cultural group.

Parents, caretakers and teachers are more likely to report an adolescent's need for help, and seek help resources, than the adolescent.&lt;ref name="Bean"/&gt;{{rp|p.348}} Unaccompanied refugee minors are less likely to access mental healthcare services than their accompanied counterparts. Internalizing complaints (such as depression and anxiety) are prevalent forms of psychological distress among refugee children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="Bean"/&gt;{{rp|p.347}}

====Other obstacles====
Additional structural deterrents for refugees:
* Complicated insurance policies based on refugee status (e.g. Government Assistant Refugees vs. Non-), resulting in hidden costs for refugee patients&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Health education ===
The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and Family Health International (FHI) have designed and piloted a peer-centered education program for adolescent refugee girls in Uganda, Zambia, and Egypt. The goal of the program was to reach young women who were interested in being informed about reproductive health issues. The program was split into three age-specific groups: girls aged seven to 10 learned about bodily changes and anatomy; girls aged 11 to 14 learned about sexually transmitted diseases; girls aged 15 and older focused on tips to ensure a healthy pregnancy and to properly care for a baby. According to qualitative surveys, increased self-esteem and greater use of health services among the program's participants were the largest benefits of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Speizer, Ilene S., Robert J. Magnani, and Charlotte E. Colvin. "The effectiveness of adolescent reproductive health interventions in developing countries: a review of the evidence."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Adolescent Health''&amp;nbsp;33, no. 5 (2003): 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

This section covers education throughout the different stages of the refugee experience. The report, "Left Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis," compares [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] sources and statistics on refugee education with data on school enrollment around the world provided by [[UNESCO]], the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The report notes that, globally, 91 percent of children attend primary school. For all refugees, that figure is at 61 percent. Specifically in low-income countries, less than 50 percent of refugees are able to attend primary school. As refugee children get older, school enrollment rates drop: only 23 percent of refugee adolescents are enrolled in secondary school, versus the global figure of 84 percent. In low-income countries, nine percent of refugees are able to go to secondary school. Across the world, enrollment in tertiary education stands at 36 percent. For refugees, the percentage remains at one percent.&lt;ref&gt;“Left Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis.” Geneva, Switzerland: UNHCR, September 12, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/59b696f44.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting to a new school environment is a major undertaking for refugee children who arrive in a new country or [[refugee camp]].&lt;ref name="Hoot"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.03.363 |title=Working with very young refugee children in our schools: Implications for the world's teachers |year=2011 |last1=Hoot |first1=James L. |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=15 |pages=1751–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education is crucial for the sufficient psychosocial adjustment and cognitive growth of refugee children.&lt;ref name="Eisenbruch" /&gt; Due to these circumstances, it is important that educators consider the needs, obstacles, and successful educational pathways for children refugees.&lt;ref name="Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educational Handbook for Refugee Parents|last=Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services.|publisher=International Rescue Committee: New York|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham, Minhas, and Paxton (2016) note in their study that&amp;nbsp;parents' misunderstandings about educational styles, teachers' low expectations and stereotyping tendencies, bullying and racial discrimination, pre-migration and post-migration trauma, and forced detention can all be risk factors for learning problems in refugee children. They also note that high academic and life ambition, parents' involvement in education, a supportive home and school environment, teachers' understanding of linguistic and cultural heritage, and healthy peer relationships can all contribute to a refugee child's success in school.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Hamish R., Ripudaman S. Minhas, and Georgia Paxton. "Learning problems in children of refugee background: a systematic review."&amp;nbsp;''Pediatrics''&amp;nbsp;137, no. 6 (2016): e20153994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to education===

====Structure of the education system====
Schools in North America lack the necessary resources for supporting refugee children, particularly in negotiating their academic experience and in addressing the diverse learning needs of refugee children.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Isik-Ercan|first=Zeynep|title=In Pursuit of a New Perspective in the Education of Children of the Refugees: Advocacy for the Family|journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice|date=Autumn 2012|issue=Special Issue|pages=3025–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/2329285/In_Pursuit_of_a_New_Perspective_in_the_Education_of_Children_of_the_Refugees_Advocacy_for_the_Family_|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex schooling policies that vary by classroom, building and district, and procedures that require written communication or parent involvement intimidate the parents of refugee children.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt; Educators in North America typically guess the grade in which refugee children should be placed because there is not a standard test or formal interview process required of refugee children.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.189}}

The ability to enroll in school and continue one's studies in [[developing country|developing countries]] is limited and uneven across regions and settings of displacement, particularly for young girls and at the secondary levels.&lt;ref name=Dryden-Peterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryden-Peterson|first=Sarah|title=Refugee Education: A Global Review|year=2011|publisher=UNHCR|location=University of Toronto|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4fe317589.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of sufficient classrooms and teachers is low and many discriminatory policies and practices prohibit refugee children from attending school.&lt;ref name="Dryden-Peterson" /&gt; Educational policies promoting age-caps can also be harmful to refugee children.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13676260220134430 |title=Factors Influencing the Academic Success of Refugee Youth in Canada |year=2002 |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Lori |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=173–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.176}}

Many refugee children face legal restrictions to schooling, even in countries of first asylum.&amp;nbsp;This is the case especially for countries that have not signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] or its [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. "Refugee education in countries of first asylum: Breaking open the black box of pre-resettlement experiences."&amp;nbsp;''Theory and Research in Education''&amp;nbsp;14, no. 2 (2016): 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where they lack official refugee status, refugee children are unable to enroll in national schools.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. "The educational experiences of refugee children in countries of first asylum."&amp;nbsp;''Migration Policy Institute''&amp;nbsp;(2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, unregistered refugee children described being hesitant to go to school, due to risk of encountering legal authorities at school or while on the way to and from school.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Structure of classes ====
Student-teacher ratios are very high in most refugee schools, and in some countries, these ratios are nearly twice the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UNCHR]] guideline of 40:1.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Although global policies and standards for refugee settings endorse child-centered teaching methods that promote student participation,&lt;ref&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah.&amp;nbsp;''Refugee education: A global review''. UNCHR, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; teacher-centered instruction often predominates in refugee classrooms. Teachers lecture for the majority of the time, offering few opportunities for students to ask questions or engage in creative thinking.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In eight refugee-serving schools in Kenya, for example, lecturing was the primary mode of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Mary, Sarah Dryden-Peterson, Lesley Bartlett, Caroline Ndirangu, Rosemary Imonje, Daniel Gakunga, and M. Tangelder. "Quality education for refugees in Kenya: Pedagogy in urban Nairobi and Kakuma refugee camp settings."&amp;nbsp;''Journal on Education in Emergencies''&amp;nbsp;1, no. 1 (2015): 92-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residence====
Refugee children who live in large [[urban area|urban]] centers in North America have a higher rate of success at school, particularly because their families have greater access to additional social services that can help address their specific needs.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.190}} Families who are unable to move to urban centers are at a disadvantage.

====Language barriers and ethnicity====
[[Acculturation]] stress occurs in North America when families expect refugee youth to remain loyal to ethnic values while mastering the host [[culture]] in school and social activities. In response to this demand, children may over-identify with their host culture, their culture of origin, or become marginalized from both.&lt;ref name=Correa-Velez&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Correa-Velez I, Gifford SM, Barnett AG |title=Longing to belong: social inclusion and wellbeing among youth with refugee backgrounds in the first three years in Melbourne, Australia |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=1399–408 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20822841 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insufficient communication due to [[language barrier|language]] and cultural barriers may evoke a sense of alienation or "being the other" in a new society. The clash between cultural values of the family and popular culture in mainstream Western society leads to the alienation of refugee children from their home culture.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt;

Many Western schools do not address diversity among ethnic groups from the same nation or provide resources for specific needs of different cultures (such as including [[halal]] food in the school menu). Without successfully negotiating cultural differences in the classroom, refugee children experience [[social exclusion]] in their new host culture.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt;  The presence of racial and ethnic discrimination can have an adverse effect on the well-being of certain groups of children and lead to a reduction in their overall school performance.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.189}} For instance, cultural differences place Vietnamese refugee youth at a higher risk of pursuing disruptive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Zhou, M &amp; Bankston, Carl"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED439180|title=Straddling Two Social Worlds: The Experience of Vietnamese Refugee Children in the U.S.|author1=Zhou, M|author2=Bankston, Carl.|publisher=Education Resources Information Center, 111, pp. 1-84|year=2000|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7}} Contemporary [[Vietnamese American]] adolescents are prone to greater uncertainties, self-doubts and emotional difficulties than other American adolescents. Vietnamese children are less likely to say they have much to be proud of, that they like themselves as they are, that they have many good qualities, and that they feel socially accepted.&lt;ref name="Zhou, M &amp; Bankston, Carl" /&gt;{{rp|p.11}}

Classes for refugees, more often than not, are taught in the host-country language.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Refugees in the same classroom may also speak several different languages, requiring multiple interpretations; this can slow the pace of overall instruction.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo living in Uganda, for example, had to transition from French to English. Some of these children were placed in lower-level classes due to their lack of English proficiency. Many older children therefore had to repeat lower-level classes, even if they had already mastered the content.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Using the language of one ethnic group as the instructional language may threaten the identity of a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;Pherali, Tejendra, and Dean Garratt. "Post-conflict identity crisis in Nepal: Implications for educational reforms."&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Educational Development''&amp;nbsp;34 (2014): 42-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of the curriculum can also act as a form of discrimination against refugee children involved in the education systems of first asylum countries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Bush, Kenneth David, and Diana Saltarelli. "The two faces of education in ethnic conflict." (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Curricula often seem foreign and difficult to understand to refugees who are attending national schools alongside host-country nationals. For instance, in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, children described having a hard time understanding concepts that lacked relevance to their lived experiences, especially concepts related to Kenyan history and geography.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Similarly, in Uganda, refugee children from the Democratic Republic of Congo studying together with Ugandan children in government schools did not have opportunities in the curriculum to learn the history of their home country.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The teaching of one-sided narratives, such as during history lessons, can also threaten the identity of students belonging to minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.&amp;nbsp;''The hidden crisis: Armed conflict and education''. UNESCO, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Vietnamese mothers bringing their children to the Wizo kindergarten in upper Afula.jpg|thumb|[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugee mother and children at a kindergarten in upper [[Afula]], 1979.]]

====Other obstacles====
Although high-quality education helps refugee children feel safe in the present and enable them to be productive in the future, some do not find success in school.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Stewart
| first = Jan
| title = Supporting Refugee Children: Strategies for Educators
| publisher = University of Toronto Press: Toronto
| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.67}} Other obstacles may include:&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;
*Disrupted schooling - refugee children may experience disruptive schooling in their country of origin, or they may receive no form of education at all. It is extremely difficult for a student with no previous education to enter a school full of educated children.&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt;{{rp|p.71}}
* Trauma - can impede the ability to learn and cause fear of people in positions of authority (such as teachers and principals)&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.340}}
* School drop outs - due to self-perceptions of academic ability, antisocial behaviour, rejection from peers and/or a lack of educational preparation prior to entering the host-country school. School drop outs may also be caused by unsafe school conditions, poverty, etc.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.341}}
* Parents - when parental involvement and support are lacking, a child's academic success decreases substantially. Refugee parents are often unable to help their children with homework due to language barriers. Parents often do not understand the concept of parent-teacher meetings and/or never expect to be a part of their child's education due to pre-existing cultural beliefs.  
* Assimilation - a refugee child's attempt to quickly [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into the culture of their school can cause alienation from their parents and country of origin and create barriers and tension between the parent and child.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.340–344}}
* Social and individual rejection - hostile discrimination can cause additional trauma when refugee children and treated cruelly by their peers&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.350}}
* Identity confusion&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.352}}
* Behavioral issues - caused by the adjustment issues and survival behaviours learned in refugee camps&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.355}}

===Role of teachers===
North American schools are agents of acculturation, helping refugee children integrate into Western [[society]].&lt;ref name="Eisenbruch"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Maurice |last1=Eisenbruch |year=1988 |title=The Mental Health of Refugee Children and Their Cultural Development |journal=International Migration Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=282–300 |jstor=2546651 |doi=10.2307/2546651}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.291}} Successful educators help children process trauma they may have experienced in their country of origin while supporting their academic adjustment.&lt;ref name="Szente"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10643-006-0082-2 |title=Responding to the Special Needs of Refugee Children: Practical Ideas for Teachers |year=2006 |last1=Szente |first1=Judit |last2=Hoot |first2=James |last3=Taylor |first3=Dorothy |journal=Early Childhood Education Journal |volume=34 |pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Refugee children benefit from established and encouraged communication between student and teacher, and also between different students in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt; Familiarity with sign language and basic [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] strategies improves communication between teachers and refugee children.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt; Also, non-refugee peers need access to literature that helps educate them on their refugee classmates experiences.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt;  Course materials should be appropriate for the specific learning needs of refugee children and provide for a wide range of skills in order to give refugee children strong academic support.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt;

Educators should spend time with refugee families discussing previous experiences of the child in order to place the refugee child in the correct grade level and to provide any necessary accommodations&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;{{rp|p.189}} School policies, expectations, and parent's rights should be translated into the parent's native language since many parents do not speak English proficiently. Educators need to understand the multiple demands placed on parents (such as work and family care) and be prepared to offer flexibility in meeting times with these families.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISIK-ERCAN" /&gt;

====Academic adjustment of refugee children====
[[File:Syrian refugee children.jpg|thumb|Syrian refugee children attend a lesson in a UNICEF temporary classroom in northern Lebanon, July 2014]]
Teachers can make the transition to a new school easier for refugee children by providing [[Language interpretation|interpreters]].&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt; Schools meet the psychosocial needs of children affected by war or displacement through programs that provide children with avenues for emotional expression, personal support, and opportunities to enhance their understanding of their past experience.&lt;ref name="Roussea, Cecile &amp; Guzder, Jaswant"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rousseau C, Guzder J |title=School-based prevention programs for refugee children |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=533–49, viii |date=July 2008 |pmid=18558311 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2008.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.536}} Refugee children benefit from a case-by-case approach to learning, because every child has had a different experience during their resettlement. Communities where the refugee populations are bigger should work with the schools to initiate after school, summer school, or weekend clubs that give the children more opportunities to adjust to their new educational setting.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt;

[[Biculturalism|Bicultural]] integration is the most effective mode of acculturation for refugee adolescents in North America. The staff of the school must understand students in a community context and respect cultural differences.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.331}} Parental support, refugee peer support, and welcoming refugee youth centers are successful in keeping refugee children in school for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.334}} Education about the refugee experience in North America also helps teachers relate better with refugee children and understand the traumas and issues a refugee child may have experienced.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.333}}

Refugee children thrive in classroom environments where all students are valued. A sense of belonging, as well as ability to flourish and become part of the new host society, are factors predicting the well-being of refugee children in academics.&lt;ref name="Correa-Velez" /&gt; Increased school involvement and social interaction with other students help refugee children combat [[depression (mood)|depression]] and/or other underlying [[mental health]] concerns that emerge during the post-migration period.&lt;ref name="Kia-Keating"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2007|title=Belonging and connection to school in resettlement: young refugees, school belonging, and psychosocial adjustment|journal=Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1177/1359104507071052|pmid=17375808|vauthors=Kia-Keating M, Ellis BH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peace education ===
Implemented by UNICEF from 2012 to 2016 and funded by the Government of the Netherlands, Peacebuilding, Education, and Advocacy (PBEA) was a program that tested innovative education solutions to achieve peacebuilding results.&lt;ref&gt;Affolter, Friedrich W. "Indicators for Education for Peacebuilding in Fragile States UNICEF’s Peacebuilding, Education and Advocacy Program."&lt;/ref&gt; The PBEA program in Kenya's [[Dadaab refugee camp]] aimed to strengthen resilience and social cohesion in the camp, as well as between refugees and the host community.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The initiative was composed of two parts: the Peace Education Programme (PEP), an in-school program taught in Dadaab's primary schools, and the Sports for Development and Peace (SDP) program for refugee adolescents and youth. There was anecdotal evidence of increased levels of social cohesion from participation in PEP and potential resilience from participation in SDP.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Peace education for refugee children may also have limitations and its share of opponents. Although [[peace education]] from past programs involving non-refugee populations reported to have had positive effects,&lt;ref&gt;Arnon, Michal, and Yair Galily. "Monitoring the effects of an education for peace program: An Israeli perspective."&amp;nbsp;''Human Affairs''&amp;nbsp;24, no. 4 (2014): 531-544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Gal. "Is there a place for peace education? Political education and citizenship activism in Israeli schools."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Peace Education''&amp;nbsp;11, no. 1 (2014): 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; studies have found that the attitudes of parents and teachers can also have a strong influence on students' internalization of peace values.&lt;ref&gt;Yahya, Siham, Zvi Bekerman, Shifra Sagy, and Simon Boag. "When education meets conflict: Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli parental attitudes towards peace promoting education."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Peace Education''&amp;nbsp;9, no. 3 (2012): 297-320.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers from [[Cyprus]] also resisted a [[peace education]] program initiated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Michalinos, Panayiota Charalambous, and Constadina Charalambous. "Manifestations of Greek-Cypriot teachers' discomfort toward a peace education initiative: Engaging with discomfort pedagogically."&amp;nbsp;''Teaching and Teacher Education''&amp;nbsp;28, no. 8 (2012): 1071-1082.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that, while teachers supported the prospect of reconciliation, ideological and practical concerns made them uncertain about the effective implementation of a peace education program.&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Michalinos, Constadina Charalambous, Panayiota Charalambous, and Panayiota Kendeou. "Promoting peaceful coexistence in conflict-ridden Cyprus: Teachers’ difficulties and emotions towards a new policy initiative."&amp;nbsp;''Teaching and Teacher Education''&amp;nbsp;27, no. 2 (2011): 332-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disabilities ==
Children with disabilities frequently suffer physical and sexual abuse, exploitation, and neglect. They are often not only excluded from education, but also not provided the necessary supports for realizing and reaching their full potential.

In refugee camps and temporary shelters, the needs of children with disabilities are often overlooked. In particular, a study surveying Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal, Burmese refugee camps in Thailand, Somali refugee camps in Yemen, the [[Dadaab refugee camp]] for Somali refugees in Kenya, and camps for internally displaced persons in Sudan and Sri Lanka, found that many mainstream services failed to adequately cater to the specific needs of children with disabilities. The study reported that mothers in Nepal and Yemen have been unable to receive formulated food for children with cerebral palsy and cleft palates. The same study also found that, although children with disabilities were attending school in all surveyed countries, and refugee camps in Nepal and Thailand have successful programs that integrate children with disabilities into schools, all other surveyed countries have failed to encourage children with disabilities to attend school.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Reilly, Rachael. "Disabilities among refugees and conflict-affected populations."&amp;nbsp;''Forced Migration Review''&amp;nbsp;35 (2010): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Syrian parents consulted during a four-week field assessment conducted in northern and eastern [[Lebanon]] in March 2013 reported that, since arriving in Lebanon, their children with disabilities had not been attending school or engaging in other educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;“Disability Inclusion in the Syrian Refugee Response in Lebanon.” New York: Women’s Refugee Commission, July 2013. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Disability_Inclusion_in_the_Syrian_Refugee_Response_in_Lebanon.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, too, Syrian refugee children with disabilities identified lack of specialist educational care and physical inaccessibility as the main barriers to their education.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. "Access to Education for Syrian Refugee Children and Youth in Jordan Host Communities."&amp;nbsp;''UNICEF, Jordan'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, limited attention is being given to refugee children with disabilities in the United Kingdom. It was reported in February 2017 that its government has decided to partially suspend the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme, originally set to resettle 3,000 children with their families from countries in the Middle East and North Africa. As a result of this suspension, no youth with complex needs, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties,&amp;nbsp;would be accepted into the program until further notice.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Countries may often overlook refugee children with disabilities with regards to humanitarian aid, because data on refugee children with disabilities are limited. Roberts and Harris (1990) note that there is insufficient statistical and empirical information on disabled refugees in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Keri, and Jennifer Harris.&amp;nbsp;''Disabled refugees and asylum seekers in Britain: Numbers and social characteristics''. University of York, Social Policy Research Unit, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was reported in 2013 that 26 percent of all Syrian refugees in Jordan had impaired physical, intellectual, or sensory abilities, such data specifically for children do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/handicapinternational/pages/454/attachments/original/1397045203/Hidden_Victims_of_the_Syrian_Crisis%E2%80%94disabled__injured_and_older_refugees.pdf?1397045203|title=Hidden victims of the Syrian crisis: disabled, injured and older refugees|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Handicap International, HelpAge International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was capped five times for Argentina in 2004, including in a match against the [[All Blacks]]. Roncero played another five times for Argentina in 2005. He also played in Argentina's 2006 mid-year series against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and the All Blacks.

In 2007 he was selected to join the Argentina squad for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] which succeed in gaining Argentina's highest world cup finish of third place.

He played five internationals in 2008 and five in 2009.

In the issue of [[Rugby World]] magazine published in December 2009 (and dated January 2010), the columnist [[Stephen Jones (journalist)|Stephen Jones]] ranked Roncero as the ninth best player in the world at the time of his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby World magazine (IPC Media), January 2010 – The Stephen Jones column&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodrigo was part of [[2011 Rugby World Cup squads#Argentina|Argentine squad]] for the [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] [[Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand.

He has developed a reputation as one of the world game's most destructive scrummagers. On 6 October 2012, Roncero played his last game in international rugby against [[Australia national rugby union team|the Wallabies]] during [[The Rugby Championship]] in his country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">[[Image:Maryville-treatment.jpg|thumb|350px|Maryville Treatment Center at Mount Alverno on the bluffs above the 102 River.]]
The '''Sisters of St. Francis of Maryville''' ([[postnominal]] initials: S.S.M.) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] for women based in [[Maryville, Missouri]], which followed the Rule of the [[Third Order of St. Francis]]. Their ministry was primarily one of medical care, to which end they founded hospitals in Missouri and Oklahoma.

==History==
The congregation was founded in 1894 when Mother [[Mary Augustine Giesen]] led six other [[Religious sister|sisters]] to Maryville from the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] [[motherhouse]] of the [[Sisters of St. Mary]]. They then became independent of that congregation, with Mother Augustine as the first [[Superior General]].

They founded St. Francis Hospital, the only hospital in the town and one of only two hospitals in the vast [[Platte Purchase]] area of northwest Missouri north of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] (the other hospital is in [[Fairfax, Missouri]]).

In 1947, the order built its motherhouse, with its landmark yellow steeple, on a bluff overlooking the [[One Hundred and Two River]]. In 1963 they opened the Mount Alverno Academy for high school girls on land adjacent to the motherhouse. The high school closed in 1971.

In 1985 the congregation merged back with its parent congregation of the [[Sisters of St. Mary]] to form the [[Franciscan Sisters of Mary]].  The headquarters was moved to St. Louis.

Concerned Maryville residents seeking to preserve the landmark motherhouse tower sought various uses for it.  In 1995 the [[Missouri Department of Corrections]] bought the {{convert|44|acre|m2|sing=on}} grounds with the motherhouse and school for the minimum security [[Maryville Treatment Center]] which began operations in 1996.

The congregation's hospitals now are operated as the [[SSM Health Care]] Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fsmonline.org/history/|title=History {{!}} Franciscan Sisters of Mary|work=Franciscan Sisters of Mary|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SOLVATTEN''' is a combined portable [[water treatment]] and [[Solar water heating|solar water heater]] system that has been designed for use at the household level in the developing world. The device uses natural UV radiation to treat water, and units are capable of rendering highly contaminated water drinkable (as defined by the [[WHO]] safe drinking water standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatesolver.org/innovations/supplying-energy/solvatten Climate Solver: Solar safe water system]&lt;/ref&gt;) in a few hours, provided there is sufficient sunlight.

SOLVATTEN incorporates three water treatment processes: [[filtration]], [[pasteurisation]] and [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV sterilisation]].&lt;ref name="Lundström"&gt;Lundström, H. &amp; Hagström, E. A field study in Kenya of insolation parameters to make water drinkable in the household water treatment unit SOLVATTEN. Uppsala University, Sweden [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:538805/SUMMARY01]&lt;/ref&gt; Under optimal conditions, the device can eliminate all [[pathogen]]ic material in 10-litres of water within 2 hours,&lt;ref name="SROI"&gt;Jönsson, J., Wikman, A. &amp; Wätthammar, T. (2011) Social Return on Investment, SROI, the value added for families before and after using Solvatten in the Bungoma district in Western Kenya. Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala [http://stud.epsilon.slu.se/3308/1/watthammar_t_111006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for multiple batches of water to be treated in a given day.

The device is typically used in situations where [[water resources]] are scarce and prone to contamination, but it has also been applied in disaster relief scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/plan_sverige/pressreleases/pplan-solvatten-och-quatar-airways-foerser-tyfondrabbade-foerlossningskliniker-i-filippinerna-med-rent-vatten-964584/ Solvatten use following Typhoon Yolanda (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt; The device and its inventor, Petra Wadström, have both achieved recognition through a series of national and international awards.

== Design and Usage ==

Each SOLVATTEN unit consists of two five-litre containers that have transparent surfaces and can be filled with water. The transparent surfaces of the containers are made from a plastic that allows the penetration of a large portion of UV light, specifically UV-B which is highly effective at destroying [[microorganism]]s. Water is poured in through an opening that houses a filter of 35 microns to remove larger particles&lt;ref name="Solvatten Brochure"&gt;[http://www.solvatten.se/Solvatten_brochure.pdf Solvatten product brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309045326/http://www.solvatten.se/Solvatten_brochure.pdf |date=2014-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once filled, the unit is placed in direct sunlight, which simultaneously heats the water and exposes it to [[ultraviolet radiation]]. The combination of these is an effective means of purifying water and, depending on conditions, the water will be free of pathogenic material in 2–6 hours. The water is heated to between 55 and 75&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Lundström" /&gt; making it suitable for a number of other household and hygiene purposes, such as hand washing, bathing and domestic cleaning.

A study has shown that the use of SOLVATTEN is associated with health improvements in communities that are dependent upon contaminated water resources. It showed that it eliminated 100% of pathogenic material from water sourced from contaminated wells, whilst its use was also associated with as 60% reduction in diarrhoeal infections in children under five years old.&lt;ref name="Diop" /&gt;

The study, conducted in Mali, showed that households using SOLVATTEN reduced their combustion of firewood and charcoal by an average of 0.5 and 0.9&amp;nbsp;kg/day respectively.&lt;ref name="Diop"&gt;Diop, B. S. (2012) Sanitary, economic and environmental impacts of Solvatten in the West African peri-urban context: case of Dialakorodji, Bamako (Mali). University of Dakar, Senegal. [http://blogs.washplus.org/drinkingwaterupdates/2013/03/sanitary-economic-and-environmental-impacts-of-solvatten/]&lt;/ref&gt; This had additional economic benefits for the user, with average savings of 15.8 USD/month.&lt;ref name="Diop" /&gt;  A separate research exercise calculated the [[social return on investment]] (SROI) of SOLVATTEN, which accounts for extra-financial value (e.g. environmental and social value not reflected in conventional financial accounts) relative to resources invested. In that study, the SROI was calculated as being 1:26, meaning that for every unit of currency invested in SOLVATTEN, 26 were created&lt;ref name="SROI" /&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==

SOLVATTEN was designed by the Swedish inventor and environmentalist Petra Wadström. Wadström has been recognised as one of Sweden’s most prestigious modern entrepreneurs and environmentalists, whilst the SOLVATTEN device itself has been acknowledged as a significant innovation. Below is a list of some of the awards received by both Wadström and her invention.

'''The FIRM''' (stylized as '''The FIRM''') is a brand of exercise videos and equipment owned by [[Gaiam]]. It is best known for popularizing a hybrid of [[aerobic exercise]] and [[Bodybuilding|weight training]].

== History ==
In 1979, Anna Benson founded the exercise studio The Body Firm (later The FIRM Studios) in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. She recruited her sister Cynthia Benson and husband Mark Henriksen under the Meridian Films label to co-produce a series of exercise videos filmed there between 1986 and 1994. It quickly established itself as a competitor to personalities like [[Jane Fonda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1991/03/05/battle-the-bulge-with-home-exercise-videos/09ab47d0-073d-461b-8b96-6ea9195c63fb/|title=BATTLE THE BULGE WITH HOME EXERCISE VIDEOS|last=Krucoff|first=Carol|date=1991-03-05|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit brought against Meridian Films in 2001 over royalties&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Meridian Films, Inc.'' 00-1359. Retrieved from http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Unpublished/001359.U.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; forced The FIRM to be sold to [[GoodTimes Entertainment]]. Gaiam purchased GoodTimes in 2005 and subsequently expanded The FIRM, focusing on women's fitness.

Anna Benson started Fitness Favorites, which became the official online store for the original videos after her death in 2009. After her death, Anna's son became owner of the Classic The FIRM and has released Anna's 'classic' DVDs from VHS format.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/living/article14362331.html|title='Firm Believers' lose a friend|last=Holleman|first=Joey|website=The State|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIRM Studios was renamed The Flex Body/The FLEX  in 2015 and is owned by Emily Welsh. In 2018, Anna Benson's Fitness Favorites renamed The FIRM (classic) to Anna L. Benson's The Body Firm. Now, Fitness Favorites is also streaming workouts.

'''''Top of the Lake''''' is a mystery drama [[television series]] created and written by [[Jane Campion]] and [[Gerard Lee]], and directed by Campion and [[Garth Davis]]. It aired in 2013, and the sequel, entitled ''Top of the Lake: China Girl'', in 2017.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicole Kidman to star in Top of the Lake season 2: China Girl|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/nicole-kidman-to-star-in-top-of-the-lake-season-2-china-girl-20160612-gphahh.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks Campion's first work for television since ''[[An Angel at My Table]]'' in 1990.

== Production ==

=== ''Top of the Lake'' ===
Actress [[Jennifer Ehle]] auditioned for the role of GJ, which went to [[Holly Hunter]]. [[Jane Campion]] originally offered the role of Robin to [[Anna Paquin]], who had worked with her on ''[[The Piano]]'' (1993). Paquin declined due to her pregnancy, and the role went to American [[Elisabeth Moss]].&lt;ref name="vulture-interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisabeth Moss, ''Top of the Lake'' interview|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/elisabeth-moss-top-of-the-lake-interview.html|work=Vulture|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was originally intended as a co-production with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. But after Moss was cast as Robin, the network pulled their funding before production began, citing a prior agreement to put an Australian actress in the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No funding from ABC for ''Top of the Lake'' after it learned ''Mad Men'' actress Elisabeth Moss was in cast|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/no-funding-from-abc-for-top-of-the-lake-after-it-learned-mad-men-actress-elisabeth-moss-was-in-cast/story-e6frewyr-1226187020051|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian-based channel [[BBC_UKTV|UKTV]], owned by [[BBC Worldwide]], filled the funding gap left by the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Wenham: "''Top of the Lake'' is ABC's loss"|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/03/david-wenham-top-of-the-lake-is-abcs-loss.html|work=TV Tonight|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippa Campbell]] was the [[Television in New Zealand|New Zealand]]-based producer.

Filming took 18 weeks and was shot entirely on location in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and [[Glenorchy, New Zealand|Glenorchy]], in [[Otago]], on the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. While Queenstown is referred to during the series, Glenorchy doubles as the fictitious town of Laketop. The scenes in the women's commune were filmed at [[Moke Lake]].&lt;ref name="vulture-interview" /&gt;

=== ''Top of the Lake: China Girl'' ===

In early 2013, co-creator Jane Campion said that ''Top of the Lake'' comes to a distinct ending, and there would be no additional series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Girl: Inside ''Top of the Lake'', Jane Campion’s gritty new thriller|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/03/11/inside-jane-campion-s-new-sundance-thriller-top-of-the-lake.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=30 August 2013|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, it was announced in October 2014 that the series had been renewed for a second season.&lt;ref name="vanityfair1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=Top of the Lake Season 2|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/top-of-the-lake-season-2|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''China Girl'' began shooting on location in [[Sydney, Australia]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Han|first=Angie|title=Elisabeth Moss Returning for ‘Top of the Lake’ Season 2|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/top-of-the-lake-season-2/|work=SlashFilm|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shechet|first=Ellie|title=Season 2 of ''Top of the Lake'' Will Take Place in Sydney and Hong Kong|url=http://jezebel.com/season-2-of-top-of-the-lake-will-take-place-in-sydney-a-1719784402|work=Jezebel|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campion returned as co-writer and co-director. [[Gerard Lee]] returned as co-writer. The original co-director, Garth Davis, was replaced by [[Ariel Kleiman]] due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Laura|title=Gwendoline Christie Joins Elisabeth Moss for Series 2 of Jane Campion’s ‘Top of the Lake’|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/gwendoline-christie-joins-elisabeth-moss-for-season-2-of-jane-campions-top-of-the-lake-240501/|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippa Campbell]] returned as producer. Actress [[Nicole Kidman]] joined the cast for ''China Girl'', which is the second time she has worked with Campion.

| ShortSummary    = In [[Sydney]], brothel owners Bootie and Dang throw a heavy suitcase off a cliff into the ocean. Four years after the events with Tui, Robin tries to adjust back to life in Sydney while dealing with residual [[PTSD]] from shooting Al Parker. Parker turned witness in the case of the paedophile ring in exchange for immunity, but has now filed a civil suit against Robin, claiming the shooting was personally motivated. Robin's daughter, Mary, is now nearly 18 and exhibiting signs of mental instability that her adoptive parents worry is more than teen angst. Unbeknownst to her parents, Mary is dating a 42-year-old German, Alexander, nicknamed "Puss", who lives above a brothel, Silk 41. Mary is enamoured with Puss, who claims to be "empowering" the young Asian prostitutes by teaching them English and other life lessons. Mary is aggressively rebelling and openly hostile against her adoptive parents, Pyke and Julia, who are getting a divorce after Julia came out as a lesbian. Pyke and Julia are appalled after meeting Puss, who informs them he plans to marry Mary. Robin's new boss, Detective Sergeant Adrian Butler, brings a large stuffed panda to a young Asian woman. Brett, a socially awkward university student who frequents brothels, worries because he can't find a prostitute named Cinnamon, whom he believes is his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the suitcase washes up on [[Bondi Beach]] and it contains the decomposing body of a woman. Robin and a rookie constable, the awkward Miranda, are assigned to the case.

| ShortSummary    = A flashback reveals that four weeks earlier, Johnno was arrested on their wedding day after his pot farm was raided, and Robin left him after discovering he had cheated on her as well. Meanwhile, Tui is now raising her son at the women's commune. In the present, Robin, who had three miscarriages while with Johnno, has nightmares about babies. Robin is obsessed with the case of the Asian Jane Doe found in the suitcase, dubbed "China Girl," whose cause of death was possibly strangulation. With no matching reports from missing persons, they suspect she was working as a prostitute, possibly entering the country with a false passport. Robin and Miranda observe the autopsy, where the coroner learns that China Girl was about 17 weeks pregnant. An emotional Miranda leaves the autopsy when she sees the tiny foetus, and she later reveals she is 18 weeks pregnant. Robin is irritated by Miranda, but Adrian insists they work together, because nobody else will work with either of them. They visit brothels, which are [[Prostitution in Australia#New South Wales|legal in Sydney]]. Robin notices a large stuffed panda at one, Silk 41, and asks Adrian what happened to the one he had in his office. He claims he gave it to his son. Brett goes to Silk 41 to find Cinnamon, and is eventually told she went to [[Canberra]]. He refuses to believe she would without telling him. Robin finally works up the courage to contact Mary, leaving a letter at the Edwards' home. She first meets with Pyke and Julia at his office, and Julia angrily informs her that Mary's behavioural problems began four years earlier, after she never received a reply to the letter she sent Robin. She chastises her for not having the decency to respond, and that Mary agonised over whether she had said something wrong in the letter. Julia storms off, but Pyke is more patient and listen as Robin explains she was just 16 years old when Mary was born. Robin is able to meet Mary, who behaves oddly and exhibits very low self-esteem. Mary reveals she assumed that she was the product of rape, which Robin confirms. Mary volunteers to murder her mother's rapist, and Robin confesses that she never knew who the father was, being a victim of a gang rape. A DNA test on the male foetus reveals China Girl was not his biological mother, mystifying the pathologist. Robin, though, realises the dead girl was acting as a surrogate mother, changing the course of the investigation.

| Viewers         = 1.97
| ShortSummary    = Robin believes that China Girl was acting as an illegal surrogate, as the law states surrogates must be over 25 and have already had a child of their own, and thus the biological parents were working outside the normal system. She and Miranda visit a fertility clinic, where a doctor tells Robin that although many parents may be desperate enough to try illegal surrogacy, that would bring great risk as the law would side with the surrogate mother, who could decide to keep the child. Robin comes out to see Miranda arguing with the receptionist. Robin gets a lead after potentially finding the biological parents for whom China Girl was a surrogate, after a mentally unstable woman is wandering in traffic, crying about her missing baby. Robin visits the woman, Felicity, and her husband, Mike, in the psychiatric ward. Mike, who has a criminal record for cocaine possession, eventually agrees to take a DNA test. Robin is irritated by Miranda, who smokes and drinks despite her pregnancy, and who is now sleeping with Robin's brother on top of having an affair with the married Adrian. Another detective, Stally, continues to make unwanted advances on Robin. After some investigating, Pyke and Julia confront Puss with the fact that he is already married, causing him to have a bizarre outburst in a restaurant and a further rift between them and Mary. Puss locks himself in his apartment and refuses to see Mary or any of the prostitutes in to see him. After being called by Pyke, Robin takes Mary to her apartment, where Mary breaks down because of Puss refusing to see her. Robin's mediation with Al, now confined to a wheelchair, does not go as planned when he tries to kill her before it begins.

| ShortSummary    = Puss manipulates Mary to start working as a prostitute when she turns 18, mocking her for her privileged upbringing and implying she thinks she is better than her friends at the brothel. Pyke and Mary attend her school's Daddy/Daughter dance, which he has been looking forward to. Mary at first stops to check on Puss, who talks his way into attending, claiming he is her "Daddy." At the dance, he interrupts Pyke and Mary's waltz and causes outrage when he begins dancing sexually with Mary, and is thrown out. Brett, who has seen the news about the Asian Jane Doe, contacts the police and gives them a photo of Cinnamon. Upset that the police consider him a suspect, Brett tells them about the creepy guy at the brothel. As he describes him, Robin fears he is talking about Mary's boyfriend. Mary takes some of the prostitutes (whom she claims are students) to the beach with her, Pyke and Robin, to teach them how to swim. Puss comes along and, after noticing Robin's air of hostility towards him, he brings up her rape, makes sexually suggestive remarks and then violently attacks her, biting her on the nose. Mary, screaming and hitting herself in the head, convinces Robin not to press charges. The DNA test reveals that Felicity and Mike are not the biological parents, but Robin is shocked to find out they have three young Asian women as surrogate mothers. Mary asks Dang to start working there, and Dang refuses. On Mary's 18th birthday, Puss takes Mary to a hookers' strip. She says she is afraid and he hits her in the face. He tells her that is worse than what any John will do to her, and now she doesn't have to be afraid, and then leaves her there. Unable to complete the act, she is thrown out of a car by a John, and phones Robin for help. In Robin's car, Mary sees the photo of Cinnamon, whom she recognises.  Robin hints that Mary is in great danger. At Robin's apartment, Mary breaks down crying, saying she doesn't know how to leave him.

| ShortSummary    = Mary leaves the safety of Robin's home to reconnect with Puss, who learns from her that Robin is looking into the murder of Cinnamon. Robin tells Pyke about picking Mary up from under the overpass. Pyke wants to kill Puss, and Robin says even she arrests him, she knows he won't be held long. Brett becomes further unhinged after identifying her Cinnamon's body and begins suffering from hallucinations. Miranda has another crying spell at work and admits she fears her baby has died. They return to the same fertility clinic where Miranda shows the receptionist the photo of Cinnamon, and demands to know if she recognises her. Miranda informs her that the girl in the photo was not a student, but a sex worker, and then starts screaming that she wants an ultrasound. Robin takes her out to the beach to calm down, where Miranda reveals she is not actually pregnant and that her pregnancy is being done via surrogacy because of her own fertility issues. Miranda says their surrogate is pregnant with a daughter but has gone missing, and she fears it is because of a miscarriage. Miranda still insists that their surrogate was a student, but Robin asks if Adrian gave her a stuffed panda, because she saw one at Silk 41. A doctor at the fertility clinic, unaware that the girls were sex workers, connects Robin with a couple who identify Cinnamon as their surrogate mother, whose real name was Pathma. With the assistance of Mary's schoolfriend Michaela, Puss directs make some sort of "art film" with the prostitutes and Caucasian babies, set in a Thai village. Mary becomes worried when Caramel, another pregnant girl from Silk 41, is taken away by Puss and Dang. Connected by concern over Mary and Puss, Robin and Pyke grow closer, much to Julia's annoyance and jealousy. Brett, armed with a rifle, shows up at the brothel and demands to see Puss. Puss pushes Mary in front of him and escapes in the elevator as Brett fires the gun.

| ShortSummary    =Robin and Pyke make love when she receives a late-night call from Mary. Nobody speaks, but Robin hears people arguing about a taxi fare and Mary screams before the phone is disconnected. Miranda calls and tells her there was a shooting at Silk 41, and that the suspect is Brett Iles, who took Mary hostage. The taxi is found at Bondi Beach, with the taxi driver shot dead. Security footage from the brothel shows Puss escaping as Brett shot Bootie, before leaving with Mary. The security footage also shows another room, in which Miranda spots her surrogate. That room is not at the brothel, and none of the sex workers know its location. The next day, Pyke and Julia go to Mary's school to appeal to her classmates for any information. Michaela tells them about a place on [[Liverpool Street, Sydney|Liverpool Street]] called Stasi Cafe, where Mary first met Puss. The manhunt for Brett intensifies, but Robin is convinced he's still on Bondi Beach, now packed with people. She notices an empty case of beer that was there the previous night. She and Miranda move in and try to quietly move beachgoers away from the box. One group refuses to move and distracts Robin while Miranda discovers a shoe sticking out from the sand. She kicks the box away to find Brett's face peeking out, his eyes closed. Miranda moves in to check his pulse. Robin yells at Miranda to draw her weapon but she freezes. Brett suddenly pulls the rifle out of the sand and shoots Miranda in the abdomen. Robin jumps on him, her gun to his head, demanding to know where Mary is. Meanwhile, Mary shows up at home, unharmed. Crying, Julia begs her to stay, promising that she will change and try to understand her, but Mary leaves. Robin visits the hospital, where Miranda is in a coma, her outlook grim. Adrian vows to tell everyone he loves her, and begs Robin to find their surrogate. Robin finds Pyke at Stasi Cafe, where they kiss and embrace. He leaves after getting a text from Julia informing him that Mary's passport is missing. Robin then finds Puss in the kitchen, where she cuts him with a kitchen knife. He claims that Cinnamon hanged herself. Robin puts her gun to his head and he discloses the address of the missing surrogates, giving her the key. She shows up to find not only Adrian but the other expectant couples, including Felicia and Mike, all of whom received calls from their surrogates. They find the apartment empty, with a DVD left behind. Meanwhile, Mary escorts the dozen or so surrogates through the airport. Puss shows up as they board the plane, and Mary, upset, tells him that she could have been shot while he fled. He lies and tells her the elevator doors closed and he couldn't do anything. She asks what will happen to the babies and who will love them, and he tells them the "people who made them" will buy them back. She pulls away and he slaps her. She hits him back, over and over. Caramel calls for Mary, but she refuses to board and watches him leave. At the apartment, Adrian plays the DVD, which shows the video shot at the brothel of the Thai women with the babies. Puss narrates, mocking the parents, and accusing the West of exploiting the bodies of oppressed Asian women through prostitution and now surrogacy. He declares that their babies have flown away but each one will bring enough money to feed an entire poor village, as the video shows Bootie handing a bundle of cash in exchange for a white baby. Robin rushes to the airport, while the couples become hysterical, begging Adrian to call the airport and detain the women who are kidnapping their children. Adrian, stunned, tells them there is nothing that can be done legally, as the women can do whatever they want, even while pregnant with another mother's child. Robin arrives at the airport and finds an empty gate, with just the stuffed panda. Mary, however, is safe with her parents. Robin arrives at the Edwards' home, where Julia says she and Pyke are going to give it another try as a couple. Before she leaves, Robin asks if she can borrow the DVD Pyke told her about, showing Mary growing up. Julia protests and says it is their only copy, so Pyke says he will come pick it up as soon as Robin has finished watching it, which Robin says she will do that evening. Julia looks concerned, but says nothing. Later that night, Robin watches the video, crying happy tears, then looks up as she hears a knock on her door – presumably from Pyke.

There were also some less positive reviews.  Mike Hale of ''The New York Times'' criticized the "elaborately introduced plotlines" and described Tui's disappearance as "less a story element than a metaphor for the kind of armed resistance to male hegemony that constitutes the central idea of Ms Campion’s body of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/arts/television/top-of-the-lake-on-the-sundance-channel.html |title=Pregnant Girl Vanishes, and Story Lines Fork |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2296">The '''uterotubal junction''' or '''utero-tubal junction''' is the connection between the endometrial cavity of the [[uterus]] and the [[fallopian tube]] (uterine tube) at the proximal tubal opening, the beginning of the intramural part of the fallopian tube. Histologically, the endometrial [[epithelium]] changes over to the [[cilia]]ted tubal epithelium.

==Function==
Patency of the utero-tubal junction is necessary for normal reproduction. The tubes can get blocked here by infection ([[salpingitis]]) and surgical intervention may be necessary.
 
Mouse studies have indicated that selective passage of individual [[spermatozoa]] may occur at this junction,&lt;ref name=Nakanishi&gt;{{Cite journal | format = Free full text | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 71 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15151931 | title = Selective passage through the uterotubal junction of sperm from a mixed population produced by chimeras of calmegin-knockout and wild-type male mice | first7 = M. | issue = 3 | pages = 959–965 | pmid = 15151931 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.104.028647 | issn = 0006-3363| last5 = Baba | date=Sep 2004 | first6 = S. | first2 = A.| last3 = Yamaguchi| last2 = Isotani| last4 = Ikawa | first3 = R. | first4 = M.| last6 = Suarez| last7 = Okabe | first5 = T.| last1 = Nakanishi | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with abnormal morphology being identified as a significant selection criterion, leading to predominantly normal [[sperm]] passing towards the [[ovum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 38| issue = 1| journal = Reproduction | title = The Passage of Abnormal Spermatozoa Through the Uterotubal Junction of the Mouse | pmid = 4841384 | year=1974 | pages=81–90 | last1 = Krzanowska | first1 = H | doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0380081}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absence of the protein [[calmegin]] has also been suggested as a critical factor for reliable sperm passage.&lt;ref name=Nakanishi/&gt;

==Other==
The utero-tubal junction is accessible by [[hysteroscopy]] and the entry point for tubal [[cannulation]] and [[falloposcopy]]. Contraceptive methods have been developed to block the utero-tubal junction.

On 29 November 2017, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] became the first [[States and territories of Australia|Australian state]] to pass legislation allowing '''voluntary assisted dying'''.  The law gives anyone suffering a terminal illness, with less than six months to live, the right to end their life.  The law has an 18-month implementation period, and it will come into effect in mid 2019.

==The Bill==
On 20 September 2017, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 was introduced into the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]] by the [[Daniel Andrews|Andrews]] [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] Government. The bill is modelled on the recommendations of an expert panel chaired by former [[Australian Medical Association]] president [[Brian Owler|Professor Brian Owler]]. The proposed legislation was said by proponents to be the most conservative in the world; it contains 68 safeguards including measures designed to protect vulnerable people from coercion and abuse, as well as a Review Board to promote compliance.{{R|abc1909|Austlii1}} [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] and [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] [[Member of parliament#Australia|MPs]] were allowed a [[conscience vote]] on the Bill.{{R|"Premier2009"|"HS2009"}}

The bill was debated in the lower house over three sitting days, passing the assembly without amendment on 20 October 2017 after an emotional and tense debate{{R|"HStext"}} which lasted more than 24 hours.{{R|"Age2010"}} The bill was passed by 47 votes to 37.{{R|"abc2010"}} The bill moved to the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] for debate.

Former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Keating]] spoke out against the passing of the bill to the upper house saying "the passage of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill through the Victorian lower house is truly a sad moment for the whole country."{{R|"smh2010"}}

The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], who is also against euthanasia, said:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the Victorian parliament's job to do this, I'm not a supporter of euthanasia but I have been following the debate and it would be very interesting to see if their upper house passes it and what follows on from it. ... Federal law prevails over a state law but only in an area that both the Commonwealth and the state parliament have jurisdiction, so you've got to begin with an area where the federal parliament has jurisdiction.{{R|"TheAus2010"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 14 November 2017, the government agreed to a series of amendments designed to garner further support for the bill in the Council. For terminally ill adults in severe pain and with only 12 months to live, the deadline to access lethal drugs was cut to six months, except for sufferers of neurodegenerative conditions such as [[motor neurone disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]]. Additionally, an amendment restricting this scheme to people who have lived in Victoria for 12 months was accepted, as was a requirement for a death to be documented as assisted dying, in addition to noting the underlying disease. Funding for [[palliative care]] in regional areas was also increased as part of the agreement.{{R|"abc1411"}} On 22 November 2017, the bill in its amended form passed the Council by 22 votes to 18, after a marathon sitting lasting more than 28 hours.{{R|"CouncilPass"}}

The bill returned to the Legislative Assembly for consideration of the Council's amendments. The Assembly approved of the Council's amendments on 29 November 2017. In passing the legislation, Victoria became the first state to legalise voluntary assisted dying. The law received [[royal assent]] on 5 December 2017, will come into effect in mid-2019.{{R|"Worko"|"Act"}} The 18-month period will allow for implementation of the scheme including establishment of a review board.

==Reactions==
Kathy Eagar, the executive director of the Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration, and director of the Australian Health Services Research Institute at the University of Wollongong, has analysed the statistics surrounding euthanasia internationally, and says the law is limited. According to Eagar, the most important reason people choose euthanasia is that they don't want to lose their independence and autonomy. She believes euthanasia is a social issue and not not a health issue, and maintains that less than one in five people choose euthanasia due to pain.{{R|"abcEagar"}}
{{Quote|text=They've been very careful and very cautious in the approach, but a lot of the people who've been very strong advocates for euthanasia are not people with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.  They are people living with debilitating conditions for many, many years and they won't be eligible for voluntary assisted dying under the legislation...  "The conversation about, 'I am doing this because I want to make existential choices about the end of my life', that's a much harder conversation to have as a community, but it is the one we need."{{R|"abcEagar"}}|source= Kathy Eagar}}

Lorraine Baker, the Victorian President of the [[Australian Medical Association]], said that the passing of the legislation marked a ''"significant shift"'' in medical practice in Victoria, but the conscientious objection provisions contained in the legislation would ensure that doctors would not be forced into taking part in voluntary assisted dying.{{R|"AgeReact"}} 
{{Quote|text=The outcome of this parliamentary vote will cause anguish for some members of our profession, as well as the public...(doctors should not be involved in) interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a person's life|author=Lorraine Baker|source=''The Age'' newspaper 22 November 2017&lt;ref name="AgeReact"/&gt;}}

Euthanasia advocate [[Philip Nitschke]] called the law "beg and grovel legislation" because people will only be able to access it as a privilege granted ''in extremis'' rather than as a right to be accessed at a time nominated by the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Manch |first1=Thomas |title=Euthanasia pioneer warns of 'beg and grovel' legislation |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/108441737/Euthanasia-pioneer-warns-of-beg-and-grovel-legislation |accessdate=9 November 2018 |publisher=Stuff.nz.co |date=8 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Academy''' ('''WHA''') is an [[international non-governmental organization]] specializing in [[global health]]. It serves as a representative body for physicians worldwide, developing health policy, advancing continuing education programs, and speaking as a unified voice for medicine in international advocacy. The WHA is headquartered in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] and led by [[Robert A. Schwartz]], of [[Rutgers University]].

The WHA seeks to achieve optimal health for all people across borders, uniting the medical field to harness the collective expertise and power of its members. As the medical profession’s global and authoritative voice, the WHA assists governments and national medical associations in jointly tackling health problems and improving the welfare of their citizens.

The ''International Journal of Medicine'' is an [[open access]] [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the World Health Academy. It covers primary research and [[secondary research]] from any discipline within [[medicine]]. The ''IJM'' Editorial Board consist of [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, [[Lasker Award]] recipients, and other prominent persons. ''Dermatologic Therapy'', a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]], is also an official journal of the WHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Issue Information|journal=Dermatologic Therapy|volume=27|issue=1|year=2014|pages=ii–ii|issn=1396-0296|doi=10.1111/dth.12088|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/dth.12088/asset/dth12088.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hv74kq2h&amp;s=e2c60adc6b095f1acb61af3f19191f7d5f00ce43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
