'''''1634: The Ram Rebellion''''' is the seventh published work in the [[1632 series|1632]] alternate history book series, and is the third work to establish what is best considered as a "main plot line or thread" of historical [[alternate history|speculative]] focus that are loosely organized and classified geographically. The initial ''main thread'' is called the "Western and North-Central Europe thread" (encompassing northern and western Germany, [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the Baltic); the second plot line, encompassing events in Italy, Spain, the Mediterranean region, and France, the "South European thread", and this book can be considered the starting novel of the "South-Central/South-East thread" being set in southern Germany, Austria, [[Bavaria]], and [[Bohemia]]. This geographically organized plot thread actually began in ''[[Ring of Fire (anthology)|Ring of Fire]]'' in Flint's novelette "The Wallenstein Gambit" which is set in Bohemia, Austria, and Germany, which tied into stories in various [[The Grantville Gazettes|Grantville Gazettes]].

==Contents==

The book is hard to classify as it is an oddity, as acknowledged by series creator Eric Flint in the foreword; an anthology in fact, with several longer [[Novella|novelette]]s sandwiching seemingly unrelated short stories under a (hidden for a while) overarching story line that is capped off by a short novel that ''finally'' brings all the seemingly unrelated and disparate contents together in the latter part of the book.

Unlike most works in the 1632 series, much of this book is written from the standpoint of common people "in the street", including Germans trying to cope with [[Grantville (1632 series)|Grantsville]], [[West Virginia]], ''up-timers'' trying to cope with their new world around Grantville, and both trying to deal with the problems of two widely different cultures meeting in the new United States of Europe. These merging dynamics are the milieu shaping stories Flint felt necessary to include even though they are set in 1631—1632. Their impact extends throughout the book and into 1634, as well as across political boundaries and battle lines as the historical imperatives developed in this book extend into the direct sequel [[1634: The Bavarian Crisis]].

==Plot summary==
The book spot-covers local events and a few related diplomatic discussions from a few days after the Ring of Fire (May–June 1631) to October in the fall of 1634—giving it the largest time footprint of the four—though narrowly focused. The short novel that concludes the work begins in late August 1633 and overlaps many of the shorter works earlier in the book. Two of the three other books set in 1634 refer to the events in the work (usually as the "troubles in Franconia") setting its canonical place in the "greater" neohistorical international politics covered in the other two works.

==="Recipes for Revolution"===
The two Larkin "Birdie" Newhouse tales along with two flashback vignettes by Flint begin the Ram Rebellion book, all four set in the weeks immediately after the ''Ring of Fire''. In the Flint stories which are sandwiched around the Birdie tales, [[Mike Stearns]] goes back to school under the tutelage of Melissa Mailey. Stearns has a problem, he has to get a handle on likely complications from the local population, as the stories are set just a few days after he is elected as Chairman of the Emergency Committee. As a result, Mailey gives Stearns several very thick history books on European history in the era.

Birdie Newhouse has an immediate problem, he's a farmer with most of his farm's arable land 300 years off and a continent away. The stories by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett explore the alien land practices and ownership of down-time Germany as Birdie seeks to gain additional lands. Land sales are rare, worse, the lawyers are in control and there are three general levels of vested interest: The tenants, have certain rights and obligations over and above monetary rent while leases are generally for the lesser of three generations or 99 years. In between the owner in fact, and the tenants is usually a monetary transaction which gives the rents to any number of claimants—depending upon the finances of the landholding family. The claimants all have a say in the farm operation to some extent, as do the occupants of the farm villages, which also have the right to disapprove or accept new co-farmers, for the land is farmed cooperatively with another set of obligations and entitlements. Birdie can't just go and buy a piece of land, he has to buy it from three different and diverse groups of people... and get them all to agree to terms. As the story notes, seventeenth century [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] was a lawyer's paradise.

==="Enter the Ram"===
Flo Richards is a farmer's wife with four grown children who had bought a small flock of type C [[Delaine Merino]] sheep and some [[angora rabbits]] before the Ring of Fire in the hope that she'd see more of her youngest daughter, Jen, once she'd finished her studies out of town. The Ring of Fire had consequently left Jan behind in the present in which Flo dealt with this loss by concentrating on her livestock. She and her husband JD have local Germans living with them as partners now that farming has become more labour-intensive. Flo's laments about the poor quality wool of the locally obtained ram (who comes to be known as Brillo for that reason) strike a chord with someone and subsequently a number of 'Brillo fables' started to appear in the local broadsheet, which concerns the titular ram escaped from his pen and interfered with her merino breeding program. His fame due to the stories spread through Grantville out into the rest of Germany. The Women's League of Voters uses a Ram's Head as its emblem, schoolchildren sing songs about Brillo, and even adapted into a ballet.

==="The Trouble in Franconia"===
With the example of future Grantville, a peasant revolt becomes a revolutionary movement in the fractured [[Holy Roman Empire]] south and east of [[Thuringia]] while the Machiavellian maneuvers in the neohistorical governments and various field armies now dance to counter-act those aimed at the Americans' new heartland. ''Up-timers'', from the original USA [[space-time]] want the serfs to succeed and liberate themselves—but also know what a bloodbath the [[French Revolution]] became and various individuals act to help one and prevent the others. Avoiding that path will take all sorts of resources and efforts, and Americans from both uptime and ''down-time'' act resolutely to mitigate the problems, diplomacy to head off wars headed by authoritarians threatened by the new American ideals, and a deft appreciation of when not to fight and dangle an irresistible carrot instead.

==="The Ram Rebellion"===
In Franconia, schoolteacher Constantin Ableidinger has been reading ''[[Common Sense]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]]. He also finds the Brillo stories interesting. The farmers in Franconia (and Thuringia for that matter) have a history of dissent concerning serfdom and Mike Stearns has hopes of getting some fundamental changes made in the way that Franconia is run as a result of a farmer's rebellion of sorts. He neglects to include this in the briefing given to the civil servants sent down to administer Franconia although these people, Johnny F. and Noelle Murphy, among others have an effect on the schoolteacher's "Ram rebellion".

==Literary significance and reception==
Dana Blankenhorn of [[ZDNet]] called the book "a sort of open source novel" as a way of describing how Eric Flint invited other authors to contribute stories to this book in which it extends the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/open-source-content-moves-forward/1223 |title=Open source content moves forward |journal=[[ZDNet]] |date=July 18, 2007 |first=Dana |last=Blankenhorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer wrote that "the book gets mired down in detail. It was just too much information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xodiac.fo.cx/rev/view.php?bookid=492 |title=1634: The Ram Rebellion |website=Doug's Book Reviews |first=Doug |last=Linger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1634: The Ram Rebellion'' was listed on the [[Locus (magazine)]] Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2006, topping at number 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/07LocusBestsellers.html |title=Locus Bestsellers, July 2006 |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/08LocusBestsellers.html |title=Locus Bestsellers, August 2006 |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{African American topics sidebar|right}}
'''African-American studies''' is an interdisciplinary [[academic field]] devoted to the study of the history, culture, and politics of Black Americans. Taken broadly, the field studies not only the cultures of people of African descent in the United States, but the cultures of the entire [[African diaspora]] but it has been defined in different ways. The field includes scholars of [[African-American literature]], history, politics, religion and [[religious studies]], [[sociology]], and many other disciplines within the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/African_American_studies.aspx|title=African American studies facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about African American studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intensive academic efforts to reconstruct African-American history began in the late 19th century ([[W. E. B. Du Bois]], ''The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America'', 1896). Among the pioneers in the first half of the 20th century were [[Carter G. Woodson]],&lt;ref&gt;See Pero Gaglo Dagbovie: ''The Early Black History Movement, Carter G. Woodson, and Lorenzo Johnston Greene'', University of Illinois Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Melville Herskovits]], and [[Lorenzo Dow Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1012/features/legacy.shtml Jason Kelly, "Lorenzo Dow Turner, PhD ’26: A linguist who identified the African influences in the Gullah dialect" (''University of Chicago Magazine'', November-December 2010):]

“''Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect'' (1949) ... was considered not only the defining work of Gullah language and culture but also the beginning of a new field, African American studies. ‘Until then it was pretty much thought that all of the African knowledge and everything had been erased by slavery. Turner showed that was not true,’ [curator Alcione] Amos says. ‘He was a pioneer. He was the first one to make the connections between African Americans and their African past.’”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03gullah.html?pagewanted=2 Holland Cotter, "A Language Explorer Who Heard Echoes of Africa"] (''[[The New York Times]],'' September 2, 2010):

“Turner published ‘Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect,’ a book that would help pave the way for the field of African-American studies in the 1960s.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs and departments of African-American studies were first created in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of inter-ethnic student and faculty activism at many universities, sparked by a five-month strike for black studies at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State]]. In February 1968, San Francisco State hired [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Nathan Hare]] to coordinate the first black studies program and write a proposal for the first Department of Black Studies; the department was created in September 1968 and gained official status at the end of the five-months strike in the spring of 1969. The creation of programs and departments in black studies was a common demand of protests and [[sit-in]]s by minority students and their allies, who felt that their cultures and interests were underserved by the traditional academic structures.

Black studies is a systematic way of studying black people in the world&amp;nbsp;– such as their history, culture, sociology, and religion. It is a study of the black experience and the effect of society on them and their effect within society. This study aims to, among other things, help eradicate many racial stereotypes. Black studies implements: history, family structure, social and economic pressures, stereotypes, and gender relationships.

==The Origins of African-American studies==

===The Civil Rights context===

In the United States the 1960s is rightfully known as the “Turbulent Sixties”. During this time period the nation experienced great social unrest, as citizens challenged the social order in radical ways. Many movements took place in the United States during this time period, including: women’s rights movement, labor rights movement, and the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry DeMuth, "Fannie Lou Hamer: Tired of Being Sick and Tired," ''The Nation'', June 1, 1964, 548-551.&lt;/ref&gt;

The students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) were witnesses to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and by 1964 they were thrust into activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philips|first=Mary|title=Origins of Black Studies at UC Berkeley|journal=[[Journal of Western Black Studies]]|year=2010|volume=34|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1964, [[Jack Weinberg]], a former graduate student, was sitting at a table where the Congress of Racial Equality was distributing literature encouraging students to protest against institutional racism. Police asked Weinberg to produce his ID to confirm that he was a student, but he refused to do so and was therefore arrested.  In support of Weinberg 3,000 students surrounded the police vehicle, and even used the car as a podium from where they spoke about their right to engage in political protest on campus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Free Speech Café Mural | journal=Moffit Library | issue=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impromptu demonstration was the first of many protests, culminating in the institutionalization of African-American Studies.

Two months later students at UC Berkeley organized sit-in at the Sproul Hall Administration building to protest an unfair rule which prohibited all political clubs from fundraising, excluding the democrat and republican clubs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Origins of Black Studies at UC Berkeley | journal=Journal of Western Black Studies | year=2010 | issue=Print | pages=256 | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested 800 students. Students a “Freedom of Speech Movement” and Mario Savio became its poetic leader, stating that “freedom of speech was something that represents the very dignity of what a human is...."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), a well-connected and organized club, hosted a conference entitled “Black Power and its Challenges".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Black leaders who were directly tied to then ongoing civil rights movements spoke to a predominantly white audience about their respective goals and challenges. These leaders included [[Stokely Carmichael]] of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and [[James Bevel]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).

Educational conferences like that of SDS forced the university to take some measures to correct the most obvious racial issue on campus—the sparse black student population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"&gt;{{cite journal | title=EOP Offers Aid | journal=Daily Californian |date=19 October 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the school held its first official racial and ethnic survey, it which it was discovered that the “American Negro” represented 1.02% of the university population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Racial, ethnic minorities 7.02 percent of Cal Students | type=Editorial | journal=California Monthly |date=July–August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 the university instituted its Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) facilitated the increased minority student enrollment, and offered financial aid to minority students with high potential.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"/&gt; By 1970 there were 1,400 EOP students. As the minority student population increased tension between activists clubs and minorities rose, because minority wanted the reigns of the movement that affected them directly. One student asserted that it was “backward to educate white people about Black Power when many black people are still uneducated on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Negro Group Afro-American Rally Will Oppose SDS", ''Daily Californian'', Editorial, October 26, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; ”The members of the Afro-American Student Union (AASU) proposed an academic department called “Black Studies” in April 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Origins of Black Studies at UC Berkeley | type=Editorial | journal=Journal of Western Black Studies | year=2010 | pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"We demand a program of “Black Studies,” a program that will be of and for black people. We demand to be educated realistically and that no form of education which attempts to lie to us, or otherwise miss-educate us will be accepted."&lt;ref name="DailyCalifornian69"&gt;"Afro-American Studies Proposal", ''Daily Californian'', Editorial, March 4, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

AASU members asserted that “The young people of America are the inheritors of what is undoubtedly one of the most challenging, and threatening set of social circumstances that has ever fallen upon a generation of young people in history...."&lt;ref name="DailyCalifornian69" /&gt; AASU used these claims to gain ground on their proposal to create a black studies department. Nathan Hare, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University, created what was known as the “A Conceptual Proposal for Black Studies” and AASU used Hare’s framework to create a set of criteria.&lt;ref name="a3"&gt;{{cite book | title=An End to Silence: The San Francisco State Student Movement in the 60s | publisher=Pegasus | author=Barlow W. &amp; Shapiro | year=1971 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Black Studies Program was implemented by UC Berkeley administration on January 13, 1969. In 1969, [[St. Clair Drake]] was named the first chair of the degree granting, ''Program in African and Afro-American Studies'' at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/AAAS/aaas_online/aboutaaas/history.html|title=African &amp; African American Studies - Stanford University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Black Studies Programs and departments and programs around the nation were created in subsequent years.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

At [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], similarly, student activism led to the establishment of a Black Studies department, amidst great targeting and discrimination of student leaders of color on the University of California campuses.  In the fall of 1968, black students from UCSB joined the national civil rights movement to end racial segregation and exclusion of Black history and studies from college campuses.Triggered by  the insensitivity of the administration and general campus life, they occupied North Hall and presented the administration with a set of demands. Such efforts led to the eventual creation of the Black Studies department and the Center for Black Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/about|title=About the Department - Department of Black Studies - UC Santa Barbara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar activism was happening outside of California.  At [[Yale University]], a committee headed by political scientist [[Robert Dahl]] recommended establishing an undergraduate major in African-American culture, one of the first such at an American university.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/politics/robert-a-dahl-dies-at-98-defined-politics-and-power.html "Robert A. Dahl Dies at 98; Defined Politics and Power"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Feb. 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Ernie Davis]] from [[Syracuse University]] became the first African American to win the Heisman trophy in College football, it renewed debates about race in college campuses in the country. Inspired by the Davis win, civil rights movement and nationwide student activism, in 1969 Black and White students led by the Student African American Society (SAS) at [[Syracuse University]] marched in front of the building at [[Newhouse School of Public Communications|Newhouse]] and demanded Black studies be taught at Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewshouse.com/flash/revolutionary-minds|title=Revolutionary Minds - The NewsHouse - Syracuse University and Community News - S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed as an independent, underfunded non-degree offering program from 1971 until 1979.&lt;ref name="aas.syr.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.syr.edu/about/history.html|title=Redirect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the program became the [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University|Department of African American Studies]], offering degrees within the College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name="aas.syr.edu"/&gt;

===Recent challenges and criticism===

One of the major setbacks with Black Studies/African-American Studies Programs or departments is that there is a lack of financial resources available to student and faculty.&lt;ref name="BSCCD"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Black Studies: Challenges and Critical Debates | type=Editorial | journal=Journal of Western Black Studies | year=2010 | pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities and colleges around the country provided Black Studies programs with small budgets and therefore it is difficult for the department to purchase materials and hire staff. Because the budget allocated to Black Studies is limited some faculty are jointly appointed therefore, causing faculty to leave their home disciplines to teach a discipline of which they may not be familiar. Budgetary issues make it difficult for Black Studies Programs and departments to function, and promote themselves.

Some critics{{who|date=April 2016}} claim that racism perpetrated by many administrators hinders the institutionalization of Black Studies at major universities.&lt;ref name="BSCCD" /&gt; As with the case of UC Berkeley most of the Black Studies programs across the country were instituted because of the urging and demanding of black students to create the program. In many instances black students also called for the increased enrollment of black students and offer financial assistance to these students.&lt;ref name="BSCCD" /&gt; Also seen in the case of UC Berkeley is the constant demand to have such a program, but place the power of control in the hands of black people. The idea was that black studies could not be “realistic” if it was not taught by someone who was not accustomed to the black experience. On many campuses directors of black studies have little to no autonomy—they do not have the power to hire or grant tenure to faculty. On many campuses an overall lack of respect for the discipline has caused instability for the students and for the program.

In the past thirty years there has been a steady decline of Black studies scholars.&lt;ref name="BSCCD" /&gt;

===Recent trends: emergence of Black Male Studies (BMS)===

African-American studies scholars have often explored the unique experiences of black boys/men. This line of research dates back to W.E.B. Dubois in his analysis of black male training in his book [[Souls of Black Folk]]. Though African-American studies as its own discipline has been in decline, its perpetuation as a sub-discipline in various social science fields (e.g., education, sociology, cultural anthropology, urban studies) has risen. This rise has coincided with the emergence of men's studies (also referred to as masculine studies). Since the early 1980s increasing interest in Black males among scholars and policy makers has resulted in a marked rise in the sub-discipline Black Male Studies.

{{Criminal law}}
An '''assault''' is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html|title=Assault and Battery Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=criminal.findlaw.com|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]] and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. 

Traditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as "assault". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.

Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.

==Related definitions==

===Battery===
In jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:
* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

==Defenses==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M. Advocate'', [1975&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ScotHC HCJ_1, 1975 SLT 65, 1975 JC 30.|author=|date=|website=bailii.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&amp;nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&amp;nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Regional details==

===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=1985-46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt; This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; sections 351 through 358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - "Indian Penal Code"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===
'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025838/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===South Africa===
[[South African law]] does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. ''Assault'' is a [[common law crime]] defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him". The law also recognises the crime of ''assault with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]]'', where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Co |year=1996 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=405–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common law crime of ''[[indecent assault]]'' was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]], and replaced by a statutory crime of ''[[sexual assault]]''.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====
An assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing "actual bodily harm" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, "[[grievous bodily harm]]" (GBH).
;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as "malicious wounding" or "unlawful wounding". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as "wounding with intent". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

Other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:
;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or
:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].
;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.
;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).
;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).
;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].
;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.
;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply "evil intent",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

=== Australia ===
The term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4274/assault-laws-in-australia-definitions-and-defences.aspx|title=Assault Laws in Australia: Definitions and Defences|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

====Assault with further specific intent====
* Acts done to the person with intent to murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding or grievous bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use or possession of a weapon to resist arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault causing certain injuries====
* Actual bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the term is not defined in the ''Crimes Act'', but case law indicates actual bodily harm may include injuries such as bruises and scratches,&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|305|2009|litigants=R v McIntyre |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as psychological injuries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|442|2005|litigants=Li v R |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; if the injury inflicted is more than merely transient (the injury does not necessarily need to be permanent)&lt;ref&gt;''R v Donovan'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 498; [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/cases/NZPoliceLawRp/1934/8.pdf (1934) 5 New Zealand Police Law Reports 247].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|Felony Sentences in State Courts, study by the United States Department of Justice.]]

In the United States,{{where|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- federal? some states? all states and territories? including Louisiana which did not incorporate English common law? --&gt; assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless the victim is a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer){{fact|date=September 2018}}, or in New York State for example if the offender is a repeat offender. As a misdemeanor, however, it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record. The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at [[common law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002201839505900307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury; 
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:
* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another 
* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&amp;Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below.

In [[Kansas]] the law on assault states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |title=KS Statutes: Ch 21 Article 34: Crimes Against Persons |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114225316/http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Assault is intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.}}

In [[New York State]], assault (as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/120.05|title=Article 120 - NY Penal Law - Assault Menacing Stalking - Law|publisher=New York State Senate|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery; there is no crime of battery in New York. However, in New York if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact, that is called "menacing". A person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree (a [[misdemeanor|Class A misdemeanor]]; punishable with up to one year [[incarceration]], [[probation]] for an extended time, and a permanent [[criminal record]]) when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person, and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree (a [[Class E felony]]) if they have a previous conviction for the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-30.html|title=New York Consolidated Laws, Penal Law - PEN § 240.30 - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-harassment-laws.html|title=New York Harassment Laws - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/opinion/when-is-a-threat-a-criminal-act.html|title=Opinion - When Is a Threat a Criminal Act?|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/second-degree-aggravated-harassment.html|title=Second Degree Aggravated Harassment|author=|date=|website=The Law Office of Crotty &amp; Saland|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York also has specific laws against [[hazing]], when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5673">'''Australian realism''', also called '''Australian materialism''', is a school of [[philosophy]] that flourished in the first half of the 20th century in several universities in [[Australia]] including the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Adelaide]], and the [[University of Sydney]], and whose central claim, as stated by leading theorist [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]], was that "''whatever exists'' … is real, that is to say it is a spatial and temporal situation or occurrence that is on ''the same level of reality'' as anything else that exists".&lt;ref name=Baker,1986&gt;{{cite book | last = Baker | first = A.

L. Mackie]], [[Ullin Place]], [[J. J. C. Smart]], and [[David Stove]]. The label "Australian realist" was conferred on acolytes of Anderson by [[A J (Jim) Baker, Australian philosopher|A. J. Baker]] in 1986, to mixed approval from those [[Philosophical realism|realist]] philosophers who happened to be Australian.&lt;ref name=Sparkes,1991&gt;{{cite book | last = Sparkes | first = A.

== Origins ==
Australian realism began after John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927. His students included philosophers such as [[John Passmore]], J. L. Mackie, David Stove, [[Eugene Kamenka]] and David Malet Armstrong. Anderson viewed philosophy historically as a long argument beginning with [[Thales]]. Anderson proposed that there was nothing more to being than the spatio-temporal system and that a correct and coherent view of the world involved not only rejecting any sort of deity, but also the extraordinary entities postulated by so many philosophers, from at least the time of [[Plato]] to the present day.&lt;ref name=Franklin,2003&gt;{{cite book | last = Franklin | first = James | title = Corrupting the Youth: A History of Philosophy in Australia | publisher = Macleay Press | location = Sydney | year = 2003| isbn = 1-876492-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|chs1-2}} 

Independently from the Andersonians, in Adelaide during the 1950s, the [[mind–brain identity theory]] was being developed by two former students of [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[J. J. C. Smart]] (then Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Adelaide]]) and [[Ullin Place]].&lt;ref name="Franklin,2003"/&gt;{{rp|ch9}}

== Basic tenets ==
(1) All entities exist in spatio-temporal 'situations'. 'Situations' are all that exist. All situations have the same [[ontology|ontological]] status. There are no 'levels' of reality.

(2) All situations have a propositional form — that is, all situations have the form of "A is B".

(3) Reality is infinitely complex and plural. Every fact (which includes every “object”) is a complex situation: there are no simples, no atomic facts, no objects which cannot be expanded into facts.

(4) All situations exist independent of knowledge of them. 

(5) Determinism: all entities — objects, events, situations — are caused. 

(6) Ethics is concerned with establishing and describing what is Good. This is a positive science. It is not normative.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Renée, "Australian Realism", ''Remembering Hedley'', ANU E Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ian Fleming - 22 Ebury Street Blue Plaque.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[English Heritage]] blue plaque commemorating [[Ian Fleming]] at 22b [[Ebury Street]], [[Belgravia]], London (erected 1996)]]
A '''blue plaque''' is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, event, or former building on the site, serving as a [[historical marker]]. The term is used in the United Kingdom in two different senses. It may be used narrowly and specifically to refer to the "official" scheme administered by [[English Heritage]], and currently restricted to sites within [[Greater London]]; or it may be used less formally to encompass a number of similar schemes administered by organisations throughout the UK.

The "official" scheme traces its origins to that launched in 1866 in London, on the initiative of the politician [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]], to mark the homes and workplaces of famous people.&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Spencer |first=Howard |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/blue_plaques.html#1 |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |title=The commemoration of historians under the blue plaque scheme in London |year=2008 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/history-of-blue-plaques/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=The History of Blue Plaques |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been administered successively by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] (1866–1901), the [[London County Council]] (1901–1965), the [[Greater London Council]] (1965–1986) and [[English Heritage]] (1986 to date). It remains focused on London (now defined as [[Greater London]]), although between 1998 and 2005, under a trial programme since discontinued, 34 plaques were erected elsewhere in England. The first such scheme in the world, it has directly or indirectly provided the inspiration and model for many others.

Many other plaque schemes have since been initiated in the United Kingdom. Some are restricted to a specific geographical area, others to a particular theme of historical commemoration. They are administered by a range of bodies including [[Local government|local authorities]], [[Civic society|civic societies]], [[residents' association]]s and other organisations such as the [[Transport Trust]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], the [[Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]] and the British Comic Society. The plaques erected are made in a variety of designs, shapes, materials and colours: some are blue, others are not. However, the term "blue plaque" is often used informally to encompass all such schemes.

There are also commemorative plaque schemes throughout the world such as those in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Oslo]], [[Dublin]]; and in other cities in Australia, Canada, the [[Historical markers of the Philippines|Philippines]], Russia and the United States. The forms these take vary, and they are more likely to be known as [[historical marker]]s.

==In the United Kingdom==

===English Heritage scheme===
{{Further|List of English Heritage blue plaques in London}}
The original blue plaque scheme was established by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] in 1867, and since 1986 has been run by [[English Heritage]]. It is the oldest such scheme in the world.&lt;ref name="EHhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt; Since 1984 English Heritage have commissioned Frank Ashworth to make the plaques which have then been inscribed by his wife, Sue, at their home in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/ |title=Built to last: the making of a blue plaque |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=16 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English Heritage plans to erect an average of twelve new blue plaques each year in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/blue-plaques/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=Blue Plaque FAQS  |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are unveiled by prominent public people: for example, in 2010 a plaque dedicated to [[John Lennon]] was unveiled in Montagu Square by [[Yoko Ono]], at the house where the couple shot the cover of the album ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1323118/John-Lennon-Yoko-Onos-London-home-gets-blue-plaque.html |title=Getting back to where she once belonged: Yoko Ono unveils blue plaque at John Lennon's London home |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=23 October 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
After being conceived by politician [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] in 1863, the scheme was initiated in 1866 by Ewart, [[Henry Cole]] and the Society of Arts (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]]),&lt;ref&gt;Hansard vol 172 17 July 1863 quoted in 'The commemoration of historians under the blue plaque scheme in London' by author Howard Spencer&lt;/ref&gt; which erected plaques in a variety of shapes and colours.

The first plaque was unveiled in 1867 to commemorate [[Lord Byron]] at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, [[Cavendish Square]]. This house was demolished in 1889. The earliest blue plaque to survive, also put up in 1867, commemorates [[Napoleon III]] in King Street, [[St James's]].&lt;ref name="EHhistory"/&gt; Byron’s plaque was blue, but the colour was changed by the manufacturer [[Mintons Ltd|Minton, Hollins &amp; Co]] to chocolate brown to save money.&lt;ref name="lbkc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmblueplaques/general/about_blue_plaques.asp |title=About blue plaques |publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total the Society of Arts put up 35 plaques, fewer than half of which survive today. The Society only erected one plaque within the square-mile of the [[City of London]], that to [[Samuel Johnson]] on his [[Dr Johnson's House|house in Gough Square]], in 1876. In 1879, it was agreed that the [[City of London Corporation]] would be responsible for erecting plaques within the City to recognise its jurisdictional independence. This demarcation has remained ever since.&lt;ref name="EHhistory"/&gt;

In 1901, the Society of Arts scheme was taken over by the [[London County Council]] (LCC),&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt; which gave much thought to the future design of the plaques. It was eventually decided to keep the basic shape and design of the Society's plaques, but to make them uniformly blue, with a laurel wreath and the LCC's title.&lt;ref name="EHdesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/about/design/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=The Blue Plaque Design |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this design was used consistently from 1903 to 1938, some experimentation occurred in the 1920s, and plaques were made in bronze, stone and lead. Shape and colour also varied.&lt;ref name="EHdesign"/&gt;

In 1921, the most common (blue) plaque design was revised, as it was discovered that glazed ceramic [[Royal Doulton|Doulton ware]] was cheaper than the [[encaustic tile|encaustic]] formerly used. In 1938, a new plaque design was prepared by an unnamed student at the LCC's Central School of Arts and Crafts and was approved by the committee. It omitted the decorative elements of earlier plaque designs, and allowed for lettering to be better spaced and enlarged. A white border was added to the design shortly after, and this has remained the standard ever since.&lt;ref name="lbkc"/&gt; No plaques were erected between 1915 and 1919, or between 1940 and 1947, owing to the two world wars.&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; The LCC formalised the selection criteria for the scheme in 1954.&lt;ref name="EHhistory"/&gt;

When the LCC was abolished in 1965, the scheme was taken over by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). The principles of the scheme changed little, but now applied to the entire, much larger, administrative county of [[Greater London]]. The GLC was also keen to broaden the range of people commemorated. The GLC erected 252 plaques, the subjects including [[Sylvia Pankhurst]],&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|473}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Seacole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the GLC was disbanded and the blue plaques scheme passed to [[English Heritage]]. English Heritage erected more than 300 plaques in London.

In January 2013 English Heritage suspended proposals for plaques owing to funding cuts.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blue plaques scheme suspended after 34% cut in government funding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jan/06/blue-plaques-cut-government-funding|accessdate=7 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 January 2013 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/blue-plaques/ |title=Blue Plaques scheme position statement |date=8 January 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s chairman stated that his organisation might step in to save the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9786341/National-Trust-could-save-blue-plaques.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Louise | last=Gray | title=National Trust could save blue plaques | date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event the scheme was relaunched by English Heritage in June 2014 with private funding (including support from a new donors' club, the Blue Plaques Club, and from property developer [[David Pearl (businessman)|David Pearl]]).&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/london-blue-plaques-re-open-for-nominations/|title=London Blue Plaques Re-Open For Nominations – 18 June 2014 |work=English Heritage |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two members of the advisory panel, Professor [[David Edgerton (historian)|David Edgerton]] and author and critic Gillian Darley, resigned over this transmutation, concerned that the scheme had been "reduced to a marketing tool for English Heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=London Blue Plaques scheme re-launched |journal=Salon: [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] Online Newsletter |volume=322 |date=23 June 2014 |url=http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5557bc147d34993782f185bde&amp;id=413251937e#mctoc16 |accessdate=27 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts, [[Historic England]] (a statutory body), and the new English Heritage Trust (a charity, which took over the English Heritage operating name and logo). Responsibility for the blue plaque scheme passed to the English Heritage Trust.

====Criteria====
To be eligible for an English Heritage blue plaque in London the famous person concerned must:&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/propose-a-plaque/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=Propose a plaque |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth. Fictional characters are not eligible;
* Be considered eminent by a majority of members of their own profession; have made an outstanding contribution to human welfare or happiness;
* Have lived or worked in that building in London (excluding the City of London and [[Whitehall]]) for a significant period, in time or importance, within their life and work; be recognisable to the well-informed passer-by, or deserve national recognition.

In cases of foreigners and overseas visitors, candidates should be of international reputation or significant standing in their own country.

With regards to the location of a plaque:
* Plaques can only be erected on the actual building inhabited by a figure, not the site where the building once stood, or on buildings that have been radically altered;
* Plaques are not placed onto boundary walls, gate piers, educational or ecclesiastic buildings, or the [[Inns of Court]];
* Buildings marked with plaques should be visible from the public highway;
* A single person may not be commemorated with more than one blue plaque in London.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

Other schemes have different criteria, which are often less restrictive: in particular, it is common under other schemes for plaques to be erected to mark the sites of demolished buildings.

====Selection process====
Almost all the proposals for English Heritage blue plaques are made by members of the public who write or email the organisation before submitting a formal proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/how-to-propose-a-blue-plaque/ |title=How to propose a Blue Plaque |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English Heritage's in-house historian researches the proposal, and the Blue Plaques Panel advises on which suggestions should be successful. This is composed of 9 people from various disciplines from across the country. The panel is chaired by Professor [[Ronald Hutton]], and includes former [[Poet Laureate]] Professor Sir [[Andrew Motion]] and buildings historian Professor [[Gavin Stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue Plaques Panel |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/who-we-are/how-we-are-run/committees-and-panels/blueplaquespanel/ |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor and broadcaster [[Stephen Fry]] was formerly a member of the panel, and wrote the foreword to the book ''Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5788181/Lived-in-London-Blue-Plaques-and-the-Stories-Behind-Them-by-Emily-Cole-review.html  |title=Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them by Emily Cole: review  |author=Parker, Peter |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly a third of proposals are approved in principle, and are placed on a shortlist. Because the scheme is so popular, and because a lot of detailed research has to be carried out, it takes about three years for each case to reach the top of the shortlist. Proposals not taken forward can only be re-proposed once 10 years have elapsed.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

====Event plaques====
A small minority of GLC and English Heritage plaques have been erected to commemorate events which took place at particular locations rather than the famous people who lived there.

====Outside London====
[[File:Peter Ellis Plaque at 40 Falkner Square.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|English Heritage plaque&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1412}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 40 [[Falkner Square]], [[Liverpool]], commemorating [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]], architect (erected 2001)]]
In 1998, English Heritage initiated a trial national plaques scheme, and over the following years erected 34 plaques in [[Birmingham]], [[Merseyside]], [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]]. The scheme was discontinued in 2005. Although English Heritage no longer erects plaques outside Greater London, it does provide advice and guidance to individuals and organisations interested or involved in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20150517233221/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/faq/ |title=About Blue Plaques: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other schemes===
The popularity of English Heritage's London blue plaques scheme has meant that a number of comparable schemes have been established elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Many of these schemes also use blue plaques, often manufactured in metal or plastic rather than the ceramic used in London, but some feature plaques of different colours and shapes. In July 2012, English Heritage published a register of plaque schemes run by other organisations across England.&lt;ref name="local register"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/register/ |title=Register of Plaque Schemes |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria for selection varies greatly. Many schemes treat plaques primarily as memorials and place them on the sites of former buildings, in contrast to the strict English Heritage policy of only installing a plaque on the actual building in which a famous person lived or an event took place.

====London====
[[File:Lloyds Coffee House (3984416269).jpg|thumb|left|Corporation of London plaque on the site of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]] in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]]]]
[[File:Josef Dallos plaque.jpg|thumb|right|upright|City of Westminster green plaque at 18 [[Cavendish Square]], [[Marylebone]], commemorating [[Josef Dallos]], contact lens pioneer (erected 2010)]]

The [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] continues to run its own plaque scheme for the [[City of London]], where English Heritage does not erect plaques. City of London plaques are blue and ceramic, but are rectangular in shape and carry the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="EHhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visiting-the-city/walks-tours-and-architecture/blue-plaques/Pages/default.aspx |title=Blue plaques |publisher=City of London |accessdate=19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rapidity of change in the built environment within the City, a high proportion of Corporation of London plaques mark the sites of former buildings.

Many of the 32 [[London boroughs]] also now have their own schemes, running alongside the English Heritage scheme. [[Westminster City Council]] runs a green plaque scheme, each plaque being sponsored by a group with a particular interest in its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Green Plaques Scheme |accessdate=7 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Borough of Southwark]] started its own blue plaque scheme in 2003, under which the borough awards plaques through popular vote following public nomination: living people may be commemorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southwark.gov.uk/DiscoverSouthwark/BluePlaquesSection/blueplaques2007/ |title=Blue Plaque Winners 2007 |publisher=Southwark Borough Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913030453/http://www.southwark.gov.uk/DiscoverSouthwark/BluePlaquesSection/blueplaques2007/ |archivedate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Borough of Islington]] has a very similar green heritage plaque scheme, initiated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/recent_plaques/Pages/default.aspx |title=Recent Plaques |publisher=London Borough of Islington |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322125600/http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/recent_plaques/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=22 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plaques may be erected by smaller groups, such as [[residents' association]]s. In 2007 [http://www.hgsra.org.uk/ The Hampstead Garden Suburb Residents Association] erected a blue plaque in memory of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] at 12 Southway as part of the centenary celebrations of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]].

====Northern Ireland====
In [[Northern Ireland]] the [[Ulster History Circle]] is one of a small number of groups administering blue plaques. Established in 1983, it has erected around 140 plaques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/index.htm  |title=THe Ulster History Circle |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belfast City Council]] also has a scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/news/news.asp?id=2492&amp;month=February%202011 |title=Poet and broadcaster remembered  |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985, they were made of cast aluminium, colour-coded to reflect the type of commemoration (blue for people; red for events in the city's social history; black for buildings of architectural or historic interest; green for other subjects). After a period of abeyance, the scheme has been revived and all plaques are now patinated bronze.&lt;ref name="manchester plaques"/&gt;

==In other countries==
Commemorative plaque schemes (not all of them using blue plaques) also exist most notably in the cities of Paris, Rome, Oslo and Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/places |title=Plaques by Country |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, commemorative plaques similar to those used in Europe are called [[historical marker]]s. These vary in colour and design by state. The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] or the U.S. government, through the [[National Register of Historic Places]], can bestow historical status, with a small bronze marker affixed to the building.  Other markers are erected by state historical commissions and similar authorities, local governments or civic groups.  These can also be affixed to the building, but are frequently free-standing markers with the text on each side, or, in larger instances, beginning on one side and continuing to the other.

Most states in Australia have historic marker programs.

[[Chemical element]]s may or may not be included in the definition, depending on expert viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Scerri-2005"/&gt;

Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from [[mixture]]s. A common example of a chemical substance is pure [[Water (molecule)|water]]; it has the same properties and the same [[ratio]] of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] whether it is isolated from a river or made in a [[laboratory]]. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are [[diamond]] (carbon), [[gold]], [[Edible salt|table salt]] ([[sodium chloride]]) and refined [[sugar]] ([[sucrose]]). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.

Chemical substances exist as [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es, or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and may change between these [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] with changes in [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]. Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of [[chemical reaction]]s.

Forms of [[energy]], such as [[light]] and [[heat]], are not matter, and are thus not "substances" in this regard.

==Definition==
[[File:Nile red 01.jpg|thumb|Colors of a single chemical ([[Nile red]]) in different solvents, under visible and UV light, showing how the chemical interacts dynamically with its solvent environment.]]
A chemical substance may well be defined as "any [[material]] with a definite chemical composition" in an introductory general chemistry textbook.&lt;ref name="HillPetrucciP5"&gt;Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., p5, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure [[chemical element]] or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form of [[matter]] that has both definite composition and distinct properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/p/u/pure%20substance/source.html |title=Pure Substance – DiracDelta Science &amp; Engineering Encyclopedia |publisher=Diracdelta.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181524/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/p/u/pure%20substance/source.html |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical substance index published by [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] also includes several [[alloys]] of uncertain composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/58D34DD3892142D18F5C3B0A004D3A0C/indexguideapp.pdf Appendix IV: Chemical Substance Index Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203025138/http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/58D34DD3892142D18F5C3B0A004D3A0C/indexguideapp.pdf |date=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-stoichiometric compound]]s are a special case (in [[inorganic chemistry]]) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of [[palladium hydride]]. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including – (i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/newchems/pubs/invntory.htm|title=What is the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory?|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2009-10-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605152252/http://www.epa.gov/oppt/newchems/pubs/invntory.htm|archivedate=2009-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], substances of uniform composition are called [[mineral]]s, while physical mixtures ([[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]]) of several minerals (different substances) are defined as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. Many minerals, however, mutually dissolve into [[solid solution]]s, such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a mixture in stoichiometric terms. [[Feldspar]]s are a common example: [[anorthoclase]] is an alkali aluminum silicate, where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium.

In law, "chemical substances" may include both pure substances and mixtures with a defined composition or manufacturing process. For example, the [[European Union|EU]] regulation [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] defines "monoconstituent substances", "multiconstituent substances" and "substances of unknown or variable composition". The latter two consist of multiple chemical substances; however, their identity can be established either by direct chemical analysis or reference to a single manufacturing process. For example, [[charcoal]] is an extremely complex, partially polymeric mixture that can be defined by its manufacturing process. Therefore, although the exact chemical identity is unknown, identification can be made to a sufficient accuracy. The CAS index also includes mixtures.

[[Polymer]]s almost always appear as mixtures of molecules of multiple molar masses, each of which could be considered a separate chemical substance. However, the polymer may be defined by a known precursor or reaction(s) and the [[molar mass distribution]]. For example, [[polyethylene]] is a mixture of very long chains of -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- repeating units, and is generally sold in several molar mass distributions, [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Medium-density polyethylene|MDPE]], [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]].

==History==
The [[concept]] of a "chemical substance" became firmly established in the late eighteenth century after work by the chemist [[Joseph Proust]] on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as [[basic copper carbonate]].&lt;ref name="Hill_et_al_p37"&gt;Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., p37, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He deduced that, "All samples of a compound have the same composition; that is, all samples have the same proportions, by mass, of the elements present in the compound." This is now known as the [[law of constant composition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/LawofDefiniteProportion.html Law of Definite Proportions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118150853/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/LawofDefiniteProportion.html |date=November 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later with the advancement of methods for [[chemical synthesis]] particularly in the realm of [[organic chemistry]]; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of [[analytical chemistry]] used for isolation and purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern [[chemistry]], the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks. However, there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in chemistry literature need to be indexed.

[[Isomerism]] caused much consternation to early researchers, since [[isomers]] have exactly the same composition, but differ in configuration (arrangement) of the atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of [[benzene]], until the correct structure was described by [[Friedrich August Kekulé]]. Likewise, the idea of [[stereoisomerism]] – that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement – was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, [[tartaric acid]] has three distinct isomers, a pair of [[diastereomer]]s with one diastereomer forming two [[enantiomer]]s.

==Chemical elements==
[[File:Schwefel 01.jpg|thumb|Native sulfur crystals. Sulfur occurs naturally as elemental sulfur, in [[sulfide]] and [[sulfate]] minerals and in [[hydrogen sulfide]].]]
{{Main|Chemical element}}
{{See also|List of elements}}
An [[chemical element|element]] is a chemical substance made up of a particular kind of atom and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element, though it can be transmuted into another element through a [[nuclear reaction]]. This is so, because all of the atoms in a sample of an element have the same number of protons, though they may be different [[isotope]]s, with differing numbers of neutrons.

As of 2012, there are 118 known elements, about 80 of which are stable – that is, they do not change by [[radioactive decay]] into other elements. Some elements can occur as more than a single chemical substance ([[allotropes]]). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The majority of elements are classified as [[metal]]s. These are elements with a characteristic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] such as [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[gold]]. Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well, and they are [[Malleability|malleable]] and [[Ductility|ductile]].&lt;ref name="Hill_et_al_pp44-45"&gt;Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., pp&amp;nbsp;45–46, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Around a dozen elements,&lt;ref&gt;The boundary between metalloids and non-metals is imprecise, as explained in the previous reference.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]], are classified as [[non-metal]]s. Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high [[electronegativity]] and a tendency to form [[Ion|negative ions]]. Certain elements such as [[silicon]] sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are known as [[metalloid]]s.

==Chemical compounds==
[[File:Potassium-ferricyanide-sample.jpg|thumb|[[Potassium ferricyanide]] is a compound of potassium, iron, carbon and nitrogen; although it contains cyanide anions, it does not release them and is nontoxic.]]
{{Main|Chemical compound}}
{{See also|List of organic compounds|List of inorganic compounds}}
A pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of [[molecule]]s or [[ion]]s. Two or more elements combined into one substance through a [[chemical reaction]] form a [[chemical compound]]. All compounds are substances, but not all substances are compounds.

A chemical compound can be either atoms [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s in which atoms, molecules or ions form a [[crystal structure|crystalline lattice]]. Compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called [[organic compound]]s, and all others are called [[inorganic compound]]s. Compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called [[organometallic compound]]s.

Compounds in which components share electrons are known as [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds. Compounds consisting of oppositely charged [[ion]]s are known as [[ionic bond|ionic]] compounds, or [[salt (chemistry)|salts]].

In organic chemistry, there can be more than one chemical compound with the same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called [[isomer]]s. Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, and often may be isolated without spontaneously interconverting. A common example is [[glucose]] vs. [[fructose]]. The former is an [[aldehyde]], the latter is a [[ketone]]. Their interconversion requires either [[Glucose isomerase|enzymatic]] or [[Lobry–de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation|acid-base catalysis]].

However, [[tautomer]]s are an exception: the isomerization occurs spontaneously in ordinary conditions, such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers, even if these can be identified spectroscopically or even isolated in special conditions. A common example is [[glucose]], which has open-chain and ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the [[hemiacetal]] form.

==Substances versus mixtures==
[[File:Vintage cranberry glass.jpg|thumb|right|Cranberry glass, while it looks homogeneous, is a ''mixture'' consisting of glass and [[gold]] colloidal particles of ca. 40 nm diameter, which give it a red color.]]
{{Main|Mixture}}
All matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds, but these are often intimately mixed together. Mixtures contain more than one chemical substance, and they do not have a fixed composition. In principle, they can be separated into the component substances by purely [[Mechanics|mechanical]] processes. [[Butter]], [[soil]] and [[wood]] are common examples of mixtures.

Grey iron metal and yellow [[sulfur]] are both chemical elements, and they can be mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow-grey mixture. No chemical process occurs, and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process, such as using a [[magnet]] to attract the iron away from the sulfur.

In contrast, if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio (1 atom of iron for each atom of sulfur, or by weight, 56 [[gram]]s (1 [[mole (unit)|mol]]) of iron to 32&amp;nbsp;grams (1&amp;nbsp;mol) of sulfur), a chemical reaction takes place and a new substance is formed, the compound [[iron(II) sulfide]], with chemical formula FeS. The resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is not a mixture. Iron(II) sulfide has its own distinct properties such as [[melting point]] and [[solubility]], and the two elements cannot be separated using normal mechanical processes; a magnet will be unable to recover the iron, since there is no metallic iron present in the compound.

==Chemicals versus chemical substances==
While the term ''chemical substance'' is a precise technical term that is synonymous with ''chemical'' for chemists, the word ''chemical'' is used in general usage in the English speaking world to refer to both (pure) chemical substances and mixtures (often called ''compounds''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/compound ''compound''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030500/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/compound |date=2017-11-07 }} in Oxford Online Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; and especially when produced or purified in a laboratory or an industrial process.&lt;ref name=chemical&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chemical ''chemical''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055113/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chemical |date=2017-11-07 }} in Oxford Online Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicnas.gov.au/Industry/New_Chemicals/Does_My_Chemical_Require_Notification/What_Is_A_Chemical.asp |title=What is a chemical |publisher=Nicnas.gov.au |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213642/http://www.nicnas.gov.au/Industry/New_Chemicals/Does_My_Chemical_Require_Notification/What_Is_A_Chemical.asp |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the chemical substances of which fruits and vegetables, for example, are naturally composed even when growing wild are not called "chemicals" in general usage. In countries that require a list of ingredients in products, the "chemicals" listed are industrially produced "chemical substances". The word "chemical" is also often used to refer to addictive, narcotic, or mind-altering drugs.&lt;ref name=chemical/&gt;&lt;ref name=rh&gt;[https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/chemical Random House Unabridged Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107025305/https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/chemical |date=2017-11-07 }}, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the chemical industry, manufactured "chemicals" are chemical substances, which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals, [[fine chemical]]s and chemicals found in research only:
* Bulk chemicals are produced in very large quantities, usually with highly optimized continuous processes and to a relatively low price.
* Fine chemicals are produced at a high cost in small quantities for special low-volume applications such as biocides, pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for technical applications.
* Research chemicals are produced individually for research, such as when searching for synthetic routes or screening substances for pharmaceutical activity. In effect, their price per gram is very high, although they are not sold.
The cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the molecular structure of the chemical. Bulk chemicals are usually much less complex. While fine chemicals may be more complex, many of them are simple enough to be sold as "building blocks" in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for single use, as named above. The ''production'' of a chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-products and impurities involved in the synthesis. The last step in production should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals. The required purity and analysis depends on the application, but higher tolerance of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals. Thus, the user of the chemical in the US might choose between the bulk or "technical grade" with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer "pharmaceutical grade" (labeled "USP", [[United States Pharmacopeia]]). "Chemicals" in the commercial and legal sense may also include mixtures of highly variable composition, as they are products made to a technical specification instead of particular chemical substances. For example, [[gasoline]] is not a single chemical compound or even a particular mixture: different gasolines can have very different chemical compositions, as "gasoline" is primarily defined through source, properties and [[octane rating]].

==Naming and indexing==
Every chemical substance has one or more [[systematic name]]s, usually named according to the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC rules for naming]]. An alternative system is used by the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS).

Many compounds are also known by their more common, simpler names, many of which predate the systematic name. For example, the long-known [[sugar]] [[glucose]] is now systematically named 6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. [[Secondary metabolite|Natural products]] and [[pharmaceutical]]s are also given simpler names, for example the mild pain-killer [[Naproxen]] is the more common name for the chemical compound (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid.

[[Chemist]]s frequently refer to [[chemical compound]]s using [[chemical formula]]e or [[molecular structure]] of the compound. There has been a phenomenal growth in the number of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the [[scientific literature]] by professional chemists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joachim Schummer |url=http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ed01/Jslit/eduquim.htm |title=Coping with the Growth of Chemical Knowledge: Challenges for Chemistry Documentation, Education, and Working Chemists |publisher=Rz.uni-karlsruhe.de |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917052259/http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ed01/Jslit/eduquim.htm |archivedate=2013-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.org/newsevents/releases/60millionth052011.html |title=Chemical Abstracts substance count |publisher=Cas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140120/http://cas.org/newsevents/releases/60millionth052011.html |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like [[IUPAC]] and CAS have initiated steps to make such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as [[CAS registry number]] to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as [[chemistry journal]]s and [[patent]]s). This information is compiled as a [[database]] and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]] and the [[International Chemical Identifier]] or InChI.

==Isolation, purification, characterization, and identification==
Often a pure substance needs to be isolated from a [[mixture]], for example from a [[nature|natural source]] (where a sample often contains numerous chemical substances&lt;!--HELP, I need a nice example, I think the extraction of cocaine from the coca-plant is stigmatising--&gt;) or after a [[chemical reaction]] (which often give mixtures of chemical substances).

'''China Time-honored Brand''' ([[simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: '''''Zhonghua lao zihao''''' 中华老字号 or simply '''''lao zihao''''' 老字号) is a title granted by the [[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Commerce]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] to Chinese enterprises that existed before 1956, sell products, techniques or services passed down through generations, have distinct Chinese cultural characteristics and are widely recognized by society.{{sfn|van der Meulen|Sun|Carvajal|Kite|2016|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H2glBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;f=false 454]}}

This title was first granted soon after the foundation of the PRC in 1949.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}} The current eligibility criteria were set in 2006, when the Ministry of Commerce revised them for the last time.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}}

There are currently around 1,000 brands granted this title,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} among which are [[Tongrentang]] ([[traditional Chinese medicine]]), [[Quanjude]] ([[Peking Duck]]) and [[Go Believe]] ([[baozi]] or steamed dumpling). Many of the shops have a history of over 400 years, and in modern times have begun to expand via mass [[commercialization]] of their products.

[[UNESCO]]'s '''City of Literature''' programme is part of a wider [[Creative Cities Network]] which was launched in 2004 and is currently made up of 180 UNESCO Creative Cities globally. Members are drawn from 72 countries and cover seven creative fields: Crafts &amp; Folk Art, Design, Film, Gastronomy, Literature, Music, and Media Arts.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/about-creative-cities/ UNESCO What is the Creative Cities Network?]&lt;/ref&gt; The Network was born out of UNESCO's Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity initiative which was created in 2002. The Creative City Network’s aim is to "promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world." The cities in the network promote their local creative scene and conform to UNESCO’s goal of fostering cultural diversity. They recognise past, present and future: a strong cultural heritage, a vibrant and diverse contemporary cultural scene, and aspirations to extend culture to the next generation at home and to other cities in a global partnership.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"/&gt; {{As of|2017}}, 28 cities have been designated as part of the City of Literature programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macdonald |first=Moira |date=31 October 2017 |title=UNESCO declares Seattle a City of Literature |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/unesco-declares-seattle-a-city-of-literature/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Cities of Literature network of 28 cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofliterature.com/international-cities-of-literature/how-it-began/ How It Began]&lt;/ref&gt; represents 6 continents and 23 countries, and a combined population of over 26 million.

==Criteria for Cities of Literature==
To be approved as a City of Literature, cities need to meet a number of criteria set by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/literature/ Do you have what it takes to be a City of Literature?]&lt;/ref&gt; Designated UNESCO Cities of Literature share similar characteristics:
*Quality, quantity and diversity of publishing in the city
*Quality and quantity of educational programmes focusing on domestic or foreign literature at primary, secondary and tertiary levels
*Literature, drama and/or poetry playing an important role in the city
*Hosting literary events and festivals which promote domestic and foreign literature; 
*Existence of libraries, bookstores and public or private cultural centres which preserve, promote and disseminate domestic and foreign literature
*Involvement by the publishing sector in translating literary works from diverse national languages and foreign literature
*Active involvement of traditional and new media in promoting literature and strengthening the market for literary products.

Cities submit bids to UNESCO to be designated a City of Literature.  The designations are monitored and reviewed every four years by UNESCO.

'''''Click''''' (2007) is a work of [[collaborative fiction]] written by [[David Almond]], [[Eoin Colfer]], [[Roddy Doyle]], [[Deborah Ellis]], [[Nick Hornby]], [[Margo Lanagan]], [[Gregory Maguire]], [[Ruth Ozeki]], [[Linda Sue Park]], and [[Tim Wynne-Jones]]. It is about a photographer named George G. Keane, his grandchildren, Jason and Margaret, and how they affected the lives of different people, such as a Russian prisoner and an Irish teen.

==Plot==
George G. Keane, or "Gee", was a photographer who travelled around the world taking pictures. In Gee's will he leaves his granddaughter, Margaret, a box containing seven lettered boxes and a message stating "throw them all back". Each lettered box contains a shell. She discovers that each letter on each box represents the continent that the shell came from, and that her grandfather intended for her to put them back where they came from over her lifetime. This is a gift that will last Maggie's whole life. Meanwhile, Jason, Margaret's brother, is left with a camera and uses it to construct multiple photo albums, one of which consisted of a girl doing ordinary things throughout the day while holding a large piece of glass. The last chapter of the book depicts an elderly Margaret living in the future with her great-niece, watching a documentary about her grandfather, her brother, and herself.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;

==Reception==
The novel was well received by the online community, most notably in an article by [[NPR]].&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

'''Comediehuset''' (The Comedy House) or '''Sillgateteatern''' (The Herring-Street Theatre) was a Swedish theatre, active in [[Gothenburg]] from 1779 until 1833. It was the first permanent Public theatre in Gothenburg and the only one until 1816. It was located at the corner of [[Sillgatan]], the Herring-street (now [[Postgatan]]) and [[Nedre Kvarnbergsgatan]]. 

== History ==
===Background===
Prior to the foundation of the first theater, travelling theatre companies had visited Gothenburg, the first one being recorded in 1696. They were foreign, usually from Germany, but by the 1750s, the Swedish theater company of [[Peter Lindahl]] regularly visited the town. During the 1770s, amateur theater became popular among the wealthy city elite due to the theater interest of [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and the family of Alströmer and Hall staged amateur theater and became patrons of theater. 

In about 1775, [[Patrik Alströmer]] and his brother [[Clas Alströmer]], had a proper theater building constructed, known as the Comedy House. Originally of wood, it was rebuilt in stone in 1782. This was to become the 4th public theater in Sweden, after [[Björngårdsteatern]] (1640) and [[Bollhuset]] (1667) in Stockholm, and the second outside of the capital, after [[Egges teater]] in Norrköping (1762), and prior to Spektakelhuset in Karlskrona and Spektakelhuset in Gävle (both founded in 1784). This was a part of a great enthusiasm and development of the theatre had begun in the country after King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] had founded the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in 1773. Many theaters were founded in smaller cities around Sweden in the 18th-century, but Comediehuset was one of few to have success enough to last past a few years. 

===Permanent theatre===
It is not exactly known when the theater was first used. Likely, it was used by travelling theater companies from the start. From 1779, however, the building was used by the theater company [[Gemenasiska sällskapet]]. It was managed by, in succession, [[Johan von Blanc]] (1779-86); Gustaf Simson (1786-87) and finally by [[Lovisa Simson]] (1787-92) in companionship with [[Andreas Widerberg]] (1786-90). 

The standard of the Comediehuset was considered high. The theater's outside the capital was not as closely guarded by the authorities, and controversial plays often had premier sooner in Gothenburg, Karlskrona and Norrköping earlier than in Stockholm. ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' had its premier in Sweden in Comediehuset in 1786, and ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1787, much sooner than in the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in Stockholm. Comediehuset also arranged public masquerade balls, concerts, opera and ballet, and had its own restaurant. Travelling guests artists also performed there, often foreign, such as French pantomime artists, Italian Opera and English circus artists. 

===Later history===
In 1792, the theater was dissolved. However, it continued to be used by travelling theater companies. From 1793 until 1800, it was used by the company of [[Johan Anton Lindqvist]], during which it in effect continued as a permanent theater. The following years, it was temporarily used by a succession of theater companies. 

From 1810 until 1816, it was again permanently used by [[Johan Anton Lindqvist]], until the building was deemed unsuitable and Lindqvist moved his theater to the second theater in Gothenburg, the newly established ''[[Segerlindska teatern]]'' (1816–1892), which was also called Stora teatern and Mindre teatern (from 1864), which in its turn was replaced by ''[[Stora Teatern]]'', founded in 1859. 

After repairs, Comediehuset was temporarily used for some performances until it was closed in 1833. The empty building burnt down 13 March 1867.

"'''{{lang|mk|Denes nad Makedonija}}'''" ({{lang-mk|Денес над Македонија}}, {{IPA-mk|ˈdɛnɛs nad makɛˈdɔnija|pron}}, {{Literal translation|"Today Over Macedonia"}}) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Both the music and lyrics date from the early 1940s. [[Todor Skalovski]] composed the music, while the lyrics were written by [[Vlado Maleski]]. It was adopted as the Macedonian national anthem in 1992, a year after the state's independence was declared from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Before its adoption as the Macedonian national anthem, it was used as the regional anthem of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]], a constituent state of Yugoslavia.

==History==
[[File:Soldiers say goodbye to Macedonian friends DVIDS97161.jpg|thumb|Macedonian soldiers saluting during a performance of the Macedonian national anthem in 2008]]
The lyrics of "Denes nad Makedonija" were penned by [[Vlado Maleski]], a writer who was active in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] movement during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Bechev&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilGfCIF4Ao4C&amp;pg=PA140|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=April 13, 2009|last=Bechev|first=Dimitar|page=140–141|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, he took charge of [[Macedonian Radio Television#History|Radio Skoplje]] in December 1944, penned the manuscript for the first [[Macedonian language|Macedonian-language]] movie,&lt;ref name=Bechev/&gt; sat on the editorial board of the first Macedonian publishing house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rozita|last=Dimova|year=2013|title=The 'Nation of Poetry': Language, Festival and Subversion in Macedonia|journal=History and Anthropology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=140|doi=10.1080/02757206.2012.759112}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the [[Macedonian alphabet#The Second Committee and adoption|Commission for Language and Orthography]] that submitted recommendations to the government on standardizing the Macedonian alphabet, which were subsequently accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Božidar|last=Vidoeskit|date=January 1998|title=Five decades since the codification of the Macedonian language|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language|volume=131|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/ijsl.1998.131.13}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his extensive contributions to the country's literature, Maleski is regarded as part of "the first generation of Macedonian prose writers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGEMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Vlado+Maleski%22&amp;dq=%22Vlado+Maleski%22|title=Macedonia and the Macedonians: a history|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=2008|last=Rossos|first=Andrew|page=255|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical portion was composed by [[Todor Skalovski]], one of Macedonia's most distinguished composers who also served as the conductor of its opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rzr_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|title=Macedonia: Country Study Guide – Strategic Information and Developments|publisher=Lulu Press Inc.|volume=1|date=March 3, 2012|last=|first=|page=51|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Samson&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yJ60SHL4R-0C&amp;pg=PA490|title=Music in the Balkans|publisher=Brill Publishers|date=May 23, 2013|last=Samson|first=Jim|page=490|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also regarded as one of the trailblazers in composing music inspired by and incorporating Macedonian culture and mythology.&lt;ref name=Samson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5RFUDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|edition=4th|editor-last=Randel|editor-first=Don Michael|page=478|isbn=9780674011632|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song was first played in 1942, among groups affiliated with the communist and Partisan resistance in [[Struga]]&lt;ref name=Kolstø&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=qY7eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT212|title=Strategies of Symbolic Nation-building in South Eastern Europe|publisher=Routledge|date=April 1, 2016|last=Kolstø|first=Pål|page=|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which also happens to be Maleski's birthplace).&lt;ref name=Bechev/&gt;  According to oral recounts, the hymn was played by Maleski himself on [[New Year's Eve]] in the presence of 24 youths, whose identities were subsequently documented in writing only in 1981.  Even though the resistance consisted of fighters from the different ethnic groups across Yugoslavia, the aforementioned youths are believed to have all identified as Macedonians.&lt;ref name=identity&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=hIuTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT158|title=Anthems and the Making of Nation States: Identity and Nationalism in the Balkans|chapter=Chapter 6 – A Fight for Rights: Macedonia 1941|publisher=I.B.

Soon after independence, the country's [[National Assembly|assembly]] held a contest to determine a national anthem for the new sovereign state.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; "Denes nad Makedonija" was one of several candidates in contention&lt;ref name=Kolstø/&gt; – the others in the running were "Himma" ({{Lang-en|"Anthem"}}, {{Literal translation|Hymn}}) by Taki Hrisik and "Dani bideš večna" (meaning "That You Should be Eternal") by [[Aleksandar Džambazov]]&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; – and ended up finishing runner-up in the final results.&lt;ref name=Kolstø/&gt;  In spite of this, most of the Assembly Commission voted to make it the national anthem of the state, and it was duly adopted on August 11, 1992.&lt;ref name=Kolstø/&gt;&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;

==Lyrics==
"Denes nad Makedonija" consists of four stanzas, none of which have been codified by legislation.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;  The second stanza, however, has been omitted from the recognized lyrics of the national anthem posted on government websites.&lt;ref name=Zdravljica/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFA&gt;{{cite web|title=State Symbols of Republic of Macedonia|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/index.php/en/ministry/protocol/flag-and-anthem-of-the-republic-of-macedonia|date=|accessdate=June 17, 2017|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|publisher=Government of the Republic of Macedonia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617021138/http://www.mfa.gov.mk/index.php/en/ministry/protocol/flag-and-anthem-of-the-republic-of-macedonia|archivedate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context of lyrics==
The lyrics of "Denes nad Makedonija" are reflective of a [[March (music)|military marching song]], which is fitting given its connection to the [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|Yugoslav Macedonian theatre]] of the Second World War.  They are not a call to arms for Macedonians; rather, the hymn uses [[imagery]] to take the person singing it back to the time the anthem was written, and purports that they themselves were engaging in combat at the time.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;  Furthermore, the lyrics previously alluded to the concepts of mothers and motherhood (specifically in the second stanza).  This is in line with the national anthems – both past and present – of other [[Southeast Europe]]an countries like [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ("[[Jedna si jedina]]"), [[Croatia]] ("[[Lijepa naša domovino|Horvatska domovina]]"), and [[Montenegro]] ("[[Oj, svijetla majska zoro]]").&lt;ref name=Zdravljica&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelen|first1=Christopher|last2=Pavković|first2=Aleksandar|year=2014|title=“Zdravljica” – toast to a cosmopolitan nation anthem quality in the Slovenian context|journal=Nationalities Papers: The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity|volume=42|issue=5|pages=839|doi=10.1080/00905992.2014.916664}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It discussed how mothers mourn for their fallen sons, who died fighting for the rights and liberty of their country.  They are comforted for their loss by being reminded of the bravery of their sons and the nobleness of the cause for which they died.  Although this theme has been described as a "standard anthemic device", it was subsequently expunged from the official words of the anthem.&lt;ref name=Zdravljica/&gt;

==Legal protection==
The Republic of Macedonia's [[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia|Sobranie]] (legislative chamber) passed [[legislation]] titled "The Law on the Anthem of the Republic of Macedonia" on August 11, 1992.  This officially adopted "Denes nad Makedonija" as the national anthem of the then-nascent country,&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; with Article 2 specifically confirming the song's status as such.&lt;ref name=Kolstø/&gt;  However, it did not stipulate which stanzas were to be recognized as official.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;  Curiously, the statute did not technically pass with the requisite two-thirds majority as stipulated by Article 5 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia|country's constitution]] for proposals concerning [[National symbols of the Republic of Macedonia|national symbols]] (the anthem, the [[Flag of the Republic of Macedonia|flag]], and the [[National emblem of the Republic of Macedonia|national emblem]]).&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt;  Although 88 out of the 120 members of the assembly voted for it, representatives elected from the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian community]] were not involved.&lt;ref name=Kolstø/&gt;

The '''Department of Tourism''' ({{lang-fil|Kagawaran ng Turismo}}, '''DOT''') is the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] responsible for the regulation of the [[tourism in the Philippines|Philippine tourism industry]] and the promotion of the Philippines as a [[tourist destination]].

==History==
Started as a private initiative to promote the [[Philippines]] as a major travel destination, the Philippine Tourist &amp; Travel Association was organized in 1950. In 1956, the Board of Travel and Tourist Industry was created by Congress As stipulated in the Integrated Reorganization Plan in 1972 sanctioned as a law under Presidential Decree No. 1, as amended, the Department of Trade and Tourism was established, reorganizing the then Department of Commerce and Industry. A Philippine Tourism Commission was created under the unified Trade and Tourism Department to oversee the growth of the tourism industry as a source of economic benefit for the country. 

In 1973, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] created a new cabinet-level Department of Tourism (DOT) by splitting the Department of Trade and Tourism into two separate departments. Included in the new Department of Tourism, the agency [[Philippine Tourism Authority]] (PTA) and the Philippine Convention Bureau (PCB) were created. The Department of Tourism was then renamed '''Ministry of Tourism''' as a result of the shift in the form of government pursuant to the enforcement of the [[Constitution of the Philippines#The 1973 Constitution|1973 Constitution]].

In 1986, under Executive Order Nos. 120 and 120-A signed by President [[Corazon Aquino]], the Department of Tourism was reorganized and, correspondingly, the  Convention Bureau was renamed the [[Philippine Convention and Visitors Corporation]], and the [[Intramuros Administration]] was attached, previously being under the defunct Ministry of Human Settlements. In 1998, the Department of Tourism assumed a prominent role in culmination of [[Independence Day (Philippines)#Centennial|centennial celebration]] of the country's [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|independence]] from the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1898.

In 2003, the Department of Tourism initiated one of its most successful tourism promotion project, ''Visit Philippines 2003'', under Secretary (now Senator) [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard J. Gordon]].

The latest improvements in the tourism industry in the country came about with the passage of Republic Act No. 9593 or the "Tourism Act of 2009."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1680">'''Differential Educational Achievement (DEA)''' is a [[Sociology|sociological]] term often given to a concept that disagrees with some of the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] views on [[education]].

Many functionalists believe that an individual's academic success depends completely upon that person's IQ ([[intelligence quotient]]) and the effort they apply to their studies. They also believe that society works in a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic system]]: that people work for what they achieve, and achieve what they deserve, according to their own merit and effort, i.e., they work hard to get the best jobs in later life.

Some other sociologists do not concur with this idea. They think that other factors have a more prominent impact on one's education. These factors may include [[social class]] background, [[gender]] and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/diffed1.doc - “A” Level Sociology] - Teaching Notes for Students ''Education and Training - Differential Educational Achievement''&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marxists]] believe that this is due to social class, and that in education only the ruling class values are transmitted. This means that working-class people find it difficult to connect with the education system. In this respect, according to this theory, many people from less [[affluent]] backgrounds are academically disadvantaged from the very start.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Doll i' the Grass''' is a Norwegian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] in their ''[[Norske Folkeeventyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/asbjornsenmoe/dollgrass.html ''Doll i' the Grass'']"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne-Thompson]] type 402, Animal Brides.&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0402.html Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 402 and related stories]"&lt;/ref&gt;  Another tale of this type is ''[[The Frog Princess]]''.&lt;ref name="ashliman"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

A king sent his twelve sons out to find brides, laying on them the condition that their brides could spin, weave, and sew a shirt in a day, and giving them each a mail coat and a horse.  When they had gone a distance, they refused to let the [[Youngest son|youngest]] go with them, because he was useless.  A little girl asked him to come see Doll i' the Grass, and he went.  Doll i' the Grass asked him his troubles, and he told her but said she was so lovely, though small, he would be happy if she consented to be his wife.  

She made him a shirt in a day, but it was tiny.  They set out, he on his horse, she in a silver spoon drawn by two white mice, leaving him afraid he would trample her.  They came to a body of water, his horse shied, and Doll i' the Grass was thrown in.  He was horror-struck, but a [[merman]] brought her out again, and now she was of normal size.  

His brothers had brought home ugly wives who had fought all the way home, and they wore hats with tar and soot, so that the rain had stained their faces with it, making them uglier.  The king drove them and their brides away, and celebrated the wedding of his youngest son.

'''Downtown Las Vegas''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DTLV''') is the [[central business district]] and historic center of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. It is the original townsite and was the gambling district of Las Vegas prior to [[the Strip]], and the area still incorporates [[Downtown gaming Las Vegas|downtown gaming]]. As the urban core of the [[Las Vegas Valley]], it features a variety of hotel and business [[highrise]]s, cultural centers, historical buildings and government institutions, as well as residential and retail developments.  Downtown is located in the center of the Las Vegas Valley and just north of the [[Las Vegas Strip]], centered on [[Fremont Street]], the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Fremont East]].  The city defines the area as bounded by [[Interstate 15|I-15]] on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east and Sahara Avenue on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schoenmann |first=Joe |date=March 19, 2014 |title=Joe Downtown: The boundaries of downtown Las Vegas are as fluid as its reputation |url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/column/joe-downtown/2014/mar/19/boundaries-downtown-las-vegas-are-fluid-reputation/?_ga=1.239706432.27414779.1396127750 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vic-yellowshirt.JPG|thumb|Downtown Las Vegas casinos on Fremont Street (1973)]]
Perhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]], who traveled here 10,000 years ago, leaving behind [[petroglyph]]s. [[Anasazi]] and [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] tribes came here at least 2,000 years ago.

The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for ''the meadows'', in the 1800s because it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as desert spring waters for westward travelers.

The year 1844 marked the arrival of [[John C. Frémont]], whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas’ Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of the [[LDS Church]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Los Angeles]], where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue at the [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park]].

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres of land adjacent to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.

The year 1931 was a pivotal one for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks.  This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the [[Great Depression]]. It was completed in 1935.

Following [[World War II]], lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

The 1950s saw the opening of the [[Moulin Rouge Hotel]], the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.

In 1951, the first [[atomic bomb]] detonation at the [[Nevada Test Site]], 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, occurred.  City residents and visitors were able to witness the [[mushroom cloud]]s until 1963, when the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.

During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as [[Howard Hughes]] were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as "gaming," which transitioned into legitimate business.

In 1989, entrepreneur [[Steve Wynn]] changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up [[The Mirage]], the Las Vegas Strip’s first mega-casino resort. This strengthened the pull of visitors away from the downtown area.

In 1995, the [[Fremont Street Experience]] in Las Vegas’ downtown area was opened. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.

Due to years of revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed “The Year of Downtown.” Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Children’s Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/factsstatistics/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727081949/http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/FactsStatistics/history.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-07-27|title=History (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1838100_1838099_1838098,00.html|title=Las Vegas: 10 Things to Do — 10.

In 2018, plans for a new downtown expo center were announced, replacing and expanding on space previously provided by the Cashman Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/las-vegas/downtown-las-vegas-to-get-new-76m-expo-center/|title=Downtown Las Vegas to get new $76M expo center|date=29 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Las Vegas Medical District===
Business and government leaders have begun working on a plan to expand downtown’s Las Vegas Medical District (LVMD) from its current 200 acres to at least 680 acres. While currently offering the largest concentration of health-care services in the Las Vegas valley, an expanded district would allow for additional health-care services and opportunities. Areas for planned expansion include the Charleston Boulevard corridor to Valley View Boulevard, along Martin L. King Boulevard and in Symphony Park. The centerpiece of this expanded district will be the 260,000-square-foot UNLV School of Medicine, which will include an educational building and library. The school was granted preliminary accreditation in late 2016 and can begin accepting students for its 2017 charter class.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===Financial District===
Centered on Bonneville Avenue and Casino Center Boulevard, most of this area is filled with office and government buildings.  With several court buildings located here, there are many judicial-related businesses such as law firms in the immediate area.  The financial district is home to the [[Las Vegas City Hall]] building, the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and several bank buildings such as [[Bank of America]]. The Clark County Marriage Bureau is also located here at the Regional Justice Center.&lt;ref name="lasvegasnevada.gov"/&gt;

===Art and culture===
[[File:LasVegasSymphonyPark1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Symphony Park]]]]

===Architecture===
Several buildings of architectural significance exist downtown, although being founded in 1905, Las Vegas lacks the number of historical buildings of older cities. Exceptions include the Historic Fifth Street School, built in 1936 in the Spanish-mission style and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed is the [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]], which currently serves as home to The Mob Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mob Museum website|url=http://www.themobmuseum.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few historical neoclassical buildings in the city.  Built in 1930, the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies and Performing Arts is the city's best example of Art Deco architecture.  The Morelli House, built in 1959, is a notable mid-century modern design.  The building that formerly housed the Las Vegas City Hall, and now is home to the corporate headquarters for the online retailer Zappos.com, is a notable example of 1970s modern architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aialasvegas.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=34|title=About the Historic 5th Street School - American Institute of Architects Las Vegas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aialasvegas.org/associations/9424/files/Visitors%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As Las Vegas boomed, more recent buildings tended to take inspiration from a variety of styles.  The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif.  The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design. Architect [[Frank Gehry]] designed the building for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health building in deconstructionist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/lasvegas/downtown01b.html|title=Architecture Studies Library - University Libraries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7598.htm|title=Symphony Park (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Downtown serves as a main center for government services in the [[Las Vegas Valley]].  Government offices for the city of Las Vegas and Clark County are located here, as well as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and several courts.

Some former government buildings have been turned into attractions, such as the old [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]] becoming the [[Mob Museum]].

==Transportation==
[[File:RTC Bus Picture - Photo by June Johns.jpg|thumb|Regional Transportation Commission provides public transportation]]

Two major freeways—Interstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95—cross in downtown Las Vegas. [[RTC Transit]] is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, including the downtown area.

A [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the Strip &amp; Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010. It connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stops at the Bonneville Transit Center.  Completed in 2012, the transit terminal serves as a central transfer point for downtown and features 16 vehicle bays for buses and 100 bike racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141505/http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downtown Loop is a free shuttle servicing many attractions in downtown Las Vegas.  The Loop runs continuously during operating hours and arrives at each stop every 20 minutes. The hours of operation are Monday through Thursday: 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Friday through Saturday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.

The AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle is a pilot program that provides rides in the Fremont East Entertainment District Nov 2017 – Nov 2018. The pilot program is a partnership with [http://www.keolisnorthamerica.com/ Keolis], the [[city of Las Vegas]], and the [[Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada]]. The shuttle runs Tuesday – Sunday 4:30pm – 8:30pm, with the main station stop at the Downtown Container Park. Shuttle service is suspended during the month of August.

==Economy==
The economy of downtown Las Vegas has been primarily based on gambling and entertainment, as is the case in the greater [[Las Vegas Valley]]. However, the smaller downtown casinos earn revenues that pale in comparison to the mega resorts on the Las Vegas Strip further south. As of 2014, there have been major renovations of several downtown resorts such as [[Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino|The Plaza]], Golden Gate Hotel, [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]], El Cortez Hotel &amp; Casino, the D and the Downtown Grand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/mar/20/downtown-casino-renovations-maintain-old-vegas-vib/|title=Downtown casino renovations maintain Old Vegas vibe|author=Ron Sylvester|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/apr/10/strip-gaming-revenue-rose-33-percent-february/|title=Strip gaming revenue rose 3.3 percent in February|author=Cy Ryan|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Las Vegas also houses some corporate offices, as well as the World Market Center Las Vegas, a frequent host of trade shows and conventions.  Recently, the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the arrival of the new Zappos headquarters downtown has started to attract new medical and technology-oriented businesses to the area.

===Revitalization===
The downtown area in recent decades has played second fiddle to the larger and more famous [[Las Vegas Strip]], which is located a few miles to the south. The city has been working on revitalization efforts to entice more visitors and residents to the downtown area.
[[Image:WMCLV GrandPlaza.jpg|thumb|right|The World Market Center Las Vegas complex]]
[[File:The Smith Center for the Performing Arts &amp; DISCOVERY Children's Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]]
World Market Center Las Vegas consists of three giant buildings, with a total of 5.1 million square feet, in a facility designed by [[Jon Jerde]]. It is home to semiannual trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries. This is one of several entities that are helping to diversity downtown Las Vegas' economy and job base.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Market Center Las Vegas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The square footage of World Market Center Las Vegas is greater than both the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]].

The city is also working to attract events to the downtown area. Recently held events include ''Helldorado''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkshelldorado.com|title=Elks Helldorado Days Official Website - Join us May 14-17, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Life is Beautiful'' festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeisbeautifulfestival.com/|title=Life is Beautiful Life is Beautiful|work=Life is Beautiful}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 several new downtown projects were completed. The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the new [[Mob Museum]] and a new City Hall building opened. The Discovery Children's Museum opened next door to The Smith Center in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2013/mar/07/new-discovery-childrens-museum-opens-weekend/|title=New Discovery: Children's museum opens this weekend|author=Ken Miller|date=7 March 2013|work=LasVegasWeekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Las Vegas City Hall now operates out of a new building, which, along with the Bonneville Transit center, can serve as an anchor tenant for new development along Main Street.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Fiscal Year In Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, "A New Downtown Emerges."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Main and Commerce streets in downtown Las Vegas are undergoing major beautification efforts, which started in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/apr/17/joe-downtown-construction-begin-downtown-beautific/|title=Joe Downtown: Construction to begin on downtown beautification project|author=Joe Schoenmann|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online retailer [[Zappos]] made major renovations to the old Las Vegas City Hall, and moved into the building in late 2013, which now houses its corporate headquarters. Zappos CEO [[Tony Hsieh]] has taken a personal, as well as a professional, interest in the urban area and is contributing $350 million of his personal wealth toward a multifaceted revitalization effort called the Downtown Project, with businesses like [[The Writer's Block]] included among its investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brooklyn-moves-to-vegas.html|title=What Happens in Brooklyn Moves to Vegas|date=21 October 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eskimology''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|s|k|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə|dʒ|i}} or '''Inuitology''' is a complex of [[humanities]] sciences [[Area studies|studying]] languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] and [[Eskimo]] ([[Inuit]]–[[Yupik peoples|Yupik]])–[[Aleut]] peoples in chronological and comparative context.

==History==
Eskimology traces its beginning to the pioneering work of [[Hans Egede]] (1745) and David Crantz (1767) in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;Fienup-Riordan, Ann. (1990). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=erhrp9-RHiYC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=%22Regional+groupings+for+the+Yukon-Kuskokwim+region%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DPWJs6UYY9&amp;sig=i8i0NT3pPLlz0cc7ensiwYLWvE4&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6lh-VMmkNeHTygPH-oAY&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Regional%20groupings%20for%20the%20Yukon-Kuskokwim%20region%22&amp;f=false Eskimo Essays: Yup'ik Lives and Howe We See Them]''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eskimology has traditionally had a particular focus on Greenland studies owing to the long-standing relationship between Denmark and Greenland established in the early 18th century, and the academic discipline of Eskimology is today centered at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The term "Eskimology" was not common until 1967, when a genuine department was established and officially named the ''Department of Eskimology''. From the late 1960s, Eskimology changed its focus toward increasingly contemporary and global political issues.&lt;ref name="Thuesen"/&gt;

'''''Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly''''',{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Zero ~Akai Chō~''|零 〜紅い蝶〜||lit. "Zero ~Crimson Butterfly~"}}}} known in Europe as '''''Project Zero II: Crimson Butterfly''''', is a Japanese [[survival horror]] video game developed and published by [[Tecmo]] in 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. It is the second installment in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series, and features an independent story with little relation to [[Fatal Frame (video game)|the first title]]. The story follows twin sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura as they explore an abandoned village and experience encounters with the paranormal. Their lives quickly become threatened when the village spirits begin to possess the pair and target them as sacrifices for an ancient ritual. Players must use a camera with powers of [[exorcism]] to defeat enemies and uncover the secrets of the village.

Development of ''Fatal Frame II'' began shortly after the completion of the first title. Because many players were too frightened to finish the original, Tecmo made the sequel's story more interesting to encourage players to see it through and finish the game. Despite this, horror was still the central focus of the game. Director Makoto Shibata kept the perpetual nature of spirits in mind during development. Ghosts reappearing in different locations, and being able to feel their presence even after their death were characteristics Shibata felt were indicative of a horror scenario.

Upon release, ''Fatal Frame II'' received positive reviews, and is widely considered to be among the scariest video games ever made. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] port, subtitled ''Director's Cut'', was released in 2004 and included improved visuals, audio, and new gameplay modes. The game has also been re-released on the [[PlayStation 3]] via [[PlayStation Network|PSN]] in 2013, and a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game titled ''[[Project Zero 2: Wii Edition]]'' was released for the [[Wii]] in 2012 in Europe and Japan.

==Gameplay==
{{details|Fatal Frame#Series gameplay}}
''Fatal Frame II'' is a [[survival horror]] video game.&lt;ref name="IGNPS2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunham |first1=Jeremy |title=Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/19/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly |website=IGN |accessdate=15 October 2016 |date=19 November 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701184755/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/19/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly |archivedate=1 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the game, the player controls the protagonist Mio Amakura as she and her sister Mayu explore a [[ghost town]].&lt;ref name=IGNPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=manual&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly | type=instruction manual | edition=NTSC, PS2 |publisher=Tecmo |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} As they explore the town and uncover its secrets, they defeat enemies in the form of ghosts and spirits by taking pictures of them with an enchanted camera, the Camera Obscura.&lt;ref name=IGNPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|10–11}} There are two modes of gameplay, field mode and viewfinder mode. When in field mode, the player controls Mio directly and can examine items and search areas for clues. When the camera is used, the game enters viewfinder mode, from where pictures of ghosts and scenery can be taken. Information about the camera film type, lens type, and camera enhancements is visible.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|6–13}}

{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center

}}
Most of the game is spent directing Mio followed closely by Mayu as they explore the village.  A filament in the corner of the screen will glow when ghosts or clues are nearby. Many clues are only visible through the viewfinder, and some ghosts are non-hostile and will provide hints to advance further. Sometimes Mayu will stop if she finds a clue as well.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|6–13}} Other than clues and key items to progress the narrative, consumable items such as health restoratives and film for the Camera Obscura can be found.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Fighting spirits by taking pictures of them is a key gameplay mechanic.&lt;ref name=IGNPS2/&gt; When in viewfinder mode, one can take pictures of enemies, damaging them. More damage can be dealt by snapping shots at certain moments, indicated by the filaments and lights on the camera. Power-up lenses can be used to provide added affects such as slowing down the enemy or pushing them back.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|13,16–17,24–27}} Pictures taken with the camera can be saved to the memory card.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|21}} Mayu cannot fight off ghosts, and if she takes too much damage, it is [[game over]]. The player character Mio has a health meter, and like Mayu, if she receives too much damage it is game over. The game must then be continued from a previous save.The game can only be saved at red lanterns located in throughout the village.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;{{rp|6–13,20}}

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===

''Fatal Frame II'' is set in the fictional {{nihongo|Minakami|皆神}} region of Japan. The region is home to Minakami Village (lit. "All God's Village"), an abandoned town where the majority of the game takes place. The player learns that Minakami Village was host to the "Crimson Sacrifice Ritual", the failure of which caused the settlement to vanish—thus earning it the name "The Lost Village". In the game's present, there is an [[urban legend]] about the Lost Village, where people who become lost in the Minakami forest will become trapped forever in the village.

The [[protagonist]]s of ''Fatal Frame II'' are Mio and Mayu Amakura, twin sisters who are visiting their favorite childhood playspot in Minakami before it is lost due to construction of a new dam. The main [[antagonist]] is the vengeful spirit of Sae Kurosawa, the sole Twin Shrine Maiden sacrificed for the failed ritual. She yearns to reunite with her twin sister Yae. Sae mistakens Mio for her sister, and wants to use Mayu to try and complete the ritual with her. Other characters include the spirit of Itsuki Tachibana, a young man who also mistakes Mio for Yae, but instead tries to help her and Mayu escape; and Seijiro Makabe, a folklorist who visited Minakami Village with a Camera Obscura prototype (the same camera Mio uses in the game) and his assistant, Ryozo Munakata.&lt;ref name=green_05&gt;{{cite video game|title=Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly|developer=[[Tecmo]]|publisher=Tecmo|date=27 November 2003|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|scene=Green Diary 5 (in-game file)|level=|quote='''Ryozo Munakata''': Itsuki, I pray that you read this. I can't stay in this village any longer. I told Yae and Sae that I would come for them on the day of the ceremony. After they make it out of the village, I'll take care of them. Don't worry.

In the past, before the Repentance occurred, twins Yae and Sae Kurosawa tried to escape their fate with Itsuki's help.&lt;ref name=bound_01 /&gt; During their escape, Sae was caught and brought back to the village, while Yae escaped. The Minakami villagers desperately hanged Sae to try to satisfy the Hellish Abyss; the attempt failed, causing the Repentance to occur and the village to disappear. During the Repentance, Sae returned from the Hellish Abyss as a vengeful spirit and, along with Seijiro Makabe, made a Kusabi for the Abyss, slaughtering the priests and villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly|developer=[[Tecmo]]|publisher=Tecmo|date=27 November 2003|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Sae''': ''[laughter]'' Go ahead!

Near the end of the game, when Mio learns that in Minakami Village, the twin born second is considered the elder, as the village believes that the "elder" lets the weaker, "younger" twin be born first.&lt;ref name=folklorist_12 /&gt; This completely reverses Mio's implied fate: instead of being sacrificed herself, she must strangle her "younger" twin sister.&lt;ref name="Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly"/&gt; When Mio and Mayu finally begin escaping, the villagers' spirits take Mayu back to the Kurosawa house, where the Hellish Abyss awaits them below. Should the player choose to take the escape route alone, they will obtain the ''Lingering Scent'' ending, which leads to an automatic game over.&lt;ref name="ending_lingering" /&gt; If the player instead chooses to pursue Mayu, they have a chance to obtain the other endings. The "Crimson Butterfly" ending sees Mio and Mayu proceeding with the ritual, where Mayu becomes a crimson butterfly.&lt;ref name="ending_butterfly" /&gt; The "Hellish Abyss" ending sees Mio rescuing Mayu from Sae, only to become permanently blinded from looking into the Hellish Abyss. The "Promise Ending", added to the ''Director's Cut'' version, sees Yae and Sae performing the ritual and freeing the villagers' spirits, thus sparing Mio and Mayu of the ritual.&lt;ref name="ending_promise" /&gt; According to the events of ''[[Fatal Frame III: The Tormented]]'', the direct sequel of the game, the "Crimson Butterfly" ending is the canonical ending.&lt;ref name="ff3_letterfromkei6" /&gt;

==Development==
Development of a sequel to the original ''[[Fatal Frame (video game)|Fatal Frame]]'' began "relatively soon" after its release. Many players were too scared to finish the first game, so for the sequel, Tecmo shifted their attention to create a more interesting storyline to encourage players to see it through.&lt;ref name="PSB_MS"/&gt; Despite this, ''Fatal Frame II'' was developed with "horror" being the central focus more-so than the "action".&lt;ref name=txbox/&gt; Producer Keisuke Kikuchi and director of the Xbox port, Zin Hasegawa, called it "horror that appeals to human imagination", citing how some people get scared when hearing faint sounds in the dark.&lt;ref name="IGN_int"/&gt; Kikuchi cited symmetry as a central theme in the story, in that, "tragedies and fear are based on what happens when you tear things apart," such as butterflies and twins.&lt;ref name=txbox/&gt;

In creating the horror atmosphere, they considered more closely how spirits may behave. They may randomly disappear or reappear in different locations, and their presence can sometimes still be felt after they are killed. Shibata called these "never-endings loops" characteristic of a horror scenario, and this illusion was something he felt in a dream which he was using as inspiration for the game's story.&lt;ref name="PSB_MS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shibata |first1=Makoto |title=Fatal Frame 2 Hits PSN Tuesday, Series Director Speaks |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/02/fatal-frame-2-hits-psn-tuesday-series-director-speaks/ |website=PlayStation.Blog |accessdate=15 October 2016 |date=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930130419/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/02/fatal-frame-2-hits-psn-tuesday-series-director-speaks/ |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kikuchi took his inspiration from movies, literature, and also traditions and customs. He specifically cited Japanese novelist [[Seishi Yokomizo]] and Stanley Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' as inspirations.&lt;ref name=txbox/&gt;

The decision to make an Xbox port of ''Fatal Frame II'' was not made until after release of the PlayStation 2 version and during planning of ''[[Fatal Frame III]]''.&lt;ref name="xboxgs"/&gt; The Xbox port featured enhanced graphics with better lighting techniques, and also a Dolby Digital audio option was added.&lt;ref name=txbox/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN_int"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein |first1=Hilary |title=Fatal Frame II Interview |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/16/fatal-frame-ii-interview |website=IGN |accessdate=15 October 2016 |date=16 September 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126132254/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/16/fatal-frame-ii-interview |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional gameplay modes were also added, First-Person Shooter Mode and Survival Mode, and more costumes as well.&lt;ref name="IGN_int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xboxgs"/&gt; Kikuchi considers this version to be "Fatal Frame 2.5".&lt;ref name="xboxgs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maragos|first1=Nich|title=GameSpy: Keisuke Kikuchi on Fatal Frame 2: Director's Cut - Page 1|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/fatal-frame-ii-directors-cut/542420p1.html|website=xbox.gamespy.com|accessdate=15 October 2016|date=August 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village has no "chief". The Ceremony Master presides over the village. I wonder if this village was founded by people who wanted to preserve their sacred rituals and festivals? Most notable among All God's folklore is the "gate to hell" legend that has been passed down for years. It is an archetypal tale of a gate or hole that marks the border to the world of the dead, also called Hades, the underworld, or the netherworld. It is a forbidden place that is feared and hated, but it is also worshipped as well. The idea of hell has been a core belief of humans since ancient times. This village supports the theory that the belief is universal. The Forbidden Ritual regarding this "gate to hell" that takes place here is something no one is allowed to see or speak of. This strict taboo is probably the result of a ceremony concerning the border with hell coming closer to the living world. Villagers lead a simple life. Deep in the mountains, they struggled to forage food for their daily meals. The village has little contact with the outside world. They continue to practice the ways of old frozen in time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony is based on the belief that when the two bodies reunited as one, the Shrine Maiden will gain the power of a deity. The text says "the older sister must ✻✻ the younger and throw her into the ✻". The ✻✻ part must refer to the most horrible part of the ritual, probably some kind of "sacrifice".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If your twin is with you, she'll also sometimes aid you by stopping in front of important rooms or giving you a verbal clue to indicate that something worth noting is nearby. The village's dark history is gradually revealed, both through grainy black and white film sequences and through the abundance of documents you'll find scattered as you proceed. There's also at least one genuinely "friendly" ghost in the game who believes you are someone he already knows, so he'll often give you hints for your objectives--if he's available. You gradually get a complete picture of the town's denizens through numerous diaries, memos, and notebooks as well as by grabbing choice photos--when the opportunities arise--by using the game's core feature: the camera obscura.&lt;br/&gt;You find the camera soon after arriving in town, and the device serves a wide range of functions. It can be used to defeat hostile spirits, reveal clues, unseal doors held closed with spirit power, and catch hidden ghosts. It can even just take snapshots, if you'd like. You need film to take pictures, and, unlike in the first Fatal Frame, this iteration of the camera thankfully comes preloaded with a mysteriously inexhaustible supply of low-grade film. This allows you to hoard the more powerful film you obtain for combat, while letting you snap pictures of clues and the like to your heart's content. Otherwise, the camera handles just as it did in the previous game. So pressing the circle button causes you to enter first-person mode, and lining up things in the capture circle allows you to photograph hints, or it allows you to damage spirits. The capture circle glows green for hints and hidden spirits, and it glows red or orange when you've got a lock on hostile spirits. You can upgrade the abilities of the camera via lenses and other special items you acquire during gameplay. You'll spend something called "spirit points" to do this, which you'll earn through special photos and through battle. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218053713/http://www.gamespot.com/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Benin'''&lt;ref name=Tsavo&gt;{{cite web|title=National Flag of Benin|url=http://www.worldflags101.com/b/benin-flag.aspx|accessdate=May 19, 2013|work=World Flags 101|publisher=Tsavo Media Canada Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[flag]] consisting of two horizontal yellow and red bands on the fly side and a green vertical band at the hoist.  Adopted in 1959 to replace the [[Flag of France|French Tricolour]], it was the flag of the [[Republic of Dahomey]] until 1975, when the [[People's Republic of Benin]] was established.  The new regime renamed the country and changed the flag to a green field with a [[red star]] in the canton.  This version was utilized until the regime collapsed in 1990, coinciding with the [[Revolutions of 1989]].  The new government promptly restored the original pre-1975 flag.

==History==
[[File:Flag of Benin (1975-1990).svg|thumb|right|Flag of [[People's Republic of Benin]] (1975–1990).]]
Under [[French colonial empire|French colonial rule]] over [[French Dahomey|Dahomey]], French authorities forbade the colony from having its own [[National flag|regional flag]].  This was because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Whitney|last=Smith|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Gabon, flag of|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355240/Gabon-flag-of|accessdate=May 19, 2013|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the rise of the [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonization movement in Africa]], the French were obliged to grant limited autonomy to Dahomey as a self-governing republic within the [[French Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3G3XyLV6b4cC&amp;pg=RA1-PT241&amp;dq=french+community+benin|title=Historical Dictionary of Benin|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=December 14, 2012|last1=Houngnikpo|first1=Mathurin C.|last2=Decalo|first2=Samuel|pages=|accessdate=May 19, 2013|isbn=0810873737}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was granted on December 4, 1958, and a search for a national flag began soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D27kUeUnZVcC&amp;pg=PT11&amp;dq=french+community+benin|title=Background Notes: West Africa, June 2011|publisher=U. S. Department of State|date=July 1, 2011|pages=|accessdate=May 19, 2013|isbn=1592431305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new flag was chosen on November 16, 1959, and remained unchanged when Dahomey became independent less than a year later on August 1, 1960.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Whitney|last=Smith|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Benin, flag of|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355066/Benin-flag-of|accessdate=May 19, 2013|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, a [[coup d'état]] took place in the country, with the new government aligning itself with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideals.  In order to symbolize the revolutionary change, the regime renamed the country to [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]] and instituted a new flag three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Benin|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/benin/history|date=|accessdate=May 19, 2013|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This featured a green field [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with a [[Five-pointed star|five-pointed]] [[red star]] in the top-left canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why did Dahomey change its name to Benin?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZZglAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B_UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2870,75786&amp;dq=flag+of+benin&amp;hl=en|date=January 13, 1976|accessdate=May 19, 2013|first=Omo|last=Olukun|newspaper=Washington Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the regime's flag was never adopted by law, making it only the ''[[de facto]]'' flag of Benin.&lt;ref name=Tsavo/&gt;

The green flag remained in place until 1990, when economic problems and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|weakening]] of the [[Soviet Union]]'s power due to the [[Revolutions of 1989]] culminated in the collapse of the People's Republic of Benin.  The socialist regime was replaced and the original flag from 1959 was reinstated on August 1, 1990.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings.  Nationally, the yellow and green allude to the northern [[savanna]]s and [[Arecaceae|palm]] groves located in the south of the country, while the red symbolizes the blood shed by those who fought for Dahomey.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  On a continental level, the yellow, green and red represented the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] movement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ezur2IUQ4OkC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=flag+of+benin#v=onepage&amp;q=flag%20of%20benin&amp;f=false|title=Flags|publisher=HarperCollins UK|year=2004|last=Shaw|first=Carol P.|pages=46|accessdate=May 20, 2013|isbn=9780007165261}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three colours were utilized by the [[African Democratic Rally]], a political party representing the interests of [[French West Africa]] in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly of France]] at the time of decolonization.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  Furthermore, the colours are the same as the ones utilized in the [[flag of Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8UD0kOEb1XIC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=flag+of+benin#v=onepage&amp;q=flag%20of%20benin&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedic World Atlas|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=December 26, 2002|last=Philip|first=George and Son|pages=54|accessdate=May 20, 2013|isbn=9780195219203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This honours the oldest independent country in Africa and the only nation other than [[Liberia]] to remain independent during the [[Scramble for Africa]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/27/iraq.simonjeffery|title= Colouring the outcome|first=Simon|last=Jeffery|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 27, 2004|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">'''Genreflecting''' is the process of examining and analyzing the patterns and characteristics of [[literary genre]]s—both [[fiction]] and recreational [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]]—and using that analysis to identify titles with similar appeals to readers (i.e., read-alikes), in order to make reading suggestions to individuals who are looking for something to read.

The term "genreflecting" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, a prominent [[library science]] educator, in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction|last=Rosenberg|first=Betty|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1982|isbn=978-0872873339|location=Littleton, CO|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the term has been adopted by [[readers' advisory]] in [[Library|libraries]] and extended to [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] genres as well as fiction. A similar practice in retail bookstores is called "hand-selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Retail-Approach-or-Library-Approach-Shaping-Readers-Advisory-John-Schoppert/pid=5938363|title=Retail Approach or Library Approach? Shaping Readers' Advisory, by John  Schoppert {{!}} Booklist Online|website=www.booklistonline.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time the first edition of Rosenberg's ''Genreflecting'' was written, adding popular reading materials to library collections and recommending those titles to readers were controversial practices. Dr. Rosenberg's First Law of Reading—"Never apologize for your reading taste"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—has since been adopted by growing numbers of [[librarian]]s, and the field of [[readers' advisory]] has become increasingly central to the practice of [[Library science|librarianship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2014/02/library-services/the-state-of-readers-advisory/#_|title=The State of Readers’ Advisory|newspaper=Library Journal|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Pearl]], the well known model of the librarian [[action figure]] and author of ''[[Book Lust]]'' and ''More Book Lust,'' has promoted and further popularized the practice of readers' advisory within the library community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litreactor.com/columns/readers-advisory-expert-advice-on-what-to-read-next|title=Library Love: Reader’s Advisory - Expert Advice On What To Read Next|newspaper=LitReactor|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of [[online database]]s have been developed to assist readers' advisors find "read-alikes," including ''What Do I Read Next?'' (Gale Thomson), ''NoveList'' ([[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]]), ''The Reader's Advisor Online'' ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]]), ''Fiction Connection'' (Bowker), and ''Booklist Online'' ([[American Library Association]]).

The '''Gibraltar Museum''' is a [[national museum]] of [[History of Gibraltar|history]], [[Culture of Gibraltar|culture]] and [[natural history]] located within the city centre of the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. Founded in 1930 by the then [[Governor of Gibraltar]], General [[Alexander Godley|Sir Alexander Godley]], the museum houses an array of displays portraying [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock's]] millennia-old history and the unique culture of [[Gibraltarian people|its people]]. The museum also incorporates the remains of a 14th-century [[Moors|Moorish]] bathhouse. Its director since 1991 is [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Clive Finlayson]].&lt;ref name="commonwealth" /&gt;

==History==

===Background===
There were several unsuccessful attempts to establish a museum in Gibraltar during the 19th century. Significant local finds could not be kept on [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]] because there was no museum, resulting in the first known adult [[Neanderthal]] skull (the so-called [[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar skull]]) went to the  [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name="commonwealth" /&gt; This was the second Neanderthal [[fossil]] to be found and was excavated in 1848 at [[Forbes' Quarry]] on the north face of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gibraltar at the end of the Millennium: A Portrait of a Changing Land | year=1999 | publisher=Aquila Services | location=Gibraltar | author=Finlayson, Clive &amp; Geraldine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known collection established in Gibraltar was due to the Reverend John White, chaplain at Gibraltar from 1756 to 1774. Encouraged by his elder brother [[Gilbert White]], he collected [[zoological]] specimens which he studied and sent to England. He took advice from [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] and also later wrote in England, what is considered the first detailed zoological account of Gibraltar. However, ''Fauna Calpensis'' was never published, and it and his collections are now lost.&lt;ref name=foster&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Paul|title=The Gibraltar collections: Gilbert White (1720–1793) and John White (1727–1780), and the naturalist and author Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (1723–1788)|volume=34|pages=30–46|doi=10.3366/anh.2007.34.1.30|issn=0260-9541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next known recording of something that could resemble a museum dates from 1830. [[St Bernard's Hospital]] is recognised to have had a ''room for specimens of natural history and morbid anatomy''. Again, no remains of such collection are kept.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum History|url=http://www.gibmuseum.gi/Museum_History.html|publisher=Gibraltar Museum|accessdate=7 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301120155/http://www.gibmuseum.gi/Museum_History.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first proposal to open a museum in Gibraltar was discussed in 1835 at a meeting of the Gibraltar Scientific Society - a group of [[British Army]] officers who met at the [[Garrison Library]]. The first museum was established and housed in rented accommodation. The museum became so important that the society changed its name to the Museum Society. One of the milestones of the existence of the Society was the presentation of the Gibraltar skull on the 3rd of March, 1848, although its importance was not recognised at the time, it was to the Society, by its secretary, Lieutenant Edmund Flint of the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCxEDWs8kwgC&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=3AL8QmsNaC&amp;dq=skull&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=skull | pages=180–1 | title=The Antiquity of Man | first=Arthur | last=Keith | publisher=Anmol Publications | year=1994 | isbn=9788170419778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation===
The museum's establishment is credited to General [[Alexander Godley|Sir Alexander Godley]], who was installed as [[Governor of Gibraltar]] in 1928. Upon his arrival, he gave an opening address in which he highlighted his reformist aims, which would: "''help to restore [Gibraltar] to its prosperity which had been showing signs of waning''". One of the elements of this reformist mission was the creation of a national museum. After nine months in office, on 30 July 1929, the Gibraltar Society was launched. Its primary objective was to assist the colonial authorities in the foundation of a museum. Godley was able to get two adjacent military quarters for use as a museum. The choice was fortunate as under one of them, Ordnance House, the former residence of the Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores, lay chambers of a [[Moorish Baths, Gibraltar|bathhouse]] from the [[History of Gibraltar#Moorish period|Moorish period]], which had been used as a semi-underground stable.&lt;ref name="ourGibraltar"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Gibraltar | first=Dorothy | last=Ellicott | year=1975 | publisher=Gibraltar Museum Committee | pages=131–132 | authorlink=Dorothy Ellicott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Info" /&gt;

The Gibraltar Museum was opened on 24 July 1930 and on the first anniversary (10th of July 1931), the Gibraltar Museum Ordinance was passed as "''An [[local ordinance|Ordinance]] relating to Ancient Monuments and Antiquities and to provide for the management of the Gibraltar Museum''".&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In the 1970s, the Gibraltar Museum housed the first office of the [[Gibraltar Ornithological &amp; Natural History Society]] (GONHS). Founders of the organisation included then [[curator]] of the museum Joaquin Bensusan and Clive Finlayson, the current museum director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date=16 December 2006 | url=http://www.gonhs.org/documents/2006Pressreleases.pdf | title=GONHS is 30 years old this week | format=PDF | work=2006 PRESS RELEASES | publisher=Gibraltar Ornithological &amp; Natural History Society | accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Except in the [[Alhambra]] there is nothing in Spain to compare with it; and in [[Morocco]] such baths may not be entered by [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]s or Jews, so that its interest is exceptional.&lt;ref name=Gibnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar Museum|url=http://www.gibnet.com/tourist/t_muse.htm|publisher=Gibnet|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Excavations in the museum's garden revealed a water [[channel (geography)|conduit]], dating to the Spanish period. This conduit enters the garden from [[Line Wall Road]] and is thought to have run off an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] that run along that road from wells south of the town. It then runs through the rooms and into a [[cistern]] under the interior [[patio]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The baths consist of rooms similar to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Hypocaust]] system of baths with a normal temperature room for undressing, a cold room and a hot room. Channels under the floor would allow warm air to circulate as a form of [[underfloor heating]]. This process of bathing would act like modern [[sauna]]s whereby moving between hot and cold temperatures cleanses the body by [[perspiration|sweating]].&lt;ref name="Info" /&gt;

[[Greek mythology]] has consistently served as a source for many filmmakers due to its artistic appeal. Antiquity has been reimagined in many ways and these recreations have been met with great public success regardless of their individual achievements. The plot lines of [[epic poetry]] are even more appealing with their enthralling battles, heroic characters, monsters, and gods. And now, with modern technology and [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), our ability as a society to recreate greek mythology on screen has improved greatly.

As a scholar of [[Homer]] put it,&lt;blockquote&gt;"At the beginning of literature, when heroic poetry reach society as a whole...society ''listened''; in the twentieth century society ''views''... the modern heroic medium is film, and not necessarily the productions that are held in highest critical regard."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Homer's ''Iliad'' ==
The ancient Greek epic poem the ''[[Iliad]] (''[[Iliad|Ἰλιάς]]) details the final year of the decade-long [[Trojan War]]. The war began due to divine interaction with mortals: Eris, personification of strife and discord, presented a [[golden apple]] to the goddesses [[Aphrodite]], [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] but instructed that only the fairest of them could keep it. [[Zeus]] sends the three women to Paris, the prince of [[Troy]], who decides to award the apple to Aphrodite, who promises to make the beautiful [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] – wife of Greek King [[Menelaus]] – his wife. Paris' taking of Helen begins the fighting between the Greeks and Trojans. Although the initial rivalry exists between King Menelaus and Paris, the epic poem highlights the argument between Greek hero [[Achilles]] and the Greek King [[Agamemnon]], Achilles' inner turmoil about whether or not he wants to engage in the fighting, and the overall heroic desire for ''[[kleos]]'' (κλέος, "glory, fame") and eventual ''nostos'' (νόστος, "homecoming").

=== Helen of Troy (1956) ===
[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]] is a 1956 epic film based on Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.  Filmed in parts of Rome, the film retells the story of the Trojan War, despite some major changes from the Iliad storyline.

=== Troy (2004) ===
[[Troy (film)|Troy]] is an American epic adventure war film directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen|Wolfgang Peterson]].  Based on Homer’s ''Iliad'', the film describes the story of the Trojan War following the attack of Troy by Greek forces as well as the stories of those involved.  Although the Iliad describes the story of the rivalry between Achilles and Agamemnon in the ninth year, Troy tells the story of the entire decade-long war.  The film’s ending is not taken from the Iliad but from Virgil’s ''Aeneid,'' showing [[Hector]]’s death and funeral instead. The film’s cast includes actors [[Brad Pitt]], [[Orlando Bloom]], and [[Eric Bana]].

== Homer's ''Odyssey'' ==
Another Homeric epic often used in modern film, the ''[[Odyssey]]'' ([[Odyssey|Ὀδύσσεια]]) serves as a sort of sequel to the ''Iliad''. The poem narrates the journey home (or ''nostos'') of Greek hero [[Odysseus]] after ten years of fighting in the Trojan War. Like the ''Iliad'', the poem begins ''[[in medias res]]'', or "in the middle of things," beginning

=== Ulysses (1954) ===
[[Ulysses (1954 film)|Ulysses]] is a fantasy-adventure film based on Homer’s ''Odyssey''.  The film tells the story of Ulysses’ attempt to return home after the Trojan War, as well as the adventures that ensue. In the film, actor [[Silvana Mangano]] plays both [[Penelope]], the wife of Ulysses as well as the sorceress, [[Circe]]. The 1954 film also features actors [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].  Ulysses was a tremendous success which later led to the production of the film [[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]] in 1958, which was credited with igniting the Italian sword-and-sandal craze in the 1960s.

=== The Odyssey (1997) ===
[[The Odyssey (miniseries)|The Odyssey]] is a British-American fantasy-adventure television series based on Homer’s ancient Greek epic poem, The Odyssey.  The miniseries won a 1997 [[Emmy Award]] and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]]. The two-part [[NBC]] miniseries was filmed in Malta, Turkey, parts of England, as well as places around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] where the story took place.

== Apollonius Rhodes' ''Argonautika'' ==

=== Jason and the Argonauts (1963) ===
[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]] is an American-British fantasy film made in 1963. Known for its fantasy creatures and iconic fight scenes, the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in association with Morningside Productions. The film tells the story of the Greek hero as he leads a team of adventurers in a quest for the legendary [[Golden Fleece]].

=== Hercules (1958) ===
[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]] is an Italian epic fantasy based upon both Hercules and the Quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] myths.  The film’s screenplay is based loosely upon the myths of Hercules and the Greek epic poem [[Argonautica|Argonautika]] by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].  Hercules tells the tale of the Greek hero as he sails with the [[Argonauts]], experiencing adventure and romance.

The '''Hebrew alphabet''' ({{lang-he-n|[[wikt:אלפבית|אָלֶף־בֵּית]] עִבְרִי}},{{ref label|Common_Hebrew_Spelling|a|}} ''{{transl|he|Alefbet Ivri}}''), known variously by scholars as the '''Jewish script''', '''square script''', and '''block script''', is an [[abjad]] script used in the writing of the [[Hebrew language]]. It is also used in the writing of other [[Jewish languages]], most notably [[Yiddish]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]], and [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]].

Historically, two separate abjad scripts have been used to write Hebrew. The original, old Hebrew script, known as the [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], has been largely preserved in a variant form as the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. The present "Jewish script" or "square script", on the contrary, is a stylized form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and was known by Jewish sages as the [[Ashuri alphabet]] (lit. "Assyrian"), since its origins were alleged to be from [[Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 21b–22a); Jerusalem Talmud (''Megillah'' 10a). Cf. [[Mishnah]] (''Megillah'' 1:8): "The Books [of Scripture] differ from phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' only in that the Books may be written in any language, while phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' may be written '''in the Assyrian writing only'''."  See: ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: London 1977, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various "styles" (in current terms, "[[font]]s") of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, including a variety of [[cursive Hebrew]] styles. In the remainder of this article, the term "Hebrew alphabet" refers to the square script unless otherwise indicated.

The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have [[letter case|case]], but five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of [[consonant]]s, but is now considered an "[[impure abjad]]". As with other abjads, such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], during its centuries-long use scribes devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as ''[[niqqud]].'' In both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, the letters [[Yodh|{{hebrew|י}}]] [[Waw (letter)|{{hebrew|ו}}]] [[He (letter)|{{hebrew|ה}}]] [[Aleph|{{hebrew|א}}]] can also function as ''[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'', which is when certain consonants are used to indicate vowels. There is a trend in [[Modern Hebrew]] towards the use of ''matres lectionis'' to indicate vowels that have traditionally gone unwritten, a practice known as "[[full spelling]]".

The  [[Yiddish alphabet]], a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet used to write Yiddish, is a true alphabet, with all vowels rendered in the spelling, except in the case of inherited Hebrew words, which typically retain their Hebrew spellings.

The Arabic and Hebrew alphabets have similarities because they are both derived from the [[Aramaic alphabet]].

==History==
[[File:Paleo-hebrew alphabet.jpg|300px|thumb|Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]
[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|300px|thumb|The ''[[Aleppo Codex]]'', a tenth century [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[Book of Joshua]] 1:1]]
{{Main|History of the Hebrew alphabet}}
A distinct Hebrew variant of the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]], called by scholars the [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], emerged around 800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saénz-Badillos |first=Angel |date=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |url= |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=16 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of related early inscriptions from the area include the tenth-century [[Gezer calendar]], and the [[Siloam inscription]] (c. 700 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saénz-Badillos |first=Angel |date=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |url= |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=61–62 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paleo-Hebrew alphabet was used in the ancient kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE during the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Jews]] began using a form of the Assyrian Aramaic alphabet, which was another offshoot of the same family of scripts. The [[Samaritans]], who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, "square" form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that was used by the [[Persian Empire]] (and which in turn had been adopted from the [[Assyria]]ns),&lt;ref name="A History of the Hebrew Language"&gt;{{cite book|year=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-55634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the paleo-Hebrew script called the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. After the fall of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE, Jews used both scripts before settling on the square Assyrian form.

The square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the [[Jewish diaspora]] – such as [[Karaim language|Karaim]], the [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in [[Israel]].

===General===
In the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an [[abjad]] consisting only of [[consonant]]s, [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.

===Vowels===

In the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak [[consonant]]s [[Aleph]] ({{hebrew|א}}), [[He (letter)|He]] ({{hebrew|ה}}), [[Waw (letter)|Vav]] ({{hebrew|ו}}), or  [[Yodh]] ({{hebrew|י}}) serving as vowel letters, or [[Mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']]: the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of [[Yiddish]] and to some extent [[Modern Hebrew]], [[vowel]]s may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|full spelling]] with the weak letters acting as true vowels.

When used to [[Yiddish orthography|write Yiddish]], vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with niqqud diacritics (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|אָ}} or {{Script/Hebrew|יִ}}) or without (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|ע}} or {{Script/Hebrew|י}}), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.

To preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called ''nequdot'' ({{hebrew|ניקודות}}, literally "points"). One of these, the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian system]], eventually prevailed. [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as [[Bible|Biblical]] books intended for study, in [[poetry]] or when teaching the language to children.  The Tiberian system also includes a set of [[cantillation]] marks, called "[[Trope (religion)|trope]]", used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, ''niqqud'' are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from [[Semitic root|Hebrew roots]] (called ''shorashim'' or "triliterals") allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word's context and part of speech.

===Alphabet===

Unlike the Paleo-Hebrew writing script, the modern Ashuri script has five [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] that have special [[final form]]s,{{ref label|Pronunciation_in_Different_Word_Positions|c|}} called '''sofit''' ({{lang-he|סופית}}, meaning in this context "final" or "ending") form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] or in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s.{{ref label|Variants_in_Arabic_Mandaic|b|}} These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are [[List of Unicode characters#Hebrew|Unicode]] standard&lt;ref name="unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_unicode.org"&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf Chart of Hebrew glyphs at unicode.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_fileformat.info"&gt;[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/hebrew/list.htm Unicode names of Hebrew characters at fileformat.info].&lt;/ref&gt;). Although Hebrew is read and written from right to left, the following table shows the letters in order from left to right.

Note that dotless tav, ת, would be expected to be pronounced /θ/ ([[voiceless dental fricative]]), but this pronunciation was lost among most Jews due to its not existing in the countries where they lived (such as in nearly all of Eastern Europe). Yiddish modified this /θ/ to /s/ (cf. [[seseo]] in Spanish), but in modern Israeli Hebrew, it is simply pronounced /t/.

====Shin and sin====

{{further|Shin (letter)}}

''Shin'' and ''sin'' are represented by the same letter, {{hebrew|ש}}, but are two separate [[phoneme]]s. When vowel diacritics are used, the two phonemes are differentiated with a ''shin''-dot or ''sin''-dot; the ''shin''-dot is above the upper-right side of the letter, and the ''sin''-dot is above the upper-left side of the letter.

|}

Historically, ''left-dot-sin'' corresponds to [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] *{{transl|sem|ś}}, which in biblical-Judaic-Hebrew corresponded to the [[Voiceless dental and alveolar lateral fricatives|voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, as evidenced in the Greek transliteration of Hebrew words such as ''[[balsam]]'' ({{Hebrew|בֹּשֶׂם}}) (the ''ls'' - 'שׂ') as is evident in the ''[[Targum Onkelos]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

====Dagesh====

{{main|Dagesh}}
Historically, the consonants {{hebrew|ב}} ''beth'', {{hebrew|ג}} ''gimel'', {{hebrew|ד}} ''daleth'', {{hebrew|כ}} ''kaf'', {{hebrew|פ}} ''pe'' and {{hebrew|ת}} ''tav'' each had two sounds: one hard ([[plosive]]), and one soft ([[fricative consonant|fricative]]), depending on the position of the letter and other factors. When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called ''dagesh'' ({{hebrew|דגש}}), while the soft sounds lack a ''dagesh''. In modern Hebrew, however, the ''dagesh'' only changes the pronunciation of {{hebrew|ב}} ''beth'', {{hebrew|כ}} ''kaf'', and {{hebrew|פ}} ''pe'', and does not affect the name of the letter.  The differences are as follows:

In other dialects (mainly liturgical) there are variations from this pattern.
*In some [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]] dialects, ''bet'' without dagesh is pronounced {{IPA|[b]}}, like ''bet'' with dagesh
*In [[Syrian Jews#Pronunciation of Hebrew|Syrian]] and [[Yemenite Hebrew]], ''gimel'' without dagesh is pronounced {{IPA|[ɣ]}}.
*In Yemenite Hebrew, and in the Iraqi pronunciation of the word "Adonai", ''dalet'' without dagesh is pronounced {{IPA|[ð]}} as in "these"
*In [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], ''tav'' without dagesh is pronounced {{IPA|[s]}} as in "silk"
*In Iraqi and [[Yemenite Hebrew]], and formerly in some other dialects, ''tav'' without dagesh is pronounced {{IPA|[θ]}} as in "thick"

====Sounds represented with diacritic geresh====

{{main|Geresh|Hebraization of English}}

The sounds {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, written "{{Hebrew|צ׳}}", "{{Hebrew|ג׳}}", "{{Hebrew|ז׳}}", and {{IPAblink|w}}, non-standardly sometimes transliterated {{Hebrew|וו}}, are often found in slang and loanwords that are part of the everyday Hebrew colloquial vocabulary. The apostrophe-looking symbol after the Hebrew letter modifies the pronunciation of the letter and is called a ''[[geresh]]''.

The pronunciation of the following letters can also be modified with the geresh diacritic, the represented sounds are however foreign to [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]], i.e., these symbols mainly represent sounds in foreign words or names when transliterated with the Hebrew alphabet, and not [[loanword]]s.

A ''geresh'' is also used to denote [[acronym]]s pronounced as a string of letters, and to denote a [[Hebrew numeral]]. Geresh also is the name of one of the notes of cantillation in the reading of the [[Torah]], but its appearance and function is different.

====Identical pronunciation====

In [[Israel]]'s general population, many letters have the same pronunciation. They are as follows:

&lt;small&gt;* Varyingly&lt;/small&gt;

====Ancient Hebrew pronunciation====

Some of the variations in sound mentioned above are due to a systematic feature of Ancient Hebrew. The six consonants {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called ''[[Begadkefat|BeGeD KeFeT]]'' letters {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|eɪ|ɡ|ɛ|d|ˈ|k|ɛ|f|ɛ|t}}. The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v ɣ ð x f θ/}} when preceded by a vowel (commonly indicated with a macron, ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the ''dagesh''. In Modern Hebrew the sounds ḏ and ḡ have reverted to {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, respectively, and ṯ has become {{IPA|[t]}}, so only the remaining three consonants {{IPA|/b k p/}} show variation. {{hebrew|ר}} ''resh'' may have also been a "doubled" letter, making the list ''BeGeD KePoReT''. ([[Sefer Yetzirah]], 4:1)

*{{hebrew|ח}} ''chet'' and {{hebrew|ע}} ''ayin'' represented [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], {{hebrew|צ}} ''tsadi'' represented the [[emphatic consonant]] {{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{hebrew|ט}} ''tet'' represented the emphatic consonant {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{hebrew|ק}} ''qof'' represented the [[uvular consonant|uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}}. All these are common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[consonant]]s.
*{{hebrew|שׂ}} ''sin'' (the {{IPA|/s/}} variant of {{hebrew|ש}} ''shin'') was originally different from both {{hebrew|שׁ}} ''shin'' and {{hebrew|ס}} ''samekh'', but had become {{IPA|/s/}} the same as {{hebrew|ס}} ''samekh'' by the time the vowel pointing was devised. Because of [[cognate]]s with other [[Semitic language]]s, this phoneme is known to have originally been a [[lateral consonant]], most likely the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ɬ/}} (the sound of modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ll'') or the [[voiceless alveolar lateral affricate]] {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (like [[Náhuatl]] ''tl'').

====Regional and historical variation====

The following table contains the [[pronunciation]] of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]]. The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a [[Yodh|yud]] but a [[geresh]]. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a "[[dagesh]] kal", also modifies the sounds of the letters &lt;span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;"&gt;[[ב]], [[כ]] and [[פ]]&lt;/span&gt; in [[modern Hebrew]] (in some forms of Hebrew it modifies also the sounds of the letters &lt;span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;"&gt;[[ג]], [[ד]] and/or [[ת]];&lt;/span&gt; the "dagesh chazak" – orthographically indistinguishable from the "dagesh kal" – designates [[gemination]], which today is realized only rarely – e.g. in biblical recitations or when using [[Arabic]] [[loanword]]s).

====Matres lectionis====
{{main|Mater lectionis}}

{{hebrew|א}} ''alef'', ע ''ayin'', {{hebrew|ו}} ''vav'' and {{hebrew|י}} ''yod'' are letters that can sometimes indicate a vowel instead of a consonant (which would be, respectively, {{IPA|/ʔ/, /ʔ/, /v/ and /j/}}). When they do, {{hebrew|ו}} and {{hebrew|י}} are considered to constitute part of the vowel designation in combination with a niqqud symbol – a vowel diacritic (whether or not the diacritic is marked), whereas {{hebrew|א}} and ע are considered to be mute, their role being purely indicative of the non-marked vowel.

====Vowel points====

''[[Niqqud]]'' is the system of dots that help determine vowels and consonants. In Hebrew, all forms of ''niqqud'' are often omitted in writing, except for children's books, prayer books, poetry, foreign words, and words which would be ambiguous to pronounce. Israeli Hebrew has five vowel phonemes, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, but many more written symbols for them:

'''Note 4:''' The letter ו (''vav'') is used since it can only be represented by that letter.&lt;/small&gt;

=====Meteg=====
{{main|Meteg}}

By adding a vertical line (called ''[[Meteg]]'') underneath the letter and to the left of the vowel point, the vowel is made long. The ''meteg'' is only used in [[Biblical Hebrew]], not [[Modern Hebrew]].

=====Sh'va=====
{{main|Sh'va}}

By adding two vertical dots (called ''[[Sh'va]]'') underneath the letter, the vowel is made very short. When sh'va is placed on the first letter of the word, mostly it is "è" (but in some instances, it makes the first letter silent without a vowel (vowel-less): e.g. '''&lt;big&gt;וְ&lt;/big&gt;''' ''wè'' to "w")

===Gershayim===
{{main|Gershayim}}
The symbol {{Hebrew|'''״'''}} is called a [[gershayim]] and is a punctuation mark used in the Hebrew language to denote acronyms. It is written before the last letter in the acronym, e.g. {{Hebrew|ר״ת}}. Gershayim is also the name of a note of [[cantillation]] in the reading of the [[Torah]], printed above the accented letter, e.g. {{Hebrew|א֞}}.

==Stylistic variants==
{{further|Cursive Hebrew|Rashi script|Ashuri alphabet|History of the Hebrew alphabet}}

The following table displays typographic and chirographic variants of each letter. For the five letters that have a different final form used at the end of words, the final forms are displayed beneath the regular form.

The block (square, or "print" type) and cursive ("handwritten" type) are the only variants in widespread contemporary use. Rashi is also used, for historical reasons, in a handful of standard texts.

| The ''[[rafe]]'' ({{hebrew|רפה}}) [[Hebrew diacritics|diacritic]] is no longer regularly used in Hebrew. In [[Masoretic Text]]s and some other older texts, [[lenition|lenited]] consonants and sometimes ''matres lectionis'' are indicated by a small line on top of the letter. Its use has been largely discontinued in modern printed texts. It is still used to mark fricative consonants in the [[YIVO]] orthography of [[Yiddish]].

==Numeric values of letters==
{{main|Hebrew numerals}}

Following the adoption of Greek Hellenistic alphabetic numeration practice, Hebrew letters started being used to denote numbers in the late 2nd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Sirat, Colette (1976), ''Ecriture et civilisations'', Paris: Editions du CNRS.&lt;/ref&gt; and performed this arithmetic function for about a thousand years. Nowadays alphanumeric notation is used only in specific contexts, e.g. denoting dates in the [[Hebrew calendar]], denoting grades of school in Israel, other listings (e.g. שלב א׳, שלב ב׳ – "phase a, phase b"), commonly in [[Kabbalah]] ([[Judaism|Jewish]] [[mysticism]]) in a practice known as [[gematria]], and often in religious contexts.

The numbers 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 are commonly represented by the juxtapositions &lt;span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override; text-direction:ltr;"&gt;ק״ת, ר״ת, ש״ת, ת״ת, and ק״תת&lt;/span&gt; respectively.
Adding a [[geresh]] ("׳") to a letter multiplies its value by one thousand, for example, the year 5778 is portrayed as ה׳תשע״ח, where ה represents 5000, and תשע״ח represents 778.

==Transliterations and transcriptions==
{{Main|Romanization of Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew orthography|Yiddish|Yiddish orthography}}

The following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in [[Modern Hebrew]].

Clarifications:
*For some letters, the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] offers a ''precise'' transliteration that differs from the ''regular'' standard it has set. When omitted, no such precise alternative exists and the regular standard applies.
*The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [[phoneme|phonemic]] transcription is specified whenever it uses a different symbol from the one used for the '''regular''' standard Israeli transliteration.
*The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [[phonetics|phonetic]] transcription is specified whenever it differs from IPA '''phonemic''' transcription.

Note: [[Society of Biblical Literature|SBL's]] transliteration system, recommended in its ''Handbook of Style'',&lt;ref name=SBL&gt;[http://www.viceregency.com/Translit.htm Resources for New Testament Exegesis – Transliteration Standards of The SBL Handbook of Style]&lt;/ref&gt; differs slightly from the 2006 ''precise'' transliteration system of the Academy of the Hebrew Language; for "[[צ]]" SBL uses "ṣ" (≠ AHL "ẓ"), and for [[Begadkefat|בג״ד כפ״ת]] with no dagesh, SBL uses the same symbols as for with dagesh (i.e. "b", "g", "d", "k", "f", "t").&lt;!-- THIS INFORMATION RELIES ON http://www.viceregency.com/Translit.htm, IF BETTER SOURCE AVAILABLE, PLEASE CORRECT! --&gt;

;Notes:
{{note label|silent_A1_eg|}}{{note label|silent_A2_eg|}}{{note label|silent_A3_eg|}}{{note label|silent_A4_eg|}}&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''1{{note|silent_A1}}2{{note|silent_A2}}3{{note|silent_A3}}4{{note|silent_A4}}&lt;/sup&gt;In transliterations of modern Israeli Hebrew, initial and final ע (in regular transliteration), silent or initial א, and silent ה are ''not'' transliterated. To the eye of readers orientating themselves on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters might seem to be transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacritics – niqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in אִם ("if", {{IPA|[ʔim]}}), אֵם ("mother", {{IPA|[ʔe̞m]}}) and אֹם ("[[nut (hardware)|nut]]", {{IPA|[ʔo̞m]}}), the letter א always represents the same consonant: {{IPAblink|ʔ}} ([[glottal stop]]), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or not. Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that א in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop &amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ʾ&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in "im", "em" and "om", respectively.

{{note label|geresh_B1_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B2_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B3_eg|}}&lt;sup&gt;'''B'''1{{note|geresh_B1}}2{{note|geresh_B2}}3{{note|geresh_B3}}&lt;/sup&gt;The [[diacritic]] [[geresh]] – "׳" – is used with some other letters as well (ד׳, ח׳, ט׳, ע׳, ר׳, ת׳), but only to transliterate ''from'' other languages ''to'' Hebrew – never to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made). The non-standard "ו׳" and "וו" {{ref label|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1|e1|}} are sometimes used to represent {{IPAslink|w}}, which like {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}} and {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} appears in Hebrew slang and loanwords.

{{note label|ch_C1_eg|}}{{note label|ch_C2_eg|}}&lt;sup&gt;'''C'''1{{note|ch_C1}}2{{note|ch_C2}}&lt;/sup&gt;The Sound {{IPAslink|χ}} (as "ch" in [[loch]]) is often transcribed "ch", inconsistently with the guidelines specified by the Academy of the Hebrew Language: חם {{IPA|/χam/}} → "cham"; סכך {{IPA|/sχaχ/}} → "schach".

{{note label|final_pe_D_eg|}}&lt;sup&gt;'''D'''{{note|final_pe_D}}&lt;/sup&gt;Although the Bible does include a single occurrence of a final pe with a dagesh ([[Book of Proverbs]] 30, 6: "{{Hebrew|אַל-תּוֹסְףְּ עַל-דְּבָרָיו: פֶּן-יוֹכִיחַ בְּךָ וְנִכְזָבְתָּ.}}"), in modern Hebrew {{IPAslink|p}} is always represented by [[Pe (letter)|pe]] in its regular, not final, form "פ", even when in final word position, which occurs with loanwords (e.g. שׁוֹפּ {{IPA|/ʃop/}} ''"shop"''), foreign names (e.g. פִילִיפּ {{IPA|/ˈfilip/}} ''"Philip"'') and some slang (e.g. חָרַפּ {{IPA|/χaˈrap/}} ''"slept deeply"'').

==Religious use==
The letters of the Hebrew alphabet have played varied roles in Jewish religious literature over the centuries, primarily in mystical texts. Some sources in classical [[rabbinical literature]] seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], for example, records that "the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy", and that the letters "came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]");&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 21b&lt;/ref&gt; others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or [[Jewish messianism|the redemption]]. In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the [[Talmud]] illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Pesach 87b, Avodah Zarah 18a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the letters' creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the [[Sefer Yezirah]], or ''Book of Creation'', a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the [[Book of Genesis]], largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and [[Zohar]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zohar 1:3; 2:152&lt;/ref&gt;

Another book, the 13th-century [[Kabbalistic]] text [[Sefer HaTemunah]], holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the [[teffilin]] box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will [[Tikkun Olam|repair the universe]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Book of Letters''. Woodstock, Vermont: Jewish Lights Publishing, Woodstock. 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with final forms hold the "secret of redemption".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition, the letters occasionally feature in [[aggadic]] portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given [[anthropomorphic]] qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation):

{{quote box
| align = center
| width = 50%
| quote = ''Why does the story of creation begin with bet?... In the same manner that the letter bet is closed on all sides and only open in front, similarly you are not permitted to inquire into what is before or what was behind, but only from the actual time of Creation.''
| source = Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Hagigah, 77c
}}

Extensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within [[Mishna Berura]] of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]].

==Mathematical use==
See [[aleph number]] and [[beth number]] and [[gimel function]].

In [[set theory]], &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced aleph-naught or aleph-zero, is used to mark the [[cardinal number]] of an infinite [[countable set]], such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all integers. More generally, the &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (aleph) notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.

Less frequently used, the &lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (beth) notation is used for the iterated [[power set]]s of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. The 2nd element &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Very occasionally, gimel is used in cardinal notation.

==Unicode and HTML==
[[File:Hebrew keyboard layout.png|thumb|An example of a Hebrew keyboard.]]
{{main|Unicode and HTML for the Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew keyboard}}
The [[Unicode]] Hebrew block extends from U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It includes [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], [[combining diacritical mark]]s (''[[Niqqud]]'' and [[cantillation]] marks) and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref name="unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_unicode.org" /&gt; The [[Numeric character reference|Numeric Character References]] is included for HTML. These can be used in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew [[glyphs]] compatible with the majority of web browsers.

Standard Hebrew keyboards have a 101-key layout.  Like the standard [[QWERTY]] layout, the Hebrew layout was derived from the order of letters on Hebrew [[typewriter]]s.

==Notes==
&lt;sup&gt;a{{note|Common_Hebrew_Spelling}}&lt;/sup&gt;"Alef-bet" is commonly written in Israeli Hebrew without the ''{{transl|he|maqaf}}'' ({{lang|he|מקף}}, "[Hebrew] hyphen"), {{lang|he|אלפבית עברי}}, as opposed to with the hyphen, {{lang|he|אלף־בית עברי}}.

&lt;sup&gt;b{{note|Variants_in_Arabic_Mandaic}}&lt;/sup&gt;The [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic letters]] generally (as six of the primary letters can have only two variants) have four forms, according to their place in the word. The same goes with the [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic ones]], except for three of the 22 letters, which have only one form.

&lt;sup&gt;c{{note|Pronunciation_in_Different_Word_Positions}}&lt;/sup&gt;In forms of Hebrew older than Modern Hebrew, '''כ״ף''', '''בי״ת''' and '''פ״א''' can only be read ''b'', ''k'' and ''p'', respectively, at the beginning of a word, while they will have the sole value of ''v'', ''kh'' and ''f'' in a ''sofit'' (final) position, with few exceptions.&lt;ref name="kaf_sofit"/&gt; In medial positions, both pronunciations are possible. In Modern Hebrew this restriction is not absolute, e.g. פִיזִיקַאי {{IPA|/fiziˈkaj/}} and never {{IPA|/piziˈkaj/}} (= "physicist"), סְנוֹבּ {{IPA|/snob/}} and never {{IPA|/snov/}} (= "snob"). A ''[[dagesh]]'' may be inserted to unambiguously denote the [[plosive]] variant: בּ = {{IPA|/b/}}, כּ = {{IPA|/k/}}, פּ ={{IPA|/p/}}; similarly (though today very rare in Hebrew and common only in [[Yiddish]]) a [[rafe|rafé]] placed above the letter unambiguously denotes the [[fricative]] variant: בֿ = {{IPA|/v/}}, כֿ = {{IPA|/χ/}} and פֿ = {{IPA|/f/}}. In [[Modern Hebrew]] [[orthography]], the sound {{IPAblink|p}} at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form "פ", as opposed to the final form "ף", which always denotes {{IPAblink|f}} (see [[#Transliterations and transcriptions|table of transliterations and transcriptions]], comment{{ref label|final_pe_D_eg|D|}}).

&lt;sup&gt;d{{note|Double_Vav_as_Ligature_or_as_Separate_Letters}}&lt;/sup&gt;However, וו (two separate vavs), used in [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|Ktiv male]], is to be distinguished from the ''Yiddish ligature'' װ (also two vavs but together as one character).

&lt;sup&gt;e1{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1}}e2{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_2}}e3{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_3}}e4{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_4}}e5{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_5}}&lt;/sup&gt;The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both {{IPAblink|v}} and {{IPAblink|w}} be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter Vav.&lt;ref name="trans-into-heb taatiq2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Transliteration Rules |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703210016/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }} issued by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote {{IPA|[w]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[v]}} but rather, when [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|spelling without niqqud]], to denote the [[phoneme]] /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single Vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in spelling without niqqud denotes one of the [[phoneme]]s /u/ or /o/. To pronounce foreign words and [[loanword]]s containing the sound {{IPAblink|w}}, Hebrew readers must therefore rely on former knowledge and context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">The '''history of scholarship''' is the historical study of [[fields of study]] which are not covered by the English term "science" (cf., [[history of science]]), but are covered by, for example, the German term "[[Wissenschaft]]" (i.e., all kinds of academic studies). Examples are the history of classical studies, the history of the study of religions, of philosophy, of Biblical studies, of historiography, of the study of music, arts etc. It is a field which has recently undergone a complete renewal and is now a major branch of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ligota, C.

Rudolph Pfeiffer (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Rudolph (1968). History of Classical Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age.  Oxford University Press. (Oxford University Press academic monograph reprints). &lt;/ref&gt; describes the history of classical scholarship from its revival inspired by Petrarch to the achievements of the Italian humanists and the idependent movement in Holland (including Erasmus) and the German scholar-reformers. Pfeiffer traces the development of classical scholarship in the countries of Western Europe through the next two Centuries, with particular attention to sixteenth-century France and eighteenth-century England. Finally he provides an account of the new approach made by Winckelmann and his successors in Germany.

For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}

An international strategy to operationalise the Dakar Framework for Action;
The World Education Forum (Dakar 2000) agreed to reach 6 goals by 2015:
* expand early childhood care and education
* improve access to complete, free schooling of good quality for all primary school-age children
* greatly increase learning opportunities for youth and adults
* improve adult literacy rates by 50%
* eliminate gender disparities in schooling
* improve all aspects of education quality. 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

* “Volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study” (Indicator 4.B.1)

* “By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States” (Target 4.C)

* “Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country” (Indicator 4.C.1)

According to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals” in 2018, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals (English)|first=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2015-12-01|title=Incheon declaration : education 2030 - towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/167341467987876458/Incheon-declaration-education-2030-towards-inclusive-and-equitable-quality-education-and-lifelong-learning-for-all|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success.

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Ivanovich Betskoi''' or '''Betskoy''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Ива́нович Бе́цкой}}; {{OldStyleDate|14 February|1704|3 February}}{{spaced ndash}}{{OldStyleDate|11 September|1795|31 August}}) was a [[Russia]]n school reformer who served as [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]'s advisor on education and President of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] for thirty years (1764–94). Perhaps the crowning achievement of his long career was the establishment of Russia's first unified system of public [[education]].

== Life ==

Betskoy's parents were Prince [[Ivan Trubetskoy]], a Russian Field Marshal, and his Swedish mistress, Baroness [[Wrede family|Wrede]]. His surname is the abbreviated form of his father's.

He was born in [[Stockholm]], where Trubetskoy was held captive throughout the [[Great Northern War]], and went to [[Copenhagen]] to get a military education before joining a Danish cavalry regiment. It was in the Danish service that he sustained a fall from a horse which forced him to retire from the service. Field Marshal Trubetskoy, having no other sons but Betskoy, recalled him to [[Russia]] in 1729. At first he served as his father's [[aide-de-camp]] but later would be sent on diplomatic missions to various capitals of Europe.

Betskoy was actively involved in a [[coup d'etat]] that brought [[Elizaveta Petrovna]] to the Russian throne. The grateful empress promoted him to General Major and asked him to attend [[Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]], whose daughter Catherine was selected as a bride for the Empress' nephew and heir, Grand Duke Peter. In truth, Betskoy had been on friendly terms with Johanna Elisabeth for two decades previous, their intimacy giving rise to rumours that Catherine was his biological daughter.

After Johanna Elisabeth was expelled from Russia in 1747, Betskoy found it necessary to lay down his offices and settle in [[Paris]], where he spent the following 15 years in commerce with the [[Encyclopédistes]] especially to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. And to [[Denis Diderot]], he was at least in correspondence with him. He was introduced to the highest echelons of the French aristocracy by his only sister Anastasia Ivanovna, Landgravine von [[Hesse-Homburg]] (her first husband was Prince [[Demetre Cantemir]], ruler of [[Moldavia]]). 

[[Peter III of Russia]] recalled Betskoy to Russia and put him in charge of imperial palaces and gardens. Upon arriving to Saint Petersburg, Betskoy renewed his acquaintance with the sovereign's wife (and his own purported daughter), helping her depose Peter in 1762. His hopes to profit from his prominent share in the conspiracy were high. In her memoirs, [[Ekaterina Dashkova]] recalls an episode when Betskoy importuned the Empress with questions like "Was I not the one who incited the Guards? Was I not the one who threw money to the people?"

Although Betskoy held no post of any consequence until 1764, when Catherine made him President of the Imperial Academy of Arts, he went on to become a pillar of the Russian establishment. His position at Catherine's court is not easy to classify. Some historians define his post as a "personal secretary"; others regard Betskoy as an "unofficial education minister" to the Empress. He was one of the few people who enjoyed unlimited access to the Tsarina on daily basis for most of her reign. It was at his suggestion that [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] was commissioned to sculpt the ''[[Bronze Horseman]]''; and it was he who engaged [[Georg von Veldten]] to design a magnificent iron fence for the [[Summer Garden]].

Betskoy's influence continued unabated until the late 1780s when Catherine's tolerance towards the ideas of the Enlightenment began to be eroded and Betskoy was declared "reverting to childhood" on account of his advanced age. Death overtook him in his ninety-second year, when he had long been incapacitated by blindness. Betskoy never married and left his estates to a natural daughter who enjoyed Catherine's particular favour; she married [[Jose de Ribas]], a Spanish adventurer who founded the city of [[Odessa]].

== Educational reform ==
[[Image:Betskoy Ivan Ivanovich2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Ivan Betskoy, by [[Alexander Roslin]] (1791). For a statue of Betskoy, see here.&lt;ref&gt;http://enc.lfond.spb.ru/bigimage.php?kod=62{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In 1763, Betskoy presented to Catherine the ''Statute for the Education of the Youth of Both Sexes'', studded with citations from [[Comenius]], [[John Locke]], and Rousseau. The treatise contained a proposal to educate young Russians of both sexes in state [[boarding school]]s, aimed at creating "a new race of men". Betskoy set forth a number of arguments for general education of children rather than specialized one:  "in regenerating our subjects by an education founded on these principles, we will create... new citizens." Boarding schools were to be preferred to other institutions of education in accordance with Rousseau's notion that "isolating the pupils enabled their tutors to protect them from the vices of society."&lt;ref&gt;David Ransel, "Ivan Betskoi and the Institutionalization of Enlightenment in Russia", in ''Canadian-American Slavic Studies'' 14, no. 3 (1980), page 327–328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empress endorsed his proposal and established the [[Society for the Training of Well-Born Girls]], with Betskoy as a trustee. This so-called [[Smolny Institute]] was the first female educational institution in Russia and one of the first in Europe. The Smolny was to become a training ground for Rousseau's ideas on education: the girls{{spaced ndash}}viewed as the future centers of their families{{spaced ndash}}were protected from every pernicious influence and their moral education was given more prominence than intellectual one. The Empress personally maintained a correspondence with some of the pupils, perhaps viewing the school for women as a vindication of her own place at the pinnacle of Russian society.&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Graham. ''Science in Russia and the Soviet Union: A Short History''. Cambridge University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-521-28789-8}}. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the students of this institution Betskoy and Catherine brought out an instruction entitled ''On the Duties of Man and Citizen''. This essay not only discussed the pupil's duties in regard to God and to society but also contained practical advice on health, hygiene, and other everyday matters. An extensive collection of Betskoy's aids and manuals was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1775. This edition was revised and expanded to two volumes printed in 1789–1791.

Born out of wedlock himself and anxious to reduce the frequency of [[infanticide]], Betskoy found in illegitimate children and orphans an ideal material for implementing his educational theories. It was by his advice that two large [[Child abandonment|foundling]] homes were established, [[Moscow Orphanage|first in Moscow]] (1764) and then in [[Saint Petersburg]] (1770). The Saint Petersburg Foundling House was a precursor of the modern [[Herzen University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herzen.spb.ru/index.phtml?id=2600 210 years of Herzen University] Official University site&lt;/ref&gt; Not less potent was his encouragement of education for merchant's sons. Betskoy deplored the fact that "we have only two classes of society, either peasants or noblemen" and sought to spur the development of [[middle-class]] consciousness by establishing a commercial school in Moscow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11103">There are a number of languages spoken in Honduras though the official language is Spanish.

== Studies ==
Several studies have been carried out on the languages spoken in Honduras, including the following:

- Honduran Dictionary (Catracho), in 1899, [[Alberto de Jesús Membreño]], published the first Honduran Dictionary with the title of "Honduranisms Vocabulary of the Provinces of Honduras", nourished with great part of the words and expressions collected in [[Botica del pueblo|La Botica del pueblo]] of Doctor [[Francisco Cruz Castro]].

In the twenty-second edition of the [[Diccionario de la lengua española|Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary]], 2001, [[Academia Hondureña de la Lengua|AHL]] made a valuable contribution to the Spanish-speaking world: 1,950 Hondurans were incorporated. In the twenty-first edition, in 1992, there were 302. Thus, there are about 2,702, including 400 Honduran gentilices, which makes [[Hondurans|Honduran]] Spanish speakers one of the greatest contributors of new lexical elements in that edition of the dictionary.

=== Dictionary: I know you, mosco ===
Likewise, "I know you, Mosco - Dictionary of Honduran popular thought" (Juan Carlos I Spanish King of the [[Cooperación cultural española en Honduras|Spanish Cultural Cooperation]] in Honduras), by Juan Ramón Saravia, compiled more than 2,700 words.

=== Dictionary of Languages of Honduras DLH ===
{{main|Honduran Languages Dictionary}}

In 2013, and after 4 years of work coordinated by Dr. [[Víctor Manuel Ramos (Honduras)|Victor Manuel Ramos]], the [[Academia Hondureña de la Lengua|Honduran Academy of the Language]] AHL presents the "Dictionary of the Languages of Honduras", filled in by the [http://ccet-aecid.hn/dictionaries portal dedicated to linguistic diversity of Honduras], with access to the dictionaries of 'Honduranisms' and of the 'Languages of Honduras DLH'.

==Languages spoken in Honduras==
In Honduras, dozens of languages were spoken before the Spanish conquest. The language most spoken was the Lenca language; after the conquest, the most spoken language became the Castilian.

=== Honduran Sign Language ===
{{main|Honduran Sign Language}}

=== Lencan languages ===
{{main|Lencan languages}}

The language of the Honduran lencas, known as or also called "lenca", is considered an extinct language. Because it is already in danger of extinction, it has a population of 300 to 594 inhabitants. Its geographical location is between the western departments of Honduras, as they are: Lempira, [[Intibucá Department|Intibucá]], [[La Paz]], also they are in smaller quantity in the central departments of [[Santa Bárbara (Honduras)|Santa Barbara]], Comayagua, [[Francisco Morazán]] and [[Valley]].

The native lencas religion was a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion that saw reality from an animist point of view, believed in [[Nagual|nahualism]] and the gods were organized hierarchically.

=== Ch’orti’ language ===
{{main|Ch’orti’ language}}

The [[Chorites]] speak a language of the [[Mayan languages]] in the Chol group. They have lost their language and have adopted the Spanish language.

=== Garifuna language ===
{{main|Garifuna language}}

They are the result of the mixture of African slaves (that shipwrecked in two ships in 1655 and another one that shipwrecked in 1675) with the Caribbean Indians (Amerindians, who had diverse languages called Caribbean languages), thus originated the black Caribs who dominated the Island of San Vicente until 1797, when they were expelled by the English towards Roatán and Trujillo.

=== Ethnicity ===
{{main|Culture of Honduras}}

The Bay Islands are composed of larger islands called Utila, Roatan and Guanaja and their smaller islands or islets called Morat, Barbareta, Santa Elena and Cayos Cochinos. They are located on the northern coast of Honduras.

Their language is Creole English. Imported from [[England]] and [[Ireland]], when the [[Piracy|pirates]] and corsairs possessed these lands, when they attacked the ships of the [[Spanish Empire]].

=== Tawahka or sumo language ===
{{main|Sumo languages}}

[[File:AurelioMartinezACALing 01.JPG|thumb|Diego Cardona represents the Tawahka in a congress in the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras|National Autonomous University of Honduras]]]]

According to studies consulted, the Tawahka language and the Misquita are quite similar in their morphological and syntactic structure, although they do not have much lexicon in common. Both languages belong to the group macro-chibcha, linguistic group of [[South America]]n origin. It is assumed that in very distant dates the ancestors of the Tawahkas, Misquitos and the branches (another related group), emigrated from what is now Colombia passing through the isthmus of [[Panama]]. The Tawahkas call their language Twanka, which shows a similarity to the name that, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Spaniards gave the Indians of the Guayape-Guayambre area: tahuajcas.
The mother tongue of this town is Tawahka, but they also speak Miskito and Spanish, although they still have some difficulty speaking Spanish.

=== Tolupan language ===
{{main|Jicaquean languages}}

=== Paya language ===
{{main|Paya language}}

They call themselves "pech" which means "people," a term that is used to refer only to them; for the rest of the population they use the terms pech-akuá (the other people) or bulá that means ladino. Lehmann and Greenberg consider that the pech language comes from the chibcha, although some linguists consider it an isolated league.

=== Miskitu ethnicity ===
{{main|Miskito people}}

It is a Mesoamerican ethnic group that has its own language, which occupied part of the territory of Honduras and El Salvador since pre-Columbian times.

In the time of the Spanish conquest only three lencas are named in the documents of that time: Mota, Entepica and Léppira.

=== Castilian ===
{{main|Spanish language}}

The most widely spoken language in Honduras today is Castilian. Its name comes from the language where the language was born, the region of [[Castile (historical region)|Castilla]]. In Honduras there is a variant of Spanish called Honduran Spanish or also called Honduran Castilian.

=== Matagalpa language ===
{{main|Matagalpa language}}

It is an extinct language of the [[Misumalpan languages]] that was the main language of the central highlands of the republic of Nicaragua and of the [[El Paraíso Department|department of El Paraíso]] in The Republic of Honduras.

In El Paraíso, it was called the language of the "Chatos" and "Sules" of that Honduran department.

== Classification ==
Hondurans, as mentioned, are usually classified into six language families. Some of the languages are poorly documented, however, it seems that all languages documented in Honduras can be classified with reasonable certainty. Some of the languages are currently extinct (and here they are marked with the sign †). The table indicates the territories where the different languages were spoken, although in the actulidad the languages have disappeared of many of the indicated departments. The following list contains 12 languages between living languages and extinct languages:

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">The '''Leszynski naming convention''' (or '''LNC''') is a variant of [[Hungarian notation]] popularized by consultant Stan Leszynski specifically for use with [[Microsoft Access]] development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/dnaraccess/html/msdn_20naming.asp Naming Conventions for Microsoft Access (Archived Microsoft Access Content)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Naming convention (programming)|naming convention]] is nowadays often used within the [[Microsoft Access]] community, and is the standard in [[Visual Basic]] programming, it is not widely used elsewhere.

The conventions are derived from an earlier set of conventions, the Leszynski/Reddick naming conventions, originally developed in 1992 by [[Greg Reddick]]. Eventually, Leszynski and Reddick had different ideas about how the conventions should be developed, and split into two separate sets of conventions, the other being the [[RVBA Conventions]].

As in all Hungarian notations, it uses prefixes (called ''tags'') to indicate the type of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] and [[database development]] fields. 
The general structure of Hungarian notation (named after [[Charles Simonyi]]'s native country) is to break down object names into the following elements:
[prefix(es)][tag]BaseName[Suffix/Qualifier]
The tags are always [[Lower case|lower-case]] and each word of the object name is [[majuscule|capitalized]]. Spaces and underscores are not used. 

==Advantages==
Since the Leszynski naming convention is a special form of [[Hungarian notation]] the same general advantages also apply to the Leszynski convention.

The use of distinctive prefixes makes your database self-documenting; when you see ''frmSales'' in VBA code, you will know that it references a form, and when you see ''curSales'' you will know that it is a Currency variable.  When selecting a query from a drop-down list, you will know that a query starting with ''qmak'' is a make-table query, while one starting with ''quni'' is a union query.  This information will allow you to avoid errors such as using the SetFocus method (a control method) with a field, or trying to open a table.

==Disadvantages==
*Since the Leszynski naming convention is a special form of [[Hungarian notation]] the same general disadvantages also apply to the Leszynski convention.
*Changes in database design may require wholesale renaming. For example, replacing a table with a query would involve either retaining the tbl name for the query, or going through the entire database replacing the tbl name with a query name.
*When transferring the database to a different DBMS, problems will arise if the target DBMS does not support [[CamelCase]] names.
*As every object of the same type starts with the same letter, it is not possible to navigate through the objects in a [[List box]] by typing the beginning letter.

==Elements==
The elements of the naming convention are described in the following table.

'''Medieval Hebrew''' was a literary and liturgical language that existed between the 4th and 18th century. It was not commonly used as a spoken language, but mainly in written form by [[Rabbinic literature|rabbis]], scholars and poets. Medieval Hebrew had many features that distinguished it from older forms of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. These affected grammar, syntax, sentence structure, and also included a wide variety of new lexical items, which were either based on older forms or [[loanword|borrowed]] from other languages, especially [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Hebreeuwse taal. §1. Oud-Hebreeuws en Midden-Hebreeuws". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]] and [[Jonah ibn Janah]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[David Hakohen]] and the two [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]]s, in a "purified" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative metres (see [[piyyut]]).  This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. Many have direct parallels in medieval Arabic. The [[Ibn Tibbon]] family, and especially [[Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon]] were personally responsible for the creation of much of this form of Hebrew, which they employed in their translations of scientific materials from the Arabic.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} At that time, original Jewish philosophical and theological works produced in [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spain]] were usually written in Arabic,&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; but as time went on, this form of Hebrew was used for many original compositions as well.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized [[Rabbinic Hebrew]] of the Talmud.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

By late 12th and early 13th centuries the cultural center of Mediterranean Jewry was transferred from an Islamic context to Christian lands. The written Hebrew used in Northern Spain, Provence (a term for all of the South of France) and Italy was increasingly influenced by Latin, particularly in philosophical writings, and also by different vernaculars (Provençal, Italian, etc.). In Italy we witness the flourishing of a new genre, Italian-Hebrew philosophical lexicons. The Italian of these lexicons was generally written in Hebrew characters and are a useful source for the knowledge of Scholastic philosophy among Jews. One of the earliest lexicons was that by Moses b. Shlomo of Salerno, who died in the late 13th. century; it was meant to clarify terms that appear in his commentary on Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. Moses of Salerno's glossary was edited by Giuseppe Sermoneta in 1969. There are also glossaries associated with Jewish savants who befriended Pico della Mirandola. Moses of Salerno's commentary on the Guide also contains Italian translations of technical terms, which brings the Guide's Islamic-influenced philosophical system into confrontation with 13th-century Italian scholasticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Hebrew was also used as a language of communication among Jews from different countries, particularly for the purpose of international trade.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Mention should also be made of the letters preserved in the Cairo geniza, which reflect the Arabic-influenced Hebrew of medieval Egyptian Jewry. The Arabic terms and syntax that appear in the letters constitute a significant source for the documentation of spoken medieval Arabic, since Jews in Islamic lands tended to use colloquial Arabic in writing rather than classical Arabic, which is the Arabic that appears in Arabic medieval sources.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

"'''My Biełarusy'''" ({{lang-be|Мы, беларусы}}; {{lang-ru|Мы, беларусы|My, belarusy}}; "We Belarusians") is the unofficial title of the [[national anthem]] of [[Belarus]] and the first line of its [[lyrics]]. Officially, "My Biełarusy" is titled "'''the State Anthem of the Republic of Belarus'''" ({{lang-be|Дзяржаўны гімн Рэспублікі Беларусь}}, ''Dziaržawny himn Respubliki Biełaruś''; {{lang-ru|Государственный гимн Республики Беларусь}}, ''Gosudarstvennyj gimn Respubliki Belarusj&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''). The anthem was originally written and adopted in 1955 for use in the [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalanthems.me/belarus-my-belarusy/ | title=Belarus – My Belarusy | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2017-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of the [[Anthem of Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian SSR anthem]] was composed by [[Niescier Sakałoŭski]] and the lyrics were written by [[Mikhas Klimkovich]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the music composed by Sakałoŭski was kept and the lyrics were discarded.

The lyrics of the anthem now sing of a friendly Belarus, honoring past military battles and looking forward to the future. The music was kept due to the historical connections it has to Belarus.

== Anthem of the Byelorussian SSR ==
{{main|Anthem of the Byelorussian SSR}}
"My Biełarusy" was originally used as the anthem of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] ({{lang-be|Гімн Беларускай Савецкай Сацыялістычнай Рэспублікі|Himn Biełaruskaj Savieckaj Sacyjalistyčnaj Respubliki}}; {{lang-ru|Гимн Белорусской Советской Социалистической Республики|Gimn Belorusskoj Sovetskoj Socialističeskoj Respubliki}}) starting from February 24, 1955. The original anthem was composed by Sakałoŭski and the lyrics were written by [[Mihas' Klimovich|Maxim Klimkovich]]. It was presented in front of a jury in 1944, but it took 11 years of modifications before it was officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Виталий|last=СКАЛАБАН|coauthors=|script-title=ru:Когда авторы будут вскрыты...|date=2001-01-09|publisher=Советская Белоруссия|url=http://sb.by/print.php?articleID=861|work=Беларусь Сегодня|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-23|language=ru|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730152926/http://sb.by/printv.php?area=content&amp;articleID=861|archivedate=2012-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Belarus became an independent country, the national anthem was modified to drop the Communist-era lyrics. An attempt was made in 1995 to adopt [[Natallia Arsiennieva]]'s poem "[[O God Almighty]]" as the national anthem, but the suggestion was not acted on even though it was supported by a parliamentary committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belarus-misc.org/anthem.htm |title=The National Anthem of Belarus |year=2005 |work=A Belarus Miscellany |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012054636/http://www.belarus-misc.org/anthem.htm |archivedate=2008-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthem of the Republic of Belarus ==
The only legal mention of the national anthem before 2002 is in the [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution of the Republic of Belarus]]. Section One, Article 19 of the constitution states that "The symbols of the Republic of Belarus as a sovereign state shall be its national flag, national emblem and national anthem." While the constitution only mentioned the use of the flag, anthem and arms as national symbols, each symbol had to be defined by law.&lt;ref name="s1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19329.html |title=Constitution of Belarus, Section 1 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=Press Service of the President of the Republic of Belarus |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216021746/http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19329.html |archivedate = February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law introducing an anthem was not enacted until Presidential Decree 350 took effect, on July 18, 2002, the day before [[Independence Day (Belarus)|Belarus's independence day]]. The decree's main objective was to establish lyrics for the anthem and introduce musical notation along with the new lyrics. Moreover, the decree designated when, where, and how the anthem was to be performed.&lt;ref name="decree"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.by/press15629.html |title=Указ № 350 ад 2 лiпеня 2002 г. |accessdate= |date=2002-07-02 |language=be |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304085452/http://www.president.gov.by/press15629.html |archivedate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the newspaper ''[[Soviet Byelorussia]]'', President Lukashenko decided on the anthem on June 12, 2002 and chose to have its first performance on July 3, Belarusian independence day, the anniversary of the date in 1944 when the [[Wehrmacht]] was driven away from Minsk by the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Людмила|last=МАСЛЮКОВА|coauthors=|script-title=ru:Конкурс гимна: решающее мнение|date=2002-07-12|publisher=|url=http://www.sb.by/article.php?articleID=17696|work=Советская Белоруссия|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-12|language=ru|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202935/http://www.sb.by/article.php?articleID=17696|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first performance actually took place on July 2 at a concert organized by the government as part of the Belarusian independence festivities.

When Lukashenko issued his decree selecting a new national anthem, only slight changes were made to the Soviet-era hymn. While the references to Russia, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] were replaced; the overall theme of "friendship of peoples" and the original music composed by Sakałoŭski were preserved. The government decided to keep Sakałoŭski's music in order to maintain historical continuity, and also on account of its popularity and musical quality.&lt;ref name="byns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.by/en/press10664.html |title=State System&amp;nbsp;— State Symbols |accessdate=2007-10-13 |publisher=President of the Republic of Belarus }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the national anthem was adopted, the process of adopting national symbols was completed.&lt;ref name="byns"/&gt;

=== Reaction ===
The organization [[Freedom House]] commented on the adoption of the anthem in a report about the country, published in 2003. On page 125 of the "Country Report of Belarus", Freedom House says that President Lukashenko has "reintroduced the state symbols used by the old Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2002, the president approved a streamlined version of the Soviet-era anthem "My Belarusy" ("We Belarusians"), as the country's new national anthem." The report also mentioned President Lukashenko's ban of the symbols that were used since Belarus's independence in 1991, such as the [[Pahonia]] arms and the white, red, white flag, which Lukashenko claims are associated with [[fascism]] (because the pro-Nazi [[Belarusian Central Rada]] in World War II used these symbols).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/NISPAcee/UNPAN012373.pdf |title=Country Report of Belarus |accessdate=2008-02-23 |year=2003 |format=PDF |work=Nations in Transit |publisher=Freedom House }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Dr. Taras Kuzio wrote in [[Radio Free Europe]] that President Lukashenko "is the quintessential Soviet Belarusian patriot who presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia." Kuzio said that the motives of Russia and Belarus in re-adopting Soviet-era symbols are part of restoring that nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Taras |last=Kuzio |title=Attitudes to Soviet past reflect nostalgia, pragmatism |date=2003-08-13 |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |url=http://www.taraskuzio.com/media8_files/24.pdf |accessdate=2017-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulations ===
The anthem must be performed in accordance with the lyrics and sheet music established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and again upon signing off (usually around midnight). The anthem can also be performed on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must [[salute]].&lt;ref&gt;Law of the Republic of Belarus.

==Vajacki marš==
{{main|Vajacki marš}}
"Vajacki Marš" (''March of the Warriors'') was the official anthem of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref name="hl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/heraldica_litvaniae/hymn.html |title=National anthems of Great Litva |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=2003 |publisher=Heraldica Litvaniae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223192532/http://www.geocities.com/heraldica_litvaniae/hymn.html|archivedate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Belarusian state that was created in 1918 but lasted only 10 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Birgerson |first=Susanne Michele |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=After the Breakup of a Multi-Ethnic Empire |publisher=Praeger/Greenwood |year=2002 |location= |pages=101 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-275-96965-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Imperial Germany|German]] occupation of Belarus in [[World War I]].

Since 1919, the song has been used as an anthem of Belarus by [[Belarusian diaspora|Belarusian emigrant]] communities in Western Europe and North America. It is still considered the official anthem used by the [[Rada BNR|government-in-exile of the Belarusian Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radabnr.org/symbali/ Дзяржаўныя сымбалі Беларускай Народнай Рэспублікі] [State Symbols of the Belarusian Democratic Republic] on the official website of the [[Rada BNR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other songs ==
"[[Mahutny Boža]]", a religious hymn, is also actively used by those who oppose the Lukashenko Government.&lt;ref name="hl"/&gt;

A favorite in the anthem competition was the poem called "[[Young Belarus (poem)|Young Belarus]]" (Маладая Беларусь) by [[Janka Kupala]]. However, the poem was never set to a musical composition so Young Belarus could not be selected as the anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysticplanet.com/BELARUS2.HTM |title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;— The National Anthem |accessdate=2008-02-22 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regimes of Belarus and Russia have been working towards a closer relationship with each other, resulting in the proposed [[Union of Russia and Belarus]]. While Belarus and Russia will be able to keep their own symbols, a song called "[[Sovereign Union of Nations]]" ({{lang-be|Дзяржаўны саюз народаў, Russian: Державный союз народов, Derzhavny soyuz narodov}}) has been proposed as the Union's unofficial anthem. The song, which was modified from the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]], refers to a wider union of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianmaster.ru/gimn.html#sd |script-title=ru:ДЕРЖАВНЫЙ СОЮЗ НАРОДОВ |accessdate=2008-02-22 |year=2003 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological hazards==
{{Main article|Geohazard}}

===Avalanche===
An avalanche occurs when a large snow (or rock) mass slides down a mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow avalanches|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science/avalanches.html|website=All about snow|publisher=National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by the size or severity of consequences resulting from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Public Avalanche Danger Scale|url=http://www.avalanche.org/danger_card.php|website=Avalanche.org|publisher=American Avalanche Association|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake===
{{See also|Lists of earthquakes|Soil liquefaction}}
[[Image:Sanfranciscoearthquake1906.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco]] was devastated by an [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]] in 1906]]
An [[earthquake]] is the sudden relof energy stored as lithospheric stress that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest with a shaking or displacement of the ground; when the [[earthquake]] occurs on the seafloor, the resulting displacement of water can sometimes result in a [[tsunami]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simkin, Tom|display-authors=3|author2=Tilling, Robert I.|author3=Vogt, Peter R.|author4=Kirby, Stephen H.|author5=Kimberly, Paul|author6=Stewart, David B.|title=This Dynamic Planet: World map of volcanoes, earthquakes, impact craters, and plate tectonics|date=2006|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey Map I-2800|isbn=1-411-30959-6|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|accessdate=18 July 2014|archiveurl=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|archivedate=7 Jan 2014|format=map}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.

===Coastal erosion===
[[Coastal erosion]] is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents that can be influenced by tides and storm surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komar|first1=Paul D.|title=CRC handbook of coastal processes and erosion|date=1983|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9780849302251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal erosion can result from long-term processes (see also [[beach evolution]]) as well as from episodic events such as [[tropical cyclone]]s or other severe storm events.

===Lahar===
A [[lahar]] is a type of natural event closely related to a [[volcanic eruption]], and involves a large amount of material originating from an eruption of a glaciated volcano, including mud from the melted ice, [[rock (geology)|rock]], and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] sliding down the side of the [[volcano]] at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people, and form [[flood basalt]].
This is based on natural events.

===Landslide===
A [[landslide]] is a mass displacement of sediment, usually down a slope. It can be caused by pressure pulling natural objects down a declining hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Nicholas K.|title=Geohazards: natural and human|date=1995|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780023229923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinkhole===
A [[sinkhole]] is a localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure such as a [[cave]]. Although rare, large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures.

===Volcanic eruption===
[[Image:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]]]]
A [[volcanic eruption]] is the point in which a [[volcano]] is active and releases its power, and the eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small eruptions which occur in places like [[Kilauea]] in [[Hawaii]], to megacolossal eruptions (where the volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of material) from supervolcanoes like [[Lake Taupo]] (26,500 years ago) and [[Yellowstone Caldera]]. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], 70 to 75 thousand years ago, a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] event at [[Lake Toba]] reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in [[human evolution]]. Some eruptions form [[pyroclastic flows]], which are high-temperature clouds of ash and steam that can travel down mountainsides at speed exceeding an airliner.

==Meteorological or climate hazards==
[[Image:Young steer after blizzard - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Young steer after a blizzard, March 1966]]

===Blizzard===
A blizzard is a severe winter storm with icy and windy conditions characterized by low temperature, strong wind and heavy snow.

===Drought===
A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water.
Scientists warn that [[global warming]] and  [[climate change]] may result in more extensive [[drought]]s in coming years. These extensive droughts are likely to occur within the African continent due to its very low precipitation levels and high temperatures.

===Hailstorm===
A [[hail]]storm is a natural hazard where a thunderstorm produces numerous [[hailstone]]s which damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be especially devastating to [[farm]] fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment.

===Heat wave===
A [[heat wave]] is a hazard characterized by [[heat]] which is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of [[weather]] events to take place, and may include [[temperature inversion]]s, [[katabatic winds]], or other phenomena. There is potential for longer-term events causing [[global warming]], including [[stadial]] events (the opposite to glacial "ice age" events), or through human-induced climatic warming.

===Cyclonic storm===
Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Katrina]]]]
[[Hurricane]], [[tropical cyclone]], and [[typhoon]] are different names for the cyclonic [[storm]] system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated [[water]] that comes off of the [[ocean]] and becomes a [[storm]]. The [[Coriolis effect]] causes the storms to spin.{{convert|74|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Hurricane'' is used for these phenomena in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]s, ''tropical cyclone'' in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], and ''typhoon'' in the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

===Ice storm===
An [[ice storm]] is a particular [[weather]] event in which precipitation falls as [[ice]], due to [[atmospheric|atmosphere]] conditions. It causes damage.

===Tornado===
A [[tornado]] is a natural disaster resulting from a [[thunderstorm]]. Tornadoes are violent, rotating columns of air which can blow at speeds between {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and possibly higher. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large [[tornado outbreak]]s associated with [[supercell]]s or in other large areas of thunderstorm development. [[Waterspout]]s are tornadoes occurring over tropical waters in light rain conditions.

===Climate change===

[[Climate change]] can increase or decrease weather hazards, and also directly endanger property due to [[sea level rise]] and biological organisms due to [[habitat]] destruction.

===Geomagnetic storm===

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disrupt or damage technological infrastructure, and disorient species with [[magnetoception]].

==Flood==
A [[flood]] results from an overflow of water beyond its normal confines of a body of water such as a lake, or the accumulation of water over land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Flood|website=Meteorology glossary|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildfire==
[[Wildfire]] is a fire that burns in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner. Wildfires can result from natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or from human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildfire|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/wildfire|website=Cambridge dictionaries online|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[Disease]] is a natural hazard that can be enhanced by human factors such as [[urbanization]] or poor [[sanitation]].  Disease affecting multiple people can be termed an [[outbreak]] or [[epidemic]].

In some cases, a hazard exists in that a human-made defense against disease could fail, for example through [[antibiotic resistance]].

==Multi-hazard analysis==
Each of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence, hazard frequency and [[return period]], and measures of intensity and impact. These complexities result in "single-hazard" assessments being commonplace, where the hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a "multi-hazard" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0294-2 | doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0294-2 | volume=64 | title=Challenges of analyzing multi-hazard risk: a review | journal=Natural Hazards | pages=1925–1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;

Many examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an [[earthquake]] may trigger [[landslides]], whereas a [[wildfire]] may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and [[anthropic]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-3049.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[groundwater]] abstraction may trigger [[groundwater-related subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthgwlandsubside.html|title=Land Subsidence|work=USGS Water Science School|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective [[hazard analysis]] in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of [[disaster risk reduction]]) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|url=http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/283/2007/|journal=Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.|volume=7|issue=2|pages=283–288|doi=10.5194/nhess-7-283-2007|issn=1684-9981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''ThinkHazard!'' is an online tool that provides an overview of the hazards from eight natural hazards (river floods, earthquakes, water scarcity, cyclones, coastal floods, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides) developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery in partnership with other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkhazard.org/ ThinkHazard!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gfdrr.org/ Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International campaigns==
In 2000, the [[United Nations]] launched the [[International Early Warning Programme]] to address the underlying causes of vulnerability and to build disaster-resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of [[disaster risk reduction]] as an integral component of [[sustainable development]], with the goal of reducing human, economic and environmental losses due to hazards of all kinds (UN/ISDR, 2000). 

The 2006-2007 United Nations International Disaster Reduction Day theme was “Disaster reduction education begins in school”. The Foundation of Public Safety Professionals launched an international campaign with an international open essay or documentary competition.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:Queen-Sirikit-Navaratna.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Thailand]]'s flawless {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} "[[Queen Sirikit]] Navaratna" Necklace.]]
'''''Navaratna''''' ({{lang-sa|नवरत्न}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] [[bahuvrihi|compound word]] meaning "nine [[Gemstone|gems]]". Jewellery created in this style has important cultural significance in [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] among other religions.

==Royal setting==
The ancient origin of the Nine Gems—called ''Navaratna'' in [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Kannada]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and [[Nepali language|Nepali]], ''Navarathinam'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''Navarathnalu'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''Navarathnam'' in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], ''Navaratna'' in [[Sinhala language|Singhalese]], ''Nawaratna'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], and ''Nawarat'' or ''Noppharat'' in [[Thai language|Thai]]—has proved impossible to trace. Yet such importance is given to this combination of nine gems that they are recognised as sacred and royal in almost all the countries of [[Asia]], including, [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]], [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], regardless of religious and cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mangala Navaratna (page 1) |author=Richard Brown |publisher=Hrisikesh Ltd |date=2007 |isbn =974-07-1853-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition in Thailand===
In [[Thailand]], the Navaratna is officially recognised as a national and royal symbol of the king. A high award given by the king is called "Noppharat Ratchawaraphon" (the Ancient Auspicious [[Order of the Nine Gems]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reference Thai Government |url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Ninegem00.htm |accessdate=2009-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005080438/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/d_Ninegem00.htm |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Order of the Nine Gems (Thailand) ribbon.png|frame|none|Ribbon of the Order]]
The decoration consists of a single class (Knight). The insignia is:
* Pendant of the Nine Gems, on a yellow sash with a red, blue and green trims, worn over the right shoulder of the left hip (for men). For women, the Pendant of the Nine Gems is attached onto a silk ribbon, worn on the front left shoulder.
* Star of the Nine Gems, to wear on the left chest
* Gold Ring of the Nine Gems, for men, to wear on the right ring finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to wear navaratna |url=http://www.humbletom.com/astro/articles/navratna.html |accessdate=2010-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621044850/http://www.humbletom.com/astro/articles/navratna.html |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gems and planets==
Late Thai astrologer ''Horacharn'' Thep Sarikabutr has given the meaning of these nine gems in his ''Parichad-Jataka'' (chapter 2, verse 21, page 35–36) translated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mangala Navaratna |author=Richard Brown |publisher=Hrisikesh Ltd |date=2007 |pages=1–2 |isbn=974-07-1853-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Top quality and flawless ruby is the gem for the Sun, natural pearl for the Moon, red coral for Mars, emerald for Mercury yellow sapphire for Jupiter, diamond for Venus, blue sapphire for Saturn, hessonite for Rahu (ascending lunar node), and cat's eye for Ketu (descending lunar node)."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Further evidence===
This quote attributed to the Sanskrit "Brihat Jatak" is also quoted in the "Mani-mala" page 575, verse 79 by S.M. Tagore (1879), and also in the ancient "Jataka Parijata," chap. 2, sloka 21 compiled by Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshitar,
&lt;blockquote&gt;''माणिक्यं तरणेः सुजात्यममलं मुक्ताफलं शीतगोः''&lt;br&gt;
''माहेयस्य च विद्रुमं मरकतं सौम्यस्य गारुत्मतम''&lt;br&gt;
''देवेज्यस्य च पुष्पराजमसुराचार्यस्य वज्रं शनेः''&lt;br&gt;
''नीलं निर्मलमन्ययोश्च गदिते गोमेदवैदूर्यके''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reads in [[Sanskrit]] transliterated as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''maaNikyaM taraNeH sujaatyamamalaM muktaaphalaM shiitagoH''&lt;br&gt;
''maaheyasya cha vidrumaM marakataM saumyasya gaarutmatama''&lt;br&gt;
''devejyasya cha puShparaajamasuraachaaryasya vajraM shaneH''&lt;br&gt;
''niilaM nirmalamanyayoshcha gadite gomedavaiduuryake''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation:
# [[Ruby]] (maanikyam) for [[Surya]] (taraneh) (Sun),
# [[Pearl]] (muktaaphalam) for [[Chandra]] (Moon),
# Red [[Precious coral|Coral]] (vidrumam) for [[Mangala]] (maaheya) (Mars),
# [[Emerald]] (marakatam) for [[Budha]] (saumya) (Mercury),

# [[Hessonite]] (gomeda) or [[Rahu]] (the ascending lunar node)
# [[Chrysoberyl#Cymophane|Cat's Eye]] (vaidooryam) for [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]] (the descending lunar node),&lt;br&gt;...these gems must be high-born  and flawless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Astrological Gemstones &amp; Talismans |author=Richard S. Brown |publisher=AGT Ltd |page=47 |date=1995 |isbn=974-89022-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting arrangement==
[[File:Navaratna-setting-system.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nine navaratna gems in a Nava-graha pendant-yantra.]]
The traditional setting and arrangement of these nine gems is shown in the illustration. A ruby (representing the Sun) is always in the center, surrounded (clockwise from the top) by a diamond, a natural pearl, red coral, hessonite, a blue sapphire, cat's eye, a yellow sapphire, and an emerald. This is the same placement as the Nava-graha Yantra.

Traditionally, no gem other than a ruby or a red spinel is set in the center of a nine gems arrangement. To do so is believed to go against the flow of nature. Because the Sun is the center of the solar system, its gem is positioned in the heart of a Navaratna [[Talisman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mangala Navaratna |author=Richard Brown |publisher=Hrisikesh Ltd |page=2 |date=2007 |isbn=974-07-1853-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an example of the navaratna in a necklace setting, see Thailand's "The [[Queen Sirikit]] Navaratna."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A New Addition to the Crown Jewels of Thailand |author=Bangkok Gems &amp; Jewellery Magazine |publisher=BGJ Bangkok |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navaratna gem purity==
In the above ''sloka'' the words ''sujatyam-amalam'' (''sujati''=high born, and ''amala''=completely pure or flawless) are significant. According to Asian belief systems, only clean, top-quality gems are considered to be auspicious.

In further support of this mostly overlooked dictate, in the Hindu "''[[Garuda Puranam]]''," chapter 68, verse 17, it is stated by narrator [[Ugrasrava Sauti|Sri Suta Goswami]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" ''Pure, flawless gems have auspicious powers which can protect one from demons, snakes, poisons, diseases, sinful reactions, and other dangers, while flawed stones have the opposite effect''."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And from the ancient " ''[[Agni Purana]]''," chapter 246, ''slokas'' 7 and 8:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''A gem free from all impurities and radiating its characteristic internal luster should be looked upon as an escort of good luck; a gem which is cracked, fissured, devoid of luster, or appearing rough or sandy, should not be used at all''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Astrological Gemstones &amp; Talismans  |edition=2nd |author=Richard S. Brown |publisher=Hrisikesh Ltd |pages=33, 51 |date=2008 |isbn= 978-974-8102-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contemporary ideas on gem therapy by Yogananda in [[Autobiography of a Yogi]]==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as a house can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be benefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive to negative pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations are constantly circulating in the universe [...] This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but also of plants and most effective of all faultless jewels of not less than two carats. The preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied outside of India. One little-known fact is that the proper jewels, metals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next to the skin."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Gems in sidereal astrology==
According to [[jyotisha|Hindu astrology]], life on earth is influenced by the ''[[navagraha]]s'', or nine influencers. The placement of the ''navagrahas'' in one's horoscope supposedly have an influence throughout an individual's life. Wearing the nine gems is said to provide an astrological balance and benefit to the wearer. Hindu astrology also says that these gems potentially may have both positive or negative influences on human life, and that astrological gems should be worn only after consulting a Vedic astrologer, who is also conversant with gems. Based on an individual's sidereal [[horoscope]], either a single gem or a combination of compatible gems is advised to be worn to harness beneficial planets or counteract harmful planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Healing Power of Gemstones |author=Harish Johari |publisher=Destiny Books |page=35 |date=1982 |isbn=0-89281-215-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vibrational Healing With Gems |author=Howard Beckman |publisher=Balaji Publisher |date=2000 |isbn=81-212-0704-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed "astrological" or "piezoelectric" benefit of wearing or donating gems has not been scientifically quantified.

'''Neosymbolism''' is a movement current in the [[visual arts]] genre.  Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the [[Czech Republic]], and Canada.

== Philosophy ==
The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like [[Norman Rockwell]] could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche—the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality.

Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was  the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word "Neosymbolism", thus coining it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the "non-sense" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy.
  
The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |title=webbyen.dk |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2017-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132848/http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* Using Iconic language in their expressions
* Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world  
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
* Examining the underlying meaning of life
* Using media in conscious and innovative ways

The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in ''Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism,''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo.

* Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. 
* Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self-Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. 
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world, with the idea that mankind must “make friends with his animal nature” in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. 
* Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. 
* Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies.

Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition:
 
- The "exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal."{{cite quote|date=April 2015}}
  
This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The term '''Cup of Nestor''' or '''Nestor's Cup''' can refer to:
#A golden mixing cup, described in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], belonging to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], the king of [[Pylos]].
#A golden goblet, found at [[Mycenae]], which the excavator, [[Heinrich Schliemann]], identified as the cup of Nestor described in the ''Iliad''.
#A clay drinking vessel of the 8th century BC found at [[Pithekoussai]], [[Ischia]] (Italy), which bears a famous inscription comparing itself to Nestor's cup as described in the ''Iliad''.

== The Cup of Nestor in the Iliad ==
The [[Iliad]] of [[Homer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0217&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.632 11.632-637 Perseus.tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; describes a magnificent golden cup (''depas'') that belongs to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], the king of [[Pylos]]:

:Beside these she set a cup,
:a magnificent work Nestor had brought from home,
:studded with gold.  There were four handles on it,
:around each one a pair of golden doves was feeding.
:Below were two supports.  When that cup was full,
:another man could hardly lift it from the table,
:but, old as he was, Nestor picked it up with ease.

(translation by Ian Johnston)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/homer/iliad11.htm Mala.bc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Cup of Nestor" from Mycenae==
In 1876, [[Heinrich Schliemann]] excavated [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Grave Circle A]] at [[Mycenae]], and in several [[shaft tomb|shaft graves]] he found rich deposits of grave goods, including many golden objects. Shaft Grave IV yielded the richest finds, and among these Schliemann found a golden vessel which he identified as the "Cup of Nestor" as described in the ''Iliad''. Schliemann believed that the shaft graves dated to the time of the [[Trojan War]], and identified Shaft Grave V as the [[tomb of Agamemnon]]. However, Schliemann's identification of the shaft graves with Homeric heroes was not accepted by many archaeologists in his own day. The shaft graves are conventionally dated to ca. 1600-1500 BC, some three centuries before the date of the Trojan War (if the war is to be considered as a historical event). Thus the "Cup of Nestor" from Mycenae would have been buried hundreds of years before Nestor supposedly made use of it at Troy.

The cup found at Mycenae differs from Homer's description in several respects, apart from being much smaller. The cup from Mycenae has two handles, whereas Homer's cup has four. Homer's cup has two doves per handle, but the cup found in the shaft grave has a single bird for each handle, and instead of the doves found on the Homeric cup, the birds on the Mycenae cup are falcons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Heubeck, 1974. ''Die Homerische Frage''. (Darmstadt) p. 222; Webster, ''Mycenae to Homer''. pp. 33, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

This cup is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]], Greece.

== The  "Cup of Nestor" from Pithekoussai ==
[[Image:Coppa di Nestore.png|thumb|300 px|The so-called ''Nestor's cup'' from [[Pithekoussai]], [[Ischia]]]]

The so-called '''Cup of Nestor''' from [[Pithekoussai]] is a clay drinking cup ([[kotyle]]) that was found by [[Giorgio Buchner]] in 1954 at excavations in a grave in the ancient Greek site of Pithekoussai on the island of [[Ischia]] in [[Italy]]. Pithekoussai was one of the earliest Greek colonies in the West. The cup is dated to the [[Geometric Period]] (c.750-700 BC) and is believed to have been originally manufactured in [[Rhodes]]. It is now kept in the Villa Arbusto museum in the village of [[Lacco Ameno]] on the island of Ischia, Italy.

The cup bears a three-line inscription that was scratched on its side at a later time, and it was later used as a burial gift for a young boy. The inscription is now famous as being one of the oldest known examples of writing in the [[Greek alphabet]], side by side with the so-called [[Dipylon inscription]] from Athens. Both inscriptions are dated to c.740-720 BC and have been linked to early writing in the island of [[Euboea]].

===The text of the inscription===
[[Image:Nestor Cup Cumae.jpg|thumb|300px|The inscription]]

The inscription is fragmented, as some shards of the cup are lost. It is written in the early [[Euboea]]n form of the [[Western Greek alphabet]], written from right to left in three separate lines. The text runs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:ΝΕΣΤΟΡΟΣ:...:ΕΥΠΟΤΟΝ:ΠΟΤΕΡΙΟ[Ν]&lt;br /&gt;ΗΟΣΔΑΤΟΔΕΠ[ΙΕ]ΣΙ:ΠΟΤΕΡΙ..:ΑΥΤΙΚΑΚΕΝΟΝ&lt;br /&gt;ΗΙΜΕΡ[ΟΣ ΗΑΙΡ]ΕΣΕΙ:ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤ[ΕΦΑΝ]Ο:ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΕΣ
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is usually transcribed (in later classical orthography, with the missing parts in brackets) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:{{lang|grc|Νέστορος [....] εὔποτ[ον] ποτήριο[ν]·}}&lt;br /&gt;{{lang|grc|ὃς δ’ ἂν τοῦδε π[ίησι] ποτηρί[ου] αὐτίκα κῆνον}}&lt;br /&gt;{{lang|grc|ἵμερ[ος αἱρ]ήσει καλλιστ[εφάν]ου Ἀφροδίτης.}}

: (??) Nestor’s cup, good to drink from.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever drinks from this cup, him straightaway&lt;br /&gt;the desire of beautiful-crowned Aphrodite will seize.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the beginning, many scholars propose the restitution "I am...". The second and third lines form a [[hexameter]] verse each, with a perfect regular [[scansion]]. Modern scholars agree that the text is meant as a humorous contrast between the richness of the legendary Cup of Nestor and the simplicity of the clay drinking cup. There are several interpretations, some of which make use of [[textual emendation]]s, to explain the humorous effect of the perceived incoherence between the first line and the others. One emendation is that the beginning should read: "{{lang|grc|Νέστορος μὲν ...}}" ('Nestor's cup may be good, but...'),&lt;ref&gt;A. Kontogiannis (1999), "Η γραφή". In: M. Z. Kopidakis (ed.), Ιστορία της ελληνικης γλώσσας. Athens, Elliniko Logotechniko kai Istoriko Archeio. 360-379; quoting [[Margherita Guarducci]].&lt;/ref&gt; or "{{lang|grc|Νέστορος ἔρροι ...}}" ('Nestor's cup, begone!').&lt;ref&gt;Tarik Wareh: "Greek writing" [http://www1.union.edu/~wareht/greek3/ Online description and discussion of the Nestor Cup.]&lt;/ref&gt; A third hypothesis is that the text was the result of a "[[drinking game|drinking-party game]]":&lt;ref&gt;Barry B. Powell (1998): "Who invented the Alphabet: The Semites or the Greeks?" ''Archaeology Odyssey'' 1(1). [http://www.basarchive.org/sample/bswbBrowse.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=1&amp;Issue=1&amp;GroupID=2 Online article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230142345/http://www.basarchive.org/sample/bswbBrowse.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=1&amp;Issue=1&amp;GroupID=2 |date=2005-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One player wrote the first line, then a second player was challenged to complement the poem with a second line, and so on.  This is reinforced by the phrasing of the last verse, which says, albeit very elegantly, that the drinker will become [[Sexual_arousal|sexually aroused]]. The most recent hypothesis is the one proposed by Yves Gerhard (''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'', 176, 2011, pp. 7-9), with Νέστορος ἔ[ασον] εὔποτον ποτήριον at the first verse : "Leave aside Nestor's cup, as excellent as it may be to drink from; but whoever drinks of this very cup shall immediately be seized by the desire of well-crowned Aphrodite." 

The inscription has often been seen as a reference to the ''Iliad''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051230142345/http://www.basarchive.org/sample/bswbBrowse.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=1&amp;Issue=1&amp;GroupID=2 Barry B. Powell] calls it "Europe’s first literary allusion." Other scholars, however, deny that the inscription refers to the ''Iliad'', arguing that descriptions of Nestor's Cup existed in mythology and oral tradition independent of the Homeric poems.

'''''Oddworld''''' is a [[video game]] franchise and [[fictional universe]], created by developers [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] under the direction of [[Lorne Lanning]]. The series has been released on various platforms such as [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Windows]], [[Wii U]], and [[Personal computer|PC]].

Throughout games set in the ''Oddworld'' universe, the player's character goes on a quest to defend Oddworld's ecosystem from  endangerment by industrial corporations.

==Oddworld planet==
Oddworld is the name of the planet on which all four Oddworld Inhabitants games are based, extant in another dimension.&lt;ref name="Dear Alf March 2013 Vol. 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/2013/03/dear-alf-march-2013-volume-1/#more-2096 |title=Dear Alf March 2013 (Volume 1) |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet was originally described as ten times the size of Earth; but Oddworld Inhabitants' president and creative developer Lorne Lanning has since explained that Oddworld's surface area is ten times the size of Earth's, given that Oddworld is predominantly a dry-land planet and Earth is predominantly water-covered.&lt;ref name="Nathan Interviews Lorne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddworldlibrary.net/blog/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning-again/ |title=Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning again |publisher=Oddblog |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its own sun and thus its own orbit resulting in a unique clock and calendar.&lt;ref name="Dear Alf March 2013 Vol. 1" /&gt;

At some point, the planet suffered huge natural turmoils that resulted in volcanic crusts forming a new layer upon the entire planet. When that crust collapsed, it created giant 1000-foot craters all over the planet.&lt;ref name="Nathan Interviews Lorne" /&gt; The planet has a total of three layers, each with its own climate, temperature and gravitational levels.&lt;ref name="Nathan Interviews Lorne" /&gt; The giant craters were then used by the various Oddworld species to house their cities, whose tips could be seen protruding above the crust surface when looking across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Nathan Interviews Lorne" /&gt;

Only one of Oddworld's continents has been featured in the games – Mudos – and only a tiny fraction of Mudos has been seen in-game.&lt;ref name="Mudokon Pops"&gt;Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994–2004'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt; The journeys of Abe through ''Abe's Oddysee'', ''Abe's Exoddus'' and ''Munch's Oddysee'' take him through that small portion, composed of fields, jungles, deserts, caverns, and swamps. Much of the planet is decimated by industrialist species for their own profit; this is represented by city-sized factories and mass transit systems.

==Oddworld species==
The protagonist species of the games in the Oddworld universe are the Mudokons ({{IPAc-en|m|uː|ˈ|d|ɒ|k|ən}}): an oviparous anthropoid with blue or green skin. In ''Abe's Oddysee'', ''Abe's Exoddus'', and ''Munch's Oddysee'', the Mudokons are peaceful, spiritual inhabitants of a mock-Paleolithic society. Oddworld creator Lorne Lanning has explained that the Mudokons were not always sympathetic protagonists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddworldlibrary.net/blog/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning-again/ |title=Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning again |publisher=Oddblog |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; insofar as, though they represent a class of slaves exploited by the upper class, their ability to telepathically control other species contradicts that status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |title=Editorial: Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=gog.com |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their principal enemies are the Glukkons: a cephalopod-like anthropoid with only vestigial lower limbs (usually concealed by clothing), representing an industrial master class. Subordinate to the Glukkons are the Sligs, who appear as soldiers or body-servants. The Mudokons have two sacred or totemic species, both of which resemble [[arthropod]]s, but are actually [[vertebrate]]s: the towering Scrabs and the arachnid-like Paramites, whereof both are hunted by the Sligs on the Glukkons' behalf to make food or similar products. Mudokons, Scrabs, Paramites, and Glukkons were designed by Steven Olds.&lt;ref&gt;Lanning, L. (31 August 2013) https://twitter.com/lorne_lanning/status/373845473389334528 "@stewartgilray @Thekirbyxox paramites, scrabs, mudokons, and glukkons were designed by Steve Olds." Twitter.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Oddworld games, the GameSpeak feature allows the player to interact with the non-playable characters (NPCs). Examples of GameSpeak commands in the original game ''Abe's Oddysee'' are "Hello," "Follow me," and "Wait." Rescuing Mudokons and opening certain doors are all achieved through GameSpeak. Enemies possessed by [[Abe (Oddworld)|Abe]] can also use GameSpeak, and one can take control of Slig guards, use Glukkons to command subservient Sligs, or use Sligs to call their Slog pets to heel. GameSpeak also included burps and flatulence, for comical effect.

In "Munch's Oddysee" several creatures were added to the game including Vykkers, Interns, and Big Bro Sligs (with Armored versions of them occasionally being seen). Other species include Fuzzles, Meeps, and Gabbits. The Vykkers are purple, hairless humanoids with four arms and four legs; Interns resemble Vykkers, but have only two sets of limbs; and Big Bro Sligs are bigger and more powerful versions of the original Sligs. The Fuzzles are small, furry, spheroidal predator-scavengers; Meeps resemble [[sheep]], but with only one limb and one eye; and the Gabbit is an amphibian species whose single hind leg serves as both [[foot]] and [[fluke (tail)|fluke]]s.

The GameSpeak feature was modified in ''Stranger's Wrath'', with a single talk button that caused the Stranger to say something appropriate to the situation. This context-sensitive GameSpeak also worked for questioning the Clakker and Grubb townsfolk. This change made the talk button more comparable to a universal-action button in ''Stranger's Wrath''. New species included the Clakkers (anthropomorphic, flightless birds); the Outlaws (bulbous, hairless, blue-green humanoids); the Steef (feline-featured, gracile-legged [[centaur]]s); the Grubbs (amphibian-like bipeds; symbiont of the Steef); the Oktigi (amphibious, parasite-like cephalopods related to the Glukkons); and the Gloktigi (large, cephalopod-like bipeds related to the Oktigi and Glukkons).

==Games set on Oddworld==
The developers originally stated that the ''Oddworld'' series would be a [[pentalogy]] called the Oddworld Quintology, and that ''[[Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|Abe's Exoddus]]'' and ''[[Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath|Stranger's Wrath]]'' games were bonus titles not counting toward the total of five. The Oddworld Adventures Games are handheld versions of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Exoddus''. The Quintology was halted after the first two games, when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. There were also a few titles that were hinted at in interviews and press releases, but they were never developed.

===''Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee''===
{{Main|Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee}}

At the beginning of this game, [[Abe (Oddworld)|Abe]] is a happy, ignorant worker at RuptureFarms, a meat-packing plant,&lt;ref name=Schott&gt;Carr, Diane, David Buckingham, Andrew Burn, Gareth Schott, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSp7uW75TrYC Computer Games: Text, Narrative and Play], Polity&lt;/ref&gt; but discovers that the plant's boss Molluck the Glukkon has decided to use the factory's Mudokon slaves as a source of meat.&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Jason, [http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=1:20934 Oddworld Adventures 2], All Game.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the game's introductory sequence, which is a retrospective voice-over by Abe,&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Clarke, Andy, Grethe Mitchell, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9kPRGPc4zHQC Videogames and Art], Intellect Books.&lt;/ref&gt; he runs for his life.&lt;ref name=Schott/&gt; The Mudokons’ spiritual leader, the BigFace, reveals that the Paramites and Scrabs slaughtered and processed by the Glukkons were formerly sacred to the Mudokons, and orders Abe to relight holy flames extinguished by the Glukkons. Having done this, Abe is empowered by Big Face and infiltrates RuptureFarms, where he frees the remaining slaves and destroys the Glukkon board of executives, but is himself captured. Should the player save a certain number of Mudokons, their free compatriots rescue Abe, and he receives a hero's welcome from the Mudokons he rescued. Should the player not save a sufficient number, Abe is executed by Molluck.

===''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''===
{{Main|Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus}}

''Abe's Oddysee'' was very popular, and the bonus game ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was released the following year.&lt;ref name=Schott/&gt; ''Abe's Exoddus'' begins where ''Abe's Oddysee'' ends.&lt;ref name="Robinson, John"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9902/04/oddworld/index.html Something strange is brewing in 'Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'], CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's abilities in this game were similar to his abilities in the first game,&lt;ref name=DeMaria/&gt; with an expanded ability to communicate with other characters in the world using GameSpeak.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, Maureen, François Penz, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UozK9smjVcC Architectures of Illusion: From Motion Pictures to Navigable Interactive Environments], Intellect Books&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Abe is informed by ghosts of his species &lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html Abe biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720104338/http://oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html |date=20 July 2006 }}, Official Oddworld Website.&lt;/ref&gt; that Necrum, a Mudokon burial ground, is being excavated by Glukkons, using blind Mudokons as slaves.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Abe then departs, with his companions Alf, Ben, Phos, Han, and Luke&lt;ref&gt;[[Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus]]&lt;/ref&gt; to find a cure to the sickness caused by the SoulStorm Brew, created from the excavated bones. Having cured his friends, he destroys the brewery. If the player is successful, Abe is again rescued by his friends; if not, he is captured by the brewery's owner, and electrocuted.

===''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''===
{{Main|Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee}}

Not long after [[Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus#Story|the events]] of ''[[Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|Abe's Exoddus]]'', Abe helps Munch (the last living remnant of an amphibious race called the Gabbits) to save the Gabbits' eggs from destruction, in exchange for Munch's help in rescuing more captive Mudokons. On November 12, 2015, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee was released for iOS.&lt;ref name=DeMaria/&gt;

===''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath''===
{{Main|Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath}}

''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath'' is an action-adventure game published for the Xbox in 2005. The game's main character is a bounty hunter named Stranger. The game utilizes both third and first-person perspectives and is less puzzle-oriented than the previous three ''Oddworld'' games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1109307600&amp;en=c4214af930777332&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=slogin Underneath It All, Substance Sells,] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The game has a [[Wild West]] setting. It was later ported to the PC and release through the digital distribution service [[Steam (software)|Steam]].

===Future titles===
In April 2015, Oddworld's co-founder Lorne Lanning announced on a live stream that a full remake of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' will be the next Oddworld project. There will be a voting poll where users will be able to vote what name the remake should be. So far, a lot of fans like the title ''Oddworld: Twice ze Flavor'': a reference to a line spoken in the animation. The game is in planning stages of development.

On March 14, 2016, Oddworld Inhabitants announced on social media that its next title, ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Uddworldinc/status/709379137870258181]&lt;/ref&gt; is slated for release in 2017. According to oddworld.com Oddworld: Soulstorm will now be released in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oddworld.com/soulstorm/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreleased titles===
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}

* '''''Oddworld: The Hand of Odd'''''. A [[real-time strategy]] game planned to be online. Although being halted when Citizen Siege was planned, it has since been revived as plans for its development have been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oddworld: The Hand of Odd revived, Stranger's Wrath HD delayed|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/16331-oddworld-the-hand-of-odd-revived-strangers-wrath-hd-delayed/|work=Daily Gaming News|publisher=Neoseeker|accessdate=2 May 2011|authorlink=Oddworld: The Hand of Odd revived, Stranger's Wrath HD delayed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be in production after ''Abe HD''. It is said to be [[free-to-play]] with optional extras that may be purchased.
* '''''SligStorm'''''. It would have followed the story of an albino Slig who was born in a complex it must escape to avoid infanticide, and would have been included with ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'' in a combined package. On May 9, 2011, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative released a list of FAQ answers in relation to future games, confirming ''Sligstorm'' will be worked on after ''Abe HD'' and ''The Hand of Odd''.&lt;ref name="Oddworld Inhabitants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/about/faq/ |title=FAQ|publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear where in the Oddworld continuity the game will fit.
* '''''The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot'''''. Originally intended to be the next game following ''Stranger's Wrath''. Announced in April 2005, ''Fangus Klot'' was cancelled by Oddworld Inhabitants founders Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna over deal disagreements with publishers Majesco Entertainment. In the May 9, 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed ''Fangus Klot'' is in future plans.&lt;ref name="Oddworld Inhabitants"/&gt;
* '''''Oddworld: Squeek's Oddysee'''''. Expected third game in the original pentalogy following the first two entries ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Munch's Oddysee''. In the May 9, 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed ''Squeek’s Oddysee'' is on the cards after ''The Hand of Odd'', ''Abe HD'', ''The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot'' and ''Sligstorm'' are released.&lt;ref name="Oddworld Inhabitants"/&gt;
* '''''Oddworld: Munch's Exoddus'''''. Expected to be a bonus game based on ''Munch's Oddysee'' outside of the original pentalogy, in the same way that ''Abe's Exoddus'' was to ''Abe's Oddysee''. It would have featured Munch traveling to a land named Ma'Spa to hatch the Gabbit eggs acquired from the original game. It is unknown whether or not the game was canceled or halted.
* '''''Oddworld: Slave Circus'''''. In an AMA on Reddit, Lorne Lanning discussed a possible future "gladiator" type Oddworld title, in which the player could purchase and battle slaves. "I have been fixated on a game called "oddworld Slave Circus". It is seriously whack. You start the game by buying a slave. Think Gladiators on Oddworld. Have done a tremendous amount of work on this and have never mentioned it. But it is in the coffer and there may be some light for it down the road. But has some other contingencies depending on it. Requires new level of social integration into console gaming. It's insane. Hopefully not so insane it won't come to life."
* '''''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath 2'''''. On January 17, 2013, on the Oddworld website, the Oddworld team asked which game fans would like to see after completion on "Abe's Oddysee New 'n' Tasty". Among the options was "Stranger's Wrath 2".
*'''''Stranger Arena'''''. A competitive multiplayer game using gameplay mechanics from ''Stranger's Wrath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-04-lorne-lanning-explains-his-canned-stranger-arena-multiplayer-game|title=Lorne Lanning explains his canned Stranger Arena multiplayer game|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=4 April 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OddBoxx===
In 2009, the director of Oddworld, Lorne Lanning, announced that they planned to make an Oddworld [[Online distribution|digital download]] package for PC. This package contains ''Abe's Oddysee'', ''Abe's Exoddus'', ''Munch's Oddysee'' and ''Stranger's Wrath''. Oddworld Inhabitants unveiled their re-designed website on November 4, 2010, also declaring that the Oddboxx was still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=249 |title=The Oddboxx &amp;#124; Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Oddworld.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, they announced that the Oddboxx would be released for the 2010 holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=259 |title=Oddboxx – Gets release window! &amp;#124; Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Oddworld.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European and U.S. prices were revealed on December 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=271 |title=Oddboxx – Euro and U.S. Prices.

On April 29, 2011, JAW announced at GameCity Nights that the Oddboxx would be coming to the [[PlayStation Network]] (with other platforms to be announced). ''Stranger's Wrath HD'' was released on PlayStation 3 on December 27, 2011, and ''Munch's Oddysee HD'' in December 2012. Stranger's Wrath has 37 Trophies and Munch's Oddysee has 45 Trophies. Every Oddworld title is now available on the PSN, making the PS3 and Vita the only console to offer the entire Oddboxx other than the PC. These remakes are currently cancelled for Xbox 360.

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''penalty point''' or '''demerit point''' system is one in which a [[driver's license|driver's licensing authority]], [[police force]], or other organization issues cumulative demerits, or ''points'' to drivers on conviction for road traffic offenses. Points may either be added or subtracted, depending on the particular system in use. A major offense may lead to more than the maximum allowed points being issued. Points are typically applied after driving offenses are committed, and cancelled a defined time, typically a few years, afterwards, or after other conditions are met; if the total exceeds a specified limit the offender may be disqualified from driving for a time, or the driving license may be revoked. Fines and other penalties may be applied additionally, either for an offense or after a certain number of points have been accumulated.

The primary purpose of such point systems is to identify, deter, and penalize repeat offenders of traffic laws, while streamlining the legal process. Germany introduced a demerit point system, in 1974, and one was introduced in New York at about that time.

== Description ==
:''This article discusses point systems in the abstract and treats points as demerits; in some jurisdictions, points may instead be measures of merit which are subtracted when a traffic offense is committed.''
In jurisdictions which use a point system, the police or licensing authorities (as specified by law) maintain, for each driver, a driving score—typically an integer number specified in ''points''.  Traffic offenses, such as speeding or disobeying traffic signals, are each assigned a certain number of points, and when a driver is determined to be guilty of a particular offense (by whatever means appropriate in the region's legal system), the corresponding number of points are added to the driver's total.  When the driver's total exceeds a certain threshold, the driver may face additional penalties, be required to attend safety classes or driver training, be subject to re-examination, or lose his/her driving privileges.

The threshold(s) to determine additional penalties may vary based on the driver's experience level, prior driving record, age, educational level attained, and other factors.  In particular, it is common to set a lower threshold for young, inexperienced motorists.

In some jurisdictions, points can also be added if the driver is found to be significantly at fault in a [[traffic accident]].  Points can be removed from a driver's score by the simple passage of time, by a period of time with no violations or accidents, or by the driver's completion of additional drivers' training or traffic safety training.

Major traffic offenses, such as [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]] or [[drunk driving]] may or may not be handled within the point system.  Such offenses often carry a mandatory suspension of driving privileges, and may incur penalties such as [[prison|imprisonment]].

==Requirements of point systems==
[[Image:Risk of accident.png|thumb|250px| Risk of accident related to the number of individual entries in the German register of traffic offenses]]
* A close relation of points and accident risk (validity)
* Comprehensibility for a good acceptance
* A high level of transparency for concerned persons
* Regulated reduction of points by effective psychological help
* Higher caution by the drivers.

==Jurisdictions that use a point system==

===Australia===
Traffic laws are the responsibility of the [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] Governments. Demerit points are used in all states and territories, and road authorities share information about interstate offenses.

In all states, drivers holding a full, unrestricted license will be disqualified from driving after accumulating 12 demerit points or more within a three-year period, except in New South Wales, where drivers are allowed 13 points in a three-year period. Those who can prove they are professional drivers are allowed an additional point. The minimum suspension period is three months, plus one further month for every extra four demerit points beyond the license's limit, with a cap in most states of five months (for 8 points or more over the suspension trigger; e.g. 20 points or more on a full license). An alternative to initially accepting the suspension, a driver can apply for a "good behavior" period of 12 months. In most states, drivers under a good behavior period who accumulate one or two further points (except Victoria does not allow any further offenses) have their license suspended for double the original period.

Most states also provide for immediate suspension of a license, instead of or in addition to demerit points, in certain extreme circumstances. These generally include offenses for [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol or other drugs, or for greatly excessive speed.

====New South Wales====
Provisional licence holders are allowed different numbers of demerit points over the lifetime of their licence, depending on their licence class, before being suspended from driving for three months. Holders of a P1 licence, which lasts 12–18 months (but can be renewed), are suspended after accumulating 4 points, while P2 licence holders are suspended after 7 points in a 24- to 30-month period (but can be renewed). Speeding offences for provisional licence holders are set to a minimum of four points, meaning that P1 holders will be suspended after one speeding offence of any speed.

During holiday periods, double demerit points apply for speeding, seatbelt and helmet-related offences. Offences in school zones attract more demerit points than in other areas. Automatic suspensions apply for all drink- and drug-driving offences, as well as speeding by more than 30&amp;nbsp;km/h.

====Victoria====
[[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] introduced a demerit points suspension scheme in 1970. Learner and probationary drivers are sent a combined option-suspension notice for accumulating 5 points or more over any 12-month period. An option notice allows for either a 12-month [[bail|bond]] or a three-month minimum suspension. If a driver breaches the bond by incurring one demerit point in the 12-month period, their licence is suspended for a minimum of six months. A limit of 12 points in any three-year period with the same option applies for full licence holders. The list of traffic offences and their respective points is in schedule 3 of the Road Safety (Drivers) Regulations 2009.

In Victoria, drunk-driving offences only result in immediate licence cancellation for unrestricted drivers with a [[blood alcohol concentration]] of 0.05 or higher. Readings lower than this have the option of a 10-point penalty being imposed of being taken immediately to court; this option still results in a minimum four-month suspension for novice drivers. Automatic suspensions apply for higher level charges, and re-licensing may require an order to install an [[Ignition interlock device|interlocking device]] onto the vehicle. Automatic suspension periods of at least 1 month also apply for speeding by greater than 25&amp;nbsp;km/h over the speed limit, or any speed greater than 130&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austlii.law.uts.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/rsa1986125/sch5.html Road Safety Act 1986 (Victoria), Schedule 5]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Australia====
In [[South Australia]], if a traffic offence is committed against the Road Traffic Act 1961 or the Australian Road Rules 1999, demerit points may be incurred against a driver’s licence. The number of points incurred depends on the offence and how likely it is to cause a crash. If 12 or more demerit points are accumulated in any three-year period, a driver will be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence or permit. Each three-year period is calculated based on the dates the offences were committed.

If a driver accumulates:
* 12 to 15 points, a driver loses his permission to drive for three months.
* 16 to 20 points, a driver loses his permission to drive for four months.
* 20 points or more, a driver loses his permission to drive for five months.
Demerit points are incurred whether the offence is committed in South Australia or interstate.

====Northern Territory====
A demerit points scheme was introduced into the [[Northern Territory]] on 1 September 2007. Offences that accrue points include speeding, failing to obey a red traffic light or level crossing signal, failing to wear a seatbelt, drink driving, using a mobile phone, failure to display L or P plates, street racing, burnouts and causing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/transport/mvr/licensing/infobulletins/ibl30.pdf|format=PDF|title=Motor Vehicle Registry Information Bulletin - L30 - Northern Territory Demerit Points Scheme|publisher=[[Northern Territory Government]]|accessdate=2008-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808141510/http://www.nt.gov.au/transport/mvr/licensing/infobulletins/ibl30.pdf|archive-date=2008-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learner and provisional drivers are subject to suspension for accumulating 5 points or more over a 12-month period. The three-year limit of 12 points still applies.

====Queensland====
In [[Queensland]] provisional or learner drivers are entitled to accumulate 4 demerit points, and open licence holders 12 demerit points, without it affecting their licence.  A driver who exceeds their demerit point threshold may elect to lose their licence for a period of 3 months or elect a good driving behaviour period which allows them to incur only one demerit point offences without it affecting their licence.  If whilst on the good driving behaviour period a driver incurs more than one demerit point then they will lose their licence for a minimum of 6 months unless a Magistrates Court grants a special hardship licence &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drivinglaw.com.au/services/hardship-licences]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Bulgaria====
[[Bulgaria]] has implemented a penalty point system with a total of 34 points, introduced in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tispol.org/guides/bulgaria.pdf|title=Country Driving Guides|work=TISPOL|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
[[Denmark]] has a penalty point system that penalizes drivers with a ''klip'' ("cut/stamp")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish and English dictionaries|url=http://www.smallmeans.com/dictionary/|work=Small labs|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for certain traffic violations. The term ''klip'' refers to a ''klippekort'' ("[[Punched card|punch card]] ticket").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travel Denmark Illustrated City Guide, Phrasebook, and Maps.|year=2007|publisher=MobileReference.com|location=Boston|isbn=9781605011370|author=MobileReference}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a driver with a non-probationary license accumulates three penalty points, then police conditionally suspend the driver's license. To get a new license, suspended drivers must pass both written and practical drivers examinations. Drivers who have been suspended and first-time drivers must avoid collecting two penalty points for a three-year probationary period; if the driver has not accumulated any penalty points, then the driver is allowed an extra penalty point so they can have three maximum. Penalty points are deleted from the police database three years after they were assessed. Police can also unconditionally ban people from driving.

&lt;!-- The last paragraph was incoherent so I commented it. The paragraph originally read:
If you get three clips within a period of three years. If you have taken license for ordinary passenger car or motorcycle for less than three years ago and have two clips in three years. If you are disqualified from driving condition and will have three clips in the three-year probation for the conditional suspension. You have previously been driving and you are in a period of three years after the driving ban was imposed, have three clips. If you have previously been disqualified from driving unconditional and you within a period of five years after the disqualification period has expired, get three clips within three years.
--&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====

=====England and Wales=====
In [[England and Wales]], penalty points are given by courts for some of the traffic offences listed in Schedule 2 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. Where points are given, the minimum is 2 points for some lesser offences and the maximum 11 points for the most serious offences; some incidents can result in points being given for multiple offences or for multiple occurrences of the same offence (typically for having more than one defective tyre); the majority of applicable offences attract 3 or more penalty points. The giving of penalty points is obligatory for most applicable offences, but the number of points, and the giving of points for some of several offences, can be discretionary
.
Points remain on the driver's record, and an endorsement is made upon the driver's licence, for four years from conviction (eleven years for drink- and drug-related convictions). Twelve points on the licence within three years make the driver liable to disqualification; however this is not automatic, but must be decided by a law court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/Motoring/DriverLicensing/EndorsementsAndDisqualifications/EndorsementsDisqualificationsArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4022550&amp;chk=P3SAoK|title=Penalty points (endorsements)|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995, if a person in the two years after passing their first practical test accumulates six penalty points, their licence is revoked by the [[DVLA]], and the driver has to reapply and pay for the provisional licence, drive as a learner, and pay for and take the theory and practical tests before receiving a full licence again. In the case of egregious offences, the court may order the driver to pass an extended driving test before the licence is returned, even beyond the two-year probation period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/NewlyQualifiedDrivers/NewQualifiedDriversArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4022566&amp;chk=1ZQD6M "The Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995", Directgov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926002959/http://www.direct.gov.uk/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/NewlyQualifiedDrivers/NewQualifiedDriversArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4022566&amp;chk=1ZQD6M |date=2006-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 11 October 2004 there has been [[Traffic violations reciprocity|mutual recognition]] of driver disqualification arising from the penalty points given in [[England and Wales]] (and/or Scotland) with [[Northern Ireland]]; before that date disqualification in England and Wales would only have extended to Scotland by virtue of the driver registration system covering only [[Great Britain]].{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}

===== Northern Ireland =====
The driver registration system is separate from that of Great Britain with different laws covering penalty points and the offences to which they apply. In other respects the application of the system is similar to that in [[#England and Wales|England and Wales]]. Offences to which penalty points apply are indicated in Schedule 1 of the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.

===== Scotland =====
Road traffic laws are mostly shared with, or similar to those of, [[#England and Wales|England and Wales]], although Scotland is a separate jurisdiction. The driver registration system currently covers all of Great Britain and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 currently governs the penalty points system in Scotland. The main differences in the penalty points provisions of the 1988 Act are the theft and homicide offences attracting penalty points indicated in Schedule 2 Part II ("Other Offences") which are not common between [[Scots Law]] and [[English Law]].

====Germany====

The Federal Motor Transport Authority (''Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt'') located in [[Flensburg]], operates an 8-point system for committed traffic offences. This system was introduced in May 2014, replacing the previous 18-points system that dates back to 1974. Points expire after 2.5 to 10 years depending on the type and severity of each committed offence. Under certain circumstances points can be reduced by attending formal training events. Obtaining eight or more points will result in a revocation of the driving licence; once revoked the licences will only reinstated after a psychological assessment following the ban. Information about own points can be obtained any time free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kba.de/DE/Fahreignungs_Bewertungssystem/Punktekatalog/punktekatalog_node.html|title=Punktekatalog - Stand: 19.10.2017|last=Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{main article|Penalty points in Ireland}}
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], twelve points accrued results in six months' disqualification.&lt;ref name="iecitizensinformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/penalty_points_for_driving_offences.html|title=Penalty points for driving offences|date=28 May 2012|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 [[regulatory offence]]s notified by post incur 1-2 point penalties on payment of a fine.&lt;ref name="rsatable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Licensed%20Drivers/Penalty%20Points%20Chart1.pdf|title=Table 1.

==== Italy ====
In [[Italy]] the driver has 20 points by default, and receives a bonus of 2 points for every 2 years of correct behavior, with a maximum of 30 points.

Each traffic violation incurs a specific point penalty (for example, ignoring a traffic light involves a penalty of 6 points).  If the driver loses all points, the driving license is revoked.

In case of the second alcohol abuse in 2 years, the driving license will be revoked.

A suspension is effective from when the driver is personally served with the suspension notice and they must surrender their driving license to the person giving them the notice.

====Netherlands====
Since March 30, 2002, The Netherlands has a point system for starting drivers (5 years starting from the moment you first passed a driving test or 7 years if you passed before reaching the age of 18). A driver reaching 2 points in 5 years will lose the driving licence and has to pass a driving test again in order to be regain the licence. On October 1, 2014 this limit was lowered from 3 to 2 points. Drivers can get a point for:
* Dangerous behaviour in traffic,
* Causing an accident resulting in death or injury
* Tailgating
* Exceeding the speedlimit with more than 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (motorways), or 30&amp;nbsp;km/h  (all other roads)
* Any violation of the law which resulted in injury or damage
Some of these violations could also directly result in loss of the licence, however when a driver has 2 points the licence is automatically revoked and a driving test has to be passed again, whereas normally the violation would only result in the licence being suspended for several months. However, in Dutch media the effectiveness as been doubted, it was said that points were being given but not always correctly registered.

==== Norway ====
The system is called "prikkbelastning" with prikk(er) meaning point(s). Points are assessed to a driver's license for traffic violations which do not by themselves result in immediate revocation of the license.

After July 1, 2011, the normal penalty for most traffic violations, such as failing to yield or failing to stop at red lights, is three dots in addition to the fine. Speeding violations of between 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;km/h (where the speed limit is 60&amp;nbsp;km/h or less), or between 15 and 20&amp;nbsp;km/h (where the speed limit is 70&amp;nbsp;km/h or more) result in two dots, for speeding violations below this no dots are assessed. Young drivers between 18-20 are penalized with twice the number of dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bil.bt.no/bil/article4174735.ece|title=Nå ryker førerkortet fortere enn du tror|last=Ommundsen|first=Mads|date=15 July 2011|publisher=Bergens Tidende|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A driver reaching 8 dots in three years loses his or her driving license for 6 months. Each dot is deleted when three years have passed since the violation took place. When the driving privileges are restored after the six-month ban, the dots which caused the suspension are deleted.&lt;ref name="forskrift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/sd/dok/lover_regler/forskrifter/2003/Forskrift-om-prikkbelastning.html?id=92248|title=Forskrift om Prikkbelastning |publisher=regjeringen.no ([[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]])|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====
[[File:Demerit point warning on King's Highway 12 in Ontario, Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign in Ontario, Canada]]

=====Alberta=====
When a driver accumulates 15 or more points within a two-year period, their licence is automatically suspended for one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Demerit Point System for Fully Licenced Drivers | publisher = Government of Alberta | url = https://www.transportation.alberta.ca/2172.htm | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ontario=====
Ontario uses a 15-point system where points are "added" to a driver's record following a conviction, though Ontario's point system is unrelated to safe driving behaviour (a lone driver using a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]] in Ontario will earn three demerit points).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Understanding Demerit Points | publisher = Queen's Printer for Ontario | url = https://www.ontario.ca/driving-and-roads/understanding-demerit-points | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario drivers guilty of driving offences in other Canadian provinces, as well as the States of New York and Michigan, will see demerit points added to their driving record just as if the offence happened in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/faq/what-happens-if-i-get-out-province-demerit-points|website=Ontario Government website|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The point system is applied in different ways, or not at all, in different states. If a red light running traffic violation is captured by  red light camera, no points are assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416301562 |title=Red-light running traffic violations: A novel time-based method for determining a fine structure |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |author3= Wesley Zech |year=2016 |work= Transportation Research Part A: policy and Practice |accessdate=27 October 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.tra.2016.08.015 |volume=93 |pages=55–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of a motorist's driving record (including points) may be reported to [[insurance]] companies, who may use them in determining what rate to charge the motorist, and whether to renew or cancel an insurance policy.

=====Arizona=====
Arizona uses a point system where your license will be suspended if 8 points are accumulated in one year.  Offenses that lead to this are the following:
* DUI (blood alcohol concentration (BAC of 0.08% or higher): 8 points
* Extreme DUI: 8 points
* Reckless driving: 8 points
* Aggressive driving: 8 points
* Leaving the scene of an accident: 6 points
* Running a stop sign or traffic signal or failing to yield, accident causing death: 6 points
* Running a stop sign or traffic signal or failing to yield, accident causing serious injury: 4 points
* Speeding: 3 points
* Driving or parking over area where one or more lanes diverge to go in different directions (gore area): 3 points
* All other driving violations: 2 points

There are other offenses that can count toward this (e.g. HOV lane misuse is a 3-point offense)

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azdot.gov/mvd/driver-services/driver-improvement/points-assessment|title=Points Assessment|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====California=====
Drivers who accumulate tickets for moving violations may be considered negligent operators and can lose their right to drive. Major offenses, such as hit and run, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, earn 2 points and remain on record for 13 years.  Less serious offenses earn 1 point which remain for 39 months (3 years, 3 months).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/teenweb/more_btn6/points/|title=What is a Point|publisher=Calif DMV|accessdate=26 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A driver is considered negligent if they accumulate:
:4 points in 12 months, or
:6 points in 24 months, or
:8 points in 36 months

'''Suspension or Revocation by Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)'''

Negligent drivers can be put on probation for one year (including a six-month suspension) or lose their privilege to drive. At the end of the suspension or revocation period, drivers need to re-apply for a license to drive.

DMV will revoke a license after conviction for hit-and-run or reckless driving.

'''Suspension by Judge'''

A judge may suspend license following conviction for:
:Breaking speed laws or reckless driving.
:[[Driving under the influence]] of alcohol or drugs.
:Hit-and-run driving.
:Engaging in lewd conduct and prostitution in a vehicle within 1000 feet (300&amp;nbsp;m) of a residence.
:Assaulting a driver, passenger, bicyclist, or pedestrian when the offense occurs on a highway (road rage).
:Failure to stop as required at a railway grade crossing.
:Felony or misdemeanor offense of recklessly fleeing a law enforcement officer.

When a driver is cited for a traffic violation, the judge ''may'' offer the driver the opportunity to attend a Traffic Violator School, this would include any [[online traffic school]] if the court allows. Drivers may participate once in any 18-month period to have a citation dismissed from their driving record this way.  Upon dismissal of the citation, all record of the citation is removed and no points are accumulated.

Regardless of the number of points accumulated, many serious offenses involving a vehicle are punishable by heavy fines or imprisonment.

=====Colorado=====
Colorado uses an accumulating point system according to the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles Point Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revenue.state.co.us/mv_dir/formspdf/4665.pdf Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles Point Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspension of driving privileges can result from as few as 6 points in 12 months by a driver under 18 years old.  Points remain on the driver's motor vehicle record for 7 years.  Some motor vehicle offenses carry 12 points per incident, which could result in immediate suspension of the drivers license.  Multiple traffic violation convictions can also result in a suspension of the drivers license if a sufficient number of points are accumulated during a 12- or 24-month period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revenue.state.co.us/mv_dir/wrap.asp?incl=faqdc/faqdc7 State.co.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Florida=====
Florida uses a point system similar to that of [[#Colorado|Colorado]]. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is the department responsible for the issuance of Driver's Licenses in the state and will also track points issued to drivers who are licensed within the state. The following are point values assigned for the following infractions.

Speeding
* 14&amp;nbsp;mph or less over the speed limit = 3 points
* 15&amp;nbsp;mph or more over the speed limit = 4 points
* Speeding which results in a crash = 6 points (enacted to curtail street drag racing)

Speeding Fines are doubled when the infraction occurs within an active school zone or a construction zone.

Moving Violations
* Moving violation (includes driving during restricted hours and parking on a highway outside the limits of a municipality) = 3 points
* Moving violation resulting in a crash = 4 points
* Failing to stop at a traffic signal = 4 points
* Passing a stopped school bus = 4 points
* Reckless driving = 4 points
* Leaving the scene of a crash resulting in property damage of more than [[US$]]50 = 6 points
* Improper lane change = 3 points
* Violation of a traffic control sign/device = 4 points
* Open container as an operator = 3 points
* Child restraint violation = 3 points
* Littering = 3 points
* Violation of curfew = 3 points (a licensed driver who is under the age of 17 may not operate a motor vehicle between 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., unless accompanied by a driver who is 21 years of age or older and holds a valid driver license, or the operator is driving to or from work. A licensed driver who is 17 years of age may not operate a motor vehicle between 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., unless accompanied by a driver who is 21 years of age or older and holds a valid driver license, or the operator is driving to and from work.)

Any person who collects a certain number of points within a given time frame will have their license automatically revoked by the state for the length of time listed.
* 12 points earned within 12 months results in a 30-day suspension.
* 18 points earned within 18 months results in a 3-month suspension.
* 24 points earned within 36 months results in a 12-month suspension.

Any driver under the age of 18 who accumulates six or more points within a 12-month period is automatically restricted for one year to driving for business purposes only. If additional points are accumulated the restriction is extended for 90 days for every additional point received.

If a driver license was suspended in the state of Florida for points or as a habitual (but not DUI) traffic offender, or by court order, the holder must complete an advanced driver improvement course before driving privileges are reinstated.

Points issued against a driver's license in Florida remain on the license for at least 10 years.

The state of [[Florida]] issues its citizens points against their driver's license for infractions occurring anywhere in the United States.

=====Massachusetts=====
In [[Massachusetts]] point system is known as Safe Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ocaterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Consumer&amp;L2=Insurance&amp;L3=Automobile+Insurance&amp;L4=Ways+to+Save+on+Your+Auto+Insurance&amp;sid=Eoca&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=doi_Consumer_WaysToSave_SDIP&amp;csid=Eoca Mass DOT Safe Driver Insurance Plan-]&lt;/ref&gt; This encourages safe driving with lower premiums for drivers who do not cause accidents or commit traffic violations, and by ensuring that high-risk drivers pay a greater share of insurance costs. The points are accumulated over a six-year period, and reduced for sustained periods of safe driving.

The number of surcharge points assigned to each surchargeable incident is determined by the incident classification defined in the Safe Driver Insurance Plan:

Minor Traffic Law Violation - 2 points

Minor At-Fault Accident - 3 points

Major At-Fault Accident - 4 points

Major Traffic Law Violation - 5 points


The incident count is the number of surchargeable incidents. However, if more than one surcharge comes from one incident, it only counts as one surchargeable incident.

=====New Jersey=====
The Motor Vehicle Commission of New Jersey has a point system. If the motorist receives 6 points or more within a period 3 years or more, he/she will be forced to pay a surcharge annually for three years, which does include court fees and other penalties. If 12 points or more are accumulated on the motorist's license, then his/her license will be suspended. Other offenses that lead to automatic suspension of the motorist's license are the following:

* Driving while intoxicated (DWI)
* Operating a vehicle without a license
* Driving a vehicle without insurance
* Failure to pay child support
* Failure to make a court-ordered appearance
* Drug-related charges.
* Drinking alcohol if under the age of 21 

The points range from 2 to 8 points, depending on the severity of the offense. Red light camera violations are not worth any points. The motorists can deduct points from their driving records. 3 points may be deducted one year after either the motorist's last moving violation and no violations for at least one year before. The motorist must also complete an approved driver improvement program. 2 points may be deducted if the motorist completes a defensive driving course. However, the motorist may receive point reductions every five years for every course he/she takes. 

=====New York=====
[[New York Statutes]] has a point system; after 11 points or 3 speeding tickets in 18 months, a driver's privileges are subject to suspension, with the possibility of requesting a review hearing.  Points are counted from the date of the incident (usually the date of the ticket) rather than the date of conviction. If a driver accrues 6 or more points in an 18 month period they will be fined a "NY driver responsibility assessment fee".This fee will be $100 per year for 3 years. If a driver gets more than 6 points in 18 months, an additional $25 per year will be charged for each additional point you receive. This means 1 extra point will cost you $75 more (since the assessment lasts for 3 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://traffictickets.com/blog/driver-responsibility-programs-ny/|title=The New York Driver Responsibility Assessment|date=2012-07-24|work=Rosenblum Law Firm|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For out-of-state offenses, New York State Department of Motor Vehicles does not record point violations, with the exception of violations from [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system | title = About the NYS Driver Point System| publisher = New York State Department of Motor Vehicles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====North Carolina=====
[[North Carolina]] operates two parallel point systems: one for DMV license suspension purposes and one for insurance purposes.

The DMV point system assigns 2 to 4 points upon conviction or an admission of guilt for most moving violations; non-moving violations carry no points. A driver's license is suspended for 60 days on the first suspension if twelve points are assessed against the license within a three-year period. Serious offenses, such as DWI and excessive speeding (more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph over the limit at a travelled speed of greater than 55&amp;nbsp;mph), result in an immediate suspension on conviction. Points are not assessed for up to two granted Prayers for Judgment Continued (PJC) within a five-year period, though some serious offenses (such as DUI, passing a stopped school bus, and speeding in excess of 25&amp;nbsp;mph over the posted speed limit) are ineligible for a PJC.

The insurance point system assigns points differently, assigning points to incidences of at-fault accidents and moving violations. Rather than using the points for a license suspension, the points lead to insurance surcharges of approximately 25-35% per point assessed. Notably, points are assessed for insurance purposes even if the license is suspended. Only points within the three years preceding the policy purchase date are considered, and a single PJC per household within the three-year period does not result in points assigned.

Incidents from out-of-state are treated as though they occurred in North Carolina for point assessment purposes.

=====Pennsylvania=====
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) has a point system that follows:

If the motorist accumulates 6 or more points on their license, they are in danger of losing their license. If the motorist is under 18 years of age and has 6 points or more on their license or receives a ticket for speeding 26 miles (or more) over the posted speed limit, then their license will be suspended. For every one year period (from the date of the most recent violation) that a motorist has no point related violations, PennDOT will remove a maximum of 3 points from their record. 

Violations range from 2 to 5 points (possibly with a mandatory departmental hearing), depending on the severity of the offense. PennDOT has the right to immediately suspend a motorist's license if any one of the following occurs:

* DUI (One-year suspension)
* Speeding 31 miles over the posted speed limit (15-day suspension)
* Accumulating 11 or more points on their license
* Causing the death of another due to the motorist's fault

Point system suspensions are as follows:

* First suspension: 5 days per 1 point
* Second suspension: 10 days per 1 point
* Third suspension: 15 days per 1 point
* All subsequent suspensions: 1 year

=====South Carolina=====
In South Carolina, if a motorist has six or more points on his/her driving record, a warning letter will be sent to the motorist's home address. If the motorist accumulates 12 or more points, then the license will be suspended. Motorists may reduce their points by taking a Defensive Driving Course. This course cannot be taken online and the course must be taken in the state of South Carolina. In addition, the course must be taken after the motorist has been assessed points on his/her license. However, point reductions may be made within a three-year period. If by any chance the motorist's license is in danger of being suspended, the course must be taken prior to the suspension start time. The points range from 2 to 6 points, depending on the severity of the offense. If a motorist receives a ticket for a DUI, then the license is automatically suspended.

=====Texas=====
In Texas most moving violations are worth two points, but three points are assessed in the case that an accident was caused. A license cannot be suspended as a result of point accumulation, however; instead, after six points have been accumulated, the driver must pay a "Driver Responsibility Surcharge" of $100 plus $25 per additional point each year that the license has six or more points recorded. Other convictions carry penalties that remain on the license for three years after conviction, such as a [[DWI]] conviction ($1000–$2000), driving without a license ($100), or driving without insurance ($250). The license is suspended if the surcharges are not paid.
&lt;br&gt;Points clear from the license after three years, but the actual convictions clear from the record after five years, except for DWI convictions, which never expire.

===South America===

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], all traffic violations incur a certain number of demerit points, depending on their severity, according to the 1997 Brazilian Traffic Code. If a driver accumulates more than 20 points (5 points for provisional drivers), the driving license is suspended and the driver has to take a traffic education course in order to regain the right (privilege) to drive. However, some infractions incur in immediate license suspension regardless of current point tally, such as [[drunk driving]], engaging in [[street racing]] and others. It is also notable that many offenses that only apply to pedestrians also incur in demerit points.

The '''Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America''' is a [[research library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Harvard University]]. According to [[Nancy F. Cott]], the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director, it is "the largest and most significant repository of documents covering women's lives and activities in the [[United States]]." The library is named after [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], a noted history professor at Harvard during the 20th century; and his wife Elizabeth Bancroft Schlesinger, a noted [[feminism|feminist]]. The library was begun on August 26, 1943, when the [[Radcliffe College]] alumna [[Maud Wood Park]] '98, a former suffragist, donated her collection of books, papers, and memorabilia on female reformers to Radcliffe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radcliffe.edu/schles/about.aspx | title = You Are Here - Schlesinger Library - About the Library | website = Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University |accessdate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505032345/http://radcliffe.edu/schles/about.aspx |archivedate=May 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This grew into a research library called the "Women's Archives", which was renamed in 1965 after Elizabeth Bancroft Schlesinger and her husband Arthur M. Schlesinger, as they were strong supporters of the library's mission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Schlesinger Library exists to document women's lives and endeavors. Its wealth of resources reveals the wide range of women's activities at home in the United States and abroad from the early 19th century to the present day. The library’s holdings include manuscripts; books and periodicals; and photographic and audiovisual material.

==Manuscripts==
There are more than 2,500 unique manuscript collections from individuals, families, and organizations. Women's rights movements past and present, feminism, health and sexuality, social reform, and the education of women and girls are core manuscript holdings. Ordinary lives of women and families and the struggles and triumphs of women of accomplishment are richly documented in diaries and other personal records. Many collections, such as the papers of [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Pauli Murray]], and the records of the [[National Organization for Women]], feature political, organizational, and economic questions. In 1972 the National Organization for Women chose the Schlesinger Library as the archives for its records; the collection has grown to be one of its largest (300 linear feet of manuscripts and growing as of 2013) and one of its most heavily used by researchers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/collection/records-national-organization-women Records of the National Organization for Women | Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Books and periodicals==
More than 80,000 printed volumes include scholarly [[monograph]]s as well as popular works. These cover topics including [[women’s rights]]; women and work; women’s health; women of color; comparative material about women in other cultures; works on women in the arts and in music; women and family; [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist theory]]; and [[lesbian literature|lesbian writings]]. Hundreds of periodical titles, including popular magazines such as ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'', highlight domestic concerns, leisure pursuits, etiquette, fashion, and food.

==Photographic and audiovisual material==
More than 90,000 photographs, ranging from casual snapshots to the works of professional photographers, create an unparalleled visual record of private and public life. Audiotapes, videotapes and oral history tapes, and transcripts add the soundtrack to the story of women’s lives.

The library has two distinguished special collections. A culinary collection of over 15,000 books — spanning five centuries and [[global cuisines]] — is one of the world's most significant. This collection also includes the papers of several famous chefs and [[foodwriters]] such as [[M.F.K. Fisher]], [[Julia Child]], and [[Elizabeth David]]. The archives of [[Radcliffe College]], 1879–1999 — including papers of college officers, students, and alumnae — richly record the history of women in higher education.

The Schlesinger Library is home to the Black Women Oral History Project, recorded between 1976 and 1981. With support from the Schlesinger Library, the project recorded a cross section of women who had made significant contributions to American society during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/collection/black-women-oral-history-project|title=Schlesinger Library {{!}} Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|website=www.radcliffe.harvard.edu|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While its focus for collecting is American women, the library has an abundance of print and manuscript materials bearing on issues around the globe as a result of American women's extensive travel and foreign residence. Some examples are letters of early [[missionaries in China]], activists' accounts of the Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, and the world-spanning speeches and writings of [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]].

Detailed records for the library’s manuscript collections as well as books and periodicals can be found in [[HOLLIS]]. The catalog record gives a description of the item or collection and provides other important information such as offsite location or access restrictions. Researchers can learn more about the manuscript collections by consulting the Schlesinger Library's Research Guides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.schlesinger.harvard.edu/ Schlesinger Library Research Guides - Schlesinger Library Research Guides - Research Guides at Harvard Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Research Librarians can be reached through ''Ask a Schlesinger Librarian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asklib.schlesinger.radcliffe.edu/index.php Ask a Schlesinger Librarian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of 26 episodes aired between 1984 and 1985. The series was never renewed for a second season.

==Production==
The series was a joint project between Japan's [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and the Italian public broadcasting corporation [[RAI]]. Six episodes were directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 1981 until problems with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate led to a suspension in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planete-jeunesse.com/sources/series.php3?cle=125&amp;sec=1|title=Planète Jeunesse - Sherlock Holmes|first=Stéphane|last=CLEMENT|website=www.planete-jeunesse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the issues were resolved Miyazaki had turned to other projects, and thus the remaining episodes were directed by [[Kyosuke Mikuriya]]. The show was finally aired in 1984. The same year a film version edited together of two of the episodes directed by Miyazaki (''The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle'' and ''Treasure Under the Sea'') was released alongside ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' in Japanese theaters, entitled ''Meitantei Hōmuzu Gekijouban''.

Two pieces of [[theme music]] are used for the Japanese version: The opening theme is "Sora Kara Koboreta Story" (lit. "Story Spilled From the Sky") and the ending theme is "Thames Gawa no Dance" (lit. "Dance of the Thames River"), both performed by the Japanese duo, Da Capo. The series' international versions had a single piece of theme music for the opening and ending credits. The frequent soloists are [[Joe Farrell]] on [[soprano saxophone|soprano]], [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[alto saxophone]]s and [[flute]] (in his final recording) and [[Milt Jackson]] on [[vibes (percussion)|vibes]]. This English theme does not exist on the UK DVD's from Manga, instead instrumentals of both the Japanese opening and ending themes were used.

==Characters==
;{{nihongo|[[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Hound]]|ホームズ|Hōmuzu}}
:{{anime voices|[[Taichirō Hirokawa]]|[[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]]}}
: Just like his original incarnation, he has a genius intellect and is extremely knowledgeable in multiple fields. He keeps a cool and logical head despite the situation. Unlike his original incarnation, however, his only drug habit is smoking a tobacco pipe. He keeps his apartment a mess and is regularly conducting chemical experiments that lead to clouds of noxious fumes. He also seems to have feelings for Mrs. Hudson, as does the rest of the male cast. He drive a [[Benz Velo]]. He is a [[red fox]].
;{{nihongo|[[Doctor Watson]]|ワトソン|Watoson}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kōsei Tomita]]|[[Lewis Arquette]]}}
: Hound's loyal companion, he is a trained doctor who returned to England shortly before meeting Hound. He tries his best to help Hound as he can, but has difficulty at times keeping up with Hound, both mentally and physically, being a bit overweight. Watson is a [[Scottish terrier]].
;{{nihongo|[[Mrs. Hudson]]|ハドソン夫人|Hadoson-fujin}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yōko Asagami]]|[[Patricia Parris]]}}
: Hound and Watson's landlady. In most adaptations, Holmes's long-suffering landlady is shown as middle-aged or older, but in this version she is a comely widow in her 20s and a love interest of many, including Holmes, Watson, and Moriarty (mostly Holmes), and given the first name {{nihongo|Marie|マリー|Marī}}. Her late husband Jim was a pilot and Hound finds her contacts in the world of aviation useful; many of the local aviators are also former buddies of Mrs. Hudson's late husband and/or have strong romantic feelings for the caring gentle-natured Mrs. Hudson herself, and so they are always eager to assist in any way she asks. Mrs. Hudson displays a serenely-dignified and level-headed personality comparable to Hound's; she can also be quite quick and resourceful herself when need be, plus she appears to be both an experienced high-speed driver and a crack shot with a revolver. Miyazaki actually wanted to present her as the real brains of Baker Street, running rings around both Hound and his enemy Moriarty, but he was overruled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Like many people in Hound's world, Mrs. Hudson is a [[golden retriever]].
;{{nihongo|[[Professor Moriarty]]|モリアーティ教授|Moriāti-kyōju}}
:{{anime voices|[[Chikao Ōtsuka]]|[[Hamilton Camp]]}}
:Hound's archenemy, Unlike the rarely appearing [[mafia]] [[Crime boss|don]]nish Moriarty in the books, this Moriarty is portrayed as working personally on his plans without any sort of support network and frequently encountering Hound and his allies, being the main antagonist in the majority of the episodes. Still an intellectual, he is a master inventor, often the one responsible for the [[steam punk]] technology seen in the show, including his personal "steam car", a tractor and tank combination rather than a car. His plans can occasionally be very complex or outlandish that rely on one questioning or linking together unusual acts, which is often how Hound figures out what Moriarty is up to. Sometimes he acts as a mercenary to other criminals who are after what he normally wouldn't steal. In this version, Moriarty resembles a [[gray wolf]].
;{{nihongo|Smiley|スマイリー|Sumairī}}
:{{anime voices|[[Mitsuo Senda]]|[[Lewis Arquette]]}}
:One of Moriarty's henchmen, created for the show. Smiley is tall, lanky, has something of a limited intellect, a thick [[Cockney accent]] and a [[Optimism|positive attitude]]. In the episodes directed by Hayao Miyazaki, he is colored a pea green, while in other episodes, he's medium brown. Before working for Moriarty, he and George/Todd were members of the Bengal Pirates that appeared in the first episode, though they escaped being arrested with the rest of the crew. Smiley resembles some variety of [[scent hound]]. 
;{{nihongo|George/Todd|トッド|Toddo}}
:{{anime voices|[[Hiroshi Masuoka (voice actor)|Hiroshi Masuoka]]|Larry Moss}}
:One of Moriarty's henchmen, created for the show George/Todd is small and squat, has a [[pessimist|negative outlook]] on the situation, and is usually the first to criticize Moriarty or his plans. He is inconsistently called either George or Todd, sometimes within a single episode, early in the series, eventually settling on Todd. The two are often used for comic relief. Before they worked for Moriarty, he, along with Smiley, was a member of the Bengal Pirates that appeared in the first episode, though they escaped being arrested with the rest of the crew. George/Todd appears to be a [[pug]].
;{{nihongo|[[Inspector Lestrade]]|レストレード警部|Resutorēdo-keibu}}
:{{anime voices|[[Shōzō Iizuka]]|[[Lewis Arquette]]}}
: As Hound's go-to guy in the police force, he's also the first to call on Hound for assistance on a case. Though he is a well-meaning and passionate police officer, he's not the most attentive of people, and he also has a hotheaded and impulsive nature as well. He is usually assisted by several policemen in trying to catch and arrest Moriarty, but they always fail at trying to catch him and they seem to always end up landing themselves into comedic situations similar to that of the [[Keystone Cops]]. Lestrade is a [[bull dog]].

==Releases==

===DVD===
In 2002, [[Pioneer Entertainment]] released the series on DVD (Region 1, NTSC format). 6 volumes or 'Case Files' were released. Each disk was double sided with the Japanese version on one side and the English dubbed version on the other side.

The '''Society for Indecency to Naked Animals''', or '''SINA''' [pronounced "sinna"], was a satiric [[hoax]] perpetrated by comedian [[Alan Abel]] from 1959 to 1962. In 1959, Abel wrote a satirical story about this imaginary organization for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' but the editors rejected it.&lt;ref name="Martinez 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinez |first1=Greg |year=2011 |title=Fooling People for Money and Profit |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=58–59 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abel then transformed his story into a series of press releases from the organization that garnered media attention. The group used the language and rhetoric of conservative moralists for the aim of clothing naked animals, including pets, barnyard animals, and large wildlife. An alleged debate within SINA was how large an animal had to be to require clothing.  Slogans such as ''"Decency today means morality tomorrow"'' and ''"A nude horse is a rude horse"'' were offered.  Abel persuaded the actor [[Buck Henry]] to play the group president, G. Clifford Prout, in public appearances, and Abel played the group vice president.

== Support and anthems ==
SINA actually acquired ardent supporters, some of whom attempted to contribute a great deal of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_society_for_indecency_to_naked_animals/ SINA Article], museumofhoaxes.com, Publishing date unknown, Retrieved March. 9, 2010 (Look at the second line in the fifth paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt; That aided SINA's (false) claims of gaining momentum - at one time they claimed tens of thousands of members. They also published a newsletter, in an issue of which is this anthem:

: High on the wings of SINA / we fight for the future now;
: Let's clothe every pet and animal / whether dog, cat, horse or cow!
: G. Clifford Prout, our President / he works for you and me,
: So clothe all your pets and join the march / for worldwide Decency!
: S.I.N.A., that's our call / all for one and one for all.
: Hoist our flag for all to see / waving for Morality.
: Onward we strive together / stronger in every way,
: All mankind and his animal friends / for SINA, S-I-N-A!

== Exposure ==

The hoax was exposed when staff on [[Walter Cronkite]]'s CBS television news show recognized [[Buck Henry]] while broadcasting an interview. A 1963 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] article exposed the hoax.&lt;ref name="Martinez 2011"/&gt; Abel managed to keep the newsletter going for several more years, hoaxing members who had not seen or heard of that Cronkite episode. The hoax appears in a recording of the short-lived television series ''One Man Show'' in an episode hosted by [[Groucho Marx]].

The Society for Indecency to Naked Animals hoax was chronicled in Abel's book, [http://abelraisescain.com/alan_abel_books_records_films.htm#abel_get_mad ''The Great American Hoax''], published in 1966.

[[Image:RRTA Optima Trolley side.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Optima Bus Corporation|Optima]] tourist trolley operated by [[Red Rose Transit Authority|RRTA]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].]]

A '''tourist trolley''', also called a '''road trolley''', is a rubber-tired [[bus]] designed to resemble an old-style [[tram|streetcar or tram]]. The vehicles are usually fueled by [[diesel fuel|diesel]], or sometimes [[compressed natural gas]].

The name refers to the [[American English]] usage of the word ''trolley'' to mean an electric streetcar. As these vehicles are not actually [[Trolley car|trolleys]], and to avoid confusion with [[trolley bus]]es,  the [[American Public Transportation Association]] (APTA) refers to them as "trolley-replica buses".&lt;ref name="APTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm  |title=Bus and Trolleybus Definitions |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074721/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm |archivedate = 2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Tourist trolleys are used by both [[Municipality|municipal]] and private operators.  Municipal operators may mix tourist trolleys in with the regular service bus fleet to add more visitor interest or attract attention to new routes. In many cities tourist trolleys are used as circulators.&lt;ref&gt;A circulator operates a simplified route limited to popular destinations on a fixed schedule with a reduced or free fare.  See ref [1] for definition.&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist trolleys are also run by private operators to carry [[Tourism|tourist]]s to popular destinations.

In [[San Francisco]], tourist trolleys mimic the city's famous [[San Francisco cable car system|cable cars]].

Tourist trolleys sometimes operate in places which also have streetcars. For example, tourist trolleys operate in [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitphilly.com/tours/philadelphia/philadelphia-trolley-works-76-carriage-company/|title=Philadelphia Trolley Works (&amp;#8216;76 Carriage Company) — visitphilly.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also has [[SEPTA Subway–Surface Trolley Lines|actual trolley service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/maps/trolley/city.html|title=SEPTA - Route 10, 11, 13, 15, 34 &amp; 36 Trolley Line Map|website=www.septa.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zambales dice game''' was played by the [[Negritos]] of the [[Zambales]] region of the [[Philippines]]. The [[dice game]] was recorded by William Allan Reed and published in his book entitled "Negritos of Zambales, Volume 2, Parts 1-3" (1904), and it is described on page 49.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=William Allan|title=Negritos of Zambales, Volume 2, Parts 1-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ess_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=zambales+negrito+dice+game&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DUsq0VTBsv&amp;sig=l_CSxFzRt1OL_5IvPnoeHFNCEas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixyLjLjbrNAhUBzGMKHXZPBk0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=zambales%20negrito%20dice%20game&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Bureau Of Public Printing|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two small wooden cubes are used as dice, each marked with the following on its six sides: I, II, III, X, +, #. The player has five chances to throw the two dice. If the player pairs the dice, he or she wins (Reed does not clarify if the game ends immediately after pairing the dice, or if all five throws are taken regardless). If the player cannot pair the dice within five throws, the game ends as a loss.

Wagers are made usually for small items such as [[camote]]s, rough-made cigars, and tobacco leaves. Reed noticed that [[Roman numeral]]s and modern symbols were used on the dice, but upon inquiry with the Negritos and the surrounding Filipino groups, the game appears to be very old having been handed down by the ancestors of the Negritos and observed when the surrounding Filipinos were first acquainted with the Negritos.
