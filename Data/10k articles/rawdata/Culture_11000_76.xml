'''Adult education''' is a practice in which adults engage in systematic and sustained self-educating activities in order to gain new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values.&lt;ref name="Merriam 7"&gt;[[Merriam, Sharan B.]] &amp; Brockett, Ralph G. ''The Profession and Practice of Adult Education: An Introduction''. Jossey-Bass, 2007, p. 7.  {{ISBN|978-0-78790-290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can mean any form of learning adults engage in beyond traditional schooling, encompassing basic literacy to personal fulfillment as a lifelong learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is adult education|url=http://adulted.about.com/od/whatisadultlearning/p/whatisadulteducation.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, adult education reflects a specific philosophy about learning and teaching based on the assumption that adults can and want to learn, that they are able and willing to take responsibility for that learning, and that the learning itself should respond to their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |title=Adult Education |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/adult-education/ |access-date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by what one needs or wants to learn, the available opportunities, and the manner in which one learns, adult learning is affected by demographics, globalization and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|last2=Caffarella|first2=Rosemary S.|last3=Baumgartner|first3=Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-7879-7588-3|page=7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning happens in many ways and in many contexts just as all adults' lives differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fenwick|first1=Tara J.|last2=Nesbit|first2=Tom|last3=Spencer|first3=Bruce|title=Contexts of adult education : Canadian perspectives|date=2006|publisher=Thompson Educational Publ.|location=Toronto|isbn=9781550771602|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adult learning can be in any of the three contexts, i.e.:

* Formal – Structured learning that typically takes place in an education or training institution, usually with a set curriculum and carries credentials;
* Non-formal – Learning that is organized by educational institutions but non credential. Non-formal learning opportunities may be provided in the workplace and through the activities of civil society organizations and groups;
* Informal education – Learning that goes on all the time, resulting  from daily life activities related to work, family, community or leisure (e.g. community baking class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Bruce|title=The purposes of adult education : a short introduction|date=2006|publisher=Thompson Educational Pub.|location=Toronto|isbn=9781550771619|pages=9–10|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |title=Adult learning in Canada: Characteristics of learners |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-004-x/2008001/article/10560-eng.htm |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that adult learning is an important channel to help readjust workers' skills to fit in the future of work and suggests ways to improve its effectiveness.

==Characteristics==
Educating adults differs from educating children in several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge and work experience which can add to the learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bohonos, Jeremy Appreciating the Experiences and Expertise of Adult Students, Journal of College Orientation and Transition 20:2&lt;/ref&gt; Most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to participate, by an employer. The science and art of helping adults learn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Bruce|title=The purposes of adult education : a short introduction|date=2006|publisher=Thompson Educational Pub.|location=Toronto|isbn=9781550771619|page=4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Malcolm|title=The adult learner : a neglected species|date=1984|publisher=Gulf Pub. Co., Book Division|location=Houston|isbn=978-0-87201-005-5|edition=3rd|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED084368.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of adult education is referred to as '''[[andragogy]]''', to distinguish it from the traditional school-based education for children '''[[pedagogy]]'''. Unlike children, adults are seen as more self-directed, rather than relying on others for help.

Adults are mature and therefore have knowledge and have gained life experiences which provide them a foundation of learning. An adult's readiness to learn is linked to their need to have the information. Their orientation to learn is problem-centered rather than subject-centered. Their motivation to learn is internal.&lt;ref name="Knowles" /&gt;

Adults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical fashion to learn effectively. They must have a reasonable expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them further their goals. For example, during the 1990s, many adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer training courses. These courses would teach basic use of the [[operating system]] or specific application software. Because the abstractions governing the user's interactions with a [[personal computer|PC]] were so new, many people who had been working white-collar jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers.

In the United States and many areas in Canada, a more general example is when adults who dropped out of high school return to school to complete general education requirements. Most upwardly mobile positions require at the very least a [[high school]] diploma or equivalent. A working adult is unlikely to have the freedom to simply quit his or her job and go "back to school" full-time.

Public school systems and community colleges usually offer evening or weekend classes for this reason. In Europe this is often referred to as "second-chance", and many schools offer tailor-made courses and learning programs for these returning learners. Furthermore, adults with poor reading skills can obtain help from volunteer literacy programs. These national organizations provide training, tutor certification, and accreditation for local volunteer programs. States often have organizations which provide field services for volunteer literacy programs.

The purpose of adult education in the form of college or university is distinct. In these institutions, the aim is typically related to personal growth and development as well as occupation and career preparedness. Another goal might be to not only sustain the democratic society, but to even challenge and improve its social structure.&lt;ref name="Merriam 7"/&gt;

A common problem in adult education in the US is the lack of professional development opportunities for adult educators. Most adult educators come from other professions and are not well trained to deal with adult learning issues. Most of the positions available in this field are only part-time without any benefits or stability since they are usually funded by government grants that might last for only a couple of years.

However, in Canada, professional development is available in all provinces and territories through postsecondary institutions and most Provinces also provide professional development through their ministry of education or school boards and through nongovernmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Council of Ministers of Education Canada|title=Adult Learning and Education: Canada progress report for the UNESCO Global Report on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) and the end of the United Nations Literacy Decade|url=http://www.cmec.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/283/GRALE_EN.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are programs about adult education for existing and aspiring practitioners offered, at various academic levels, by universities, colleges, and professional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesbit|first1=Tom|title=Canadian Adult Education: Still a Movement|journal=Canadian Journal of University Continuing Education|date=Spring 2011|volume=37|issue=1|page=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/948160|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Continuing education can help adults maintain certifications, fulfill job requirements and stay up to date on new developments in their field. Also, the purpose of adult education can be vocational, social, recreational or for self-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The foundations of adult education in Canada|last1=Selman|first1=Gordon|last2=Cooke|first2=M|last3=Selman|first3=M.|last4=Dampier|first4=P.|date=1998|publisher=Thompson Educational Publ|isbn=978-1550770834|edition=2.|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its goals may be to help adult learners satisfy their personal needs and achieve their professional goals.&lt;ref&gt;Bohonos, Jeremy Understanding Career Context as a Key to Recruiting, Retaining and Best Serving Adult Students. Journal of Adult Learning, 2014, p. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, its ultimate goal might be to achieve human fulfillment. The goal might also be to achieve an institution's needs. For example, this might include improving its operational effectiveness and productivity. A larger scale goal of adult education may be the growth of society by enabling its citizens to keep up with societal change and maintain good social order.&lt;ref name="Merriam 7" /&gt;

One fast-growing sector of adult education is [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]] (ESOL), also referred to as English as a Second Language (ESL) or [[English Language Learners]] (ELL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/englit.html|title=Adult English Language Instruction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031112337/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/englit.html|archivedate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These courses are key in assisting immigrants with not only the acquisition of the English language, but the acclimation process to the culture of the United States as well as other English speaking countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faez|first1=Farahnaz|last2=Valeo|first2=Antonella|date=September 2012|title=TESOL Teacher Education: Novice Teachers' Perceptions of Their Preparedness and Efficacy in the classroom|url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/tesolc/downloads/TQ_vol46-3_faezvaleo.pdf|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=3|issue=46|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The principles of [[andragogy]] flow directly from an understanding of the characteristics of adults as learners and can be recognized when we understand the characteristics of adults, and see the way those characteristics influence how adults learn best.&lt;ref name=LBS&gt;{{cite web|last1=LBS Practitioner Training: Professional development support for Literacy and Basic Skills educators in Ontario|title=Principles of Adult Learning|url=http://www.lbspractitionertraining.com/pd-courses/practitioners/working-with-adult-learners/99-22-principles-of-adult-learning|accessdate=19 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112103210/http://www.lbspractitionertraining.com/pd-courses/practitioners/working-with-adult-learners/99-22-principles-of-adult-learning|archive-date=2014-11-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who follow the principles of andragogy when choosing materials for training and when designing program delivery, find that their learners progress more quickly, and are more successful in reaching their goals.&lt;ref name=LBS/&gt;
The Canadian Literacy and Learning Network outlines the 7 key principles of adult learning. In other words, these 7 principles distinguish adult learners from children and youth.
# Adults cannot be made to learn. They will only learn when they are internally motivated to do so.
# Adults will only learn what they feel they need to learn. In other words, they are practical.
# Adults learn by doing. Active participation is especially important to adult learners in comparison to children.
# Adult learning is problem-based and these problems must be realistic. Adult learners like finding solutions to problems.
# Adult learning is affected by the experience each adult brings.
# Adults learn best informally. Adults learn what they feel they need to know whereas children learn from a [[curriculum]].
# Children want guidance. Adults want information that will help them improve their situation or that of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian ¶Literacy and Learning Network. [http://www.literacy.ca/professionals/professional-development-2/principles-of-adult-learning/ ''Principles of Adult Learning''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217103828/http://www.literacy.ca/professionals/professional-development-2/principles-of-adult-learning/ |date=2014-02-17 }}. Jossey-Bass, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and motivating factors==
Adults have many responsibilities that they must balance against the demands of learning. Because of these responsibilities, adults have barriers and challenges against participating in learning and continuing their education. The barriers can be classified into three groups including [[institution]]al, situational and [[disposition]]al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=K.P|title=Adults as learners: Increasing Participation and Facilitating Learning|date=1992|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780783725079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these barriers include the lack of time balancing career and family demands, finances and transportation. As well, things such as confidence, interest, lack of information about opportunities to learn, scheduling problems, entrance requirements and problems with child care can be barriers in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, S. T. A., Prieto, L. C., &amp; Ndinguri, E. N. (2013). Teaching an old dog new tricks: Investigating how age, ability and self-efficacy influence intentions to learn and learning among participants in adult education. Academy of Educational Leadership Journal, 17(1), 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Distance and/or online learning can address some problems with adult education that cause these barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Bruce|title=The purposes of adult education : a short introduction|date=2006|publisher=Thompson Educational Pub.|location=Toronto|isbn=9781550771619|pages=101–103|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding what motivates adult learners and what their barriers are, can assist in enrolling more adult learners. When adult learners clearly know the benefits of their continuing education, such as getting promotions or better job performance, they are more likely to be motivated to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieb|first1=Stephen|title=Principles of adult learning: Adults as learners|journal=Vision|date=Fall 1991|url=https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.masaniconsulting.com%2Fupload%2FPRINCIPLES%2520OF%2520ADULT%2520LEARNING.docx}}&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers are aware of the student's characteristics, they can develop lessons that address both the strengths and the needs of each student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Massachusetts Adult Basic Education, Curriculum Framework for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)|journal=Massachusetts Department of Education, Adult and Community Learning Services|page=9|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/acls/frameworks/esol.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults that are motivated have confidence and positive self-esteem are more likely to develop into lifelong learners.&lt;ref&gt;Kunga, K., &amp; Machtmes, K. (2009). Lifelong learning: Looking at triggers for adult learning. The International Journal of Learning, 16(7), 501-511.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Adult education can have many benefits ranging from better health and personal well-being to greater social inclusion. It can also support the function of [[Democracy|democratic systems]] and provide greater opportunities for finding new or better employment. Adult education has been shown to have a positive impact on the economy.&lt;ref name="Mundo-J"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaea.org/en/home/news/adult-education-has-long-term-impact-on-the-economy-and-society-at-large.html|title=Adult education has long-term impact on the economy and society at large|website=European Association for the Education of Adults (EAEA)|publisher=Mundo-J|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult education provides opportunities for personal growth, goal fulfillment and socialization. Chris McAllister's research of semi-structured interviews with older adult learners shows a motivation to communicate with people and to get out of the house to keep mentally active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAllister|first=Chris|date=September 22, 2010|title=This is the beginning of my life educationally': older (50+ years) working class adults' participation in higher education in Scotland, through the lens of critical educational gerontology|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume= 29, 2010 - Issue 5|issue=5|pages=547–563|doi=10.1080/02601370.2010.512802}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have documented the social aspects of older adult education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloane-Seale;Kops|first=Atlanta; Bill|date=2010|title=Older Adults' Participation in Education and Successful Aging: Implications for University Continuing Education in Canada|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ930499|journal=Canadian Journal of University Continuing Education|volume=v36 n1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship was described as important aspects of adult learning and the classroom was seen as an important part of their social network. The development of social networks and support was found to be a key motivation of adult learners. As editor of a book entitled Adult Education and Health, Leona English claims that including health education as part of adult education makes for a healthier community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fell-Chambers|first=Rachael|title=Adult Education and Health|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=33|issue=1|pages=111–113|doi=10.1080/02601370.2013.854448|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When surveying adult education programs in Japan, Nojima (2010) found that classes focusing on hobbies and very specific recreational activities were by far the most popular. The author noted that more time, money and resources needed to be in place so participants would be able to take advantage of these types of activities. Withnall (2006) explored the influences on later life learning in various parts in the U.K. Results were similar in that later in life education afforded these older adults opportunities to socialize.

Some experts claim that adult education has a long-term impact on the economy and that there is a correlation between innovation and learning at the workplace.&lt;ref name="Mundo-J"/&gt;

== Monitoring ==

=== Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) ===
{{Main|Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE)}}

Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) are a series of reports that monitor progress on Adult Learning and Education (ALE), promote action, identify trends in the field of ALE, and explore solutions to challenges. GRALE play a key role in meeting [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] commitment to monitor and report on countries’ implementation of the Belém Framework for Action. This Framework was adopted by 144 UNESCO Member States at the Sixth International Conference on Adult Learning and Education (CONFINTEA VI), which was held in Belém, Brazil, in 2009. In the Belém Framework for Action, countries agreed to improve ALE across five areas of action: policy; governance; financing; participation, inclusion and equity; and quality.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2010b.

1 linéa = 1/432 vara

1 pulgada = 1/86 vara

1 palmas = 1/4 vara &lt;ref name=":wmm"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Weights Measures and Money of All Nations|last = Clarke|first = F.W.|publisher = D. Appleton &amp; Company |year = 1891|location = New York|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Units after metric adoption ==
Although theoretically the metric system was compulsory, a survey in 1920 revealed the widespread use of both traditional Spanish units and US customary units (particularly in trade with the USA).&lt;ref name=":wm"&gt;{{Citation |title = Weights and Measures: Twelfth Annual Conference from Various States Held at the Bureau of Standards|last = Stratton|first = S.W|publisher = Government Printing Office|year = 1920|location = Washington|pages = 117, 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Brian the Closer'''" is the fourth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the 235th episode overall. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 9, 2014, and is written by [[Steve Marmel]] and directed by [[John Holmquist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/listings/20141013fox16/|title=(FG-1121) "Brian the Closer"|publisher=The Futon Critic|date=October 13, 2014&lt;!--Publish date is shown in URL of citation--&gt;|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Brian works for a real estate agency, which leads him into trouble with Quagmire.

==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] finds [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s old rope toy in the sofa, and Brian becomes possessive of it, making Peter jealous. One day, when the rope toy is in Brian's mouth, Peter ties it to his car and drives off. Brian trails behind the car and smashes into a [[fire hydrant]], losing all his teeth and breaking his nose severely. He is miserable without his teeth and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] refuses to spend money at the [[dentist]] to get him a new set since the procedure would be expensive and the fact that he's an animal. While having a drink with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] at The Drunken Clam, Brian starts to cry until Quagmire gives him the number to his dentist where he has an account.

When Brian returns, the family finds that the dentist has given him a prominent smile. Apprehensive about his appearance, the family offers support. Brian begins to find the new look suits him. While out for a walk, he is mistaken for a [[real estate]] agent. When the actual agent shows up, he gives Brian a job offer to join the agency called Quahog Realty. He finds himself selling lots of properties, including one to Bonnie near a cliff and one to [[Jason Voorhees]] that overlooks a camp. The owner sees how good Brian is at selling good property, so talks him to tackling a terrible condo and soon overhears that Quagmire has just received a bonus. Brian pays Quagmire back for the dental work and leads him into buying the property by convincing him it is a great investment.

After showing him the prospective video, Quagmire is still hesitant until Brian convinces him a hated rival pilot is after it. After the purchase, the guys accompany Quagmire to the property to find it is a run down dump and was completely misrepresented. Joe reveals that there is [[72-hour clause|an escape clause good for 72 hours after purchase]], but when they arrive at Quahog Realty, he is not around and it is revealed that he has ducked out to hide for the 72 hours. Taking refuge at a motel, he finds Quagmire already waiting for him. Quagmire informs Brian that his already low opinion of him has been pushed even further. Brian confesses that Quagmire may be his only friend, but it is revealed to only be a ruse to outlast the 72 hours. Because of this, an outraged Quagmire knocks Brian's teeth out with a lamp. Returning to normal life, the family consoles Brian.

==Cultural References==
While craving the rope toy, Peter becomes a [[Gollum]]-version of himself until Lois sends Peter away. Peter then returns as Johnny 5 from ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]''. The dumb beaver from "[[The Juice is Loose]]" is shown twice in the episode. Lois comments that Brian's new teeth make him look similar to [[Adam Carolla]], who is known for voicing [[Death (personification)|Death]] on the show. Brian sells a house to [[Jason Voorhees]] that overlooks a camp.

==Reception==
The episode received an audience of 3.63 million, the lowest in its timeslot, but the third-most watched show on Fox that night after ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Simpsorama]]" and ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/11/sunday-final-ratings-the-simpsons-brooklyn-nine-nine-adjusted-up/326064/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘The Simpsons’ &amp; ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ Adjusted Up |work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6634">'''''Carmen Possum''''' is a popular 80-line [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] poem written in a mix of [[Latin]] and [[English language|English]].  Its author is unknown, but the poem's theme and language enable one to surmise that he or she was from the [[United States|United States of America]] and was either a teacher or at least a student of Latin.

The poem's title represents a multilingual play on words:  ''Possum'' is Latin for "I can"/"I am able to" and colloquial English for "[[opossum]]."  While ''carmen possum'' sounds like a [[Well-formed formula|well-formed]] Latin phrase to untrained ears, its meaning in context reveals that at least this instance of it is not:  On one hand, the only even arguably correct Latin construction translates as "I am capable of song" (with "of" here constituting not a stand-alone preposition but rather a portion of an English [[phrasal verb]]), satisfying (if only barely) the requirements of syntax at the expense of replacing the title's clearly intended semantic content with a clearly unintended counterpart.  On the other, the fact that a proper translation of "Song of [the] Opossum" into Latin would involve a non-nominative, usually genitive, construction ([''o'']''poss'''i''''' rather than [''o'']''possum'') shows that one cannot read the title as having the semantic content clearly intended by its author without also disregarding syntactic rules' constraints on the title's permissible meanings or at least presuming the title's author to have violated those rules when writing it.

The poem can be used as a pedagogical device for elementary Latin teaching. The language mix includes vocabulary, morphology (''turnus'') and grammar (''trunkum longum'').

'''''Carmen Possum''''' is also an unpublished musical piece by [[Normand Lockwood]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder, ''Guide to the Normand Lockwood Collection, 1921-1996'', Subseries C: Miscellaneous Music by Normand Lockwood, Box No. 5.

== The poem ==

:THE NOX was lit by lux of Luna,
:And 'twas a nox most opportuna
:To catch a possum or a coona;
:For nix was scattered o'er this mundus,
:A shallow nix, et non profundus.
:On sic a nox with canis unus,
:Two boys went out to hunt for coonus.
:The corpus of this bonus canis
:Was full as long as octo span is,
:But brevior legs had canis never
:Quam had hic dog; et bonus clever.
:Some used to say, in stultum jocum
:Quod a field was too small locum
:For sic a dog to make a turnus
:Circum self from stem to sternus.
:Unus canis, duo puer,
:Nunquam braver, nunquam truer,
:Quam hoc trio nunquam fuit,
:If there was I never knew it.
:This bonus dog had one bad habit,
:Amabat much to tree a rabbit,
:Amabat plus to chase a rattus,
:Amabat bene tree a cattus.
:But on this nixy moonlight night
:This old canis did just right.
:Nunquam treed a starving rattus,
:Nunquam chased a starving cattus,
:But sucurrit on, intentus
:On the track and on the scentus,
:Till he trees a possum strongum,
:In a hollow trunkum longum.
:Loud he barked in horrid bellum,
:Seemed on terra vehit pellum.
:Quickly ran the duo puer
:Mors of possum to secure.
:Quam venerit, one began
:To chop away like quisque man.
:Soon the axe went through the truncum
:Soon he hit it all kerchunkum;
:Combat deepens, on ye braves!
:Canis, pueri et staves
:As his powers non longius carry,
:Possum potest non pugnare.
:On the nix his corpus lieth.
:Down to Hades spirit flieth,
:Joyful pueri, canis bonus,
:Think him dead as any stonus.
:Now they seek their pater's domo,
:Feeling proud as any homo,
:Knowing, certe, they will blossom
:Into heroes, when with possum
:They arrive, narrabunt story,
:Plenus blood et plenior glory.
:Pompey, David, Samson, Caesar,
:Cyrus, Black Hawk, Shalmanezer!
:Tell me where est now the gloria,
:Where the honors of victoria?
:Nunc a domum narrent story,
:Plenus sanguine, tragic, gory.
:Pater praiseth, likewise mater,
:Wonders greatly younger frater.
:Possum leave they on the mundus,
:Go themselves to sleep profundus,
:Somniunt possums slain in battle,
:Strong as ursae, large as cattle.
:When nox gives way to lux of morning,
:Albam terram much adorning,
:Up they jump to see the varmin,
:Of the which this is the carmen.
:Lo! possum est resurrectum!
:Ecce pueri dejectum,
:Ne relinquit back behind him,
:Et the pueri never find him.
:Cruel possum! bestia vilest,
:How the pueros thou beguilest!
:Pueri think non plus of Caesar,
:Go ad Orcum, Shalmanezer,
:Take your laurels, cum the honor,
:Since ista possum is a goner!

==Analysis==

The poem is written from a third-person omniscient perspective in rhyming [[iambic tetrameter]], with turns of phrase satirising [[Homer]]ian [[epic poetry|epic]].  It chronicles the adventures of two [[boy]]s who go out [[hunting]] for an [[opossum]] or [[raccoon]] on a snowy night, taking their [[Dachshund]] [[dog]] to assist them in running down the [[Game (hunting)|quarry]].  Although the dog was often mocked for its disproportionate length (eight spans or seventy [[inch]]es) and love of chasing [[rabbits]], [[cats]], and [[rats]], it performs flawlessly on the night, bringing the quarry (an [[opossum]]) to ground in a long, hollow [[Trunk (botany)|log]].

The boys run quickly to secure the death of the opossum, chopping at the tree to bring it down.  They declare the hunt finished, leave the opossum carcass on the ground, and go home, filled with pride.  As they tell the story of their hunt, they are praised by their parents and younger brother, and fall asleep, dreaming of opossums as strong as bears and as large as cattle.  Early the next morning, the two boys go to see their quarry, but it had presumably merely been injured rather than killed, and is now gone.  They never find the opossum and are dejected.

The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as [[Stone Island]], [[CP Company]], [[L'alpina]], [[Lacoste]], [[Sergio Tacchini]], [[Fila (company)|Fila]] and [[Ellesse]] in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals.{{cn|date=July 2018}} They did not wear club colours, so it was allegedly easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter [[pub]]s. Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by [[Mod (subculture)|mods]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as ''[[I.D. (1995 film)|ID]]'', ''[[The Firm (1989 film)|The Firm]]'' and ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
The designer clothing and fashion aspect of the casual subculture began in the mid-to-late 1970s.  One well documented precursor was the trend of Liverpool youths starting to dress differently from  other football fans — in [[Peter Storm (clothing)|Peter Storm]] jackets, straight-leg jeans and [[Adidas]] [[Athletic shoe|trainers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allt|first1=Nicholas|title=The Boys From The Mersey|date=2004|publisher=MILO|isbn=1 903854 39 3|pages=39–54|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans were the first British football fans to wear continental European fashions, which they picked up while following their teams at matches in Europe.&lt;ref name="bbc website"&gt;{{cite news|title=bbc-british style genius|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/britishstylegenius/content/22265.shtml|accessdate=2013-08-19|date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other documented precursor, according to Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as ''Perry Boys'', which originated in the mid-1970s as a precursor to the casuals. The Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, [[Fred Perry#Clothing label|Fred Perry]] shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Muslim countries also use a [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Workweek_and_weekend#Saturday.E2.80.93Sunday_weekend|some countries]] observe Sunday as a non-working day.

==Language==
In the late 7th and 8th centuries, Muslims encountered [[Levant]]ine Christians. The cognate [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word ''sahedo'' may have influenced the Arabic ''shahid'' (martyr-witness).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Wicker, Council on Christian Approaches to Defence and Disarmament. ''Witnesses to faith?: martyrdom in Christianity and Islam'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Abbasid]] dynasty, translations of the gospels from Syriac into Arabic were made, particularly by historian [[Bar-Hebraeus]], at the request of the Arab governor.

==Art==

Roman and Byzantine styles were particularly prevalent in early Islamic architecture. One of the examples is the [[Dome of the Rock]] (late 7th century) in Jerusalem. Its design is derived from Roman architecture.&lt;ref name="IAA"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..is045900.a#FWNE.fw..is045900.a Islamic art and architecture] History.com&lt;/ref&gt; Madrasa-Mausoleum of Sultan Al Nasir Muhammad in [[Cairo]] has a Gothic doorway from [[Acre (city)|Acre]], reused as a trophy.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;Carole Hillenbrand. ''The Crusades: Islamic perspectives'', Routledge, 2000, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The former Christian cathedral Madrasat al-Halawiyya in [[Aleppo]], probably taken by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], featured an altar.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; The [[Masjid Al Aqsa|Aqsa Mosque]] has a sculpted ornament, taken from Crusader structures of the 12th century, in the arches of the facade.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; The upper double capital of the mosque on twisted columns expresses the unity of nature in a characteristic [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.

After the [[fall of Constantinople]], the [[Ottomans]] converted a major [[basilica]], [[Hagia Sophia]], to a mosque and incorporated [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architectural elements into their own work, such as [[dome]]s. This was a part of the [[conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques]]. The Hagia Sophia also served as model for many Ottoman mosques, such as the Shehzadeh Mosque, the Suleiman Mosque and the Rüstem Pasha Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-architecture.info/A-HIST.htm Islamic architectural history] Islamic-architecture.info&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Christological]] motifs could be found in the works of [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], [[Rumi]] and others. Islamic artists applied Christian patterns for [[iconography]]. The picture of the birth of [[Muhammad]] in [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid ad-Din]]'s ''Jami at-Tarawikh'' is reminiscent of the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Arnold. ''Painting in Islam: a study of the place of pictorial art in Muslim culture'', Gorgias Press LLC, 2004, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The angels, hovering over the mother, correspond to a Christian type, while the three women, who came to visit the mother, conform to the three [[Biblical Magi]]. Some surviving [[Ayyubid]] inlaid brasses feature [[Gospel]] scenes and images of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; References to the [[Annunciation]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]] are manifest in al-Athar al-Baqiyah, where the Virgin is depicted in accordance with her representation in [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The frescoes of [[Samarra]], painted between 836 and 883, also suggest the Christian craft because of the Christian priests who are the subjects and the signatures of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Christianity in science in the medieval Islamic world ==
[[Christians]] especially [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads]] and the [[Abbasids]] by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald. ''Islamic Science and Engineering''. 1993. Edinburgh Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-7486-0455-3}}, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; They also excelled in [[philosophy]], [[science]] (such as [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[Masawaiyh]], [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Patriarch Eutychius]], [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]] etc) and [[theology]] (such as [[Tatian]], [[Bar Daisan]], [[Babai the Great]], [[Nestorius]], [[Toma bar Yacoub]] etc.) and the personal [[physicians]] of the Abbasid Caliphs were often [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] such as the long serving [[Bukhtishu]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Rémi Brague, [http://www.christiansofiraq.com/assyriancontributionstotheislamiccivilization.htm Assyrians contributions to the Islamic civilization]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409819/Nestorian Nestorian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Christianity in medicine in the medieval Islamic world ==
[[File:Manafe.jpg|thumb|200px|Ibn Bakhtishu's ''Manafi' al-Hayawan'' ('''منافع الحيوان''' ), dated 12th century. Captions appear in Persian language.]]
A hospital and medical training center existed at [[Gundeshapur]]. The city of [[Gundeshapur]] was founded in 271 by the Sassanid king [[Shapur I]]. It was one of the major cities in [[Khuzestan]] province of the Persian empire in what is today [[Iran]]. A large percentage of the population were [[Syriac Christians|Syriacs]], most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of [[Khosrau I]], refuge was granted to [[Greece|Greek]] [[Nestorian Christian]] philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] ([[Urfa]])(also called the Academy of [[Athens]]), a [[Christian]] theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences 22:2'' Mehmet Mahfuz Söylemez, ''The Jundishapur School: Its History, Structure, and Functions'', p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Marlow Taylor, ''The Physicians of Gundeshapur'', (University of California, Irvine), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daud al-Antaki]] was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers.

==Christian merchants and the Silk Trade==
[[File:Vank Cathedral interior.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Vank Cathedral]]. The Armenians moved into the [[Jolfa district]] of Isfahan and were free to build their prayer houses, eventually becoming an integral part of the society.]]
The one valuable item, sought for in Europe, which Iran possessed and which could bring in silver in sufficient quantities was silk, which was produced in the northern provinces, along the Caspian coastline. The trade of this product was done by Persians to begin with, but during the 17th century the Christian [[Armenians]] became increasingly vital in the trade of this merchandise, as middlemen.&lt;ref name="Blow; p. 213"&gt;Blow; p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas domestic trade was largely in the hands of Persian and Jewish merchants, by the late 17th century, almost all foreign trade was controlled by the [[Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;Savory; p. 195-8&lt;/ref&gt; They were even hired by wealthy Persian merchants to travel to Europe when they wanted to create commercial bases there, and the Armenians eventually established themselves in cities like [[Bursa]], [[Aleppo]], Venice, Livorno, Marseilles and Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Blow; p. 213"/&gt; Realizing this, Shah Abbas resettled large numbers of Armenians from the [[Caucasus]] to his capital city and provided them with loans.&lt;ref name="Blow; p. 213"/&gt; And as the shah realized the importance of doing trade with the Europeans, he assured that the Safavid society was one with religious tolerance. The Christian Armenians thus became a commercial elite in the Safavid society and managed to survive in the tough atmosphere of business being fought over by the British, Dutch, French, Indians and Persians, by always having large capital readily available and by managing to strike harder bargains ensuring cheaper prices than what, for instance, their British rivals ever were able to.&lt;ref&gt;Savory; p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
Immediately after the [[Conquest of Constantinople]], [[Mehmet II]] deported all the Christian population of the City, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of Balat.&lt;ref name=ma98&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he repopulated the city bringing inhabitants  &amp;ndash; both Christian and Muslim &amp;ndash; from the whole empire and from the newly conquered territories.&lt;ref name=ma98/&gt; Phanar was then repopulated with Greeks deported from Mouchlion in the [[Peloponnese]] and, [[Trabzon#Ancient and medieval|after 1461]], with citizens of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]].&lt;ref name=ma99&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of [[Greeks|Greek]] ascendancy can be traced to the need of the [[Ottomans]] for skilled and educated negotiators as the power of their empire declined and they were compelled to rely on treaties more than the force of arms. From the 17th century onwards the [[Ottomans]] began facing problems in the conduct of their foreign relations, and were having difficulties in dictating terms to their neighbours; the Porte was faced for the first time with the need of participating in diplomatic negotiations.

Given the Ottoman tradition of generally ignoring [[Western Europe]]an languages and cultures, officials found themselves unable to handle such affairs. The Porte subsequently assigned those tasks to the Greeks who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and could provide the necessary skills. As a result, the so−called ''Phanariotes'', Greek and Hellenized families mostly native to [[Constantinople]], came to occupy high posts of secretaries and interpreters to Ottoman officials and officers.

Some of the most influential Arab nationalists were [[Arab]] Christians, like [[George Habash]], founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and [[Syrian]] intellectual [[Constantin Zureiq]]. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 1992. The suicide bomber [[Jules Jammal]], a Syrian military officer who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian. While [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Maronite Christian]] were among the Masters and Fathers of the Arabic Renaissance ''[[Al-Nahda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adnan A. Musallam, [http://admusallam.bethlehem.edu/publications/EndofTheOttomanEra.htm Arab Press, Society and Politics at the End of The Ottoman Era]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today [[Christianity in the Middle East|Middle Eastern Christians]] are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-belt/pope-to-arab-christians-k_b_203943.html Pope to Arab Christians: Keep the Faith.]&lt;/ref&gt; as they have today an active role in various social, economical, sporting and political aspects in the Middle East.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">'''Civil inattention''' is the process whereby strangers who are in close proximity demonstrate that they are aware of one another, without imposing on each other – a recognition of the claims of others to a public space, and of their own [[personal boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Finkelstein, ''The Art of Self-Invention'' (2007) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Civil inattention is the term introduced by [[Erving Goffman]] to describe the care taken to maintain public order among strangers and thus to make anonymised life in cities possible.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than either ignoring or staring at others, civil inattention involves the unobtrusive and peaceful scanning of others so as to allow for neutral interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Baldwin, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'' (2004) p. 396 and 276&lt;/ref&gt; Through brief [[eye contact]] with an approaching stranger, we both acknowledge their presence and foreclose the possibility of more personal contact or of  [[conversation]].

Civil inattention is thus a means of making [[privacy]] possible within a crowd through culturally accepted forms of self-distancing.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Finkelstein, ''The Art of Self-Invention'' (2007) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Seemingly (though not in reality) effortless,&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; such civility is a way of shielding others from personal claims in public&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sennett, ''The Fall of Public Man'' (1976) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; – an essential feature of the abstract, impersonal relationships demanded by the [[open society]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The Open Society and its Enemies Vol 1'' (1995) p. 174-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative aspects==
Civil inattention can lead to feelings of [[loneliness]] or [[invisibility]], and it reduces the tendency to feel responsibility for the well-being of others. Newcomers to [[urban area]]s are often struck by the impersonality of such routines, which they may see as callous and uncaring, rather than as necessary for the peaceful co-existence of close-packed millions.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Moretti, ''Modern Epic'' (1996) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffman noted that "when men and women cross each other's path at close quarters, the male will exercise the right to look for a second or two at the female ... Civil inattention, then, can here involve a degree of role differentiation regarding obligations".&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p.  249&lt;/ref&gt; Such a public [[double standard]] has been challenged by [[feminists]], who resent the expectation that female appearance/behavior may be routinely commented on.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron, ''Feminism and Linguistic Theory'' (1992) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior may then escalate into staring, [[stalking]] and insulting harassment, revealing the costs a breach of civil inattention may bring.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Baldwin, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'' (2004) p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insanity of place===
Goffman saw many classic indications of madness as violations of the norm of civil inattention speaking to strangers, or shying away from every passing glance.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=March 2016}}

The '''culture of [[Lebanon]]''' and the [[Lebanese people]] emerged from various civilizations over thousands of years. It was home to the [[Phoenicia]]ns and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], the [[Arabs]], the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], the [[Ottoman Turks]] and the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French]]. This variety is reflected in Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country's festivals, musical styles, literature, [[cuisine of Lebanon]] and [[architecture of Lebanon]]. [[Tourism in Lebanon]] is popular with periods of interruption during conflict.

Despite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Jamie page 406"&gt;Stokes, Jamie.  ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', page 406&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on Article 11 of the [[Constitution of Lebanon]] states: "[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the [[French language|French]] language is to be used." The spoken [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]] is the language used in public which is a hybrid of the languages of the above-mentioned cultures, Food, music, and literature are deep-rooted “in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms”.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Jamie page 406"/&gt;

The hilly Mediterranean [[Geography of Lebanon]] has played a role in shaping the [[history of Lebanon]] and its culture. [[Archaeology of Lebanon]] is conducted to explore the area's past.

==Arts==
By the turn of the 20th century, Beirut was vying with Cairo to be the major center for modern Arab thought, with many newspapers, magazines and literary societies.  Additionally, Beirut became a thriving epicenter of Armenian culture with varied productions&lt;ref&gt;Migliorino, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  that was exported to the Armenian diaspora.

===Visual arts===
[[Mustafa Farroukh]] was one of Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 19th century. Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaftoun.com/component/content/article/197-moustafa-farroukh/358-moustafa-farroukh |title=Moustafa Farroukh |publisher=Kaftoun.com |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307122305/http://www.kaftoun.com/component/content/article/197-moustafa-farroukh/358-moustafa-farroukh |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art===
Contemporary art started in Beirut immediately after the end of the civil war (1975-1991).

Many contemporary artists are currently active, such as [[Walid Raad]], a contemporary media artist currently residing in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/raad/biography/ |title=Media Art Net &amp;#124; Ra’ad, Walid: Biography |publisher=Medienkunstnetz.de |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025450/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/raad/biography/ |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Architecture of Lebanon}}

Architecture in Lebanon includes the legacies of various occupying powers including the Romans, Phoenicians, Ottomans and French, as well as post independence developments.

When the Ottomans exiled [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhreddine]] to [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]] in 1613, he entered an alliance with the [[Medicis]]. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gh8ZrZRKaRwC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Syria &amp; Lebanon&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |publisher= books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|author1=Carter, Terry| author2= Dunston, Lara|author3=Humphreys, Andrew|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]] were especially built in the Italianate style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AylB2M5DjaoC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Warlords and merchants: the Lebanese ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-0-86372-297-4|author1=Dib, Kamal|author2=Dīb, Kamāl|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the [[Renaissance]] when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified [[Mount Lebanon]] with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.

The influence of these buildings, such as the ones in [[Deir el Qamar]], influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like [[Rue Gouraud]] continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308022752/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |archivedate=2009-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings like the [[Sursock Museum|Nicolas Sursock mansion]] on [[Rue Sursock]], which is today a major museum, attest{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in [[Lebanon]].

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Lebanon}}
Cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=Arab filmmakers of the Middle East: a dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHT8LjR_kC4C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=23 August 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35518-8|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films,&lt;ref&gt;Harabi, Najib (University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland)  [http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf Knowledge Intensive Industries: Four Case Studies of Creative Industries in Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000044/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf |date=2013-01-17 }}, World Bank Project (May 2009) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are:

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of Lebanon}}
Lebanese theatre has its origin in [[passion play]]s.  The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Reed Stone|title=Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EdxrNmDE1UC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77273-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.&lt;ref&gt;Badawī, Muḥammad Muṣṭafá. ''Modern Arabic Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt ===
The cultural relations between Lebanon and [[Egypt]] is considered a unique kind of cultural historical relations, Because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian [[culture]]s, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism, all of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that's what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World . Which is held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and in the presence of the Lebanese Ambassador in Egypt, [[Madeleine Tabar]] and Ahmed Ghanem founder of cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World  and an elite of Lebanese artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-balad.com/761416|title=سفير لبنان بالقاهرة : حريصون على تدعيم أواصر التعاون مع مصر|author=|date=|website=el-balad.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405104551/http://www.el-balad.com/761416|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
Many Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear European style clothes. In the countryside, women sometimes wear traditional colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the [[folk culture]]. Today, almost all Lebanese wear Western clothing.

Famous names in the Lebanese fashion industry include [[Elie Saab]], [[Zuhair Murad]], Reem Acra, and [[Rabih Kayrouz]].

==Holidays and festivals==
[[File:Beiteddine Palace InnerCourtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Beiteddine Palace]], venue of the [[Beiteddine Festival]]]]
{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}
Lebanon celebrates national holidays and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays.

Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar.  Maronites, [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar.

Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura. Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.&lt;ref name = "Festivals"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|author2=Latif  |others=Zawiah|title=Lebanon|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Children's Books|date=30 August 2007|series=Cultures of the World|volume=13|page=123|chapter=Leisure|isbn=978-0-7614-2081-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cA-RDzlwVVAC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most famous are [[Baalbeck International Festival]], [[Byblos International Festival]], [[Beiteddine Festival|Beiteddine International Festival]], Broumana Festival, Batroun Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.&lt;ref name="Festivals" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Terry|author2=Dunston Lara|others= Humphreys Andrew|title=Syria &amp; Lebanon|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=1 August 2004|edition=2|series=Guidebook Series|page=11|chapter=Getting Started|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EskzgI-229IC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's [[Ministry of Tourism (Lebanon)|Ministry of Tourism]], Lebanon Hosts about 15 Concerts from International Performers Each Year Ranking Number one for Nightlife in the Middle east and 6th Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|title=Lebanon Summer &amp; Winter Festivals|work=Lebanese Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=19 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722145040/http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Lebanese cuisine}}
[[File:Yoghurt and Hummus at Moroccan Soup Bar.jpg|thumb|right|230px|An array of Lebanese cuisine.]]

Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]].

The Lebanese national dishes are the [[kibbe]], a meat pie made from finely minced [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[burghul]] (cracked [[wheat]]), and the [[tabbouleh]], a salad made from [[parsley]], [[tomato]]es, and burghul. The national beverage is [[Arak (drink)|arak]], a strong [[anise]]-flavored liquor made from fermented [[grape juice]]. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.

Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of [[mezze]] - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled [[meat]] or [[fish]]. In general, meals are finished with [[Arabic coffee]] and fresh [[fruit]], though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.

[[M'Juhdara]], a thick stew of [[onions]], [[rice]], and [[lentils]], is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around [[Lent]] by people in the Lebanese diaspora.

Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, [[wine]] is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the [[Bekaa valley]] and elsewhere. [[Beer]] is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which [[almaza]] is perhaps the most popular.

===Food in daily life===
Lebanese cuisine is influenced by other Mediterranean cuisines. [[Pita bread]] is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy [[hummus]] (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. [[Rice]] is nearly a staple, and [[pasta]] is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. [[Red meat]] and chicken are common but are usually eaten as part of a dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Saint Barbara, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. [[Wine]] is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

==Society==
{{main|Lebanese society}}

Lebanese society is similar to certain cultures of [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean Europe]] as the country is "linked ideologically and culturally to Europe through France, and its uniquely diverse religious composition [create] a rare environment that [is] at once Arab and European.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Craig S. ''The Middle East For Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often considered as Europe's gateway to Western Asia as well as Asia's gateway to the Western World.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanon Culture. [http://hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ hangoverguide.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402060253/http://www.hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ |date=2012-04-02 }}, 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-sex groups of youth are very common especially in Verdun, [[Hamra Street]], [[Ashrafieh]], and [[Beirut Central District|downtown Beirut]] as well as other places. Premarital physical sexual relations are very common, although intercourse is frowned upon and avoided by both Muslim and Christian girls.

The contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 58%, of which 34% modern contraceptives, primarily IUDs, pills and condoms.&lt;ref name="unfpa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|title=UNFPA Lebanon - Country Profile|author=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org.lb|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919052311/http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|archivedate=19 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in Lebanon]] is nominally legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prostitution – The business of sex|publisher= Executive Magazine|date= |url= http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|accessdate= 2014-10-22|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141106130624/http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|archivedate= 2014-11-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison to most other Arab capitals, Beirut is more [[westernized]] and more [[culturally liberal]]. Compared to [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]], and [[Baghdad]], and especially in contrast to such cities as [[Riyadh]], Beirut is more tolerant with regard to relations between men and women, and also with regard to [[homosexuality]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, [[Lebanese women]] enjoy equal [[civil rights]] and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties.

While gay sex does not enjoy wide acceptance, Beirut has a number of gay bars and nightclubs, in addition to five LGBT rights organizations, namely Helem, Arab Foundation for Equality (AFE), Nasawiya-Feminist Collecrive, Proud Lebanon, and Mosaïque.  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Dalle de verre''', from French: "glass slab", is a [[glass art]] technique that uses pieces of coloured glass set in a matrix of [[concrete]] and [[epoxy|epoxy resin]] or other supporting material. 

==Technique==
The technique was developed by [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] in Paris in the 1930s. Slabs of coloured glass, {{convert|20|cm|inch}} to {{convert|30|cm|inch}} square or rectangular and typically up to {{convert|3|cm|inch}} thick, are shaped by breaking with a hammer or cutting with a saw. The edges of the resulting pieces may be chipped or faceted to increase the [[refraction]] and [[Specular reflection|reflection]] effects.

The pieces are laid out to a design, similar to traditional [[stained-glass]] work. The pieces are laid on a bed of sand, bounded by a wooden casting frame. A matrix material, sand and cement or epoxy resin, is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The visible glass faces are then cleaned and the resulting solid panel can be relocated, embedded or hung as required.

The use of thicker glass produces deeper colour effects than traditional [[lead]] [[came]] stained-glass, especially when illuminated by bright natural or artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vitraildutemple.free.fr/realisations/dalle.html |title= La dalle de verre |language=french |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osvaldsstainedglass.com/portfolio/dalle-de-verre-technique/| title=Dalle de Verre Technique |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique achieved prominence in the stained glass literature of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |first=Lacey |last=Bubnash |work=Thesis Abstract |title=Dalle de Verre / Faceted Glass: New Approaches to a Modern Material |publisher=[[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|School of Architecture]], [[Columbia University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510140934/http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Problems and conservation==
The resulting works may be subject to structural problems over time and, just like more traditional stained glass works, pose challenges to conservators and restorers.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"/&gt;

==Dalle de verre in the UK==
Dalle de verre was brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux who joined [[James Powell and Sons]] (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956 and trained [[Dom Charles Norris]] in the technique. Norris was a Dominican Friar who went on to become arguably the most prolific British proponent of dalle de verre. His work is incorporated in several Modernist listed Catholic churches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4006">'''Domestic trade''', also known as '''internal trade''' , is the exchange of domestic goods within the boundaries of a country. This may be sub-divided into two categories, '''[[wholesale]]''' and '''[[retail]]'''. Wholesale trade is concerned with buying goods from manufacturers or dealers or producers in large quantities and selling them in smaller quantities to others who may be retailers or even [[consumer]]s. Wholesale trade is undertaken by wholesale merchants or wholesale commission agents. 

Retail trade is concerned with the sale of goods in small quantities to consumers. This type of trade is taken care of by retailers. In actual practice, however, [[manufacturer]]s and wholesalers may also undertake retail distribution of goods to bypass the intermediary retailer, by which they earn higher [[Profit (economics)|profits]].

==Importance and Role==

The importance of domestic trade in a country is that it facilitates exchange of goods within the country. By doing this it also makes sure that factors of production reach to the right places so that the [[economy]] of the country can grow. By allowing all different types of goods and services to reach to all parts of the country it improves the [[standard of living]] of the residents of the country as well as the [[employment rate]] of the country. And it helps the growth of an industry by ensuring the availability of [[raw material]]s. 

Traders from outside the country will have to come in contact with internal traders, because it is not easy to come directly into another country and get the required products.

[[File:Different-Types-of-Trade1.png]]

==Wholesale trade==
Wholesalers play a major role in working of domestic trade. One could even say that it is the backbone of the domestic market. A wholesaler  is directly in contact with the manufacturers but in indirect contact with the consumers. A wholesaler generally deals with one type of industry. e.g. [[machinery]], [[textile]], [[stationery]]. A wholesaler is not only into selling of products as it is also involved in [[packaging]], [[advertising]], grading, and [[market research]]. They have their own go downs which saves the manufacturers from bothering about storage. They normally make cash payments from retailers and sometimes consumers themselves and give advance payments which benefits the manufacturers. They sell in smaller quantities to retailers, which refrains the retailers from requiring storage space. They do allow credit facilities to retailers at times. For example as we see that Bhija one of the great wholesalers usually get information documents from retailers.

==Retail trade==

A retailer is normally the final seller of a product. It makes its purchases made from Wholesalers and sales are made to the customers directly. Retailers do not  particularly have to be from one industry i.e. they can trade in a variety of products at the same time. It generally has purchases made by credit and sales made in cash.

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Pierre-Bourdieu-cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu noted [[cultural capital]] as a means of social mobility, which is diminished by the processes of dumbing down.]] --&gt;
'''Dumbing down''' is the deliberate [[oversimplification]] of [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] content in [[education]], [[literature]], and [[film|cinema]], [[news]], [[video games]] and [[culture]]. The term "dumbing down" originated in 1933, as movie-business slang used by screenplay writers, meaning: "[to] revise so as to appeal to those of little education or intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Algeo|first=John|first2=Adele|last2=Algeo|year=1988 |title=Among the New Words |journal=American Speech |volume=63 |issue=4|pages=235–236|doi=10.1215/00031283-78-3-331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumbing-down varies according to subject matter, and usually involves the diminishment of [[critical thought]], by undermining intellectual standards within [[standard language|language]] and [[learning standards|learning]]; thus trivializing meaningful information, culture, and academic standards, as in the case of [[popular culture]].

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002) proposed that, in a society in which the [[Cultural hegemony|cultural practices]] of the [[ruling class]] are rendered and established as the [[Dominant ideology|legitimate culture]] of that society, that action then devalues the [[cultural capital]] of the subordinate social classes, and thus limits their [[social mobility]] within their own society.

==Education==
In the late 20th century, the proportion of young people attending university in the UK increased sharply, including many who previously would not have been considered to possess the appropriate scholastic aptitude. In 2003, the UK Minister for Universities, [[Margaret Hodge]], criticised [[Mickey Mouse degrees]] as a negative consequence of universities dumbing down their courses to meet "the needs of the market": these are degrees conferred for studies in a field of endeavour "where the content is perhaps not as [intellectually] rigorous as one would expect, and where the degree, itself, may not have huge relevance in the labour market": thus, a university degree of slight intellectual substance, which the student earned by "simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses, is not acceptable".&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2655127.stm |title='Irresponsible' Hodge under fire |website=BBC News: World Edition |date=14 January 2003 |access-date=24 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Donald |last=MacLeod |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityaccess/story/0,,1527877,00.html |title=50% higher education target doomed, says thinktank |website=The Guardian |date=14 July 2005 |access-date=24 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Wellington Grey, a high school [[physics]] instructor in London, published an [[Internet petition]] objecting to what he described as a dumbed-down curriculum. He wrote: "I am a physics teacher. Or, at least, I used to be"; and complained that "[Mathematical] calculations&amp;nbsp;– the very soul of physics&amp;nbsp;– are absent from the new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6244942.stm|work=BBC News|title=Physicists protest at GCSE change|date=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the examples of dumbing-down that he provided were: "Question: Why would radio stations broadcast digital signals, rather than analogue signals? Answer: Can be processed by computer/ipod" to "Question: Why must we develop renewable energy sources?" (a political question).

In ''[[Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling]]'' (1991, 2002), [[John Taylor Gatto]] presented speeches and essays, including "The Psychopathic School", his acceptance speech for the 1990 New York City Teacher of the Year award, and "The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher", his acceptance speech upon being named as the New York State Teacher of the Year for 1991.&lt;ref name=Gatto&gt;{{cite web |last=Blumenfeld |first=Samuel L. |date=May 1993 |title=''The Blumenfeld Education Letter'' - May 1993: ''Dumbing Us Down: the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling'' By John Taylor Gatto |website=The Odysseus Group |publisher=[[John Taylor Gatto]] |url=http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/bookstore/dumbdnblum1.htm |access-date=23 February 2009 |archive-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711165314/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/bookstore/dumbdnblum1.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatto writes that while he was hired to teach English and literature, he came to believe he was employed as part of a [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] project. The "seven lessons" at the foundation of schooling were never explicitly stated, Gatto writes, but included teaching students that their self-worth depended on outside evaluation; that they were constantly ranked and supervised; and that they had no opportunities for privacy or solitude. Gatto speculated:

{{Quotation|Was it possible, I had been hired, not to enlarge children's power, but to diminish it? That seemed crazy, on the face of it, but slowly, I began to realize that the bells and confinement, the crazy sequences, the age-segregation, the lack of privacy, the constant surveillance, and all the rest of the national [[curriculum]] of schooling were designed exactly as if someone had set out to prevent children from learning how to think, and act, to coax them into addiction and dependent behavior.&lt;ref name=Gatto/&gt;}}

In examining the seven lessons of teaching, Gatto concluded that "all of these lessons are prime training for permanent [[underclass]]es, people deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius." That "school is a twelve-year jail sentence, where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned. I teach school, and win awards doing it. I should know."&lt;ref name=Gatto/&gt;

==Mass communications media==
{{see also|Media culture|Sensationalism}}
Increased business competition and the introduction of [[econometric]] methods changed the business practices of the [[mass media|mass communications media]]. The business monopoly practice of [[media consolidation]] reduced the breadth and the depth of the [[journalism]] practiced and provided for the information of the public. The reduction of operating costs (overhead expenses) eliminated foreign news bureaus and reporters, in favour of presenting the [[public relations]] publications ([[news release]]s) of governments, businesses, and political parties as fact.

Refinements in measurement of approval ratings and audience size increased the incentive for journalists and TV producers to write [[simplistic]] material, diminishing the intellectual complexity of the argument presented, usually at the expense of factual accuracy and rationality. Cultural theorists, such as [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Henry Giroux]], and [[Pierre Bourdieu]], invoked these effects as evidence that [[commercial television]] is an especially pernicious contributor to the dumbing-down of communications. Nonetheless, the cultural critic [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] said that the people responsible for teaching critical thinking&amp;nbsp;– parents and academic instructors&amp;nbsp;– can improve the quality (breadth and depth) of their instruction by occasionally including television programmes.

In France, [[Michel Houellebecq]] has written (not excluding himself) of "the shocking dumbing-down of French culture and intellect as was recently pointed out, [2008] sternly but fairly, by ''TIME'' magazine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard-Henri |last1=Lévy |author1-link=Bernard-Henri Lévy |first2=Michel |last2=Houellebecq |author2-link=Michel Houellebecq |translator1-first=Miriam |translator1-last=Frendo |translator2-first=Frank |translator2-last=Wynne |title=Public Enemies: Dueling Writers Take on Each Other and the World |date=2011 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |pages=3-4 |oclc=326529237 |isbn=978-0-8129-8078-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In computer software and device use ==
[[Software]] used on computers and mobile devices, can do complex tasks sometimes requiring users to have a lot of technical knowledge''.'' Similarly, user operated devices,  such as a washing machine or a camera, perform many complex operations. A lot of effort has been put into making these easier to use. Sometimes by use of good ergonomics, known as [[usability]]. And sometimes by removing some of the choices and functionality available.  The process of reducing the functionality is often known as dumbing down. For some users, this removes confusing barriers and gives them confidence to use the software or device. For others, the missing functionality may be frustrating and too restrictive. 

Replacing a user operated function with an automatic function that achieves the same result would not be considered dumbing down. However, any loss of flexibility in this automation would be the actual dumbing down.    

An example of dumbing down in software is where an email application on a smartphone or tablet computer may lack certain functions which are available on a desktop computer, such as the ability to create email folders or email rules.

==In popular culture==
The science fiction film ''[[Idiocracy]]'' (2005) portrays the U.S. as a greatly dumbed-down society 500 years in the future, in which  [[low culture|low cultural]] and [[Philistinism]] were unintentionally achieved by eroding language and education coupled with [[dysgenics]], where people of lower [[IQ|intelligence]] reproduced  faster than the  people of higher intelligence. Similar concepts appeared in earlier works, notably the [[science fiction]] short story ''[[The Marching Morons]]'' (1951), by [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] which also features a modern-day protagonist in a future dominated by low-intelligence persons. Moreover, the novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1931), by [[Aldous Huxley]], discussed the ways a [[utopian]] society was deliberately dumbed down in order to maintain [[political stability]] and [[social order]] by eliminating complex concepts unnecessary for society to function (e.g., the Savage tries reading Shakespeare to the masses and is not understood). More malevolent uses of dumbing down to preserve the social order are also portrayed in ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many [[dystopian movies]].

The social critic [[Paul Fussell]] touched on these themes ("prole drift") in his non-fiction book ''Class: A Guide Through the American Status System'' (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Fussell |date=1983 |title=Class: A Guide Through the American Status System |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Summit Books |oclc=9685644 |isbn=978-0-671-44991-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on them specifically in ''BAD: or, The Dumbing of America'' (1991).

The musical groups [[Chumbawamba]], [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]], [[Ugly Duckling (hip hop group)|Ugly Duckling]], and [[Lupe Fiasco]] each have a song titled "Dumb It Down".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">'''Earth from Above''' is a [[United Nations]]-supported ecological project conceived and led by [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]]. The project includes a [[Photo-essay|photo essay]]-style collection of [[aerial photography]] produced by Arthus-Bertrand, in which the photographer captured [[wikt:vista|vistas]] of [[Earth]] from various [[aircraft]] during a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speakers Yann Arthus-Bertrand: Photographer|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/yann_arthus_bertrand.html|work=TED - Ideas worth spreading|publisher=TED CONFERENCES, LLC|accessdate=4 May 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gave birth to a book also entitled ''Earth from Above'', of which millions of copies were sold.

==Background==
Arthus-Bertrand founded the Altitude Agency in 1991, the world's first press agency and [[Stock photography|image bank]] specializing in aerial photography. The agency holds 350,000 "selected images" taken in more than a hundred countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=- AGENCY -|url=http://www.altitude-photo.com//agence-en/|work=Altitude Agency|publisher=Altitude|accessdate=4 May 2012|author=Altitude Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a history of [[Environmentalism|environmental activism]], the photographer sought to exhibit his work at the [[Earth Summit|Rio Conference]] in 1992, and eventually made a decision to document the condition of planet Earth.&lt;ref name="Yann" /&gt;

==UN sponsorship==
In 1994, intent on conveying his perspective on environmental sustainability to other humans, Arthus-Bertrand successfully attained sponsorship from the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] for the purposes of a long-term photographic project entitled, "The Earth From Above, Wild Animals, Horses, and 365 Days".

==Book==
Following the Rio summit, Arthus-Bertrand subsequently created a picture inventory of landscapes from across the world with each picture, and accompanying text, encouraging the reader to be responsible in their treatment of the earth. The book from the project, ''Earth from Above'' (French: ''La terre vue du ciel''), sold several million copies and was translated into over 21 languages.&lt;ref name="Yann"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yann Arthus-Bertrand Photographer, Filmmaker, Activist, Environmentalist|url=http://pictureearth.org/yann/index.html|work=Picture Earth|publisher=Picture Earth, a not-for-profit organization|accessdate=4 May 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
As part of a series of outdoor displays, the "Earth from Above" free exhibition was set up at the gates of [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] in [[Paris]], whereby the images appeared as big posters. At the conclusion of the first decade of the 21st century, the series of public exhibitions have been seen by over 200 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOGRAPHY|url=http://www.yannarthusbertrand.org/en/biography|work=yannarthusbertrand.org|publisher=Yann Arthus-Bertrand|accessdate=4 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2007, Earth from Above was launched in a film format, broadcast on [[France Télévisions|French national television]] as a 4-episode, 8-hour television series. The series, presented by Arthus-Bertrand, has been approved for four [[Season (television)#Seasons.2Fseries|seasons]] (15 episodes) and was created over a four-year timespan.&lt;ref name="Yann" /&gt;

== Synopsis==
Encantadia is a vast and enchanted realm. It comprises three major kingdoms: Lireo, Sapiro and Hathoria and one autonomous territory, Adamya.
At the beginning, Encantadia was at peace, there was only one gemstone, the Mother Gem, given by their deity, Emre. It ensured the balance of nature in Encantadia. But greedy encantados such as a fairy named Adhara, wanted to seize the power of the gem. Also, distrust among the four territories made a fragile political climate in their realm. The other territories think that Lireo, the queendom of fairies, wield too much power since their queen and founder Cassiopeia is the keeper of the Mother Gem. They think that too much power could corrupt the fairies. To balance the powers to each kingdom and to make it harder to seize the powers all at once, the keeper of the Mother Gem, Cassiopeia, made the fateful decision and cleaved the gem. It resulted in a violent explosion and the once single gem became four parts. Each gemstone was given to the four major territories of Encantadia.
Lireo, in the east, is the matriarchal queendom of diwatas and lambanas (fairies and pixies). They cared for Brilyante ng Hangin (Gemstone of Air). It is the home of the temple of their supreme deity, Emre.
Sapiro, in the north, is the kingdom of healers and valiant warriors. They kept the Brilyante ng Lupa (Gemstone of Earth). Their land is blessed with fertile soil and minerals like no other kingdom in their world.
Hathoria, in the west, is the kingdom of militaristic miners and blacksmiths that develop weapons and war machinery. They held the Brilyante ng Apoy (Gemstone of Fire).
Adamya, in the south, is the territory of wise pacifist lamang-lupas (dwarves and hobbits). They kept the Brilyante ng Tubig (Gemstone of Water). This territory surrounded by the Adamyan Ocean, thrives in fishing and farming. It is also the only unfortified territory in Encantadia.
Cassiopeia thought that this would bring peace to their land but instead it brought chaos.
Hathoria, led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started a war to claim the other gems that they may gain power and rule over their whole world. He wanted the natural resources brought by the gemstones for the advancement of his own kingdom, firmly believing that their kingdom is more deserving to keep all the four gemstones. After seizing the Gemstone of Water from Adamya, the Hathors waged war with the Sapiro, in pursuit of the Gemstone of Earth. King Arvak seized the Gemstone of Earth from King Armeo of Sapiro before killing him. Later, King Arvak was killed by the Prince Raquim of Sapiro, Armeo's cousin. Before Arvak died, Raquim claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from Arvak's possession. The death of King Arvak weakened the Hathor force and made them retreat. But Hathoria, in retaliation, managed to massacre the Sapiryan royal family and destroy the kingdom. The kingdom of Sapiro fell and was left in ruins, its citizens scattered into different tribes in the northern mountains. Prince Raquim immediately brought the three gemstones to Queen Mine-a of Lireo, the current keeper of Gemstone of Air, for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Since then, the monarch of Lireo not only rules the kingdom but also is tasked to be the protector of the four gemstones.
Thousands of years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, when Queen Mine-a will choose her successor from her daughters, the four Sang'gres (Royal Blood Fairies), Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya. She and Imaw, an elder from Adamya, can feel imminent danger lurking, and as she is being called to Devas (the world of the blessed dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chooses and crowns Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion. Pirena's treachery set the chain of events that transpired for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the Gemstone of Fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost. Hathoria now plans to rise up from hiding and bring Lireo to its demise, with the end in view of ruling over the whole of Encantadia. Fortunately, Queen Mine-a before her death willed the remaining gemstones to her daughters. the youngest, Danaya became the keeper of the Gemstone of Earth. Her third daughter, Alena, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Water and her second daughter and new queen of Lireo, Amihan, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Air.
Pirena feigned reconciliation with her sisters after their mother's death. She hid her connivance with Hathoria from her sisters. Because of Pirena's lies and manipulations, she was successful in destroying the relationship of her sisters and usurping the throne from Amihan through the help of King Hagorn of Hathoria. But her treachery came back to her as she discovered too late that King Hagorn was just using her to gain access to the gemstones. With the Gemstone of Fire and Water back in Hathorian hands, the destined savior of Encantadia, Amihan's lost daughter, Lira, must unite the four sisters to gain back the lost gemstones and to bring balance again to their world. They will also find an ally in a warrior named Ybarro, which was later revealed to be the lost and only surviving member of the Sapiryan royal family, Prince Ibrahim, destined to unite and bring back the glory of the fallen kingdom of Sapiro. The sisters will soon learn that the greatest magic of all is forgiveness and love and that only through unity can they stop the evil that spread through their realm.
But with the Gemstone of Fire and Water under Hathorian hands, the sisters found it hard to reclaim Lireo from Hathorian rule. They will find their answer in the most unlikely of all beings. A lost human boy that was kidnapped into Encantadia named Paopao became Amihan's saviour. They shall soon discover that the boy wields an unknown Gemstone, the Gemstone of Quintessence/Soul, it was catapulted during the explosion the night the Mother Gem was cleaved. It was buried in the earth, hidden from the knowledge of all encantados, until Paopao accidentally discovered the gemstone. The new gemstone gave the sisters the leverage and hope to go against the now powerful Hathorian throne.
Fortunately, the sisters managed to bring down the kingdom of Hathoria and bring peace to their realm. They also succeeded in uniting the gem fragments to form the Mother Gem again. They thought they have achieved peace but a new threat came their way.

In the beginning, the world of Encantadia was created when the five major bathaluman (deities) Arde, his brother Emre, Ether, Haliya and Keros were cast out of the heavens for remaining neutral during the celestial civil war. They arrived in a strange, uninhabited land and claimed it for themselves. The bathalumans decided to name the new world, Encantadia.Working together, the  deities transformed the barren land into a paradise, populating it with both offspring and creations like the many creatures that inhabit the Encantadian wilds to ease the pain of their exile.
Relations between the masters of Encantadia were genial at first and the beings of Encantadia lived in harmony and unity devoid of malice, until Ether and Arde fell in love. They also got jealous of the many worshipers Emre has. They planned to get rid of Emre to be free from him by absorbing the powers of the Haliya and Keros. Enraged at the two for succumbing to their baser instincts and violating the terms of their exile, Emre cursed them by turning Ether into a giant snake for her treachery. Arde was banished to limbo, transformed into a dragon tasked to forever safeguard the boundaries between the world of the living and the world of the damned, Bala-ak. Emre likewise left Encantadia and made Devas, the world of the blessed dead, his home, leaving Ether to fend for herself. Keros and Haliya each put themselves in exile to be away from all the chaos. Keros lived alone in the island of Binyaan while Haliya lived on Encantadia's second moon. 
Abandoned and cursed, Ether raged for many days. Because of her horrific and feral form, most of the citizens of Encantadia grew to fear Ether and shunned her. Others, in awe of her new power and pity of her plight, came to worship the bathaluman, who in turn granted them her power and protection. They became the first citizens of the kingdoms that shall unite and will become the empire of Etheria.
The empire was made up of four Heras (royal houses), with the members of each house possessing a unique ability given by Ether associated with their house.
Hera Andal,the ruling royal house and Etheria's capital and residence of the Monarch, Empress Avria. It's denizens are known to have knowledge in black magic, dark arts and witchcraft and possess dominion over life and death through their extensive knowledge of the healing arts and sorcery.
Hera Volo, the royal house of Etheria's military and infantry that have special abilities in the category of time, space and speed (such as accelerating or enhancing the speed of their movements, teleportation, time travel and manipulation of time). It is headed by Etheria's military general, Hera Juvila. They made Etheria's greatest treasure, the Golden Hourglass that can be used for time-travel and to rewrite history. 
Hera Sensa, the royal house of Etheria's scholars. They are psychics, mind readers, telepaths, and possess other powers or abilities involving the mind. It is headed by Avria's ever loyal adviser, Hera Andora.
Hera Ae-ga, the mysterious royal house composed of only women. They can manipulate and dictate emotions/feelings, they are also skilled in archery. They live in tree houses in Etheria's jungles. It is headed by Hera Odessa.
The four territories of Encantadia were once vassals of Etheria. Because of their might and power, Etherians became cruel and wanted to conquer the whole of Encantadia in the name of their goddess, Ether. The four territories banded together and with the help of Emre (through his gift, the Mother Gem), Etheria was destroyed completely and was forgotten from the memories of all encantados.
But Avria could not be defeated easily even as her empire succumbed, as the empress swore that Etheria would return to power by the blood and spirit of those who made her empire fall.
Meanwhile, Etheria's most powerful weapon, the Golden Hourglass, was lost and ultimately forgotten as time passed.
Through the machinations of the goddess, Ether, by using the blood and spirit from the dead from the Great War, The prophecy was fulfilled and the Golden Hourglass was re-discovered. Etheria came back to the present time,  Etheria rose again from the ashes and is becoming the mighty empire it used to be. They will try to merge their past glory into the present and change history. 
But unlike before, the Etherians now know better. They now know that as long as the gemstones are in the hands of the fairies, they have no chance of winning but by using their personal weaknesses, it is easier to destroy the sisters and get their respective gemstones and by doing so their empire could be rebuilt again in the present.
Also their deity, Ether and her lover, Arde can finally usurp the divine throne of Emre in Devas. 
The Herans of Etheria tricked the sisters into going against each other. The events will challenge the trust and loyalty of the sisters to each other and to their duty as protectors of the gems and their realm. The fate of their world rests in their unity, trust and love. The sisters must also convince the other exiled deities, the moon goddess, Haliya and the destruction deity, Keros to side with Emre in a celestial war while trying to find the next generation of Encantados that will be worthy to inherit the powers of the gemstones and the duty to protect their land.

==Overview==
Encantadia is an enchanted place in a different realm. All of the characters existing in this world are called ''Encantados''. It was discovered and created thousand years ago by five supernatural beings, Haliya, Arde, Emre, Keros and Ether who were referred to as ''bathala'' ([[Gods]]) on the present times.&lt;ref name="EncaJourney"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagsimula na ang #EncaAnimatedJourney ng ‘Encantadia’|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/570468/showbiz/nagsimula-na-ang-encaanimatedjourney-ng-encantadia|website=GMA Network|publisher=GMA Network|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world they created was settled upon by low-class working individuals called "barbaro". Because of this, the three Bathala created four classes of individuals: the ''diwata's'' ([[fairy|fairies]]) of Lireo Kingdom; mystical creatures of the Adamyan territory; the warriors and healers called ''sapiryans'' of the Sapiro Kingdom and the [[blacksmiths]] of the Hathoria Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Territories"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Territories of Encantadia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCAJkHEa3N4|website=YouTube|publisher=GMA Network|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four kingdoms promised allegiance and worship to Emre, which caused Arde and Ether's jealousy and hatred, resulting to a plan to assassinate him.&lt;ref name="EncaJourney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RapplerEnca" /&gt; Emre discovered this plan and cursed both of them: Arde to become a [[dragon]] who was sent to guard ''valaak''([[hell]]) and Ether to turn into [[snake]] to forever remind her of being a traitor.&lt;ref name="RapplerEnca" /&gt; With this, the encantados are divided between the gods resulting to factions.&lt;ref name="RapplerEnca" /&gt; Some encantados followed Ether and established the fifth Kingdom of Encantadia called, ''[[Etheria]]'', which had later fallen due to the greed of their Queen Avria to conquer the whole Encantadia causing the rest to unite against their Kingdom.&lt;ref name="RapplerEnca" /&gt;

===Enchanta===

!Outcome
|The Empire of Etheria has been defeated by the combined forces of the other four kingdoms of Encantadia and resulted in the death of Etherian Queen Avria. Encantadia was then divided into the four kingdoms of Lireo, Adamya, Sapiro and Hathoria. Mine-a assumed the throne of Lireo.
|The King of Hathoria, Arvak was killed toward the end of the war while leading his troops trying to stem a full retreat of his armies after the successful onslaught of the allied Encantadian armies that broke the back of his invasion forces. The Water and Fire gems were recovered and brought to Lireo for safe keeping.
|King Hagorn was killed by his own daughter Pirena, and eventually reclaimed the fire gem. All of Hathoria retreated, and Lireo gained its victory. The four gems was then merged back into one. Lira is supposed to succeed Amihan, but refused, leading the throne of Lireo to Danaya.

In the 2016 series of Encantadia, Amihan sacrificed her life to fight Hagorn's army of spirits. King Hagorn was then killed by Pirena leading to Hathoria's fall. Emre also defeated Arde and Ether. Danaya ascended the throne of Lireo, while Ybrahim finally crowned as King of Sapiro. The five gems was then merged back as one.
|Appears only in the 2016 version of Encantadia. The war has brought the death of Ariana and Muyak, King Hagorn was killed by Raquim while Ether has been punished by Emre. Peace was restored to all the Kingdoms. Alena ascended the throne of Lireo, while Cassiopeia became a Bathaluman (Goddess).

===Etheria (2005–06)===
{{Main|Etheria}}
Back when Encantadia was a young world, there was a great  empire called Etheria, ruled by Reyna Avria, who wanted to control the neighboring kingdoms of Lireo, Sapiro, Adamya and Hathoria. However, the four kingdoms banded together and attempted to defeat the forces of Etheria in the [[Great Encantadian War]]. After Etheria had fallen, Avria swore that Etheria would return to power once the last Sang'gre is born. The prophecy was then fulfilled due to the birth of Cassandra. Etheria rose again from the ashes and in order to save the present, the four Sang'gres of Lireo travelled back to the past in ancient Encantadia, find the lost Sang'gre, and destroy the Ginintuang Orasan (Etheria's powerful weapon) to stop Avria's centuries-old plan to dominate the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etheria: Ang Ikalimang Kaharian|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494597/?ref_=tt_rec_tt|website=IMDb|publisher=Imdb|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This chapter depicts the continuing story of the four ''Sang'gres'', Pirena, Amihan, Alena (now Queen of Sapiro) and Danaya (now Queen of Lireo) along with King Ybrahim of Sapiro, in the enchanted world of Encantadia, as they face the repercussions of their previous journey through Encantadia's history. The Four Herans of the Etherian Kingdom are plotting revenge against the Sang'gre's who, for the 2nd time took down their beloved Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encantadia Pagibig Hanggang Wakas|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0781865/|website=IMDb|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encantadia (2016)===
{{Main|Encantadia (2016 TV series)}}
After the [[Great Encantadian War]] that defeated Etheria, the three kingdoms were able to live in peace for a thousand years, but the day came when the Hathors (inhabitants of Hathoria), led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started the [[Lirean war]] to claim the other gems, that they may gain power and rule over the whole continent. Later, King Arvak was killed by a Sapirian warrior named Asval but before he died, prince Raquim of Sapiro claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from him and handed them to the Queen of Lireo for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Two Thousand years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, where Queen Mine-a chose her successor from her daughters Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya because they feel imminent danger lurking, and as the gods called her to Devas (the world of the dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chose and crowned Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion and the onset of the so-called War of the four Gems. The chain of events that transpired made way for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the gemstone of fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost.Pirena then fools her sisters and ruled over Lireo, she bore a daughter named Mira while Amihan bore Lira who then took refuge in the mortal world. There were numerous times Ether helped Hathoria in defeating Lireo, but failed to succeed at. The last fight of Hathoria and Lireo resulted to the death of Queen Amihan, and Pirena's reunion with her other sisters. Danaya succeeded Amihan to the throne of Lireo, Ybrahim took oath as King of Sapiro while Pirena rebuilt Hathoria and became queen. The five gems were merged into one, but new threat had come to their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encantadia|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/shows/Encantadia|website=GMA Network|publisher=GMA Network|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Escapement''''' (a.k.a. '''''The Electronic Monster''''' in the U.S.) is a 1958 [[black and white]] British [[science fiction film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/15573/The-Electronic-Monster/overview|title=The-Electronic-Monster - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com|work=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the sci-fi novel ''Escapement'' by [[Charles Eric Maine]] (London, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/557295/The-Electronic-Monster/screenplay-info.html|title=The Electronic Monster (1960) - Screenplay Info - TCM.com|work=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original working titles included ''Zex, the Electronic Fiend''.

The film was released in England (as ''Escapement'') in 1958, but was only shown in the USA in 1960 on a double bill with either ''[[13 Ghosts]]'' or the Japanese sci-fi classic ''[[Battle in Outer Space]]''.

==Plot==
Inquiring into the mysterious death of a Hollywood star, insurance investigator Jeff Keenan uncovers an exclusive psychiatric clinic on the [[French Riviera]]. Here, patients who want to escape the stresses of life are hypnotized, then laid out in morgue like drawers and left to dream for several weeks. It turns out that Dr. Zakon, the clinic's ex-Nazi owner, is using  a "dream machine" to alter the sleepers dreams, and to impose his will on theirs.

==Production==
Producer Richard Gordon later said there were major problems with the film's special effects. He also said that he had a dispute with Anglo Amalgamated, who did not want the movie to get an X Certificate in England whereas Gordon wanted more horror for the US.&lt;ref name="tom"&gt;Tom Weaver, ''The Horror Hits of Richard Gordon'', Bear Manor Media 2011 p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Leonard Maltin]] called it a "blah sci-fi programmer" ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/557295/The-Electronic-Monster/|title=The Electronic Monster (1960) - Overview - TCM.com|work=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[TV Guide]] noted, "an intriguing feature in that it was among the first to examine the possibilities of [[psychological manipulation]] and [[brainwashing]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-electronic-monster-113848/review/|title=The Electronic Monster|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''For The Gambia Our Homeland'''" is the [[national anthem]] of [[the Gambia]], written by Virginia Julia Howe and composed by Jeremy Frederic Howe (based on the traditional [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] song Foday Kaba Dumbuya).  It was adopted after an international competition to produce an anthem (and flag) before independence in 1965.

The English lyrics are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"

|For The Gambia, our homeland
:We strive and work and pray,

'''Frances Elizabeth Hoggan''' (''née'' '''Morgan'''; 20 December 1843 – 5 February 1927) was a Welsh doctor and the first British woman to receive a doctorate in [[medicine]] from any university in [[Europe]]. She was also a pioneering medical practitioner, researcher and social reformer – and the first female doctor to be registered in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Frances Hoggan|url=https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|website=Learned Society of Wales|accessdate=20 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025133745/https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|archivedate=2017-10-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband opened the first husband-and-wife medical practice in Britain.

==Life==
Frances Hoggan was born in [[Brecon]], [[Wales]], where her father, Richard Morgan, was a curate.  She was brought up and educated at [[Cowbridge]] in Glamorgan and later at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].  During her teens, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, who was brought up with her mother and passed off as Frances' sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/women/pages/mothers_of_industry.shtml BBC – Wales History – Mothers of Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  She went on to study at [[Paris]] and [[Düsseldorf]]. 

She obtained her medical doctorate from the [[University of Zurich]] in March 1870, completing the six-year course in three years, becoming the first British woman to obtain a European MD degree.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 she married Dr George Hoggan.  She later practised in London as a specialist in women's and children's diseases, including a period at [[North London Collegiate School]].  Together with her husband, she opened the first husband-and-wife general medical practice in the UK.  

In 1882, she called for a publicly funded women's medical service for female patients in India. This helped pave the way for the [[Countess of Dufferin Fund|Dufferin Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Women for India|last=Hoggan|first=Frances|publisher=J.W. Arrowsmith|year=1882|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggan became a campaigner and social reformer, and toured the [[United States]] lecturing. She had a particular interest in racial issues, and was a speaker at the Universal Race Congress in London in 1911.

Her cremated remains are buried, with her husband's, in [[Woking]] cemetery.

== Education ==
Upon the exclusion of women by the Council of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] from its professional exams in 1867, Frances Elizabeth Morgan sought her medical education at the [[University of Zurich]], whence [[Nadezhda Suslova]], Russia's first woman physician, had received her degree in December 1867. There, Morgan completed the medical course in three years rather than the expected five, and in March 1870 became only the second woman to gain an MD (with a thesis on progressive muscular atrophy) at Zürich University.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, at a clinic in Vienna she undertook study on operative midwifery and became a pupil of surgeon Gustav Braun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frances Elizabeth Hoggan|last = Thomas|first = Onfel|publisher = R.

{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}

The '''ghazal''' ( {{lang-pa|ਗ਼ਜ਼ਲ}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''غزَل '''}}}}, {{lang-hi|ग़ज़ल}}, {{lang-fa|غزل}}, {{lang-ps|غزل}}, {{lang-bn|গজল}}) is a form of amatory poem or ode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1:341.platts|title=A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English|website=dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; originating in Arabic poetry. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/ghazal|title=Ghazal|date=9 September 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A ghazal commonly consists of between five and fifteen couplets, which are independent, but are linked – abstractly, in their theme; and more strictly in their poetic form. The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the [[Petrarchan sonnet]]{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. In style and content, due to its highly allusive nature, the ghazal has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.  

The ghazal is one of the most widespread and popular poetic forms, especially across the Middle East and South Asia. In India, [[Jagjit Singh]], popularly known as '''"The Ghazal King"''' , popularize ghazals and ghazal singing among crores of music lovers . Readings or musical renditions of Ghazals are well attended in these countries, even by the laity. In a similar manner to [[Haiku]], the Ghazal is gaining popularity among western poetry readers.

== Pronunciation ==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|غزل}} ''ġazal'' is pronounced {{IPA-ar|ˈɣazal|}}, roughly like the English word ''guzzle'', but with the ''ġ'' pronounced without a complete closure between the tongue and the [[soft palate]]{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.  In English, the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|z|əl}}&lt;ref&gt;Oxford BBC Guide to Pronunciation&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|z|æ|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins in Arabia ===
The ghazal originated in Arabia in the 7th century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ghazal|title=Ghazal – Islamic literature|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolving from the ''[[qasida]]'', a much older pre-Islamic Arabic poetic form.&lt;ref name="Kanda"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUKKvNDYyUEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Masterpieces of Urdu Ghazal from the 17th to the 20th Century|last=Kanda|first=K.C.|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=1992|isbn=8120711955|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qaṣīdas'' were typically much longer poems, with up to 100 couplets. Thematically, ''qaṣīdas'' did not include love, and were usually [[panegyric|panegyrics]] for a tribe or ruler, lampoons, or moral maxims. However, the ''qaṣīda's'' opening prelude, called the ''[[Nasīb (poetry)|nasīb]],'' was typically nostalgic and/or romantic in theme, and highly ornamented and stylized in form. In time, the ''nasīb'' began to be written as standalone, shorter poems, which became the ghazal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/short_history_of_the_ghazal.html|title=A Short History of the Ghazal|last=Jalajel|first=David|date=|website=The Ghazal Page Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ghazal came into its own as a poetic genre during the Ummayyad Era (661–750) and continued to flower and develop in the early Abbasid Era. The Arabic ghazal inherited the formal verse structure of the ''qaṣīda'', specifically, a strict adherence to meter and the use of the [[Qaafiyaa]], a common end rhyme on each couplet (called a ''bayt'' in Arabic and a ''sher'' in Persian).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The nature of the ghazals also changed to meet the demands of musical presentation, becoming briefer in length. Lighter poetic meters, such as ''khafîf'', ''ramal'', and ''muqtarab'' were preferred, instead of longer, more ponderous meters favored for ''qaṣīdas'' (such as ''kâmil'', ''basît'', and ''rajaz''). Topically, the ghazal focus also changed from nostalgic reminisces of the homeland and loved-ones, towards romantic or erotic themes – These included sub-genres with themes of courtly love (''udharî''), eroticism (''hissî''), homoeroticism (''mudhakkar''''')''', and as a highly stylized introduction to a larger poem (''tamhîdî'').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dayf, Shawqî. ''Târîkh al-Adab al-Islâmî: 2 – al-`Asr al-Islâmî'' (A History of Arab Literature: 2- The Islamic Era). Cairo: Dâr al-Ma`ârif. 1963. (pp. 347–348)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of the Arabian ghazal ===
With the spread of Islam, the Arabian ghazal spread both westwards, into Africa and Spain, as well as eastwards, into Persia. The popularity of ghazals in a particular region was usually preceded by a spread of the Arabic language in that country. In medieval Spain, ghazals written in Hebrew as well as Arabic have been found as far back the 11th century. It is possible that ghazals were also written in the [[Mozarabic language]]. Ghazals in the Arabic form have also been written in a number of major West African literary languages like [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Fula language|Fulfulde]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dispersion into Persia ===

==== Early Arabo-Persian ghazals (10th to 11th century) ====
However, the most significant changes to the ghazal occurred in its introduction into Iran in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Kanda" /&gt; The early Persian ghazals largely imitated the themes and form of the Arabian ghazal. These "Arabo-Persian" ghazals introduced two differences compared to their Arabian poetic roots. Firstly, the Persian ghazals did not employ radical enjambment between the two halves of the couplet, and secondly, the Persian ghazals formalized the use of the common rhyme in both lines of the opening couplet (''"'''matla'''"'').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The imitation of Arabian forms in Persia extended to the ''qaṣīda'', which was also popular in Persia. 

Because of its comparative brevity, thematic variety and suggestive richness, the ghazal soon eclipsed the ''qaṣīda'', and became the most popular poetry form in Persia.&lt;ref name="Kanda" /&gt; Much like Arabian ghazals, early Persian ghazals typically employed more musical meters compared to other Persian poetry forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Rudaki]] (858–941 CE) is considered the most important Persian ghazal poet of this period, and the founder of classical Persian literature.  

==== Early Persian ghazal poetry (12th to early 13th century) ====
The Persian ghazal evolved into its own distinctive form between the 12th and 13th centuries. Many of those innovations created what we now recognize as the archetypical ghazal form. These changes occurred in two periods, separated by the Mongol Invasion of Persia from 1219–1221 AD. 

The 'Early Persian poetry' period spanned approximately one century, from the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid era]] (which lasted until 1187) till a little after the Mongol Invasion. Apart from the movement towards brevity, this period also saw two significant and lasting changes to the ghazal form. 

The first change was the adoption of the ''[[Takhallus]]'', the practice of mentioning the poet's pen-name in the final couplet (called the {{'}}'''''maqta'''''{{'}}). The adoption of the ''takhallus'' became a gradually accepted part of the ghazal form, and by the time of [[Saadi Shirazi]] (1210–1291 AD), the most important ghazal poet of this period, it had become ''de rigueur.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second marked change from Arabian ghazal form in Persian ghazals was a movement towards far greater autonomy between the couplets.

==== Late Persian poetry in the Early Mongol Period (1221–) ====
The ghazal later spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. It was famous all around the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries {{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}

=== Introduction into South Asia ===
[[File:Amir Khusro.jpg|thumb|Amir Khusrow teaching his disciples in a miniature from a manuscript of ''Majlis al-Ushshaq'' by [[Husayn Bayqarah]]. Amir Khusrow is considered the first Urdu poet]]

The ghazal was spread from [[Persia]] into [[South Asia]] in the 12th century{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}} by the influence of [[Sufi]] mystics and the courts of the new Islamic sultanates{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. This period coincided with the early Islamic Sultanates in India, through the wave of Islamic invasions into the region in that period. The 13th century poet and musician [[Amir Khusrow|Ameer Khusrow]] is considered the first Urdu poet. 

Although the ghazal is most prominently a form of [[Dari language|Dari]] and [[Urdu poetry]]{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}, it is now found in the poetry of many languages on the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[File:Asad_ghalib.jpeg|thumb|Mirza Asadullah Khan Baig ''[[Ghalib]]'' is considered the greatest and most influential poet of Urdu and Farsi ghazals]]

== Poetic form ==
All the lines of a ghazal have the same meter{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.  It is common in ghazals for the poet's name (known as [[takhallus]]) to be featured in the last verse (a convention known as the [[maqta]]){{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.

== Themes ==
The ghazal was initially composed to a purely religious theme{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. Now it is more likely to lean towards romantic themes{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. 

=== Unconditional, superior love ===

Can usually be interpreted for a higher being or for a mortal beloved. Love is always viewed as something that will complete a human being, and if attained will lift him or her into the ranks of the wise, or will bring satisfaction to the soul of the poet. Traditional ghazal law may or may not have an explicit element of sexual desire in it, and the love may be spiritual. The love may be directed to either a man or a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shayari Network|url=https://www.shayaribox.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ghazal is always written from the point of view of the unrequited lover whose beloved is portrayed as unattainable{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}. Most often, either the beloved has not returned the poet's love or returns it without sincerity or else the societal circumstances do not allow it. The lover is aware and resigned to this fate but continues loving nonetheless; the lyrical impetus of the poem derives from this tension. Representations of the lover's powerlessness to resist his feelings often include lyrically exaggerated violence. The beloved's power to captivate the speaker may be represented in extended metaphors about the "arrows of his eyes", or by referring to the beloved as an assassin or a killer. Take, for example, the following couplets from [[Amir Khusro]]'s Persian ghazal ''Nami danam chi manzil buud shab'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fa-Latn|nemidanam che manzel bood shab jayi ke man boodam;
be har soo raghse besmel bood shab jayi ke man boodam.
pari peykar negari sarv ghadi laleh rokhsari;
sarapa afat-e del bood shab jayi ke man boodam.}}
|
I wonder what was the place where I was last night,
All around me were half-slaughtered victims of love, tossing about in agony.
There was a nymph-like beloved with cypress-like form and tulip-like face,
Ruthlessly playing havoc with the hearts of the lovers.}}

=== Sufism ===
Many of the major historical ghazal poets were either avowed Sufis themselves (like [[Rumi]] or [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]), or were sympathizers with Sufi ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Most ghazals can be viewed in a spiritual context, with the Beloved being a metaphor for God or the poet's spiritual master. It is the intense Divine Love of Sufism that serves as a model for all the forms of love found in ghazal poetry.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Most ghazal scholars today recognize that some ghazal couplets are exclusively about Divine Love (ishq-e-haqiqi). Others are about "earthly love" (ishq-e-majazi), but many of them can be interpreted in either context.

Traditionally invoking melancholy, love, longing, and metaphysical questions, ghazals are often sung by Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian musicians. The form has roots in seventh-century Arabia{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}},{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and gained prominence in the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century, thanks to such Persian poets as Rumi and Hafiz, and later to Indian poets such as [[Mirza Ghalib]]. In the eighteenth-century, the ghazal was used by poets writing in Urdu. Among these poets, [[Ghalib]] is the recognized master{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}}.

== Important ghazal poets ==
&lt;!-- Don't add anyone who has no article. --&gt;
Ghazals were written by [[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi Shirazi]] of [[Persia]]; the [[Turkic peoples|Azerbaijani Turkish]] poet [[Fuzûlî]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; [[Mirza Ghalib]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] of [[North India]]; and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] of [[Bengal]]. Through the influence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in [[Germany]] during the 19th century; the form was used extensively by [[Friedrich Rückert]] (1788–1866) and [[August von Platen]] (1796–1835). The [[Kashmir]]i poet [[Agha Shahid Ali]] was a proponent of the form, both in English and in other languages; he edited a volume of "real Ghazals in English". Ghazals were also written by [[Motiram Bhatta|Moti Ram Bhatta]] (1866–1896), the pioneer of Nepali ghazal writing in [[Nepali language|Nepali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/motiram-bhatta|title=Hamza Sinwari Bhatta – We All Nepali|website=www.weallnepali.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazals were also written by [[Hamza Shinwari]], He is known as the father of [[Pashto]] Ghazals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza_Shinwari|title=Hamza Shinwari|website=en.wikipedia.org|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

=== Important poets of Persian ghazal ===
In [[Persian language|Persian]], prominent and acclaimed ghazal poets include [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Rumi]], [[Saadi Shirazi]], [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi]], [[Khwaju Kermani]], [[Saib Tabrizi]], [[Hossein Monzavi]], [[Maryam Jafari Azarmani]], [[Wali Mohammed Wali]], [[Mirza Ghalib]], [[Mir Taqi Mir]], [[Momin Khan Momin]], [[Daagh]] Dehlvi, [[Khwaja Haidar Ali Aatish]], [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]], [[Khwaja Mir Dard]], [[Jaun Elia]], [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Ahmad Faraz]], [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Syed Amin Ashraf]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[Shakeb Jalali]], [[Nasir Kazmi]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Hasrat Mohani]], [[Makhdoom Mohiuddin]], [[Jigar Moradabadi]], [[Saghar Siddiqui]], [[Munir Niazi]], [[Mirza Rafi Sauda]], [[Qateel Shifai]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Dushyant Kumar]], [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]], [[Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq]], [[Madan Pal]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rekhta.org/poets/madan-pal&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kashmiri Lal Zakir]].

== Translations and performance of classical ghazal ==
Enormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages. Ghazal poems are performed in Uzbek-Tajik [[Shashmakom]], Turkish [[Makam]], Persian [[Dastgah]] and Uyghur [[Muqam]]. There are many published translations from Persian and Turkish by [[Annemarie Schimmel]], [[Arthur John Arberry]] and many others.

Ghazal "Gayaki", the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. Singers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with [[Begum Akhtar]] and later on Ustad [[Mehdi Hassan]] that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorization of ghazal singing as a form of "light classical" music is a misconception.

Classical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the "shers" or couplets in the ghazal. [[Amanat Ali Khan]], Begum Akhtar, [[Talat Mahmood]], Mehdi Hassan, [[Abida Parveen]], [[Jagjit Singh]], [[Farida Khanum]] and Ustad [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], Moinuddin Ahamed, are popular classical ghazal singers.

== Popularity ==
Understanding the complex lyrics of ghazals required education typically available only to the upper classes. The traditional classical ''[[raga|rāgas]]'' in which the lyrics were rendered were also difficult to understand. The Ghazal has undergone some simplification in terms of words and phrasings, which helps it to reach a larger audience around the world. Most of the ghazals are now sung in styles that are not limited to ''[[khyal|khayāl]], [[thumri]], [[raga|rāga]], [[Tala (music)|tāla]]'' and other classical and light classical genres.

However, those forms of the ghazal are looked down on by purists of the Indian classical tradition. In Pakistan, [[Noor Jehan]], [[Iqbal Bano]], Abida Parveen, Farida Khanum, Ghulam Ali, [[Ahmed Rushdi]], [[Ustad Amanat Ali Khan]] and Mehdi Hassan are known for ghazal renditions. Singers like [[Jagjit Singh (singer)|Jagjit Singh]] (who first used a [[guitar]] in ghazals), [[Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain]], [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Adithya Srinivasan (Singer)|Adithya Srinivasan]], [[Mohammad Rafi]], [[Pankaj Udhas]], [[Satyam Anandjee]] and many others have been able to give a new shape to the ghazal by incorporating elements of Western music.

In North India, in addition to [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], ghazals have been very popular in the [[Gujarati language]]. For around a century, starting with [[Balashankar Kantharia]], there have been many notable Gujarati ghazal writers like [[Kalapi]], [[Barkat Virani]] 'Befaam', Aasim Randeri, Shunya Palanpuri, [[Amrut Ghayal]], Khalil Dhantejvi and many more. Some notable ghazals of those prominent writers have been sung by Bollywood playback singer [[Manhar Udhas]].

Renowned ghazal singer, and pioneer of Telugu ghazals, [[Ghazal Srinivas]] popularized the ghazal in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Srinivas also introduced ghazal singing in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and Ghazals in Kannada were written by Markandapuram Srinivas.

The first true-to-form Bangla (Bengali) ghazal are published in "gajaler aayanaay" by British Dashgupta.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Canadians|Canadian]] classical ghazal singer [[Cassius Khan]] has the unusual talent of singing in the recitational style while accompanying himself on the [[tabla]].

== In English ==
After nearly a century of "false starts", the early experiments of [[James Clarence Mangan]], [[James Elroy Flecker]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Phyllis Webb]], etc., many of whom did not adhere wholly or in part to the traditional principles of the form, experiments dubbed as "the bastard Ghazal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |title=wordsters.net |work=wordsters.net |accessdate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112215734/http://wordsters.net/poetics/poetics01/01weaverprint.html |archivedate=12 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ghazal finally began to be recognized as a viable closed form in poetry of the [[English language]] some time in the early to mid-1990s. It came about largely as a result of serious, true-to-form examples being published by noted American poets [[John Hollander]], [[W. S. Merwin]] and [[Elise Paschen]] as well as by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, who had been teaching and spreading word of the Ghazal at American universities over the previous two decades. [[Jim Harrison]] created his own free-form Ghazal true to his poetic vision in ''Outlyer and Ghazals'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0671208527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Ali compiled and edited the world's first anthology of English-language Ghazals, published by [[Wesleyan University Press]] in 2000, as ''Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English''. (Fewer than one in ten of the ghazals collected in ''Real Ghazals in English'' observe the constraints of the form.) Devi Panthi of Nepal started composing ghazals claiming himself the pioneer of English ghazals since 2006.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A ghazal is composed of couplets, five or more. The couplets may have nothing to do with one another except for the formal unity derived from a strict rhyme and rhythm pattern.

A ghazal in English observes the traditional restrictions of the form:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight?&lt;br /&gt;
Whom else from rapture's road will you expel tonight?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those "Fabrics of Cashmere—" "to make Me beautiful—"&lt;br /&gt;
"Trinket"— to gem– "Me to adorn– How– tell"— tonight?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I beg for haven: Prisons, let open your gates–&lt;br /&gt;
A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God's vintage loneliness has turned to vinegar–&lt;br /&gt;
All the archangels– their wings frozen– fell tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lord, cried out the idols, Don't let us be broken&lt;br /&gt;
Only we can convert the infidel tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities&lt;br /&gt;
multiply me at once under your spell tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He's freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
He's left open– for God– the doors of Hell tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the heart's veined temple, all statues have been smashed&lt;br /&gt;
No priest in saffron's left to toll its knell tonight&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God, limit these punishments, there's still Judgment Day–&lt;br /&gt;
I'm a mere sinner, I'm no infidel tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Executioners near the woman at the window.&lt;br /&gt;
Damn you, Elijah, I'll bless Jezebel tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hunt is over, and I hear the Call to Prayer&lt;br /&gt;
fade into that of the wounded gazelle tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My rivals for your love– you've invited them all?&lt;br /&gt;
This is mere insult, this is no farewell tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee–&lt;br /&gt;
God sobs in my arms. [[Call me Ishmael]] tonight.

—[[Agha Shahid Ali]]

'''Gibberish''' (sometimes '''Jibberish''') is a [[language game]] that is played in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]]. Similar games are played in many other countries. The name [[Gibberish]] refers to the nonsensical sound of words spoken according to the rules of this game.&lt;ref name="wikiHow"&gt;[http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Gibberish How to Speak Gibberish - wikiHow], Oct. 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== In English ==
There are several variations of Gibberish in the English-speaking world. They use ''-itherg-'', ''-uthug-'', ''-elag-'', ''-itug-'', ''-uthaga-'', ''-uvug-'', ''-idig-'', ''-atheg-'' (''th'' in ''then'' and the two vowels are pronounced with a [[schwa]]), and ''-adeg-''. The dialects are given different names. Another form of gibberish known as allibi is spoken using the insertion ''-allib-''.

==="-idig- "''-uddag-''", "''-uvug-''", "''-uthug-''"===
These four dialects of Gibberish are spoken by adding the [[infix]] to each syllable after the [[syllable onset|onset]]. Example:
*dog → {{not a typo|''didigog'', ''duddagog'', ''duvugog'', ''duthugog''}} 
*cat → {{not a typo|''cidigat'' or ''kidigat'', ''cuddagat'', ''cuvugat'', ''cuthugat''}}
When a syllable starts with more than one consonant, the infix is added after the onset consonants. Example:
*creek → {{not a typo|''cridigeek'', ''cruddageek'', ''cruvugeek'', ''cruthugeek''}}
*strong → {{not a typo|''stridigong'', ''struddagong'', ''struvugong'', ''struthugong''}} 
When the syllable begins with a vowel, that vowel is used in place of the first ''i'' in the ''-ithieg-'' infix. Example:
*all → {{not a typo|''idigall'', ''uddagall'', ''uvugall'', ''uthugall''}}
*eat → {{not a typo|''idigeat'', uddageat, ''uvugeat'', ''uthugeat''}}
Words of more than one syllable repeat the rules for each syllable.
*example → {{not a typo|''idigexidigampidigle'', ''uddagex-uddagam-puddagle'', ''uvugex-uvugam-puvugle'', ''uthugex-uthugam-puthugle''}}
*flower → {{not a typo|''flidigow-idiger'', ''fluddagow-uddager'', ''fluvugow-uvuger'', ''fluthugow-uthuger''}} &lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3UL_Qtd-fM How to Speak Gibberish in Five Easy Steps], Oct. 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==="''-atheb-''", "''-adag-''"===
This dialect works in much the same way as the previous dialects, with an additional rule. When a single syllable word begins with a vowel, the infix acts as a prefix, with the initial "a" becoming like that vowel.
*all → ''{{not a typo|adagall}}''   
*eat → ''{{not a typo|eadageet}}''
*if → ''{{not a typo|idagif}}''
*it → ''{{not a typo|idagit}}''
*up → ''{{not a typo|udagup}}''
*at → ''{{not a typo|adagat}}''
*is → ''{{not a typo|idagis}}''
*I → ''{{not a typo|idaguy}}''
*hi → ''{{not a typo|hidaguy}}''
*down → ''{{not a typo|dadagown}}''
The sentence "I hit the alarm clock when I woke up" could be "Ittiguy Hittigit thittagee addagalitigarm clidigock wittigen Ittiguy wittigoke uttigup".&lt;ref name="Buzzle"&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/how-to-speak-gibberish.html How to Speak Gibberish], Oct. 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="''-(V)rV+g-''"===
Another paradigm involves infixing ''(V)rV+g'' following the onset of a monosyllabic word, or less usually after each onset or [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of polysyllabic words. In words consisting of a single [[diphthong]], the Gibberish morpheme breaks up the syllable into a sequence of vowels plus a glide. The vowels of the Gibberish morpheme typically [[vowel harmony|harmonize]] for [[vowel quality|quality]] with the vowel of the syllable nucleus, but can be [[vowel reduction|reduced]] if unstressed according to English stress rules. The {{IPA|[ɡ]}} [[syllabification|syllabifies]] into a new onset. Examples:

*Eye {{IPA|[aɪ]}} → Eregye {{IPA|[ˈærəɡaɪ]}}
*Float {{IPA|[floʊt]}} → {{not a typo|Floragoat}} {{IPA|[ˈflɔrəɡoʊt]}}
*Street {{IPA|[striːt]}} → {{not a typo|Strerageet}} {{IPA|[ˈstɪərɨɡiːt]}}

==="''-(V)lV+g-''"===
L can also be commonly used instead of r. Examples:

*Eye → Elegye {{IPA|[ˈæləɡaɪ]}}
*Float → Flolagoat {{IPA|[ˈflɔləɡoʊt]}}
*Street → Strelegeet {{IPA|[ˈstrɪəlɨɡiːt]}}

===Gibberish family===
The term "gibberish" is used more generally to refer to all [[language game]]s created by inserting a certain infix before the vowel in each syllable. For example, if the code infix were "ob", then "Hello, Thomas" would be translated as "Hobellobo, Thobomobas". While a relatively simple code, this can be difficult to understand when spoken swiftly and sounds merely like meaningless babble, which is how it received its name.  The terms "Double Talk" and "Double Dutch" are alternate names for such codes.  While any syllables could be used as code syllables, some syllables are more commonly used. These include:

* [[Ubbi dubbi]] &amp;ndash; "ub" or "ib"
* Oppish &amp;ndash; "op" or "ob",
* Egglish &amp;ndash; "eg" or "ineg", 
* Izzle  &amp;ndash; "iz" or "izl",
* Carny &amp;ndash; "earz" or "eez" or "iz"
* Fuzzy Wuzzy &amp;ndash; "ez" or "uz"

Another variation consists in the code syllables not having a specific vowel, but repeating the vowel of the syllable in which it is being inserted. This variation is common in Switzerland, where the inserted syllable thus could be "@n@f", where ''@'' denotes the original vowel; e.g. "Hallo, Chrige" would be translated into ''Hanafallonofo, Chrinifigenefe''. Similarly, "Lalafa" replaces each occurrence of a vowel with "@l[[schwa|əf]]@." In Gibberish as spoken in the [[United Kingdom]], the infix code syllable is often "@rag".

In some variants only the first syllable of each word is modified. On the other hand, combining (or double-encoding) forms of Gibberish, or by further encoding with other languages games such as [[Pig Latin]] and [[Tutnese]] can result in increasingly hard to decipher (and pronounce) words. For instance, combining Pig Latin, Hard Gibberish and Openglopish might result in a phrase {{not a typo|''idigopidigatthidigopidigay idigopidigoundsidigopidigay idigopidigikelidigopidigay idigopidigisthidigopidigay''}} ('that sounds like this').

Language games in the Gibberish family are not unique to English-speaking countries. Gibberish games in other languages include:
*[[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Allspråket (Identical to Pig Latin, but with the suffix "-all" rather than "-ay".)
*[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Konttikieli, Vedkieli
*[[French language|French]]: [[Javanais]] (consonant + vowel ---&gt; consonant + “av” + vowel), [[Louchébem]] (moving the first consonant to the end; add "-ème" at the end and then "L" at the beginning of the new word), [[Verlan]] (reverse the syllables)
*[[German language|German]]: Löffelsprache &amp;ndash; infix "@ləf"
*[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: "bet" language, "gimel" language (consonant is added after every vowel)
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: "babibo" (バビボ）and papipo （パピポ）(after each syllable, add b or p + the preceding vowel. i.e. ichigo would become {{not a typo|ibichibigobi}} or {{not a typo|ipichipigopi}})
*[[Persian language|Persian]]: "Zargari" language ("Z" sound consonantly added after every vowel (e.g Salam =&gt; Sa[Za]la[Za]m))
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Madárnyelv ("bird's-language") &amp;ndash; infix "@v" or "@rg" (''Tudsz így beszélni? → {{not a typo|Tuvudsz ívígy beveszévélnivi}}?'')

'''Graffiti''' (both singular and plural; the singular ''graffito'' is very rare in English except in archeology)&lt;ref&gt; The Italian singular form "graffito" is so rare in English (except in specialist texts on archeology) that it is not even recorded or mentioned in some dictionaries, for example the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=graffiti American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view.&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt; Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed [[Graffito (archaeology)|since ancient times]], with examples dating back to [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Graffito"/&gt;

In modern times, paint (particularly [[aerosol paint|spray paint]]) and [[marker pen]]s have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime.

Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within [[hip hop culture]], graffiti have evolved alongside [[hip hop music]], [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], and other elements.&lt;ref name=powder/&gt; Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.

Both "graffiti" and its occasional singular form "graffito" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' ("scratched"). "Graffiti" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is "[[sgraffito]]",&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|γράφειν}}—''graphein''—meaning "to write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]] 
The term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/en/safaitic-database-online|title=Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures - Safaitic Database Online|last=dan|website=krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/safaitic|title=The Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia - Safaitic|last=dan|website=krc.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-style graffiti===
The first known example of "modern style"{{clarify|date=June 2018}} graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of [[Ephesus]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]). Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt;

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals&lt;ref name=ancel/&gt;
The eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' ("handle with care").

Disappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''
''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''
''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''
''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''

Whoever loves, go to hell. I want to break Venus's ribs
with a club and deform her hips.
If she can break my tender heart
why can't I hit her over the head?
&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' IV, 1824.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IV, 4200 shows a failed attempt to write this little poem, maybe because the writer forgot the verses: see F. A. Todd, "Three Pompeian Wall-Inscriptions, and Petronius" in ''The Classical Review'', Vol. 53, No. 1 (Feb., 1939), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/706251?uid=2134&amp;uid=2476609927&amp;uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=2476609917&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21104320244421 page 6 note 2] and ''Rediscovering Pompeii'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciNtH6c9RDQC&amp;pg=PA39 page 39 note 85].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at [[Sigiriya]] in Sri Lanka scribbled over 1800 individual graffiti there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.&lt;ref name=ponnam/&gt; Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Wet with cool dew drops
fragrant with perfume from the flowers
came the gentle breeze
jasmine and water lily
dance in the spring sunshine
side-long glances
of the golden-hued ladies
stab into my thoughts
heaven itself cannot take my mind
as it has been captivated by one lass
among the five hundred I have seen here.&lt;ref name=parana/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.&lt;ref&gt;حسين مروّة، '''تراثنا كيف نعرفه'''، مؤسسة الأبحاث العربية، بيروت، 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

===Literacy or illiteracy often revealed in graffiti===
Historic forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, "qu" is pronounced "co". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18–20 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': "Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.")

Another piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Landlord, may your lies malign
Bring destruction on your head!
You yourself drink unmixed wine,
Water [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.&lt;ref name=olmert/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.

Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;
When [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.&lt;ref name="archeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

There are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=JinxArtCrimes/&gt; [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.&lt;ref name=shanks/&gt;

== Contemporary graffiti ==
Graffiti writing is often intertwined with [[hip hop culture]]&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop? (book excerpt)|date=10 February 2015|work=The Concise Guide to Hip-Hop Music|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Paul|last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the myriad international styles derived from [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City Subway]] graffiti. However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino? The Secret History of Hobo Graffiti|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some graffiti have their own poignancy. In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:&lt;ref name=reagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1918
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1945
This is the last time I want to write my name here.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During World War II and for decades after, the phrase "[[Kilroy was here]]" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed "Yardbird" or "Bird"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words "Bird Lives".&lt;ref name=russel/&gt; The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as "Free Huey" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was "Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Advent of aerosol paint===
Rock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading "Clapton is God" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].

Graffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.&lt;ref name=myspace/&gt;

Along similar lines was the legend "[[Frodo Lives!|Frodo Lives]]," referring to the protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Spread of hip hop culture===
In 1979, graffiti artist [[Lee Quinones]] and [[Fab Five Freddy|Fab 5 Freddy]] were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.&lt;ref name=chesh/&gt; Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" and "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook" /&gt;

''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=labonte/&gt; Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.&lt;ref name=hershk/&gt; Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).

===Stencil graffiti emerges===
This period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Graffiti as a memorial===
People often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture===
{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}
With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." Due to laws forbidding it, some of the "street artists" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.&lt;ref name=guerilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by [[TATS CRU]] in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings "a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse".&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

===Gamer culture===
Along with the commercial growth has come the rise of [[video game]]s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]]. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.

Other games which feature graffiti include ''[[Klark Kent|Bomb the World]]'' (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist [[Klark Kent]] where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' (2002), in which the hero, [[Mario]] must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, [[Bowser Jr.]] in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] (a manifestation of the "[[Fixing Broken Windows|broken window theory]]") or those of the "[[Graffiti Blasters]]" of Chicago's Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].

Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''). ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which is a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Double Dragon (series)#Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked]]'', ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and various examples of [[Virtual Graffiti#Gaming|Virtual Graffiti]]. There also exist games where the term "graffiti" is used as a synonym for "drawing" (such as ''[[Yahoo! Graffiti]]'', ''[[ImagiNation Network#SierraLand|Graffiti]]'', etc.).

===Advocates===
[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref name=sohh/&gt;

[[Henry Chalfant]] is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film [[Style Wars]] and co-authored the books ''[[Subway Art]]'' and ''Spray Can Art''. His most recent work, ''Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists'' displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.&lt;ref name=chalf/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]] was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement."&lt;ref name="haring-foundation-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop|title=Pop Shop|date=2018|work=The Keith Haring Foundation Website|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Keith|last=Haring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew [[123Klan]].  Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.&lt;ref name=grafica/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

===Global developments===

====South America====
There is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]. Within Brazil, [[São Paulo]] is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

Tristan Manco wrote that Brazil "boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&amp;nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration." Graffiti "flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities." Artistic parallels "are often drawn between the energy of São Paulo today and 1970s New York." The "sprawling metropolis," of São Paulo has "become the new shrine to graffiti;" Manco alludes to "poverty and unemployment&amp;nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples," and to "Brazil's chronic poverty," as the main engines that "have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture." In world terms, Brazil has "one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently." Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the "folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised," that is South American graffiti art.&lt;ref name=manco7/&gt;

Prominent Brazilian graffiti artists include [[Os Gêmeos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.&lt;ref name=globo/&gt; Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures&lt;ref name=nicek/&gt; has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''pichação'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.&lt;ref name=revela/&gt;

====Middle East====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 6754 3.jpg|thumb|Poetry graffiti in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]]] --&gt;[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|thumb|A graffiti piece found in Tel Aviv by the artist DeDe]]
Graffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.&lt;ref name=pinmag/&gt; The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference  "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" ("[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.

====Southeast Asia====
There are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.&lt;ref name=kharbar/&gt;

== Characteristics of common graffiti ==
{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}

===Methods and production===
The modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.&lt;ref name=nicolas/&gt; This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.

[[Stencil graffiti]], originating in the early 1980s ([[Blek le Rat]], [[Jef Aerosol]], [[Speedy Graphito]], [[Miss Tic]] ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image.&lt;ref name=drupal/&gt; The stencil is then placed on the "canvas" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.

===Modern experimentation===

[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]
Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffiti artists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.

===Tagging===

Some of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.

One form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.

Another form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.

A more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.

Some artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.

Many graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.

Another graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer "CAP" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a "beef", or conflict between writers.

A number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] "Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] "#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Theories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.&lt;ref name=thimar/&gt;

The murals of [[Belfast]] and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition.&lt;ref name=rpmural/&gt; In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].

Many artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffiti artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles "[[Galang (song)|Galang]]" and "[[Bucky Done Gun]]", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=teleci/&gt; Graffiti artist [[John Fekner]], called "caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition" by writer [[Lucy Lippard]],&lt;ref name=lippard/&gt; was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's [[Urban decay|decaying]] urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.

=== Personal expression ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]Graffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.

With the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted "graffiti" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered "performance art" despite the image of the "singing and dancing star" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].

[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.&lt;ref name=banksy/&gt; He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.

[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.&lt;ref name=shaer/&gt; Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. "One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Radical and political ===
[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Graffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=souther/&gt; In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as "De Zoot", "Vendex", and "Dr Rat".&lt;ref name=stockho/&gt; To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.

The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' ("Read less, live more"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.

{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=—Sandra "Lady Pink" Fabara&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;}}

The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as "on the street" or "underground", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting&lt;ref name="ziptopia-switch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost-streetart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.

In some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops:  the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.

Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.&lt;ref name="voice" /&gt;
The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].&lt;ref name="tanyabaxter-Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes-banksy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a "[[ruling class]]" or "establishment" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.

One innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as "Death to the dictator". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as "Banks=Robbers", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.

Both sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.

The murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].

Territorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

=== As advertising ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Graffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.

Tech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company [[Darren Cullen#Graffiti Kings|Graffiti Kings]] based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11408538/HP-Sprout-is-this-the-future-of-desktop-computing.html|title=HP Sprout: is this the future of desktop computing?|newspaper= Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graffitikings.co.uk/hp-hewlett-packard-sprout-graffiti-kings/|title=
HP – Hewlett Packard Sprout &amp; Graffiti Kings|website= Graffitikings|date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.

Many graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than "paid for and legalised graffiti", and have risen against mainstream ads. The [[Graffiti Research Lab]] crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.

=== Offensive graffiti ===
[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]
Graffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).&lt;ref name=halsey/&gt; Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as "racist". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant "local code" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.&lt;ref name=holqu/&gt;
:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.&lt;ref name=kelling/&gt; A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.
Hence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),&lt;ref name=barker/&gt; these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.&lt;ref name=lynn/&gt;

Elsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manchester, England]] a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, the first art galleries to show graffiti artists to the public were [[Fashion Moda]] in [[the Bronx]], [[Now Gallery]] and [[Fun Gallery]], both in the [[East Village, Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="openedition-fashionmoda"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.openedition.org/rrca/601|title=From the Street to Art Galleries : How Graffiti Became a Legitimate Art Form|date=2014|accessdate=26 August 2018|journal=Open Edition|first=David|last=diallo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hyperallergic-fashionmoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/227683/35-years-after-fashion-moda-a-bronx-gallery-revisits-the-landmark-space/|title=35 Years After Fashion Moda, a Bronx Gallery Revisits the Landmark Space|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=26 August 2018|work=Hyperallergic|first= Tiernan |last= Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-fashionmoda"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/nyregion/recreating-the-fashion-moda-exhibition-of-1982.html|title=When a South Bronx Collective Went International|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=26 August 2018|newspaper=New York Times|first=SUSAN |last=HODARA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydaily-fashionmoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/fashion-moda-old-haven-artists-south-bronx-focus-special-event-saturday-article-1.1263587|title=The legacy of Fashion Moda, a shuttered art and  performance space, to be spotlighted  |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=New York Daily News|first=TANYANIKA |last=SAMUELS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nowgallery-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now-gallery.com|title=Now Gallery |accessdate=26 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="98bowery-basquiat-fun-gallery"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://98bowery.com/return-to-the-bowery/art-new-york-jean-michel-basquiat.php | title=Jean-Michel Basquiat Interview | work=98bowery| date=1982| accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 exhibition at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's [[outer boroughs]] and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, [[Keith Haring]], and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:&lt;ref name=tonyk/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion", he says, "and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls—it's free."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as "Walls of the World" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled "Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent..." (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].

In Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788–2000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.&lt;ref name=smithea/&gt;

Between March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris — a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].&lt;ref name=rfi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rohter/&gt;

Many graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist "[[Scape (graffiti artist)|Scape]]" published ''GRAFF; the Art &amp; Technique of Graffiti'', the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include ''Faith of Graffiti'' by Norman Mailer, ''Trespass'' by Taschen press,&lt;ref name=urbana/&gt; and the comic book by [[Elite Gudz]], ''Concrete Immortalz'', which has a graffiti artist as its main character.

Figurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=intmag/&gt; World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'', which explored street art and commercialism.

==Environmental effects==
[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint unto a surface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} As an alternative, [[moss graffiti]] is starting to catch on,&lt;ref name=envirog/&gt; which uses [[moss]] to create text or images. The moss is glued onto a surface by means of [[beer]], [[buttermilk]], or [[yogurt]] combined with [[sugar]].&lt;ref name=space/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetka/&gt;

== Government responses ==

=== Asia ===
In China, [[Mao Zedong]] in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanise the country's communist revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In Hong Kong, [[Tsang Tsou Choi]] was known as the ''King of Kowloon'' for his [[calligraphy]] graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.

In [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffiti artists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated "Graffiti Zones".&lt;ref name=taitimes/&gt; From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, "We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation.&lt;ref name=taitimes2/&gt; However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, "Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively."&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

In 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in "G-20" sounds like the Korean word for "rat", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, "an ominous creature like a rat" amounts to "an organized criminal activity" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]
In Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayrière supérieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].&lt;ref name=improb/&gt;

In September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.&lt;ref name=europa/&gt;

The [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing "on the spot" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=encams/&gt; The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.

To back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: "Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem."&lt;ref name=wire/&gt; However, since the early 1990s, the British graffiti scene has been struck by self-titled "art terrorist" Banksy, who has revolutionized the style of UK graffiti (bringing to the forefront stencils to aid the speed of painting), as well as the content; making his work largely satirical of the sociological state of cities, or the political climate of war, often using monkeys and rats as motifs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]] (as amended by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050016_en_1 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005]) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In July 2008, a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge was used to convict graffiti artists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation,&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit [[criminal damage]] costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

Some councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffiti artists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the 'spray and run.'&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt;

In [[Budapest]], Hungary both a city-backed movement called ''I Love Budapest'' and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graffiti tunnel 2009, University of Sydney.jpg|thumb|Graffiti Tunnel, University of Sydney at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (2009)]]
In an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by graffiti artists. One early example is the "Graffiti Tunnel" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create "art". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].&lt;ref name=warrin/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.&lt;ref name=towno/&gt; Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced "anti-graffiti squads", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.

Many state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.

[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.&lt;ref name=wato/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]
In February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].

====Tracker databases====
Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.&lt;ref name=crcp/&gt;

====Gang injunctions====
Many restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.&lt;ref name=crcp2 /&gt;

====Hotlines and reward programs====
To help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.&lt;ref name=lawtec/&gt;

====Search warrants====
When the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to "(tagger's name)," and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.&lt;ref name=paladin/&gt;

[[File:Íslenski faldbúningurinn 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Icelandic women in the 18th century ''faldbúningur'' with tail-caps. The one to the right omits the jacket and is thus wearing a ''upphlutur''.]]

'''Icelandic national costume''', collectively known in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as '''''Þjóðbúningurinn''''' has enjoyed various levels of popularity since the term was coined in [[Iceland]] in the 19th century, during the fight for independence. Since 2001 the [[national costume]] is regulated by ''Þjóðbúningaráð'' (The National Costume Authority), which preserves the correct techniques of making them and instructs people.

==Women's costume==
The five following types of costume are all recognized as Icelandic National costumes. However both the ''kyrtill'' and ''skautbúningur'' were designed in the 19th century from scratch as ceremonial costumes, while the ''faldbúningur'', ''peysuföt'' and the ''upphlutur'' are traditional daily wear of Icelandic women in olden times.

===Faldbúningur===
[[File:Gaimard12.jpg|thumb|150px|Icelandic woman in the 18th century ''faldbúningur'' with the ''spaðafaldur'' cap.]]
The ''Faldbúningur'' is an older type of costume worn by women since at least the 17th century and well into the 19th. In its most recognized form it incorporated a hat decorated with a curved sheet-like ornament protruding into the air and exists in two variants. One of which is the ''krókfaldur'' and the other is the ''spaðafaldur''. Previously a large hat decorated with gold-wire bands was worn with it, as well as [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]] which is the reason for the ''faldbúningur'''s wide collar, which was designed to support it. Later, around the start of the 18th century women started to wear the much simpler tail-cap with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2533668 Buningurinn.is - Faldbúningur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225032928/http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2533668 |date=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peysuföt===
[[File:Learning to Read by Sigurður málari.jpg|thumb|150px|Icelandic woman wearing ''peysuföt'' teaches a boy to read.]]
The ''Peysuföt'' are black woollen clothes commonly worn by women in the 18-19th century. They usually consisted of a twill skirt and a jacket of fine knitted woollen yearn with a black [[Icelandic tail-cap|tail cap]]. It is believed that this costume was invented when women, desiring simpler working clothes than the ''faldbúningur'', started to use male articles of clothing. This includes both the tail-cap and the ''peysa'' which originally was a jacket with a single row of buttons, but evolved into this costume and eventually discarded with the buttons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2256861 Buningurinn.is - 19th and 20th century peysuföt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upphlutur===
The ''Upphlutur'' is a woman's costume, consisting of bodice that can be coloured in bright colours such as red or blue, but often black. Its headpiece is a [[Icelandic tail-cap|tail cap]]. The costume is basically the undergarment of the ''faldbúningur'' which evolved into a costume of its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257131 Buningurinn.is - 19th-and 20th-century upphlutur]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kyrtill===
The ''Kyrtill'' is a costume for women, designed by the artist Sigurður Guðmundsson in the 19th century. It was designed to look like [[Viking age]] costumes. It however incorporates a hat similar to the one on the ''skautbúningur''. While Sigurður's vision of the Viking age costume remains popular, costumes designed to more closely resemble archaeological finds have gained some popularity as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257412 Buningurinn.is - Kyrtill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223113534/http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257412 |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skautbúningur===
The ''Skautbúningur'' was also designed by Sigurður Guðmundsson. It was conceived as a modernized variation of the ''faldbúningur'', which had fallen out of use by the middle of the 19th century. It incorporates a complicated hat inspired by the ones traditionally used with the ''faldbúningur''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257584 Buningurinn.is - Skautbúningur]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's costume==
''Búningur karla'' or the Men's costume exists in three or four radically different versions. The ''þjóðbúningur karla'' is the only direct descendant of traditional daily wear of Icelandic men, while the other were designed from the start as ceremonial costume.

===Þjóðbúningur karla===
The one considered most traditional consists of woollen breeches or trousers, a usually double buttoned vest and a double buttoned jacket called ''treyja''. Sometimes a ''peysa'' with a single row of buttons is used in lieu of the vest and ''treyja''.  On the head is a [[Icelandic tail-cap|tail cap]], though historically different hats were also used. This costume was usually black, navy blue or dark green, although the vest, which was usually brighter was sometimes red, some regions stood out, using white wool instead of the darker colors. It is identical to the clothing Icelandic men commonly wore from the 17th until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fríður Ólafsdóttir, ''Íslensk karlmannsföt 1740-1850''. 1999. p. 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fornmannaklæði===
[[File:Johann Josefsson wearing Icelandic National Costume design.png|thumb|150px|The wrestler Jóhann Jósefsson wearing the ''fornmannaklæði'' in 1908.]]
In the middle of the 19th century, when many Icelandic men had taken to using continental clothing, [[Sigurður Guðmundsson]], an Icelandic artist, designed a costume for men which closely resembles 10th century Nordic clothing. While it attained some popularity at the time, it eventually disappeared until at the end of the 20th century when [[Viking]] culture and traditions have enjoyed increased popularity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Hátíðarbúningur===
[[File:Hátíðarbúningur karla.jpg|thumb|150px|An Icelandic man wears the ''hátíðarbúningur'' formal costume on his wedding day along with a [[boutonnière]].]]
Although not a traditional costume, the ''hátíðarbúningur'' was conceived as a modernized version of the men's traditional national costume and is frequently worn instead of a [[tuxedo]] to formal events. It is the result of a competition for an updated (i.e., more pragmatic) version of the men's national costume held in 1994 in correlation with the 50th anniversary of Iceland's independence from [[Denmark]] and the establishment of the [[republic]]. Some have critiqued the design of the ''hátíðarbúningur'', claiming that it bears greater resemblance to the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] national costume in its styling. Regardless, the ''hátíðarbúningur'' continues to enjoy widespread popularity among Icelanders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===The fourth costume===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Iceland19thcenturynationalcostume.png|thumb|50px|The 19th century national costume designed by Sigurður Guðmundsson.]] --&gt;
Sigurður Guðmundsson also designed another costume in the middle of the 19th century, which was commonly worn by students. It consisted of a black jacket, white shirt and black knee-breeches with horizontally striped or solid colored white socks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Children's costumes==
The ''búningur barna'' or the children's costumes did not differ from the adult's version (except in size) until the 20th century, when girls were given shorter skirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257941 Buningurinn.is - Children's costumes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223113539/http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2257941 |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shoes==
Although today, modern shoes are often used with the National Costumes, traditionally shoes made of either fish or sheep-skin, with woollen inlets, were worn with the costumes. These shoes are known as ''roðskór'' and ''sauðskinsskór'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buningurinn.is/main/view.jsp?branch=2550088 Buningurinn.is Orðabanki Skinnskór, sauðskinnsskór]&lt;/ref&gt; Some people also use 18th or 19th century type leather shoes with buckles similar to the footwear commonly used with the Faroese and Norwegian National Costumes.

==Usage==
In olden times these clothes, except the ''skautbúningur'', ''kyrtill'' and ''hátíðarbúningur'', were worn daily by people of all ages and classes. Today they are worn by many on ceremonial occasions such as the National day, Birthdays and Weddings.

They were founded in 2003, as a large rogue street gang in [[Otara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Michael|title=Killer Beez diss stings Dawn Raid|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/273458/Killer-Beez-diss-stings-Dawn-Raid|agency=Stuff News|date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a spin-off of the larger "Tribesmen" gang. The Killer Beez were formerly headed by Josh Marsters, a well-known [[Kickboxing|kickboxer]], also a former vice-president of the [[Tribesmen MC]].&lt;ref name="Gang boss badly beaten in prison"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lawrence|title=Gang boss badly beaten in prison|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/730774/Gang-boss-badly-beaten-in-prison|accessdate=30 January 2018|agency=Stuff News|date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insignia and Slang ==
===Insignia===
The Killer Beez emblem or "patch" consists of the words "Killer Beez" and "AO MOJO" that act as the surrounding [[Colors (motorcycling)#meaning|rockers]] for their ''Skull Fingers Up'' emblem of a [[The finger|middle finger]] extended upright with a partially extended thumb.  
Evident in all of the gangs music videos, released on the YouTube account [https://www.youtube.com/user/colourwayrecords/videos colourwayrecords], the gang predominantly wear black and yellow, the same colours used in their logo.

===Gang Slang===
Killer Beez members are commonly referred to as '''Killer(s)''' or simply as '''KB''' by those closely associated with the gang.&lt;ref name="Young Sid (Stuff)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Michael|title=Rapper Young Sid|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/profiles/272831/Rapper-Young-Sid|accessdate=30 January 2018|agency=Stuff News|publisher=Sunday Star Times|date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common phrase within the gang's music, as well as being used in its logo, is the term '''AO''', pronounced as separate letters, which is an acronym for the gang motto - '''A'''ll '''O'''ut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">:''This article is about an aspect of Caribbean folk culture. KONT can also refer to [[Ontario International Airport]].

'''Kont''' is a kind of [[Saint Lucia]]n folk song, performed as part of the funereal ceremony by mourners outside the deceased's house.  These mourners sing kont, a [[call-and-response|responsorial]] Creole song, accompanied by drumming.  The lyrics may refer to the last words or other aspects of the deceased's death.  Mourners also dance to both the débòt and [[bélé]], accompanied zo or [[tibwa]] and ka.

'''Kont''' is also a form of traditional [[storytelling]] of [[Dominica]], mostly performed at night-time festivals, wakes, festivals and other celebrations.  Kont storytellers use elements of local history and legend, and often provide moral or ethical messages.  A simple theme song, one line in length, frequently based on a duet between two characters, is an important recurrent element of kont storytelling.

'''''Megastructures''''' is a documentary television series appearing on the [[National Geographic Channel]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom, [[France 5]] in France, and [[7mate]] in Australia.

Each episode is an educational look of varying depth into the construction, [[Operations management|operation]], and [[Human resources|staffing]] of various structures or construction projects, but not ordinary construction products.

Generally containing interviews with [[designer]]s and [[project manager]]s, it presents the problems of construction and the methodology or techniques used to overcome obstacles. In some cases (such as the [[Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge]] and [[Petronas Towers]]) this involved the development of new materials or products that are now in general use within the construction industry.

''Megastructures'' focuses on constructions that are extreme; in the sense that they are the biggest, tallest, longest, or deepest in the world. Alternatively, a project may appear if it had an element of novelty or are a world first (such as [[Dubai]]'s [[Palm Islands]]). This type of project is known as a [[megaproject]].

The series follows similar subjects as the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' and [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Extreme Engineering]]'', covering areas of architecture, transport, construction and manufacturing.

A '''nontraditional student''' refers to a category of students at [[Higher education|colleges and universities]].

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) notes that there are varying definitions of nontraditional student. The term is defined in a general way to refer to postsecondary students who are 25 years old and older. Nontraditional students are contrasted with [[traditional student]]s, who enroll immediately after high school, are typically aged 18–22, attend full-time, live on campus, and do not have major work or family responsibilities.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"&gt;[https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002012.pdf National Center for Education Statistics. "Nontraditional Undergraduates", Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. (p. 2) Accessed 30 Sept 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pascarella|first1=Ernest T.|last2=Terenzini|first2=Patrick T|title=Studying College Students in the 21st Century: Meeting New Challenges|journal=The Review of Higher Education|date=Winter 1998|volume=21|issue=2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCES categorized anyone who satisfies at least one of the following as a nontraditional student:&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"/&gt;

*Delays enrollment (does not enter postsecondary education in the same calendar year that he or she finished high school)
*Attends [[Part-time learner in higher education|part-time]] for at least part of the academic year
*Works full-time (35 hours or more per week) while enrolled
*Is considered financially independent for purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid
*Has dependents other than a spouse (usually children, but may also be caregivers of sick or elderly family members)
*Is a single parent (either not married or married but separated and has dependents)
*Does not have a high school diploma (completed high school with a GED or other high school completion certificate or did not finish high school)

By this definition, the NCES determined that 73% of all undergraduates in 1999–2000 could be considered nontraditional, representing the newly "typical" undergraduate.&lt;ref name="nces" /&gt; This remained consistent the following years: 72% in 2003–2004, 72% for 2007–2008, and 74% for 2011–2012.&lt;ref name="Radford, A. W. 2015"&gt;Radford, A. W., Cominole, M., &amp; Skomsvold, P. (2015). Demographic and enrollment characteristics of nontraditional undergraduates: 2011-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nontraditional student designation is also used in a specialized way to refer to socially or educationally disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=K.A.|title=ERIC review: Exploring the meaning of "nontraditional" at the community college|journal=Community College Review|date=2002|volume=30|issue=1|pages=74–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuetze|first=Hans G.|last2=Slowey|first2=Maria|date=2002|title=Participation and exclusion: A comparative analysis of non-traditional students and lifelong learners in higher education|url=|journal=Higher Education (2002) 44: 309.|volume=44|issue=3-4|pages=309–327|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is uncertain exactly how or when the term “nontraditional student” was first incorporated into educational language. However, it is thought that [[K. Patricia Cross]] is responsible for the phrase becoming the accepted and appropriate term to describe adult students.&lt;ref name=llearner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross-Gordon|first=J.M.|title=Research on adult learners: Supporting the needs of a student population that is no longer nontraditional.|journal=Association of American Colleges and Universities|year=2011|volume=29|pages=1|url=http://www.aacu.org/peerreview/pr-wi11/prwi11_rossgordon.cfm|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The typical college student is not an 18-year-old, full-time student who enrolls immediately after high school, lives on-campus and who has limited family, work, and financial obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/Nontraditional-Students-Facts-2011.pdf Yesterday's Nontraditional Student is Today's Traditional Student]. Center for Law and Social Policy, June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Regarding the 2011-2012 demographics distribution of nontraditional undergraduate students in the United States, the following were identified by the National Center for Education Statistics:&lt;ref name="Radford, A. W. 2015"/&gt;
* 49% dependent and 51% independent
* 28% has dependent(s) and 72% has no dependent
* 15% single with dependent and 85% single with no dependent
* 91% high school graduate and 9% high school equivalency
* 66% delayed postsecondary enrollment less than one year and 34% delayed postsecondary enrollment one year or more
* 57% fulltime student 43% part-time student
* 26% worked full time, 36% worked part time, and 38% did not work.

In 1999–2000, the most common nontraditional characteristics included financial independence (51 percent),  part-time attendance (48 percent), and delayed enrollment (46 percent).&lt;ref&gt;[https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002012.pdf National Center for Education Statistics. "Nontraditional Undergraduates", Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. (p. 3) Accessed 09 July 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCES divides tertiary educational institutions into three categories: public, private-non-profit, and private-for-profit (PFP). With regard to the age demographic of students enrolled in these institutions, the NCES uses three age categories: under 25, between 25 and 34, and 35 and older. According to its most recent publication, in a section called ''The Condition of Education 2013,"''most nontraditional students are enrolled in PFP’s. In fact, for the fall enrollment in 2011, in four-year PFP institutions 71% full-time and 78% part-time students were at least 25 years old or older. In two-year PFP institutions, 52% full-time and 61% part-time students were also included in this 'nontraditional' category."&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;[https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002012.pdf National Center for Education Statistics. "Nontraditional Undergraduates", Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. (p. 146-7) Accessed 30 Sept 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special characteristics==
Nontraditional students frequently have different characteristics than traditional students, experience different barriers, and have different instructional and campus support needs than traditional students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasworm|first1=Carol E.|title=Setting the Stage: Adults in Higher Education|journal=New Directions for Student Services|date=2003|volume=2003|issue=102|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serving adult learners in higher education: Principles of effectiveness. Executive summary|date=2000|publisher=Council for Adult and Experiential Learning|location=Chicago, IL|url=https://www.instituteofhealthscience.org/pdf/Adult_Learners_in_Education.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panacci|first1=Adam G.|title=Adult Students in Mixed-Age Postsecondary Classrooms: Implications for Instructional Approaches|journal=College Quarterly|date=2017|volume=20|issue=2|url=http://collegequarterly.ca/2017-vol20-num02-spring/adult-students-in-mixed-age-postsecondary-classroom-implications-for-instructional-approaches.html|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many institutions offer [[List of programs and colleges for non-traditional students|programs for nontraditional students]] and services in response to their specific needs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles in Practice: Assessing Adult Learning Focused Institutions. Case Studies|date=2005|publisher=Council for Adult and Experiential Learning|location=Chicago, IL|url=http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/617695/22_ALFI_Case_Study.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is frequently observed that traditional higher education programs and policies are geared toward, and the outcome of, the previous era when traditional students were the main market for higher education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chao|first=E.

Situational barriers most frequently experienced by adult nontraditional students typically include managing multiple conflicting responsibilities in addition to their studies (e.g., life and work responsibilities and roles), financial problems and limited financial aid options for nontraditional students, lack of adequate and affordable childcare services, and lack of support from others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Attitudinal barriers most frequently identified in research include low self-esteem and negative attitudes about being an adult learner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Barriers related to academic skills most frequently discussed in the literature include a lack of knowledge and experience in literacy, numeracy, and computer-related skills, accessing and understanding information, critical and reflective thinking, essay writing, and writing examinations and tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Planet Hulk'''" is a [[Marvel Comics]] storyline that ran primarily through issues of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' started in 2006. It dealt with the Marvel heroes' decision to send the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] away, his acclimation to and conquest of the planet where he landed, and his efforts to return to Earth to take his revenge.

There was also a special ''Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook'' publication by [[Anthony Flamini]] and the storyline's main writer [[Greg Pak]], similar to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' detailing the characters, races and cultures within the storyline.

Elements from the storyline have been adapted into other media, including an [[Marvel Animated Features#Planet Hulk|animated film of the same name]], as well as the live action film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.

==Publication history==
The storyline's main writer [[Greg Pak]] describes the origin of the ideas: "The inspiration for sending Hulk to an alien planet where he'd battle monsters as a gladiator came from Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]]. I loved the idea from the minute I heard it, so I was blown away when they told me I had the gig and even more blown away when they basically cut me loose to create the whole world."&lt;ref name=cbr8093&gt;{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=8093 |title=Green World: Pak talks "Incredible Hulk" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew from real-world history: "I got inspiration for the story by reading about the real lives of gladiators in ancient Rome and from the stories of figures like [[Genghis Khan]] and more contemporary warlords, dictators, and political leaders. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War|Art of War]]'' and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[Power of Myth]]'' played a big role in helping me think through other aspects of the story.&lt;ref name=cbr8093 /&gt;

The story's roots began in the ''New Avengers: Illuminati'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] and ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #88-91. The main storyline was told in ''Incredible Hulk'' #92-105, and  ''Giant-Size Hulk'' vol 2 #1.

It led directly to the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' crossover, and inspired the ''Son of Hulk'' series.

The story was re-examined in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]: Planet Hulk''.

In October of 2017, a sequel, titled ''Return to the Planet Hulk'', starring [[Amadeus Cho]] as the Hulk, was released as a part of Marvel's ''[[Marvel Legacy]]'' initiative.

==Plot==

===Build up===
When a Gamma bomb causes the [[Incredible Hulk|Hulk]] to lose control and attack Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four #533-535,&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers: Illuminati'' one-shot&lt;/ref&gt; They trick him into entering orbit to destroy a rogue satellite, and then use a shuttle to jettison him from the solar system. They intended for him to land on a peaceful planet, but the shuttle passes through a wormhole on its way.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planet Hulk===
As Hulk listens to a recording from the Illuminati explaining their actions, his shuttle crashes on the planet [[List of planets in Marvel Comics#Sakaar|Sakaar]]. Weakened from the crash, Hulk is fixed with an obedience disk and taken into slavery. He is forced to fight gladiator battles for the planet's emperor, the [[Red King (Marvel Comics)|Red King]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #92&lt;/ref&gt; Hulk forms a [[warbound]] pact with his fellow gladiators [[Miek]], no-name [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], [[Elloe Kaifi]], Lavin Skee, [[Hiroim]] and [[Korg (comics)|Korg]].

Hulk becomes a popular hero for his actions in the arena, and a group of insurgents try to recruit the Hulk to their cause.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #93&lt;/ref&gt; The Hulk declines, but Elloe chooses to go with the rebels.

During their next gladiator fight, Lavin Skee is killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #94&lt;/ref&gt; As the others come closer to winning their freedom, the Red King's lieutenant, [[Caiera]], arranges for them to fight the Silver &lt;!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.--&gt;Surfer, who is also controlled by an obedience disk. During the battle, the Hulk breaks the Silver&lt;!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.--&gt; Surfer's disk, freeing him. The Silver&lt;!--Do NOT change this to Beta Ray Bill, he was NOT in the comic book.--&gt; Surfer then destroys all the obedience disks of everyone in the arena. As he leaves Sakaar, he offers to return Hulk to Earth. Hulk chooses to stay behind.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #95&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hulk and his warbound, now on the run from the Red King, are hunted by Caiera. As they travel through villages, Hulk finds followers who believe he is the foretold savior, "Sakaarson." Hulk denies this title. Caiera finally confronts the Hulk, but their battle is interrupted by an invasion of "spikes" that cause monstrous mutations and death to anyone they touch. Caiera calls the Red King for assistance and learns that he ordered the spikes to be deployed there. Horrified at what her king has done, Caiera joins the Hulk.

Hulk leads a raid on the Red King's capital, culminating in a one-on-one battle between the two of them. The Red King is defeated, and Hulk is named the new king. He takes Caiera for his wife, and the two are able to broker peace among the various conflicts which had festered under the Red King. Caiera becomes pregnant with Hulk's child.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #104&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the shuttle that brought Hulk to Sakaar is being turned into a monument. As part of its self-destruct sequence, the antimatter [[warp core]] engine detonates in a massive explosion. The whole city is destroyed, and Caiera dies. Enraged and blaming the Avengers who built the shuttle for the damage, Hulk and his warbound leave Sakaar and head for Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Arriving on Earth, Hulk and the warbound begin [[World War Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;''World War Hulk'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakaar rebuilds after the explosion with the help of Hulk's two surviving sons, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].&lt;ref&gt;''Son of Hulk'' #1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret Wars (2015)===
{{Plot|date=January 2017}}
The 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' crossover included a miniseries titled "Planet Hulk" written by [[Sam Humphries]] and penciled by [[Marc Laming]]. It follows a variation of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and a variation of [[Devil Dinosaur]] as they fight their way through the [[Battleworld]] domain of Greenland, a region filled with an assortment of Hulks.&lt;ref&gt;February 12, 2015 "[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=59239 EXCLUSIVE: Humphries Invades Planet Hulk with Steve Rogers &amp; Devil Dinosaur]", Comic Book Resources (accessed May 29, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an alternate Marvel Universe, Dr. Bruce Banner (who has no alter ego) owns a large technology business known as Bannertech. The headquarters is a city of the future where [[Amadeus Cho]] (who works at Bannertech), performs unauthorized gamma experiments on animals. Dr. Banner and Amadeus are alerted by S.H.I.E.L.D. that the Gamma Bomb in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s possession has been stolen and launched by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Bruce attempts to evacuate the city of the future whilst Amadeus tries to hijack the bomb. The bomb ultimately crashes into the Bannertech tower, destroying it and catching evacuating employees in its blast radius. Dr. Banner and his employees are turned green, but they are relieved that they are alive. Amadeus is not seen again. The employees and Dr. Banner suddenly mutate into various Hulk creatures. When the various Marvel universes collide, a section of this Earth including the inhabiting Hulks become the region of Battleworld known as Greenland. Sometime after the creation of Battleworld, Doctor Doom has his Thor Corps perform a mission for him. As they fly over the Mud Kingdom in Greenland, they are attacked by the Hulks who live there. The Hulks' primitive weapons anger the Thor Corps who stop the attack by destroying the Hulks' homes. The Thor Corps then leave as they were told to contain battles, but not to interfere. Meanwhile, in God Emperor Doom's Killiseum in Doomstadt, Steve Rogers and [[Devil Dinosaur]] win their twelfth fight. Whilst being congratulated by Arcade, they attempt to interrogate him to find where [[Bucky Barnes]] currently is. Their attempt fails and Steve is summoned by God Emperor Doom. [[Doctor Strange|Sheriff Strange]] offers Steve a chance to live on behalf of God Emperor Doom. Steve must travel to Greenland, kill the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red King]], and rescue Bucky from him. Steve takes Devil Dinosaur with him and they are teleported by Doctor Strange to Greenland. Upon arrival, they are meant to meet with an operative. However, they are attacked by gamma-irradiated bugs. Steve and Devil Dinosaur are saved by a Hulk named Doc Green who fires a powerful laser cannon killing the bugs.&lt;ref&gt;''Planet Hulk'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon getting acquainted with the Captain and the Devil after they woke up, Doc Green agrees to become their guide in Greenland to help them navigate it and rescue Bucky from the Red King. During a flashback in an unknown kingdom, the Captain and Bucky are racing through the rubble in the streets of a war-torn city. A missile blows up the ground in front of Bucky. Steve digs Bucky out of the rubble. Steve picks up Bucky and starts to carry him to safety. Bucky says that they need to get underground. Bucky then suggests that he and Steve enlist to fight. Steve comments that they are both beanpoles and have no business fighting. Bucky points to a picture of The Falcon as Captain America in a propaganda poster for the Super Soldier program. Steve says it is nothing but a pipe dream. On their way to the Mud Kingdom, Doc Green saves the Captain and Devil from a Hulk-Eating Plant. The Captain and Doc Green were then attacked by Bull Hulks and separated from Devil. Upon ending up in the Gamma Lake after escaping into the river and going over the waterfall, the Captain and Doc Green were attacked by a giant aquatic creature called a Sea Hulk that grabs the Captain with its tentacle. Doc Green then quotes "There you are. Come out and play."&lt;ref&gt;''Planet Hulk'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

As Doc Green tried to get to the Captain, the Devil showed up and attacked the Sea Hulk, killing it by biting off part of its neck during the fight. The incident put them off course, leaving them with two choices: circle back around the Fang Mountains which would take three days or cut straight to the Mud Kingdom by going through the Barrens of the Tribal Hulks where the Tribal Hulks dwell. The Captain decided to go through the Barrens of the Tribal Hulk as it was the faster route. In their way through the Barrens, they saw a wall made of the skulls of the people who died in the civil war between the Mud Kingdom and the Tribal Hulks. Doc Green said that the gamma only revealed what's already within each living being: an obsession with war and violence. It was the reality everyone denied. He then began to mock the Captain by saying it would be no different with him if he got corrupted by gamma as he was already doing God Emperor Doom's dirty work. But Captain said he wouldn't as he planned to find and free Bucky without killing the Red King. As a storm approached them, they took shelter inside a cave and were attacked and captured by the Tribal Hulks.&lt;ref&gt;''Planet Hulk'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Captain was taken by the Tribal Hulks to the Mud Kingdom to be sold as an slave, but was rescued by Doc Green before the Tribal Hulks could do so. After they got to the top of a structure, Doc Green pointed at the Red King's castle where Bucky was being held. Doc Green warned the Captain that it was not like the time when he and Bucky stole pies from grandma Hubbard. Surprised, the Captain asked him how he did know about that and who he was before he turned into a Hulk. Before Doc Green could answer, the Devil returned to help the Captain. With his help, the Captain invaded the castle and confronted the Red King. The Captain told him about his mission, but said that if he resealed Bucky, he would them spare his life. The Red King revealed that God Emperor Doom had lied to him and that he had sent Bucky's head to Doomsgard a month ago. He then grabbed the severed bionic arm of Bucky and said that Bucky wasn't his prisoner, but his trophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Planet Hulk'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red King then tried to convince Rogers to join his army to take God Emperor Doom down, as he was the one responsible for Bucky's death, however, he was attacked and killed by Rogers instead. Doc Green showed up afterwards, congratulating the Captain for the completion of his mission. With the Red King dead, Doc Green would take his place and rule the Mud Kingdom as God Emperor Doom had planned. The Captain started to argue with him as he knew that Bucky was already dead and manipulated him into thinking otherwise in order to get the mission done, while Doc Green mocked him by having succumbed to the Hulk inside himself just like him. Rogers said he wasn't anything like Doc Green. In order to prove him wrong, Doc Green returns to his human form of a Steve Rogers from a domain similar to the one the Captain came from where his Bucky died and he became a Hulk. Doc Green taunted a confused Captain about how Bucky made him weak and because of his loyalty to him he would leave him to rule the Greenland. The Captain responded that Bucky had made him brave enough to do what must be done and killed Doc Green. The Captain then threw the severed head of the Red King in front of the Tribal Hulks which ended the battle between them and Devil. After grieving their companion's death, the Captain and the Devil left the Mud Kingdom behind.&lt;ref&gt;''Planet Hulk'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

* The Sakaarans appear in [[Marvel Studios]]' film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/306737-guardians-of-the-galaxy-from-the-set-of-the-marvel-studios-adaptation/3|title=Guardians of the Galaxy: From the Set of the Marvel Studios Adaptation|last=Perry|first=Spencer|publisher=[[Superhero Hype!]]|date=July 8, 2014|accessdate=July 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QxBCjJLL?url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/306737-guardians-of-the-galaxy-from-the-set-of-the-marvel-studios-adaptation/3|archivedate=July 10, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of them managed to lead a slave revolt before returning to Asgard to stop [[Hela (comics)|Hela]].&lt;ref name="TotalFilmSakaar"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2017|title=2017 Hit List|journal=[[Total Film]]|volume= |issue=254|pages=82|via=[http://mcuexchange.com/planet-hulks-sakaar-confirmed-for-thor-ragnarok/ MCU Exchange] [https://www.webcitation.org/6muiDsc8r?url=http://mcuexchange.com/planet-hulks-sakaar-confirmed-for-thor-ragnarok/ Archived] from the original on December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Germany}}
The '''political culture of Germany''' as of the early 21st century is known for the popular expectation for governments to ensure a degree of [[social welfare]], business and labour corporatism and a multiparty system dominated by [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[social democratic]] forces, with a strong influence of smaller [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]], [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[socialism|socialist]] parties. Coalition governments are predominant on both the federal and the state level exemplifying the German desire for consensus politics instead of one party majority rule as in democracies that follow the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]]. Although this consensus culture is beneficial insofar as it enables minority groups to take part in political discussions and decision making, it often leads to situations in which different interest groups blockade each other resulting in political gridlocks. Political decision making is further complicated by the powers held by the German states and the presence of a judicial branch with the power to review and dismiss legislation. Therefore political power in Germany is not concentrated in the hands of one or a small number of individuals but spread thinly. Even the Chancellor can only set general guidelines for federal policies ([[Richtlinienkompetenz]]) and has to negotiate with many other politicians and interest groups when there is a need to take concrete measures.

'''Pure alexia''', also known as '''agnosic alexia''' or '''alexia without agraphia''' or '''pure word blindness''', is one form of [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]] which makes up "the peripheral dyslexia" group.&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coslett HB |title=Acquired dyslexia |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |year=2000 |pmid=11149697 |doi=10.1055/s-2000-13174 |url=https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2000-13174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have pure alexia have severe reading problems while other language-related skills such as naming, oral repetition, auditory comprehension or writing are typically intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrmann M, Shomstein SS, Black SE, Barton JJ |title=The eye movements of pure alexic patients during reading and nonreading tasks |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=983–1002 |year=2001 |pmid=11516450 |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00021-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Pure alexia results from cerebral lesions in circumscribed brain regions and therefore belongs to the group of acquired reading disorders, [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]],&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"/&gt; as opposed to [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]] found in children who have difficulties in learning to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Temple CM |title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=898–910 |date=August 2006 |pmid=17131596 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70434-9 |url=http://www.cortexjournal.net/article/S0010-9452%2808%2970434-9/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Pure alexia almost always involves an infarct to the left [[posterior cerebral artery]] (which perfuses the [[splenium of the corpus callosum]] and left [[visual cortex]], among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia – i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written).  However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-23939-0|page=501|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex ([[occipital lobe]]) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas ([[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], etc.) in the left brain because of the damage to the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do have a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. |title= Treatment for Alexia With Agraphia Following Left Ventral Occipito-Temporal Damage: Strengthening Orthographic Representations Common to Reading and Spelling.  |journal= JSLHR |year=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posterior cerebral artery is a main local for the cause of this deficit because this artery is not just responsible for itself. It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R.|title= Visual Attention in Posterior Stroke and Relations to Alexia |journal= Neuropsychologia |date=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="Imaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imaging|url= http://ophthalmology.stanford.edu/blog/archives/imaging/ |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;

These people typically adapt to their disability and are able to use a style of compensatory reading known as letter-by-letter reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexia|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/friedmar/alexia.html|website=Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory|publisher=Center for Aphasia Research and Rehabilitation|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of reading takes longer than the conventional style of reading does. As the number of letters in a word increases, the amount of time it takes for the person with pure alexia increases. For each letter that is added, a patient may take up to an additional three seconds to read the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montant|first1=Marie|last2=Behrmann|first2=Marlene|title=Pure Alexia|journal=Neurocase|date=2000|volume=6|pages=265–294|url=https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~behrmann/dlpapers/MontantBehrmann.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|doi=10.1080/13554790008402777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that pure alexia may be a result of a disconnection syndrome. Analysis of diffusion images showed that the visual word form area (VWFA) is connected to the occipital lobe via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a projection that runs between the temporal and occipital lobe. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) showed that two weeks after surgery in the ILF, the VWFA-Occipital Lobe tract was severely degenerated. The results came from an epileptic patient who showed symptoms of pure alexia after his surgery. Thus, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that the ILF lesion interferes with transmission of visual information to the VWFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epelbaum|first1=S.|title=Pure alexia as a disconnection syndrome: New diffusion imaging evidence for an old concept|journal=Cortex|date=2008|volume=44|issue=8|pages=962–974|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.05.003|pmid=18586235}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, an alternative view that suggests the "VWFA" is devoted to processing of high acuity foveal input, which is particularly salient for complex visual stimuli like letter strings. Studies have highlighted disrupted processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli after damage to the left pFG, both for familiar and unfamiliar objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Woollams|first2=AM|last3=Kim|first3=E|last4=Beeson|first4=PM|last5=Rapcsak|first5=SZ|last6=Lambon Ralph|first6=MA|title=Efficient Visual Object and Word Recognition Relies on High Spatial Frequency Coding in the Left Posterior Fusiform Gyrus: Evidence from a Case-Series of Patients with Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex Damage|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=24 August 2012|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2568–2580|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs224|pmid=22923086|pmc=3792736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Kim|first3=ES|last4=Tainturier|first4=MJ|last5=Beeson|first5=PM|last6=Rapcsak|first6=SZ|last7=Woollams|first7=AM|title=Processing deficits for familiar and novel faces in patients with left posterior fusiform lesions|journal=Cortex|date=November 2015|volume=72|pages=79–96|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2015.02.003|pmid=25837867|pmc=4643682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure alexia exhibits some unexpected residual abilities despite the inability to read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with "8 – 6", and he or she would read it as "five minus four", but still come up with the correct answer "two" with greater than chance accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L.|title=Calculating Without Reading: Unsuspected Residual Abilities In Pure Alexia|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=2000|volume=17|issue=6|pages=563–583|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/02643290050110656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Woollams|first3=AM|title=When does less yield more?

However, this may be due to right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coslett|first1=H.B.|title=Evidence For Preserved Reading In ‘Pure Alexia’|journal=Brain|date=1989|volume=112|issue=2|pages=327–359|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/brain/112.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In patients, a common symptom is letter-by-letter reading or LBL. This action is a compensatory strategy which these patients use in order to come up with a semblance of reading.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; It is essentially looking at the consonants and vowels of the word and sounding them out as they sound. However, this method does not always work, especially for words like 'phone' where the ph sounds like an f, but if sounded out, does not sound like an f. Also, by reading words in the fashion, the rate at which patients read words is much slower compared to people who do not have this disability. Petersen et al. proved that the issue of reading time had more to do with the length of the words than reading ability. The team had 4 patients with right hemisphere damage and 4 patients with left hemisphere damage in the temporo-occipital lobes as well as 26 controls were shown one word at a time on a screen. They were exposed to 20 words of 3 and 5 letters, 12 words of 7 letters. The subjects were asked to read the words as quickly and as accurately as possible. The patients with left hemisphere lesions consistently read the longer words slower than the controls despite the difficulty of the word.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; It is thought that as the word gets longer, the letters on the outsides of the word go into peripheral vision, making the patient shift their attention thus making the patient take longer to read.

==Rehabilitation==
Though there have been ample attempts to rehabilitate patients with pure alexia, few have proven to be effective on a large scale. Most rehabilitation practices have been specialized to a single patient or small patient group. At the simplest level, patients seeking rehabilitation are asked to practice reading words aloud repeatedly. This is meant to stimulate the damaged system of the brain. This is known as multiple oral re-reading (MOR) treatment. This is a text-based approach that is implemented in order to prevent patients from LBL reading. MOR works by reading aloud the same text repeatedly until certain criteria are reached.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; The most important criteria for a pure alexic patient is reading at an improved rate. The treatment aims to shift patients away from the LBL reading strategy by strengthening links between visual input and the associated orthographic representations. This repetition supports the idea of using top-down processing initially minimize the effects peripheral processing which were demonstrated in the study above.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imaging"/&gt; From here, the goal is to increase bottom-up processing. This will hopefully aid in word recognition and promote interactive processing of all available information to support reading. 'The supported reading stimulation from MOR has a rehabilitative effect so that reading rate and accuracy are better for untrained text, and word-form recognition improves as evidenced by a reduced word-length effect.'&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; These tactics have seen quite good success. 
Another tactic that has been employed is the use of cross modal therapy. In this therapy, patients are asked to trace the words in which they are trying to read aloud. There has been success using cross modal therapy such as kinaesthetic or motor-cross cuing therapy, but tends to be a more feasible approach for those on the slower reading end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leff|first1=Alexander P.|last2=Schofield|first2=T.

A '''showroom''' is a large space used to display products or show entertainment.

==Marketing location==
[[Image:Concesionario de Mercedes-Benz, Múnich, Alemania, 2013-03-30, DD 25.JPG|thumb|right|[[Car dealership]] showroom]]
[[File:-01 Kartel showrooms.jpg |thumb|right|[[Kartell]] showroom in  Via Turati, [[Milan]], [[Italy]]]]
A showroom is a large space used to display products for sale, such as [[automotive showroom|automobiles]], [[furniture]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[carpet]] or [[apparel]]. It is a [[retail store]] of a company in which products are on sale in a space created by their brand or company. A showroom can also be a space for wholesale buyers to view fashion merchandise for sale in their retail stores.

The world's most famous locations for a showroom, generally in the form of a [[business cluster|cluster]], are the [[Champs Elysees]] in Paris or [[Merchandise Mart]] in Chicago,{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One of the world's largest showrooms is the {{convert|35000|m2}} BMW showroom in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;Horatiu Boeriu, ''[http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/02/21/bmw-opens-largest-showroom-worldwide-in-abu-dhabi/ BMW opens largest showroom worldwide in Abu Dhabi]'', BMW blog, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carscoops, ''[http://www.carscoops.com/2012/02/world-largest-bmw-showroom-opens-in-abu.html World's Largest BMW Showroom Opens in Abu Dhabi, Best Selling Model in the M.E. is the 7-Series]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest collection of showrooms is a {{convert|216000|m2|sing=on}} car showroom in [[Istanbul]] called [[Autopia Europia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Buildings Directory, ''[http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 Autopia Europia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012922/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibz.com, [http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom Autopia Europia, The World’s Biggest Car Dealership, Will Have A Circuit On The Roof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025632/http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment venue==
A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a [[performance]].  Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] showroom used for the [[rock opera]] ''[[Starlight Express]]'' was customized by pouring [[concrete]] ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area.

Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is [[lease]]d to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner.

== Temporary showroom ==
In fashion capitals such as [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Milan]] or [[London]] one can find temporary showrooms. 
These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of [[event management]] agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be [[Pop-up retail|pop-up stores]], which are short-term sales spaces.

==Augmented reality showroom==
Automobile manufacturer [[Ferrari]] has recently introduced [[augmented reality]] technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/ferrari-augmented-reality-showroom-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound art''' is an artistic discipline in which [[sound]] is utilised as a primary [[artistic medium|medium]]. Like many genres of [[contemporary art]], sound art may be [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, or be used in [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms. Sound art can be considered as being an element of many areas such as [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[electronics]], [[noise music]], audio [[Recording medium|media]], [[Field recording|found or environmental sound]], soundscapes, explorations of the human body, [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[film]] or [[video]] and other aspects of the current discourse of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn. 2001, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western art]], early examples include [[Luigi Russolo]]'s ''[[Intonarumori]]'' or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by [[Dadaists]], [[Surrealists]], the [[Situationist International]], and in [[Fluxus]] [[happenings]]. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of [[visual art]] or [[experimental music]] categories, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Licht 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are [[conceptual art]], [[minimalism]], [[site-specific art]], [[sound poetry]], [[electro-acoustic music]], [[spoken word]], [[avant-garde]] poetry, and [[experimental theatre]].

==Origin of the term in the United States==
The earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called "Sound/Art" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983.  The show was sponsored by "The SoundArt Foundation," which Hellerman founded in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The artists featured in the show were: [[Vito Acconci]], Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, [[Nicolas Collins]], [[Sari Dienes]] and [[Pauline Oliveros]], Richard Dunlap, [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, [[Richard Lerman]], [[Les Levine]], [[Joe Lewis (artist)|Joe Lewis]], Tom Marioni, [[Jim Pomeroy (artist)|Jim Pomeroy]], Alan Scarritt, [[Carolee Schneeman]], Bonnie Sherk, [[Keith Sonnier]], Norman Tuck, [[Hannah Wilke]], Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: "It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that "hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought."&lt;ref&gt;Hellerman and Goddard 1983, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound art always takes place in an acoustic context, which may influence interpretation as much as if not more than any associated imagery. Installations of sound art rely on the acoustics of the spaces and reproduction technologies employed as can be exemplified by current practitioners such as Chris Watson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Sound art in Europe==
===Belgium===
The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of [[Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof]] is the biggest sound art collection in [[public space]] in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others. Yearly in [[Kortrijk]] there is the sound art festival [[Wilde Westen]] (formerly known as Happy New Ears). In [[Brussels]] there are [[QO2]] and [[Overtoon]], two organisations that run [[artist-in-residence]] programs and organize events. [[Logos Foundation]] from [[Ghent]] is a sound art org run by [[Godfried-Willem Raes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

A '''strip game''' is a [[party game]], usually involving more than one player, where a player is required to remove clothes when they lose a card hand, points in a game, or otherwise fail to come out ahead. Most [[board game]]s, [[card game]]s, [[sports]], or other games, can be adopted to create a stripping variant. A classic example is [[strip poker]], the [[Striptease|strip]] variant of [[poker]].

Strip games can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups and may be intended to generate an atmosphere of fun and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere by creating sexual excitement. Like other adult or [[Adolescence|adolescent]] party games, activities besides removing clothing and playing cards might be involved. ("[[Truth or Dare?]]" type options are often included.)

Strip games are comparable to [[drinking game]]s, in which players are required to match game losses with the drinking of a certain amount of alcohol.

==Features==
In a strip variant of a game, players, in addition to losing points according to the normal rules of the game, are also required to incrementally remove their clothing. The number of garments removed depends on the particular rules being used, but typically one piece is removed per loss or per point lost. As there are many variants of each game, the rules which will be followed on each occasion will need to be made clear, especially if there are new players. A rule which will need to be clear is when a game is to stop. For example, players can agree for the game to stop when a player is in their underwear, has only one article left or is naked or for the game to continue until only one player is left with some clothes on; and if any player can pull out if they feel uncomfortable. Other rules which will be made clear is when a player must remove clothing, as well as what constitutes "clothing" (for example, whether a pair of shoes or socks is one article or two, and whether jewelry, sunglasses or other accessories are clothing).

Generally, players will start wearing the same number of articles of clothing, though that is not necessary. It must be made clear as to what happens when a player has removed all their clothes. For example, the person may be permitted to put their clothes back on and continue playing, or the person may continue playing without clothes, until everybody has removed their clothing, or for the game to stop at that point, with the players either putting clothes back on, or remaining unclothed or semi-clothed for the rest of the evening.

Unlike their traditional variants, strip games are usually not played until the last player is removed from the game by being outscored by other players, instead players are removed from the game when they have no further garments left to take off or refuse to take off further garments.

These variations of rules are introduced in order to make game play more enticing, get more players involved, and keep guests entertained, especially during parties where alcohol is already being consumed. Unlike its traditional counterpart, the strip game becomes significantly more exciting the longer it progresses, as players are anticipating the losers to be fully or partially [[nude]], depending on the rules of the game.

As with drinking games, the strip game is usually not drawn out until the players are fully undressed or completely intoxicated, instead the players usually withdraw from the game voluntarily beforehand, depending on the degree of their personal [[Social inhibition|inhibition]]s, as well as the general social atmosphere.

==Examples==
The rules of many card and board games can be altered to produce a strip variant. Traditional casino games, such as [[blackjack]] and [[poker]], as well as games often played at [[Party|parties]], such as [[Scrabble]][http://www.alcanthang.com/poker/strip_scrabble.jpg], [[Bullshit (game)|Bullshit]], [[Speed (card game)|Speed]], [[chess]], [[Yahtzee]], [[Shithead (card game)|Shithead]], and many others can be varied to include a stripping aspect.

===Strip poker===
{{main|Strip poker}}
Strip poker is played like regular varieties of [[poker]], except that players remove an article of clothing when they lose a round. Any form of poker can be adapted to a strip form; however, it is usually played with simple variants with few betting rounds, like [[five-card draw]].

===Strip Snap===
Based on that most simple of card games "snap" where two players simultaneously place a card face up on the table. If the cards are the same they must shout "snap". The winner is the one who shouts "snap" correctly first. A player also wins if the other player incorrectly shouts snap. As with standard snap, the winner takes all cards on the table. But in this case the loser also removes an item of clothing. A player loses either when they have removed all their clothes or the other player accumulates all the cards, at which point the loser must remove the last of their clothes. 

Instead of shouting "Snap" the players can shout "strip" which some believe adds to the atmosphere. 

Usually played between couples as a form of foreplay. In groups, played between pairs with winners playing winners until only one person remains wearing clothes. In group sessions winners may re-dress between games, if that is agreed beforehand, to extend gameplay. Otherwise getting dressed is unusual, being regarded as missing the point of the game and being prudish. The final winner is expected to remove the last of their clothes upon declaration as winner. Only at that point may everybody dress, if that has been agreed before the game. Usually people remain naked or leave.

The gender mix in the group games and individual pairs is entirely a matter for the participants. In some games selecting pairs randomly from the group, or randomly within gender, such as by throwing dice, adds to the atmosphere and acts as an "ice breaker" which is the underlying purpose of the game.

===Blackjack===
Like regular [[Blackjack]], players try to get a higher card count than a dealer and not over 21. Each time a player wins a hand, the dealer takes off one article of clothing and if the dealer wins, the player/s take one off.

===Strip Scrabble===
Normal [[Scrabble]] rules apply except for the stripping rules, which can vary. For example, the players can agree to  remove an article of clothing if a player scores less than 5 points; or when another player gets a triple word score; or if a player did not score the highest score on a round.

===Music box===
This game is a variant of pass the parcel or hot potato, and involves a group of people passing around a wind-up music box.  When the music stops playing, the person holding the box must remove an item of clothing.  The box is then wound up and passed around again.

===Yakyuken===
{{main|Yakyuken}}
The same as [[rock-paper-scissors]] game. The most popular strip game in [[Japan]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} possibly even in [[East Asia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Twister===
Standard [[Twister (game)|Twister]] gameplay, with the additional penalty that every time a player falls, they must remove an article of clothing.

===Uno===
Standard [[Uno (card game)|Uno]] gameplay, Normal Uno rules apply except for the stripping rules, every time a player loses a hand, the person must remove an item of clothing.

== In popular culture ==
Stripping games also often appear as plot devices or even themes in erotic or pornographic films. One example of such a case is the 2012 film ''Strip [[Mahjong]]: Battle Royale''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strip_mahjong_battle_royale_2011/ Strip Mahjong: Battle Royale (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television game shows===
Partial or complete removal of clothing has formed a central role in numerous game shows broadcast in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the US for some years.  These include:

*''[[Everything Goes (game show)|Everything Goes]]'' &amp;ndash; (United States, 1981–1988)
*''[[Räsypokka]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[subTV]] &amp;ndash; Finland &amp;ndash; 2002)
*''[[Strip! (game show)|Strip!]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[RTL II]] &amp;ndash; Germany &amp;ndash; 1999)
*''[[Strip Poker (TV show)|Strip Poker]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] &amp;ndash; United States &amp;ndash; 1997)
*''[[Tutti Frutti (1990 TV series)|Tutti Frutti]]/[[Colpo Grosso (TV series)|Colpo Grosso]]'' &amp;ndash; (Germany/Italy &amp;ndash; 1990)
*''[[Dog Eat Dog (game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'' &amp;ndash; (United Kingdom/United States) &amp;ndash; 2001&amp;ndash;2003
*''[[Pants-Off Dance-Off]]'' &amp;ndash; (United States, 2006–present)

A '''taiaha''' ({{IPA-mi|ˈtaiaha}}) is a traditional weapon of the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]]; a close-quarters staff weapon made from either wood or whalebone, and used for short, sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with efficient footwork on the part of the wielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hiroa | first = Te Rangi  | title = Long Clubs | work = The Coming of the Maori | publisher = Māori Purposes Fund Board | year = 1949 | url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucTheC-t1-g1-t2-body1-d12-d5.html#n296 | accessdate = 19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiaha are usually between {{convert|5|to|6|ft}} in length. It has three main parts; the  ''arero'' (tongue), used for stabbing the opponent and parrying; the ''upoko'' (head), the base from which the tongue protrudes; and the ''ate'' (liver) or ''tinana'' (body), the long flat blade which is also used for striking and parrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Taiaha (long club fighting staff) | work = Collections Online | publisher = Museum of New Zealand – Te Papa Tongarewa | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=132774 | accessdate = 19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Détail d'un taiaha.jpg|thumb|''Arero'' 's detail]]

==Use==
[[Mau rākau]] is the [[martial arts|martial art]] that teaches the use of the taiaha and other [[Māori people|Māori]] weapons in combat. As with other martial arts styles, students of the taiaha spend years mastering the skills of timing, balance and co-ordination necessary to wield the weapon effectively. The taiaha is widely known due to its use in the ''wero'' &amp;mdash; the traditional Māori challenge during the [[pōwhiri]], a formal welcoming ceremony. A ''wero'' is commonly given to heads of state and visiting dignitaries welcomed to New Zealand.

{{quote|Individual displays of weaponry expertise were often performed during the wero ceremony (ritual challenge to a party of visitors). In full view of the visiting party, a selected warrior would parry invisible blows and strike down unseen foes. He would then lay down a taki (symbol of peace), which was picked up by the visitors, and the welcoming ceremony would continue. Such weaponry displays still occur today during large and important Māori gatherings. Usually, the wero is performed by a lone warrior, but during special events, there might be as many as three. This unique demonstration of Māori weaponry remains part of modern Māori society.&lt;ref name=teara&gt;{{Cite web | last = Matamua | first = Rangi | title = ''Mau Rākau – Māori Use of Weaponry'' | work = Te Ara – Encyclopedia of New Zealand | publisher = New Zealand Ministry for Culture &amp; Heritage | URL = http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/mau-rakau-maori-use-of-weaponry/ | accessdate = 17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The taiaha is one of many cultural items which are used to introduce children in school to Māori culture. They are also used in present-day [[kapa haka]] competitions, and training with the taiaha is seen as part of the Māori cultural revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Rangatira: Pita Sharples | work = New Zealand On Screen | publisher = NZ On Air | year = 1997 | URL = http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/rangatira-pita-sharples-1997 | accessdate = 19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The use of traditional Māori weaponry declined after the Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Weapons like the taiaha were replaced by the European’s muskets and para whakawai, or traditional Māori weaponry training schools, disappeared altogether. As a result, the traditional weaponry knowledge was lost among many Maori tribes. Some tribes managed to maintain their distinctive traditions by passing down traditional knowledge secretly between a few chosen individuals.&lt;ref name=teara/&gt;

During the Māori cultural renaissance in the 1980s, there has been a renewed interest and cultivation of traditional weapons. Although there is a much narrower range of traditional weapons being revived, the Māori weaponry has expanded to become a significant trademark of Māori culture. This revival has been part of the larger Māori cultural renaissance that began in the late 1960s. The survival of Māori weaponry was only possible with the work and activism of remaining experts like Irirangi Tiakiawa, Pita Sharples, John Rangihau, Matiu Mareikura and Mita Mohi.&lt;ref name=teara/&gt;

===Modern para whakawai===
In a modern context, Māori weaponry is severely limited to just a few types, with the taiaha being one of the most popular. Likewise, only a small number of para whakawai are in operation—most are taught within a tribal framework. Much of the knowledge within today’s para whakawai is presented with a background of a deeper tribal history, offering a strong sense of identity, kinship and belonging.

The para whakawai on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua trains members of Te Arawa and other interested individuals in weaponry ideologies, theories and beliefs. This programme was established under the guidance of Mita Mohi in the mid-1980s. This programme was extended to the Christchurch area in the 90s being delivered by Temairiki Williams and the group Te Tohu O Tu. 

The para whakawai Te Whare Tū Taua o Aotearoa began at Hoani Waititi marae in Auckland and grew to include a number of outreach programmes in different regions. It was established by Pita Sharples in the 1980s ‘to offer the ancient art of mau rakau back to Maoridom as an innovative programme’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Poanmu | first = Graham |  title = Te Whare Tuu Taua O Aotearoa | year = 1980 | URL = http://twttoa.wix.com/te-ao-maarama-mauraakau#! | accessdate = 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons training==
Warfare and weaponry were essential to the traditionally militant Māori society. Children were prepared for warfare from an early age. Their early training included playing activities like boxing, wrestling and stick-throwing games.&lt;ref name=teara/&gt;

In the para whakawai, the young men learned mau rākau (the use of weapons). They were instructed in battle formations, weapon use, and attack and defense maneuvers. They would often participate in mock battles using reeds instead of the real weapons. Rakanga waewae (skilful footwork) was vital to fighting and using weapons. Using weapons, especially the taiaha, takes "a lot of maneuvering. It is dangerous. It requires hours, days, months and years of constant use to master it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Awatere |first=Arapeta  |date=1 October 2007 |editor-last=Awatere |editor-first=Hinemoa Ruataupare |title=Awatere – A Soldier's Story |location=Wellington, New Zealand |publisher=Huia Publishers |page=76 |isbn=9781877283819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons===
To Māori, weapons were more than just implements of warfare — they were taonga (treasures), and handed down as precious heirlooms from generation to generation. Weapons were made of wood, stone and bone in a slow, painstaking process. Traditionally, a long weapon from hardwood could take months to shape and decorate; a stone patu would take over a year to complete. Though it took time to fashion weapons, the level of dedication and pride in creating these objects made them valuable. Karakia (incantations) were sometimes said over weapons to imbue them with deities and make them [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (sacred).&lt;ref name=teara/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">'''The Global Media Monitoring Project''' (GMMP) is the largest international study of gender in the news media. It is also an advocacy organization that aims to change the representation of women in the news media. Every five years since 1995 the GMMP collects data on indicators of gender in the news, such as: the presence of women, gender bias, and stereotyping. The most recent study, conducted in 2015, encompassed 114 countries.&lt;ref name=Who_makes&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news? | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a media monitoring project was created at the Women Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok in 1994. The [[World Association for Christian Communication|World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)]] along with MediaWatch (Canada) took up the project. They had several key goals:
*To map the representation and portrayal of women in the world’s mainstream news media
*To develop a grassroots research instrument
*To build solidarity among gender and communication groups worldwide
*To create media awareness
*To develop media monitoring skills on an international level&lt;ref name=Who_makes2&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news?: Beginnings, GMMP 1995 | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 18 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coverage'''

The 1995 Report covered 71 countries, and was conducted by volunteers over the span of one day. Consequent studies took place in 2000 and covered 70 countries, in 2005 covering 76 countries, in 2010 in 108 countries and in 2015 in 114 countries. All of the monitoring and compiling of reports is carried out by volunteers. GMMP reports have been presented at the Women’s NGO Forum in Beijing (1995), the UN Beijing + 5 (2000), a parallel-session at the Commission on the Status of Women 2010 session, and in 100 Women BBC series 2015 "Is News Failing Women?".&lt;ref name=Who_makes2 /&gt;

==2015 Report==

The 2015 Project covered 22,136 news items, 26,010 news personnel, and 45,402 total news subjects in newspaper, radio, television, internet news and news media tweets.  The research discussed news subjects, personnel and content through the framework of media accountability to women .&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = Macharia | first = Sarah | title = Who makes the news?

'''News Subjects'''

The report discovered that progress towards gender parity in the news has almost ground to a halt over the period 2010 to 2015: Women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news, exactly as they did in 2010. Over the past two decades, the gender gap in people in the news has narrowed most dramatically in Latin America by 13 percent.  Women are three percent less visible in political news stories now than five years ago. They comprise 38% of people interviewed on the basis of personal experience compared to 31% in 2005. North America has the highest percentage of women experts in the news (32%), followed by the Caribbean (29%) and Latin America (29%). In 2015, progress towards news representation that acknowledges women's participation in economic life remain elusive: While women in the real world hold at least 40% of paid employment globally, in the news world only 20% of the workers in the formal labor force are women, while 67% of the news world unemployed and stay-at-home parents are women. Portrayals of women as survivors of domestic violence have risen by more than four times across the period 2005 to 2015.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Reporters and Presenters'''

The 2015 GMMP detected what appears to be a global glass ceiling for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''News Content'''

9% of stories overall contain reference to legal, rights or policy frameworks, with social and legal stories making the highest contribution to the global average. A rights angle is barely present is political and economic stories. 97% of political stories in Asia, 98% of economic stories in the Pacific region and the Middle East perform poorly on the rights-focus yardstick. 14% of stories by female reporters focus centrally on women, in contrast to 9% of stories by their male counterparts. 9% of stories evoke gender equality or inequality issues, more than double the percentage documented in 2005. Only 4% of stories clearly challenge gender stereotypes, a one percent change since 2005.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Digital News'''

Women's relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into digital news delivery platforms: Only 26% of the people in internet news stories and media news tweets combined are women. Women report five percent more stories online than in the traditional mediums combined: 42% of online news are reported by women. Gender difference in source selection by female and male reporters becomes starker in online news: Women are 33% of sources in stories by online news female reporters, compared to 23% in stories by men. Only 4% of news media tweets clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of print, radio and television stories that challenge such stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

==Implications==

The GMMP 1995 - 2015 findings paint a picture in which unequal gender power relations are entrenched and validated, and in which gender stereotypes are replicated and reinforced by the world's news media.

That the patterns of underrepresentation, misrepresentation and invisibilization of women have continued into the digital news world show that the problem is deeply entrenched in the mainstream news media system irrespective of the platform through which news are channeled.

The '''''Haywain Triptych''''' is a [[panel painting]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] research. The central panel, signed "Jheronimus Bosch", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66&amp;nbsp;cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's ''[[The Wayfarer]]''.

==History==
The painting was part of a group of six acquired by king [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1570, and shipped to [[El Escorial]] four years later.  It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by [[Isabella II of Spain]] and brought to [[Aranjuez]], the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum.&lt;ref name="Var160"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch |publisher=Skira|location=Milan|year=2004|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy exists at the Escorial.

[[file:The Pedlar, closed state of The Hay Wain by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|240px|thumb|The closed triptych]]

==Description==

===Shutters===
The exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual [[grisaille]]. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.

According to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.&lt;ref name="Var160"/&gt;

===Main panels===
The Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.  The left panel shows God giving form to [[Eve]].  Unlike the ''Garden'', though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes.  At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; [[Serpent (Bible)|the serpent]] offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.

The central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the ''Garden of Earthly Delights''. In the center panel Bosch shows [[Christ]] in the sky, not paralleled in the ''Garden''.  An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world.  The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer’s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to [[Hell]], depicted on the right panel.

The forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minnick|first=Nathaniel|title=Hieronymus Bosch’s Triptychs in the Netherlandish Tradition|publisher=University of Michigan|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game|stealth]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] as part of the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' series. Key members of the ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas]]'' team, such as creative director Maxime Béland worked on the game. [[Gameloft]] released a handheld version for Apple's [[iOS]] on May 27, 2010.&lt;ref name="iOS release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Tom+Clancy%27s+Splinter+Cell%3A+Conviction/news.asp?c=19013 |title=GDC 2010: Splinter Cell: Conviction iPhone emerges from the shadows, available in March |last=Hearn|first=Rob |date=March 10, 2010 |work=[[Pocket Gamer]] |publisher=Steel Media Limited |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also versions available for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[Bada]]. The game was followed by a sequel in 2013 titled ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist|Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:SC Conviction ME.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Mark and Execute gameplay in use. Here, [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]] guns down burglars in the tutorial flashback.]]
''Splinter Cell: Conviction'' introduces a number of new gameplay features to the ''Splinter Cell'' series, one of which is the "Mark &amp; Execute" feature, which allows the player to mark specific targets, such as enemies or objects, and shoot them in rapid succession without manually targeting each one. The player can choose to prioritize these targets, so that, for example, he can distract one guard by shooting out a light in his vicinity and then take out another guard. Another new feature is the "Last Known Position", which occurs when the player breaks the line of sight of an alerted guard. This creates a visual [[silhouette]] where the guard thinks [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam]] is, allowing the player to flank his enemies.

Other new features include the ability to interrogate characters in real-time, and use objects in the surrounding environment against them. Mission objectives and key plot points are projected onto walls within the in-game world, in order to keep the player immersed in the gameplay. Several other features, such as blending into crowds, improvising gadgets, and interaction with the environment, were announced, and according to creative director Maxime Béland would have given the game "a lot of ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|Bourne Identity]]'' influence," but were scrapped after the development team decided that going in this direction would be taking too much of a risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/214761/splinter-cell-conviction/ |title=Splinter Cell: Conviction|work=[[GamePro]]|last=Davison|first=John |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412015416/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/214761/splinter-cell-conviction|archivedate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the features that were present in the last four games in the series do not appear in this game. Sam's hybrid [[Night vision|night/heat vision goggles]] and his multipurpose SC-20K [[assault rifle]], which were the mainstay of the last four games, no longer appear. His light sensor is also absent, although change in the screen [[Colorfulness|saturation]] now shows whether Sam is hidden from view. Sam can no longer move or hide dead bodies, nor can he knock enemies unconscious, as all equipment that helped doing the latter are absent. [[Lock picking]] and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] minigames are also not included in the game. Sam has been equipped with MK.23 and MP-446 pistols with a suppressor and unlimited ammo, which helps him to takedown his enemies in a stealthy way.

One of Ubisoft's stated goals for ''Conviction'' was to make the game more accessible.&lt;ref name="Edgeinterview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ivan |first=Tom |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/ubisoft-felt-splinter-cell-was-too-hardcore |title=Ubisoft Felt Splinter Cell Was Too Hardcore |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815200434/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/ubisoft-felt-splinter-cell-was-too-hardcore |archivedate=August 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Béland, ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]'' is "very hardcore", which turned off many players and disconnected people from the fantasy of being Sam Fisher. Béland contrasted the earlier games in the series with works containing [[James Bond]] or [[Jason Bourne]], who "run fast, they don't make noise, they kill one, two, three or four guys super quickly," and he stated that ''Conviction'' delivers a similarly dynamic experience with more of an emphasis on action than previous ''Splinter Cell'' games.&lt;ref name="Edgeinterview"/&gt;

===Multiplayer===
[[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer mode]] in ''Splinter Cell: Conviction'' involves both [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]], [[System Link|System link]] (Xbox 360), and [[Multiplayer online game|online cooperative mode]], plus a "Deniable Ops" mode, involving four modes that pit players against [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] enemies in game modes such as "Hunter" (where the player must kill a set number of enemies), "Infiltration" (where the player must kill a set number of enemies without being seen), "Last Stand" (where the player must protect a bomb as enemies try to disarm it), and "Face-Off" (a competitive version of "Hunter").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5483059/splinter-cell-convictions-multiplayer-experience-in-three-parts|title=Splinter Cell: Conviction's Multiplayer Experience In Three Parts|last=Fahey|first=Mike|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013|date=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Face-Off" is the game's only competitive multiplayer mode, as it features the ability to kill the opposing player. "Hunter", "Infiltration", and "Last Stand" can be played in single-player modes and do not always have to be played with a human partner. The game does not contain the "Spies Vs Mercenaries" mode featured in the previous games of the series.

According to co-op game director Patrick Redding, the stealth in ''Conviction'' is designed around new core elements like "Mark &amp; Execute" and "Last Known Position".

==Plot==
The game's story is divided into two portions. The main portion is the game's single-player campaign, which puts the player in control of Sam Fisher. The "Prologue" portion of the game, however, is accessed through the multiplayer co-op mode, which puts two players in control of agents Archer and Kestrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Splinter Cell Conviction Co-op Hands-on|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/18/splinter-cell-conviction-co-op-hands-on|work=[[IGN]]|last=Brudvig|first=Erik|date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
[[File:Splinter Cell Conviction Co-op.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Split screen mode of the co-op campaign. Archer (left) and Kestrel take armed guards by surprise.]]
Ten days prior to the events of the main game, Third Echelon agent "Archer" (Edward Yankie) and his Russian counterpart, Voron agent "Kestrel" (Alex Ivanovici) are deployed to [[Nevsky Prospect|Nevsky Prospekt]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia to halt rogue elements of the Russian military from selling advanced warheads on the [[black market]]. Intelligence from Andriy Kobin ([[Elias Toufexis]]) has pointed to drug and human trafficker Valentin Lesovsky ([[Mark Camacho]]) as the broker for the sale, and Archer and Kestrel are to terminate Lesovsky and his associate, Boris Sychev ([[Alain Goulem]]), as well as gaining Lesovsky's contact list.

Having completed their mission, Archer and Kestrel are deployed to the Russian embassy in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] to gather intelligence on an arms deal conducted by former Russian [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] Colonel Leonid Bykhov. They observe the deal and see Bhykov betray his associate, Tagizade, ordering his men to kill him. Archer and Kestrel prevent the destruction of the weapons crates, learning that the weapons Bhykov was going to sell were [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|Block II JDAM missile guidance kits]]. They interrogate Bhykov, learning that he is working with Major General Kerzakov, who is in the Yastreb Complex, an underground fortress situated underneath [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]].

They infiltrate the complex and learn the location of the EMP warheads. They render the JDAM kits inoperable by using their portable [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] devices, and download data from multiple servers to trace the EMP devices to the [[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Mozdok Proving Grounds]]. Sneaking aboard a supply truck, they infiltrate the Proving Grounds and secure the EMP devices with the help of Kobin. During their extraction, Third Echelon director Tom Reed ([[James A. Woods]]) calls Archer and orders him to kill Kestrel; concurrently, Kestrel reads Archer's OPSAT (Operational Satellite Uplink) device, forcing him to act in self-defense. Whilst either player can die, the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] ending has Kestrel fatally shooting Archer; overcome with grief and unaware that Kobin has entered, Kestrel is shot in the head.

===Main game===
The events of the main game take place three years after that of ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent|Splinter Cell: Double Agent]]''. Former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] Victor Coste (Howard Siegel) is being interrogated by a [[private military company]] called "Black Arrow", and recounts the events of ''Conviction'' in the past tense.

Sam Fisher ([[Michael Ironside]]) is investigating in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]] regarding rumors that the [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] death of his daughter, Sarah, might not have been accidental. As he investigates, Anna "Grim" Grímsdóttir ([[Claudia Besso]]), Sam's former colleague, contacts him and warns him of the imminent attack by a group of hitmen. Sam neutralizes them and goes after their contractor, Andriy Kobin, a drug runner who was responsible for Sarah's death. He infiltrates Kobin's mansion, kills his guards and interrogates him, but is captured by a Third Echelon Splinter Cell team before being able to extract anything useful.

He is relocated to Price Airfield in [[Virginia]], where he is to be interrogated by Grim and the Black Arrow. However, Grim kills the guard and releases Sam, revealing that she is working for U.S. President Patricia Caldwell ([[Lynne Adams]]), investigating suspicious circumstances concerning Third Echelon Director Tom Reed, Black Arrow, and stolen Russian EMP technology. She claims that Sarah is in fact alive and helps Sam escape the airfield.

After escaping, Sam meets Victor Coste at a county fair at the [[Washington Monument]], receives some equipment, and learns that Lucius Galliard ([[Tyrone Benskin]]), the CEO of Black Arrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Splinter Cell: Conviction | developer = Ubisoft Montreal | publisher = [[Ubisoft]] | date = April 27, 2010 | platform = PC | version = 1.04 | scene = Lincoln Memorial | level = 7 | quote = '''Lucius Galliard:''' One of my companies, yes. I have several, which includes Black Arrow }}&lt;/ref&gt; has tasked the private military company to provide corporate security for White Box Technologies, his recently purchased [[research and development|R&amp;D]] company specialized in EMP technology. Sam infiltrates White Box Technologies and witnesses Black Arrow murdering scientists that are no longer needed. He hacks a high security White Box computer and retrieves strategic data about an operation involving EMP for Grim's analysts to study. He escapes the facility after a firefight with armed Black Arrow gunmen, triggering an EMP to cover his tracks. He is later directed to the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on orders from President Caldwell, in order to eavesdrop on a conversation between Reed and Galliard. The conversation and the subsequent interrogation of Galliard reveals that the operation, due in 24 hours, is funded and organized by a group called "Megiddo"; Galliard is shot before he can reveal more. Sam gives chase but the assassin is killed by a car bomb.

Sam leaves the scene for the Third Echelon headquarters; after fighting his way into the building, killing all its security forces and recovering a set of sonar goggles from Grim's friend named Charlie Fryman (by Graham Cuthbertson), he raids Reed's office. Instead of finding Reed, Sam finds Kobin and interrogates him. Kobin reveals that Reed, acting on Megiddo's orders, is planning to activate three massive EMP devices in Washington DC and assassinate Caldwell in the ensuing chaos, allowing [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Calvin Samson (Larry Day) to take over the presidency. In return, Reed would be promoted. Kobin also reveals that he faked Sarah's death on orders from Grim. Grim confirms this, playing an audio recording of the deceased former Director Irving Lambert (Don Jordan). Sam learns that Lambert had found out that there was a mole in Third Echelon who planned to use Sarah as leverage against Sam. Lambert staged Sarah's death in order to nullify this plan, but was not able to locate the mole. Grim urges an enraged Sam to destroy the EMP device in the Michigan Avenue Reservoir, as Sarah's apartment is within its blast radius. At this time, the Third Echelon building's self-destruct protocol activates and Sam is forced to escape before the building explodes.

With the aid of Coste, Sam attacks the Michigan Avenue Reservoir. After slaughtering Black Arrow mercenaries defending the site, Sam marks the EMP generators for Coste to destroy from the air. Sam is then extracted by Coste and has a brief reunion with Sarah (Victoria Sanchez) before the two remaining EMPs are activated, destroying most of the electronic defenses in the city and causing general chaos. Shortly afterwards, Coste's helicopter is shot down by a [[surface-to-air missile]], but all three survive. While Coste takes Sarah to safety, Sam journeys through downtown Washington seeing the chaos and fear the EMPs have caused. He assaults the White House, now strewn with [[United States Secret Service]] corpses, engaging the occupying Black Arrow mercenaries and Third Echelon troops in combat. After shooting and immobilizing the corrupt Vice President, Sam regroups with Grim.

Grim and Sam must enter the [[Oval Office]] without alarming Reed, who may kill the President. To that end, Grim shoots Sam in the left shoulder and pretends to have detained him at gunpoint, allowing them to enter the Oval Office safely. Reed prepares to execute Sam and the President, revealing that Caldwell was going to shut down Third Echelon after Lambert's death. Reed plans to frame Sam for assassinating Caldwell as supposed proof to the country that Third Echelon is still needed. At this point, Sam and Grim spring into action, disarming Reed and killing his escorts. Sam interrogates Reed while [[United States Army]] soldiers extract Caldwell. It is then revealed that Reed was the mole Lambert was looking for. At this point, the player has the choice to have Sam or Grim execute Reed. Canonically, Fisher spares Reed only for Grim to execute him.

The story then returns to Coste's interrogation. Coste states that Sam, in his last conversation has promised to protect him just as he would protect his brother. At that moment, an alarm starts to blare, while an explosion accompanied by gunfire is heard in the background, causing all of the interrogators to abandon the interview.

==Development==
The existence of a sequel to ''Double Agent'' was [[internet leak|leaked]] to the internet on September 21, 2006 through a 2GB [[RAR (file format)|rar file]] containing, among other media, 75 [[concept art]] images of as-yet unannounced next-generation games uploaded to Ubisoft's public [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubi's Booby: New Games Leaked|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/733/733959p1.html|date=September 21, 2006|accessdate=May 16, 2010|first=Matt|last=Wales|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked images showed gloomy images of the Washington Monument under [[martial law|military occupation]], as well as roadside views of Washington, D.C.

''Conviction'' was officially announced on May 23, 2007 when Ubisoft released a trailer for the game. It depicted a more rugged-looking Sam with long hair and a fully-grown beard. He had the ability to blend in with the environment, interact with tables and chairs and utilize hand-to-hand combat against enemies, making the game appear less stealth-based than previous games. The lighting and shadow effects also showed a vast improvement over ''Double Agent''.

The game resurfaced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009|E3 2009]], with a completely new visual style and a more casual-looking Sam. The developers confirmed that the "new" ''Conviction'' had been in development since early 2008, commenting that "the gameplay has evolved a lot" and "the visual direction is simply much better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/22/rumor-splinter-cell-conviction-escapes-original-gameplay-visu/|last=Nelson|first=Randy |work=[[Joystiq]] |title=Splinter Cell: Conviction escapes original gameplay, visual design|date=September 22, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was given a November 2009 release date at E3, but was later pushed back to the first quarter of 2010.

===Retail versions===
''Splinter Cell: Conviction'' is available on the Xbox 360 and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, as well as mobile versions for the iOS and [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java ME]]. Ubisoft has stated that it has no plans to release it on the [[PlayStation 3]] with Max Béland, the creative director of ''Splinter Cell'' further stating; "Well, ''Splinter Cell'' was originally built on Xbox and we've had a great relationship with Microsoft. So ''Conviction'' is an exclusive for 360, it's not going to go to PS3."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgarabia.com/2010/03/27/ubisoft-conviction-not-coming-to-ps3-maybe-next-game-will/|title=Ubisoft: Conviction not coming to PS3, maybe next game will|last=Dajani|first=Ahmad|date=March 27, 2010|work=VG Arabia|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Personal computer|PC]] version implemented Ubisoft's new [[Digital rights management|DRM]], which requires a permanent internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Tim |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=235596&amp;site=pcg |title=Ubi DRM: Their side of the story |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date= February 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individual stores also released their own variations. [[GameStop]] pre-orders included a SPAS-12 silenced shotgun code. [[Best Buy]] pre-orders included a SC-3000 assault rifle code. [[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] released its own ''Limited Edition'' which contained the standard version of the game, a separate DVD case called "Exclusive Pre-order Pack" and the SPAS-12 code, a 32-page comic book ("Digging in the Ashes") and a DVD detailing the making of the game.

===Ports===
On May 27, 2010, a [[Porting|port]] of the game was released for the iOS.

However, the port did feature an exclusive level not found in the original game - a speed boat level set on the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name="IGNiOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/27/splinter-cell-conviction-iphone-review|title=Splinter Cell: Conviction iPhone Review|date=May 27, 2010|last=Buchanan|first=Levi |work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main points of criticism were its short length and that too much of the title is played in [[monochrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingham|first=Tim |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=242110 |title=Splinter Cell Conviction Review|work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin Van Ord awarded the game a score of 8 out of 10, praising its cooperative mode and storytelling, but criticizing its short length and slimmed-down stealth elements, as well as most of the interrogation sections, stating that interrogations were a "missed opportunity" and "more predictable than provocative."&lt;ref name="gspot-xbox" /&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave it an 8.9 out of 10 praising the "top-notch voice acting" and the game as a whole, saying "''Conviction'' is a gripping new chapter in the ''Splinter Cell'' saga."&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2010|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-splinter-cell/64416 |title = Splinter Cell: Conviction Review| work=[[GameTrailers]] |publisher=[[Viacom]] |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game a 9 out of 10&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; and [[GamePro]] gave it a 5 out of 5.&lt;ref name="Xbox release" /&gt;

''Conviction'' had a less welcome reception with some PC reviewers. GameSpot's Kevin Van Ord scored it 6.5/10, citing bugs, missing features, connection issues and a higher price than a typical PC game.&lt;ref name="gspot-pc" /&gt; ''[[PC Gamer#PC Gamer UK|PC Gamer UK]]'' gave a score of 87/100, but wrote "we can't recommend you buy this game with the current DRM."&lt;ref name="PC release"/&gt;
