'''Adolescent egocentrism''' is a term that [[David Elkind]] used to describe the phenomenon of adolescents' inability to distinguish between their perception of what others think about them and what people actually think in reality.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;  David Elkind's theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|Piaget's theory on cognitive developmental stages]], which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Inhelder &amp; Piaget|title=The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence|date=1958|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of other people's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind|first=David|title=Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=Child Development|date=1967|volume=38 | issue = 4|pages=1025–1034|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1967.tb04378.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions – especially on their behaviors and appearance – because of the "physiological metamorphosis" they experience during this period. This leads to adolescents' belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are of themselves.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two consequential mental constructions, namely [[imaginary audience]] and [[personal fable]].

==Mental constructions==

===Imaginary audience===
{{main article|Imaginary audience}}
Imaginary audience is a term that Elkind used to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions of other people to him/herself in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could be explained by the adolescent's preoccupation that others are as admiring or as critical of him as he is of himself. As a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that he/she will be the focus of attention.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

However, more often than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations always being the focus of public attention is not usually the case.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety of typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that emerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent's own construction, it is privy to his or her own knowledge of him/herself.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

According to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why adolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves – it is a reaction to the feeling that one is constantly under the critical scrutiny of others.

===Personal fable===
{{main article|Personal fable}}
Elkind addressed that adolescents have a complex set of beliefs that their own feelings are unique and they are special and immortal. '''Personal fable''' is the term Elkind created to describe this notion, which is the complement of the construction of imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate his focus on his own perceptions and that of others, he tends to believe that he is of importance to so many people (the imaginary audiences) that he comes to regard his feelings as something special and unique.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; This belief in personal uniqueness and invincibility becomes an illusion that he can be above some of the rules, disciplines and laws that apply to other people; even consequences such as death {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Due to the existence of personal fable at some point, an adolescent tends to substitute the roles of an idol, a hero or even a god with his own image.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Passing==
Elkind believed that adolescent [[egocentrism]] was a temporary phenomenon that will gradually diminish as adolescents grow older. The reason of this, Elkind argued, was because after entering the formal operational stage, no new mental systems would develop. Therefore, the mental structures formed during adolescence would continue to function for the rest of the life span.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Accordingly, the two mental constructions that result from egocentrism, imaginary audience and personal fable, will gradually be overcome and disappear as formal operations become mature and stable.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of imaginary audience===
The imaginary audience, Elkind said, could be regarded as "a series of hypotheses" that an adolescent "tests against reality". Because the imaginary audience is usually constructed based on an adolescent's attention on his own perception, it will be gradually modified through communicating and reacting with real audiences. Eventually, adolescents will be able to recognize the difference between his own preoccupations and concerns of others.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of personal fable===
As to the passing of personal fable, Elkind's idea was drawn from Erikson's (1959) stages of psychosocial development. An establishment of what Erikson called "intimacy"&lt;ref name=Erikson1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Erik.H|first=Erikson|title=Identity and the life cycle|date=1959|publisher=New York: International Universities Press|location=Psychological issues v. 1, no. 1, monograph 1.|isbn=0393012468|pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  could account for the elimination of personal fable, because during the process of establishing "intimacy", adolescents have to constantly adjust their imaginary audiences to the real ones. As a result, adolescents are able to see themselves in a more realistic way and to establish meaningful interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Discussions==
A lot of research has examined different dimensions of Elkind's concept of adolescent egocentrism, however, the findings have not well supported the concept.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco&gt;{{cite book|author=Smetana, J.G. |author2=VillaLobos M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Applied Research in Child &amp; Adolescent Development: A practical guide, edited by Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco|date=2010|publisher=New York :Psychology Press|pages=187–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this research, the manifestation of adolescent egocentrism is not a normative developmental phenomenon that occurs only during adolescence, but varies across different contexts.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Main discussions from current literature focus on three aspects: whether adolescent egocentrism is age-related; whether adolescent egocentrism has association with formal operations; whether adolescent egocentrism weigh equally across genders.

===Not being age-related===
In his 1967 work, Elkind claimed that adolescent egocentrism emerges during early adolescence (age 11–12) and gradually dissipates throughout middle and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; However, some findings from later studies indicate that this statement is not necessarily to be accurate. In 1986, Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions brought up by Elkind.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lapsley, D.K.|title=Adolescent egocentrism and formal operations: Tests of a Theorectical Assumption|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1986|volume=22|pages=800–807|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.6.800|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first study they collected data from a sample that included 45 sixth graders, 39 eighth graders, 50 tenth graders and 49 twelfth graders. They used the Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) developed by Enright et al. (1979, 1980)&lt;ref name=Enright1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enright, R. |author2=Lapsley, D. |author3=Shukla, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism in early and late adolescence|journal=Adolescence|date=1979|volume=14|pages=687–695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enright, R. |author2=Shukla, D. |author3=Lapsley, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism-sociocentrism and self-consciousness|journal=Journal of youth and Adolescence|date=1980|volume=9|pages=101–116|doi=10.1007/bf02087929}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paper-and-pencil battery of formal operations tasks developed by Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lunzer, E.|title=Problems of formal reasoning in test situations. In P. Mussen(Ed.), European research in cognitive development [Special issue]|journal=Monographs for the Society for Research in Child Development|date=1965|volume=30(2, Serial No. 100)|pages=19–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring instruments to examine the correlation between adolescent egocentrism and formal operational thought. 

If Elkind's assumption were right, the correlation was supposed to change from positive to negative as the grade increased and the magnitude of the correlation should decrease with age. The results of the study obtained only significant negative correlation in late adolescence and non-significant change in the magnitude of the correlation. The results didn't support the Elkind's claim that adolescent egocentrism emerges in early adolescence and decreases linearly throughout middle and late adolescence.  In other words, adolescents aged 11 or 12 could experience adolescent egocentrism of the same magnitude as those aged 15 or 16 do. Another study by Frankenberger (2000) also provides evidence that adolescent egocentrism is not age-related.&lt;ref name=Frankenberger2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankenberger, K.D.|title=Adolescent egocentrism: a comparison among adolescents and adults|journal=Journal of Adolescence 2000|date=2000|volume=23|pages=343–354|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In this study, a survey was conducted for data collection from 223 adolescents and 131 adults. The survey contained measures of three aspects: adolescent egocentrism, self-consciousness, and interpersonal reactivity. The result revealed that scores of egocentrism were not, on average, significantly different between adolescents and young adults (19-30), which indicates that egocentrism in adolescence may continue into adulthood.

===Little association with formal operations===
An important theoretical assumption in Elkind's theory is that the emergence of adolescence egocentrism is a result of the development of formal operational thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Nevertheless, some studies had findings that were contrast to Elkind's position. Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions in 1986.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986 /&gt; In the second study, they analyzed the data obtained from two samples: a sample of 7th-, 9th-and 11th-graders and another sample of college undergraduate students. They used Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) (Enright et al., 1979, 1980),&lt;ref name=Enright1979 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980 /&gt; Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965 /&gt; formal operations measure and Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) (Elkind &amp; Bowen, 1979)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind, D. |author2=Bowen, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1979|volume=15|pages=38–44|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.1.38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the instruments. 

The result of a grade-by-grade analysis of inter-correlations between adolescence egocentrism and formal operational thoughts showed modest to non-significant differences among all the measures, which implies that there is little association between adolescent egocentrism and formal operations. Some more recent studies got similar findings. Heather et al. (1993) found that formal operations were not an effective indicator of both imaginary audience and personal fable.&lt;ref name=Heather1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heather, C.J. |author2=Fredda B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Formal operation: A test of two models of adolescent egocentrism|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=1993|volume=22|pages=313–326|doi=10.1007/bf01537795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galanaki (2012) performed a research to investigate the association of adolescent egocentrism with age, gender, pubertal development and formal operational thoughts.

===Gender differences===
A considerable amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana, J.G.&amp;VillaLobos M., 2010).&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl's (1994) study on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS),&lt;ref name=Reynolds1987&gt;{{cite book|last=W.M.|first=Reynolds|title=Reynolds adolescent depression scale: Professional manual|date=1987|publisher=Psychological Assessment Resources|location=Odessa, FL:}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS)&lt;ref name=LapsleyNPFS&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapsley, D.K. |author2=Rice, K.G. |last-author-amp=yes|title=The "new look" at the imaginary audience and personal fable: Toward a general model of adolescent ego development. In D.K. Lapsley &amp; F.C. Power(eds.), Self, ego, and identity: Integrative approaches|date=1988|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=109–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring tools. The results revealed significantly higher scores obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schonert-Reichl|first=Kimberly A.|title=Gender differences in Depressive Symptomatology and Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1994|volume=14|pages=49–65|doi=10.1177/0272431694014001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Transient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance.&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994 /&gt; Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.&lt;ref name=Goossens1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goossens, L. |author2=Beyers, W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The imaginary audience and personal fable: factor analyses and concurrent validity of the "New Look" measures|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|date=1992|volume=12 | issue = 2|pages=193–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Institute of Biological Sciences''' ('''AIBS''') is a non-profit scientific association that is dedicated to advancing biological research and education.

==Overview==

The American Institute of Biological Sciences is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) scientific association dedicated to advancing biological research and education for the welfare of society. AIBS works to ensure that the public, legislators, funders, and the community of biologists have access to and use information that will guide them in making informed decisions about matters that require biological knowledge.

Founded in 1947 as a part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], AIBS became an independent, member-governed organization in the 1950s. Today, AIBS has nearly 160 member organizations and is headquartered in McLean, VA, with a Public Policy Office in Washington, DC. Its approximately 40 staff work to achieve its mission by publishing the peer-reviewed journal ''BioScience'' and the education Web site [[Actionbioscience|ActionBioScience.org]], providing scientific peer-review and advisory services to government agencies and other clients, and collaborating with scientific organizations to advance public policy, education, and the public understanding of science.

AIBS provides scientific peer-review and advisory services to government agencies and other clients; publishes the peer-reviewed journal BioScience and the education Web site ActionBioScience.org; and collaborates with scientific organizations to advance public policy, education, and the public understanding of science.

==Scientific Peer Advisory and Review Services (SPARS)==
===Mission===
Scientific Peer Advisory and Review Services (SPARS) is a division of the non-profit entity, American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), which is dedicated to biological research and education. SPARS is focused on the objective evaluation of potential research grant applications, ongoing medical research programs, and progress reports for numerous granting agencies, foundations, and research institutes; addressing advances in basic biology, clinical medicine, technology, and wildlife and environmental concerns.

===History and staff===
Performing peer review and related scientific services since 1963, AIBS SPARS is one of the longest-serving independent scientific review service providers in the nation. The staff at AIBS SPARS consists of scientists, administrators, IT professionals, writers, and editors.

===Processes===
SPARS works with the scientific community to match eminent, relevant scientists to highly specialized biomedical research applications. Reviewers are vetted for conflicts of interest and confidentiality is ensured to maintain the fidelity of the process. Processes include: developing request for proposals (RFPs), developing proposal receipt and tracking mechanisms, establishing review procedures, orchestrating online reviews, meetings, and teleconferences and delivering edited critiques. Many types of reviews have been implemented, including: consortia development, training and education programs, innovation awards, technology development awards, basic science and clinical trial awards.

==Public policy==

The AIBS Public Policy Office works at the interface of science and public policy. The office, staffed by science policy and public affairs professionals, works to promote the use of biological sciences knowledge in our nation’s public policy and to develop and advance science policy that serves the needs of the scientific research and education communities, particularly the biological sciences. Issues addressed by the policy office are:  funding for the biological sciences, scientific collections, science education, scientific integrity, and research and government agencies.

==Education and public programs==

AIBS is dedicated to improving biological science literacy at all levels of formal and informal education. AIBS works toward meeting this goal through a number of initiatives: recognizing teaching professionals, collaborating with other organizations, disseminating information, publishing teaching resources to improve biology education, and encouraging students to pursue careers in biology. AIBS also supports innovative programs that connect science to the public and that encourage a true appreciation of the value of the biological sciences to society.

==Publications==

AIBS is committed to the effective communication of high-quality information about biology, both within the profession and to students, educators, and the greater public. To this end, it publishes the highly cited monthly journal ''[[BioScience]]'' and continually expands the content of its free, online, educational resource [http://www.ActionBioScience.org ActionBioScience.org]. ''[http://www.aibs.org/bioscience/ BioScience]'' provides peer-reviewed synthetic overviews of current biological research, together with articles about biology education, history, and the profession generally. It is strong in environmental and interdisciplinary science as well as integrative biology. ActionBioScience.org — an award-winning, bilingual Web site—connects the general public to societal issues that are informed by biological science through peer-reviewed articles, interviews, and other resources.

'''Sven Arne Runeberg''' (7 April 1912 — 15 November 1979) was a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]], best known for his studies on [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

Arne Runeberg was born in [[Helsinki]] into the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] cultural family Runeberg; his great grandfather was Finland’s national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg|J. L. Runeberg]]. Arne Runeberg attained his B.A. degree at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1939, but [[World War II]] made a stop to his postgraduate studies. In 1947, however, he was the first student to defend his doctoral thesis, ''Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic'', at the new Faculty of Social Sciences in Helsinki University.

Representing [[evolutionary anthropology]], Arne Runeberg was trained by two students of [[Edvard Westermarck]], namely [[Gunnar Landtman]] and [[Rafael Karsten]].

After his doctoral degree, Arne Runeberg had a versatile career at several colleges in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[the United Kingdom]], including [[London School of Economics]] (1961) and [[Umeå Social College]] (1964–1971). The last tenure was at his ''alma mater'', as he was appointed the associate professor of [[social anthropology]] in Helsinki (1971–1979).

In addition to his doctoral thesis, Arne Runeberg wrote two substantial studies: ''Jesu korsfästelse i religionshistorisk belysning'' (1952) situates [[Jesus Christ]] in a long tradition of so-called [[carnival]] kings, and ''Some Observations on Linguistic Patterns in a Bilingual Society'' (1951–1954) discusses [[Multilingualism|bilinguality]]. Runeberg himself was a bilingual Finn ''par excellence'', using both [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

Arne Runeberg died in Helsinki, aged 67, soon after he was retired from the University.

'''Aun Gallery''' is a [[contemporary art]] gallery in [[Iran]]'s capital city [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/nov/1107.html | date=11 October 2009 | title=Aun Gallery: The latest talk of the town in Tehran | first=Syma | last=Sayyah | accessdate=3 June 2014 | publisher=Payvand | work=Payvand Iran News }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned and created by [[Afarin Neyssari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/iran-art-scene-sanctions | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | title=Iranian artists hit by sanctions | first=Sune Engel | last=Rasmussen | location=UK | date=22 January 2013 | accessdate=3 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery comprises two exhibitions halls for dual exhibitions based in the: [[Sheikh Bahaei]] area in northern Tehran. Aun calls itself the Iran's first commercial art space designed and built to showcase contemporary art.{{fact|date=June 2014}} The building offers 120 square meters of open exhibition space, a five-meter high ceiling and a paneled roof to provide maximum natural light. The gallery's unique architectural features allow for exhibitions of various arts including painting, photography, sculpture, video, installation and performance.

==History==
Aun Gallery was established in September 2009 to promote young Iranian artists and support their contribution to Iran's cultural scene.{{fact|date=June 2014}} The gallery holds ten to eleven solo exhibits per year, lasting approximately one month at a time. The gallery also hosted mixed media sculpture specialist [[Bita Fayyazi]] in 2009.

The [[Vanak]] area has been popular with [[Iranian art]]ists since the early 2000s, at which time it was a quiet residential area with light industry.{{fact|date=June 2014}} More recently it has undergone extensive redevelopment with cafes, restaurants and media businesses. [[Sheikh Bahaei Square]] is a prime site with a central area of dining areas and shopping precincts.

== Imprisonment of Owner ==
Aun's owner, Afarin Neyssari, and her husband [[Karan Vafadari]] were arrested in Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Intelligence Service (IRGIS) on 20 July 2016 when she was about to board a plane to travel to Italy in order to jump start an important art project, which was to prepare for Mr. Bizhan Bassiri’s solo exhibition at the Venice Biennale festival as approved and certified by the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and the Minister of Culture. Karan was supposed to join her a few days later on their trip, and to visit his three children who live in the US.  Karan received a call from Afarin, and when he went to see her he too was arrested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freekaranandafarin.blogspot.com/2017/03/new-charges-against-karan-vafadari-and.html|title=Free Karan &amp; Afarin|last=Kateh|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afarin and Karan were held in solitary confinement for over one month, and were not allowed to speak to a lawyer for 5 months. Afarin first spoke to a lawyer when she first showed up in court, 5 months after imprisonment. The Iranian judiciary has coerced the family to dismiss their chosen lawyer multiple times, and as of May 2017, they still have not found a suitable lawyer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a Zoroastrian, Karan could be another example in a history of confiscation of Zoroastrians' property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iwpr.net/printpdf/global-voices/zoroastrians-face-uncertain-future-iran|title=Zoroastrians Face Uncertain Future In Iran|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karan is a US citizen, and Afarin is a Greencard holder. A wave of public support for Karan and Afarin followed, from the artistic community within Iran, as well as from customers and friends of Aun Gallery. Robert Toscano, former ambassador from Italy to Iran, refuted the authorities’ justification for their detention in [https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/12/former-italian-ambassador-to-iran-denounces-detention-of-iranian-american-dual-national-and-wife/ an open letter], saying that “One has to be truly gullible and the easy victim of propaganda” to accept such charges. He continued, “The reason must be a different one…political blackmail toward the US (of which [she is] also citizens), envy for their success, intimidation toward the Zoroastrian community, desire to grab their properties, [and] repression of contemporary art.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/03/new-charges-against-imprisoned-iranian-american/|title=Grave and Baseless New Charges Against Imprisoned Iranian-American and Wife – Center for Human Rights in Iran|website=www.iranhumanrights.org|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Aun Gallery has appeared in magazines and publications such as [[Bidoun]],&lt;ref name="bidoun"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.bidoun.org/events/nazgol-ansarinia-at-aun-gallery-tehran/ | title=Nazgol Ansarinia at Aun Gallery, Tehran | work=[[Bidoun]] | accessdate=3 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other local and international publications.

The gallery also featured in international travel magazine websites and online magazine ''[[The Culture Trip]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iran/articles/street-art-in-iran-social-commentary-on-the-streets-of-tehran/ | work=The Culture Trip | title=Street Art in Iran: Social Commentary on the Streets of Tehran | accessdate=3 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aun Gallery was also instrumental in the creation of the ''[[Tehran Gallery Guide]]'', a dual English and [[Persian language|Persian]] publication highlighting the upcoming month's art events in the Iranian capital.{{fact|date=June 2014}} The publication ceased production in 2012.

==International work==

'''Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Musiqili Komediya Teatrı}}) – is one of the leading musical theatres of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==History==
The premiere of ''Husband and wife'', a musical comedy written by [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] in 1909, was held on May 24, 1910 in the building of the Nikitin brothers’ circus, in [[Baku]]. This production laid the foundation of Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy. By 1938, musical comedies were displayed on the stage of [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]]. In 1938, an independent theatre of musical comedy (with [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] departments), which acquired official status of "Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy" in September of the same year, was organized. In 1939, the first Azerbaijani and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] musical comedies such as ''Bride for 5 manats'' ([[Said Rustamov|S.Rustamov]]), ''Husband and wife'',''The married bachelor'', (later ''Whose wedding?'') (A.Mashadibeyov) and ''Roza'' (S.Hajibeyov) were staged. Comedies such as ''[[The Blue Mazurka|Blue mazurka]]'' ([[Franz Lehár]]), ''Arshin mal alan'' (U.Hajibeyov), ''[[Die Zirkusprinzessin|The Circus Princess]] '' ([[Emmerich Kálmán|Imre Kálmán]]), ''Wedding in Malinovka'' (B.Aleksandrov) and others were staged by the Russian department of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

From the 1940s onwards, the theatre took a significant place in cultural life of Azerbaijan.

The absence of a building for the theatre in the period 1988-1992, coupled with socio-political events  in the new Republic, affected the creative activity of the theatre’s collective. However the theatre then entered into a new stage of its development,  in a new building. Amongst the pieces presented were: ''[[If Not That One, Then This One]], Konul, Love on the stage, Goodbye!, Everyone has his own star'',  and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Expansion===
[[File:CFI Lecture Hall 2.jpg|thumb|right|CFI Lecture Hall with windows open|CFI Lecture Hall]]
By 1995 CFI had expanded into a new headquarters in [[Amherst, New York]], and in 1996 opened its first branch office in [[Los Angeles]], CFI West currently named CFI Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, CFI founded the [[#Center for Inquiry On Campus|Campus Freethought Alliance]], organizing college students around its areas of interest.

By 1997 CFI had begun expanding its efforts [[#International activities|internationally]] through an association with [[Moscow State University]].

Between 2002 and 2003 CFI opened two new branches in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to expanding its west coast branch into a new building in Hollywood, California. Located on Hollywood Boulevard, CFI Los Angeles also became home to the [[Steve Allen Theater]], named after the [[Steve Allen|former ''Tonight Show'' host]] and CFI supporter. This property was sold in 2017 and CFI Los Angeles is now located at 2535 W, Temple St. Los Angeles, CA 90026.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.centerforinquiry.net/la/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theeastsiderla.com/2017/01/los-feliz-center-for-skeptics-to-make-way-for-residential-development/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2004, CFI continued to expand into cities across the United States with the creation of a network of community organizations called [[#CFI Communities|CFI Communities]].&lt;ref name="cficommunities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/outreach/cfi_communities/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908044552/http://www.centerforinquiry.net/outreach/cfi_communities/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |title=CFI Communities; Center for Inquiry |publisher=Center For Inquiry

&lt;!-- [[File:Ron Lindsay at lectern, banner-3.jpg|thumb|left|Ron Lindsay speaking on Robert Ingersoll|Current CEO of CFI Ronald Lindsay]] --&gt;
In 2005 CFI once again expanded its Amherst headquarters with a new research wing. Additionally, CFI was granted special consultative status with the [[United Nations]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Center for Inquiry Awarded Special Consultative NGO Status by the United Nations.|journal=Free Inquiry|date=Oct–Nov 2005|volume=25|issue=6|page=7|issn=0272-0701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006 CFI has been expanding rapidly with a series of new branches in cities across North America and around the world. These include new Centers for Inquiry in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], and [[Austin, Texas]]. The branch in Washington is headquarters to CFI's Office of Public Policy, which represents CFI's interests on Capitol Hill.

Their former affiliated organizations, the Council for Secular Humanism and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, ceased to exist as independent organizations, and have become programs of Center for Inquiry, since January 2015.&lt;ref name="A Unified Center for Inquiry, Stronger Than Ever"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/a_unified_center_for_inquiry_stronger_than_ever/ |title=A Unified Center for Inquiry, Stronger Than Ever|publisher=Center for Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CFI logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo before its merger with the Richard Dawkins Foundation.]]
In January 2016, CFI announced that it was merging with the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]], with Robyn Blumner as the CEO of the combined organizations.&lt;ref name="An Important Announcement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F.A.Q."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Wedding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_dawkins_merger/ |title=Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason &amp; Science to Merge with Center for Inquiry |publisher=centerforinquiry.net |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure of founder ===
According to Paul Kurtz, in June 2009, being at odds with new CEO Ronald Lindsay, Kurtz was voted out as chairman. Kurtz has described the direction of CFI under Lindsay as "angry atheism" in contrast to his affirmative humanist philosophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/us/02beliefs.html?_r=1|title = Closer Look at Rift Between Humanists Reveals Deeper Divisions|last = Oppenheimer|first = Mark|date = October 2, 2010|work = The New York Times|access-date = October 3, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ronald Lindsay,"Paul Kurtz voluntarily resigned from his positions with CFI and all its affiliates, including his position as editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Center for Inquiry responds to the claims made by Paul Kurtz |author=Erich Vieth |url=http://dangerousintersection.org/2010/10/22/center-for-inquiry-responds-to-claim-of-paul-kurtz/ |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Inquiry Board Statement from 2010, thanks Kurtz for his "decades of service" and claims that "Much of CFI’s success is due to Paul Kurtz’s inspiration and leadership." The release states that with Kurtz's encouragement, new leadership was sought out, with the goal of transitioning Kurtz away from the CEO position. The Board according to CFI prior to 2010 had become concerned with Kurtz's "day-to-day management of the organization. In June 2008, the board appointed Dr. Ronald A. Lindsay president &amp; CEO; in June 2009, the board elected Richard Schroeder chairman, with Dr. Kurtz moving to chairman emeritus." In May 2010, the Board accepted Kurtz's resignation from CFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFI Board accepts Paul Kurtz's resignation|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/center_for_inquiry_board_statement/|website=Center for Inquiry Board Statement|publisher=Center For Inquiry|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paranormal and fringe science claims ==
[[File:Nickell in office.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Nickell in office, Amherst, NY 2013|[[Joe Nickell]], Research Fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]

Through the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI), and its journal, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, published by the Center for Inquiry, CSI evaluates claims of the [[paranormal]] (phenomena allegedly beyond the range of normal scientific explanations), such as [[psychic phenomena]], [[ghosts]], communication with the dead, and alleged [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] visitations. It also explores the fringes and borderlands of the sciences, attempting to separate strictly evidence-based research from pseudosciences.

CSICOP was, alongside magician and prominent skeptic [[James Randi]], sued by TV celebrity [[Uri Geller]] in the 1990s over claims made in the [[International Herald Tribune]].  The case ran for several years with Geller ordered to pay costs and other charges, and was ultimately settled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Uri Geller vs. James Randi decision]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Independent Investigations Group ===
[[File:25 Wendy PB Picture.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|IIG "Power Balance" testing exercise]]
{{main article|Independent Investigations Group}}

The [[Independent Investigations Group]], a volunteer group based at CFI Los Angeles, undertakes experimental testing of fringe claims.&lt;ref name="clairaudient"&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustream.tv/channel/clairaudient-test

== Religion, ethics, and society ==
[[File:Council for Secular Humanism logo.png|350px|thumb|Logo of the Council for Secular Humanism.]]
The Center promotes critical inquiry into the foundations and social effects of the world religions.  Since 1983, initially through its connection with [[Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion]],  it has focused on such issues as fundamentalism in Christianity and Islam, humanistic alternatives to religious ethics, and religious sources of political violence.  It has taken part in protests against religious persecution around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ted-cruz-joins-demonstrators-in-front-of-white-house-calls-on-obama-to-help-imprisoned-sudanese-christian-woman-121430/ |title=Ted Cruz Joins Demonstrators in Front of White House; Calls on Obama to Help Imprisoned Sudanese Christian Woman |publisher=Christianpost.com |date=2014-06-12 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposes religious privilege, for example benefits for clergy in the [[Taxation in the United States|US Tax Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_tells_federal_court_end_taxpayer_funding_of_clergy_housing/ |title=CFI Tells Federal Court: End Taxpayer Funding of Clergy Housing |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skeptic's Toolbox was an annual four-day workshop at the University of Oregon, Eugene sponsored by CFI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |url=http://www.skepticstoolbox.org |title=The Skeptic's Toolbox: 2013 workshop in Eugene, OR |publisher=Skepticstoolbox.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226190541/http://www.skepticstoolbox.org/ |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to [[scientific skepticism]]. It was formed by [[psychologist]] and now-retired [[University of Oregon]] professor [[Ray Hyman]], has been held every August since 1992. The workshop focuses on educating people to be better [[critical thinkers]], and involves a central theme. The attendees are broken up into groups and given tasks that they must work on together and whose results they must present in front of the entire group on the last day.

When the first expansion of the Center for Inquiry building was completed in 1995, the library was prominently featured. The building opened on June 9, 1995, with such luminaries as [[Leon Jaroff]], [[Herbert Hauptman]], [[Stan Lundine]], and [[Kendrick Frazier]] attending, and [[Steve Allen]], prominent supporter of CFI, spoke at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Center for Inquiry Celebrates Grand Opening | date=1995-06-09 | url =http://www.csicop.org/articles/grand_opening.html | work =CSICOP News |  accessdate = 2008-09-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323121320/http://csicop.org/articles/grand_opening.html |archivedate = 2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Stein was the Libraries’ first director and acquired a large number of rare materials. Timothy Binga has been the Director of Libraries since 1996, and has been instrumental in the cataloging and organization of the large amount of materials acquired.

[[File:CFI Library.jpg|thumb|left|CFI Library|CFI Library]]
CFI’s Libraries were created along the same lines as the organization; CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism had their own libraries, and there were a number of shared libraries and collections as well. Highlights of the various collections include materials from [[Martin Gardner]] (some papers and books), Steve Allen (bound notebooks of clippings, notes, letters, and tipped-in pamphlets organized by subject), [[Martin Theodore Orne|Martin T. Orne]] collection of books, papers, and case notes, and books and papers of noted philosophers [[Abraham Edel]], [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], Patrick Romanell, and [[Joseph Blau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfilibraries.org/collections.html |title=About the Collections |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It total, the books number around 70,000 volumes; this includes the world’s foremost collections on [[skepticism]], [[humanism]], and [[freethought]]. Also, there are world-class collections on [[science]], [[philosophy]], American Philosophical Naturalism, the occult and paranormal, [[atheism]], and other items related to the mission of the Center for Inquiry. In addition, there are archives, a reference section, periodicals, microfilm, and AV materials.

The Rare Book Room contains a signed [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] autobiography, first editions of such works as ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]], ''Reason: The Only Oracle of Man'' by [[Ethan Allen]], many signed works by [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Green Ingersoll]], hard copies of ''The [[Truth Seeker]]'' (the newspaper of record for the [[Golden Age of Freethought]]), and a collection of Little Blue Books.

==Past projects and programs==
The following projects and programs are no longer active.

=== Camp Inquiry ===
The Center for Inquiry organized an annual summer camp for children called ''Camp Inquiry'',&lt;ref name="campinq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campinquiry.org/ |title=Camp Inquiry — Holland, New York |publisher=Campinquiry.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on scientific literacy, critical thinking, naturalism, the arts, humanities, and humanist ethical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93174374 |title=Camp Offers Training Ground For Little Skeptics |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Camp Inquiry has been described as "a summer camp for kids with questions"&lt;ref name="campinqhuf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/angie-mcquaig/camp-inquiry-a-summer-cam_b_645900.html |title=Angie McQuaig: Camp Inquiry: A Summer Camp for Kids With Questions |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where spooky stories were followed by "reverse engineering sessions" as the participants were encouraged to determine the cause of an apparently supernatural experience.  Camp Inquiry has been criticised as "[[Jesus Camp]] in reverse"; its organisers countered that the camp is not exclusive to atheist children and that campers are encouraged to draw their own conclusions based on empirical and [[critical thinking]].

=== CFI Institute ===
The Center for Inquiry Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/education/institute_catalogue/ |title=Institute Catalogue |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered undergraduate level online courses, seminars, and workshops in critical thinking and the scientific outlook and its implications for religion, human values, and the borderlands of science. In addition to transferable undergraduate credit through the University at Buffalo system, CFI offered a thirty credit-hour Certificate of Proficiency in Critical Inquiry. The three-year curriculum plan offered summer sessions at the main campus at the University at Buffalo in Amherst.

=== Medicine and health ===
The Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health (CSMMH)&lt;ref name="CSMMH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmmh.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925212414/http://www.csmmh.org/ |archivedate=2010-09-25 |title=CSMMH |publisher=Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health |date=2010-09-25 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulated critical scientific scrutiny of New Age medicine and the schools of psychotherapy.

}} Professional organizations which issued position statements indicating that facilitated communication is not a scientifically valid technique; Most effective intervention for autism according to scientists; Symptoms of autism; Reason for the abundance of untested and ineffective therapies for autism&lt;/ref&gt; and in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Power Therapies and possible threats to the science of psychology and psychiatry.  By: Devilly, Grant J. [[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry]]. Jun 2005, Vol. 39 Issue 6, p437-445. 9p.  This paper reviews a collection of new therapies collectively self-termed ‘The Power Therapies’, outlining their proposed procedures and the evidence for and against their use. These therapies are then put to the test for pseudoscientific practice.  It is concluded that these new therapies have offered no new scientifically valid theories of action, show only non-specific efficacy, show no evidence that they offer substantive improvements to extant psychiatric care, yet display many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturalism Research Project ===
CFI also ran the Naturalism Research Project, a major effort to develop the theoretical and practical applications of [[philosophical naturalism]]. As part of this project, CFI’s libraries, research facilities, and conference areas were available to scientists and scholars to advance the understanding of science’s methodologies and conclusions about naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Education 
|publisher=Center for Inquiry 
|date=n.d. 
|accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of the Naturalism Research Project included lectures and seminars by visiting fellows and scholars; academic conferences; and support CFI publications of important research. Among the central issues of naturalism include the exploration of varieties of naturalism; problems in philosophy of science; the methodologies of scientific inquiry; naturalism and humanism; naturalistic ethics; planetary ethics; and naturalism and the biosciences.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Consumer fraud lawsuit against CVS ===

In July 2018 CFI filed suit against [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] in the District of Columbia for consumer fraud over its sale and marketing of ineffective homeopathic medicine. The lawsuit in part accuses the country’s largest drug retailer of deceiving consumers through its misrepresentation of homeopathy’s safety and effectiveness, wasting customers’ money and putting their health at risk. Nicholas Little, CFI’s Vice President and General Counsel said, “CVS is taking cynical advantage of their customers’ confusion and trust in the CVS brand, and putting their health at risk to make a profit and they can’t claim ignorance. If the people in charge of the country’s largest pharmacy don’t know that homeopathy is bunk, they should be kept as far away from the American healthcare system as possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=CENTER FOR INQUIRY SUES CVS FOR FRAUD OVER SALE OF HOMEOPATHIC FAKE MEDICINE |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/press_releases/cfi-sues-cvs/ |location= |publisher=Center for Inquiry |agency= |date=9 July 2018 |access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wyndgate Country Club and Richard Dawkins, 2011 ===

During [[Richard Dawkins]]' October 2011 book tour, Center for Inquiry - the tour's sponsor - signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site.  After seeing an interview with Dawkins on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance. Dawkins said that the country club official accepted [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s "twisted" interpretation of his book ''[[The Magic of Reality]]'' without having read it personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== CSH actions against faith-based initiatives ===
In 2007, CSH sued the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) to block the use of state funds in contracts to faith-based programs for released inmates, claiming that this use is prohibited under the "No Aid" provision or [[Blaine amendment]] of the Florida constitution. The initial decision found in favor of the DOC but, on appeal, the case was remanded in 2010 on just the issue of the unconstitutionality of appropriating state funds for this purpose.&lt;ref name=CHS2010 &gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1519849.html 
    |title= COUNCIL FOR SECULAR HUMANISM INC v. McNEIL |website= findlaw.com |date= April 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this case was in progress, after the appellate finding, Republican legislators began an effort to amend the Florida constitution to remove the language of the Blaine amendment, succeeding in 2011 to place the measure on the 2012 ballot as amendment 8.&lt;ref name=OS2011 &gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-04-20/news/os-blaine-amendment-religious-schools20110420_1_florida-voters-church-and-state-state-constitution

In 2015, CHS (now CFI) and the state (along with its co-defendants) both filed for summary judgement. The court granted the state's motion in January, 2016, allowing the contested contracting practice to continue.&lt;ref name=CFIvJones2016 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CFI-v-Jones-for-Web.compressed.pdf

===Heckled at the UN===
CFI representative Josephine Macintosh&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CakI_sn30xg&lt;/ref&gt; was repeatedly interrupted and heckled whilst presenting the Center's position on censorship at the [[UN Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref name="mee"/&gt;  CFI advocated free speech, and opposed the punishment by [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] authorities of [[Raif Badawi]] for running an Internet forum, whom they accused of atheism and liberalism.  The Saudi delegation objected repeatedly to CFI's statement.  CFI drew support from American, Canadian, Irish and French delegates.

===Blasphemy Day===
{{Main article|Blasphemy Day}}
Blasphemy Rights Day International encourages individuals and groups to openly express their [[criticism of religion|criticism of]] or [[Antitheism|outright contempt]] for [[religion]]. It was founded in 2009 by the Center for Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/penn_jillette_celebrates_blasphemy_day/ |title=Penn Jillette Celebrates Blasphemy Day in "Penn Says" |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student contacted the Center for Inquiry in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to present the idea, which CFI then supported. Ronald Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry said regarding Blasphemy Day, "We think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are, but we have a taboo on religion", in an interview with [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/09/30/first.blasphemy.day/ |title=Taking aim at God on 'Blasphemy Day'|work=CNN.com|date= September 30, 2009|first=Moni|last= Basu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes place every September 30 to coincide with the anniversary of the publications of the controversial [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]].

'''Chinese social relations''' are typified by a [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocal]] [[social network]]. Often social obligations within the network are characterized in [[family|familial]] terms. The individual link within the social network is known by ''[[guanxi]]'' (关系/關係) and the feeling within the link is known by the term ''[[ganqing]]'' (感情). An important concept within Chinese [[social relations]] is the concept of [[Face (social concept)|face]], as in many other [[Asia]]n cultures. A [[Buddhist]]-related concept is ''[[yuanfen]]'' (缘分/緣分).

As articulated in the sociological works of leading Chinese academic [[Fei Xiaotong]], the Chinese—in contrast to other societies—tend to see social relations in terms of networks rather than boxes. Hence, people are perceived as being "near" or "far" rather than "in" or "out".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">'''Computational social science''' refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the [[social science]]s. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena.  Fields include [[computational economics]], [[computational sociology]], [[cliodynamics]], [[culturomics]],  and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through [[social simulation]], modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computationalsocialscience.org/|title=The Computational Social Science Society of the Americas official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two terminologies that relate to each other: '''Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS)'''. In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.
On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.

Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the [[scientific method]]: [[empirical research]], especially through [[big data]], by analyzing the [[digital footprint]] left behind through social online activities; and [[scientific theory]], especially through [[computer simulation]] model building through [[social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;DT&amp;SC 7-1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3d75ZMuYU .

'''Dieselpunk''' is a genre similar to [[steampunk]] that combines the [[aesthetics]] of the diesel-based technology of the [[interwar period]] through to the 1950s with [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] technology&lt;ref name=dailydot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/dieselpunk-steampunk-beginners-guide/|title=Dieselpunk for beginners: Welcome to a world where the '40s never ended|author=Aja Romano|date=2013-10-08|publisher=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p3"&gt;{{ Citation | url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk | last='Piecraft' |first2= Nick |last2=Ottens| journal = The Gatehouse Gazette|issue =Issue 1|date = July 2008|page =3|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] sensibilities.&lt;ref name="What's in a Name?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/2013/10/whats-in-a-name/|title=What's in a Name?|author=Larry Amyett|date=October 24, 2013|publisher=The Gatehouse|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coined in 2001 by game designer Lewis Pollak to describe his role-playing game ''[[Children of the Sun (role-playing game)|Children of the Sun]]'',&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p3"/&gt; the term has since been applied to a variety of visual art, music, motion pictures, fiction, and engineering.&lt;ref name="Chronologia dieselpunku"&gt;{{cite web| first=Janicz|last= Krzysztof|title="Chronologia dieselpunku" (in Polish)|url=http://steampunk.republika.pl/chrono04pl.html| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The name "dieselpunk" is a derivative of the 1980s [[science fiction]] genre [[cyberpunk]],&lt;ref name="SciFi Wire"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dellamonica, A.M. |title=Cyberpunk, steampunk and now stitchpunk?

==Differences from steampunk==
Author [[Scott Westerfeld]] addresses the question of where to draw the line between steampunk and dieselpunk, arguing that his novel ''[[Leviathan (Westerfeld novel)|Leviathan]]'' (2009) qualifies as steampunk despite the fact that the technology it depicts includes [[diesel engine]]s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I like the word "dieselpunk" if you are doing something like 'Weird [[World War II]]'. I think that makes perfect sense. But to me, [[World War I]] is the dividing point where [[modernity]] goes from being optimistic to being pessimistic. Because when you put the words "machine" and "gun" together, they both change. At that point, [[war]] is no longer about a sense of [[adventure]] and [[chivalry]] and a way of testing your nation's level of manhood; it's become industrial, and horrible. So playing around with that border between optimistic steampunk and a much more pessimistic dieselpunk, which is more about [[Nazism|Nazis]], was kind of interesting to me because early in the war we were definitely kind of on the steampunk side of that.&lt;ref name="Carrott"&gt;Carrott, Johnson (2013), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jennifer McStotts, another author, considers the two genres to be close cousins. She defines steampunk as concerned with the [[Victorian era]], and the shift in technology and energy generation that came with [[industrialisation]]. The genre is primarily concerned with [[Steam engine|steam power]], [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]], and [[sustainable energy]], while she defines dieselpunk as the genre combining the aesthetic and genre influences of the period of both [[world war]]s.&lt;ref name="McStotts"&gt;McStotts (2014), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Gary K. Wolfe]] defines the genres by their era of setting. He defines steampunk as the genre primarily set in the Victorian era and dieselpunk as the genre primarily set in the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;Wolfe (2014), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dieselpunk inspiration==
Dieselpunk draws its inspiration from two related sources: the diesel era and a characteristic referred to by dieselpunks as "decodence."&lt;ref name=dailydot/&gt; According to the web site ''The Gatehouse'', decodence (a [[portmanteau]] of "deco" and "decadence"), "embraces the styles and technologies of the era; it rejoices in a prolonged [[Jazz Age]] ambience characterized by great enthusiasm and hopes about the future."&lt;ref name="Decodence"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Ottens|url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/2010/01/decodence/|title=Decodence|publisher=The Gatehouse|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "diesel era" is a period of time that begins with the start of the [[Interwar period|interbellum era]], which covers the time between the end of [[World War I]] and the start of [[World War II]]. The interbellum era is central to one school of dieselpunk often labeled "Ottensian." In addition to the interbellum period, World War II also plays a major role in dieselpunk, especially in the school of the genre referred to as "Piecraftian." (See "Common themes found in dieselpunk fiction", below.) The exact ending of the diesel era is in some dispute in the dieselpunk community. Depending on the source it ends either at the conclusion of World War II or continues until the early part of the 1950s with the advent of such cultural icons as the [[Golden Age of Television]] and the replacement of [[Big Band]] and [[Swing music]] with [[Rock and Roll]] in popularity.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==As an art movement==
Although the term "dieselpunk" was not coined until 2001, a large body of [[Work of art|art]] significant to the development of the genre was produced before that. Artwork (including [[visual arts]], [[music]], [[literature]], and [[architecture]]) created in the dieselpunk style are heavily influenced by elements of the art movements most prevalent in Western culture during the diesel era such as:
* Arts – [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Art Deco]], [[Bauhaus]], [[Raygun Gothic]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], [[De Stijl]] ([[Neo-Plasticism]]), [[Futurism]], [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], [[Surrealism]]
* Music – [[Blues]], jazz, [[ragtime]], [[cabaret]], Big Band, swing, [[retro swing]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]
* Literature – [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|Stream of consciousness]], [[Modernism]], [[Pulp magazine|Pulp]], [[Hardboiled]] Detective, and [[Noir fiction|Noir]]

According to Tome Wilson, owner of Dieselpunks website (www. dieselpunks.org), the term was retroactively applied to an already existing trend in literature. An alternative term was "low-brow pop surrealism". Writers of this trend blended traditional tropes and genres, such as [[Pulp magazine|Pulp Adventure]], [[Film noir]], and [[Weird fiction|Weird Horror]],  with a contemporary [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson (2013), Welcome to the Retro Future&lt;/ref&gt; In his words: "They were creating a future fueled by the spirit of the [[Jazz Age]]." In their works, the reader could see [[Sam Spade]] in the era of [[smartphone]]s and [[John Dillinger]] use a [[hovercar]] as his [[Crime scene getaway#Vehicle|getaway vehicle]]. They were writing [[cyberpunk]] stories about the era of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

In discussing punk genres, Ted Stoltz defines dieselpunk as the quasifuture from the [[Art Deco]] era. He argues that [[cyberpunk]], steampunk, [[Cyberpunk derivatives#Clockpunk|clockpunk]], [[Cyberpunk derivatives#Atompunk|atompunk]], and [[Biopunk|ribopunk]] are all defined by their connection to their respective technological element. He found this does not apply to other related genres such as [[Cyberpunk derivatives#Other proposed derivatives|elfpunk, mythpunk]], and [[splatterpunk]] where technology plays a minor role.&lt;ref name="Stoltz"&gt;Stoltz (2011), p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction and literature===
[[Alternate history|Alternative history]] and World War II feature prominently in dieselpunk literature. Examples of other dieselpunk novels are ''Tales of the First Occult War'' by [[Kevin Cooney]], ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' by [[David Bishop]], and ''[[Hard Magic: Book 1 of the Grimnoir Chronicles]]'' by New York Times bestselling novelist [[Larry Correia]].

====Common themes====
A feature that was first identified by the online magazine ''The Flying Fortress'' is that dieselpunk can be divided into two primary themes or styles: Ottensian and Piecraftian.&lt;ref name="The Dark Side of Dieselpunk"&gt;{{cite web | author = themes | title = The Dark Side of Dieselpunk | publisher = Flying Fortress | date = June 4, 2008 | url = http://flyingfortress.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/the-dark-side-of-dieselpunk/ | accessdate = 2010-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dividing line between the two themes is commonly acknowledged as the start of World War II.&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p4"&gt;{{ Citation | url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk | last='Piecraft' |first2= Nick |last2=Ottens| journal = The Gatehouse Gazette|issue =Issue 1|date = July 2008|page =4|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theme, named "Piecraftian" after its proponent author "[[Piecraft]]", focuses on the aesthetics of the world wars and speculates on how human [[culture]] could theoretically cease to evolve due to constant, widespread warfare.&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Dark Side of Dieselpunk" /&gt; According to Ottens and Piecraft this theme continues the aesthetics of the diesel era into later periods of history by describing a world where survival (largely based on a reliance on diesel power) is placed above aesthetical evolution (as seen in such dystopian movies as [[Mad Max]]&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p9"&gt;{{ Citation | url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk | last='Piecraft' |first2= Nick |last2=Ottens| journal = The Gatehouse Gazette|issue =Issue 1|date = July 2008|page =9|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A second theme, named "Ottensian" after its proponent author Nick Ottens,&lt;ref name="Decodence"/&gt; focuses on a setting where the decadent aesthetics and [[utopian]] [[philosophies]] of the American "[[Roaring Twenties]]" continued to evolve unhindered by war or economic collapse.  Ottensian dieselpunk [[fiction]] is primarily concerned with a positive vision of technology, where the utopian ideals predicted by the World's Fairs of the times came to light.&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p7"&gt;{{ Citation | url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk | last='Piecraft' |first2= Nick |last2=Ottens| journal = The Gatehouse Gazette|issue =Issue 1|date = July 2008|page =7|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result Ottensian dieselpunk incorporates "an enthusiasm for the predictions about the future,"&lt;ref name="The Two Flavors of Dieselpunk"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Flavors of Dieselpunk|author=Nick Ottens|url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/2008/05/the-two-flavors-of-dieselpunk/|publisher=The Gatehouse|date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often shares elements with [[retro-futurism]].&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p5"&gt;{{ Citation | url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf|title=Discovering Dieselpunk | last='Piecraft' |first2= Nick |last2=Ottens| journal = The Gatehouse Gazette|issue =Issue 1|date = July 2008|page =5|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaming===
Dieselpunk features prominently in the gaming industry, in both tabletop [[role-playing games]] and computer and console [[video games]].  Dieselpunk [[video game]] titles have been extremely prominent in recent years, with the success of the popular ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' (1997), and ''[[BioShock]]'' (2007) series of games.&lt;ref name="Top 10 Games"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/video-games/pc/articles/67680.aspx |title=Top 10 Steampunk and Dieselpunk Games for the PC|author=sinisterporpoise, edited &amp; published by Michael Hartman| publisher=Bright Hub |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sven Schmalfuss feels that ''BioShock'' can be defined as both retro-futuristic [[biopunk]] and dieselpunk.&lt;ref name="Schmalfuss"&gt;Schmalfuss (2012), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II is also a popular theme in dieselpunk games. One of the more prominent of these was Activision's ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'',&lt;ref name="Top 10 Games" /&gt; as well as the sequel game to the 2009 game ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', which takes place in an alternate 1960s Europe where the Nazis had won World War II. The game features many dieselpunk style weapons and robots, as the Nazis had focussed more on scientific and military development than social development. Other games set in dieselpunk versions of the World War II era include ''[[Crimson Skies]]'' (1998 board game, 2000 videogame), ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'' (1996),&lt;ref name="Top 10 Games" /&gt;  and ''[[Sine Mora]]'' (2012).&lt;ref name="Sine Mora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5827659/a-diesel+punk-shootem-up-sure-why-not?tag=grasshopper-manufacture/|title=A Diesel-Punk Shoot'em Up? Sure, Why Not.|author=Brian Ashcraft |date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and television===
With regard to moving pictures, dieselpunk combines the tropes, character archetypes, and settings of diesel era fiction genres such as Serial Adventure, Noir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad, Mark T.|title= The Philosophy of Neo-Noir|location= Lexington|publisher= The University Press of Kentucky|date= February 2009|isbn= 0813191815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulp, and War with postmodern storytelling techniques and cinematography.  Famous inspirations for dieselpunk cinema include ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927)  and ''[[Things To Come]]'' (1936), thanks to their period visions of [[utopian]] culture and technology.&lt;ref name=dailydot/&gt; Even the popular film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) has been noted as having strong dieselpunk influences, as it drew heavily on pulp and [[World War II]] iconography but mixed them with futuristic settings.&lt;ref name="Star Wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/04/right-on-the-he/|title=Ancient Weapons and Hokey Religions: Steampunk Star Wars|publisher=Wired.com|author=Vincent Janoski |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-31|quote=It's already pretty clear that Lucas was drawing from the dieselpunk styling of WWII ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commonly referenced examples of dieselpunk cinema include:

* The [[neo-noir]] movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), though widely labeled as [[cyberpunk]],  may also be described as dieselpunk due its strong borrowings from Film Noir.&lt;ref name="Philosophy of Neo-Noir"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Conrad  | first = Mark T.   | title = The Philosophy of Neo-Noir  | publisher = [[University Press of Kentucky]]  | date = February 2009  | location = Lexington  | isbn = 0813191815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' (1998)
*[[Tim Burton]]'s movie ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) has also been referred to as a dieselpunk movie.&lt;ref name="Discovering Dieselpunk p7" /&gt;

===Visual art===
According to an article titled "Dieselpunk: Love Affair with a Machine", published in the online magazine ''Dark Roasted Blend'', in dieselpunk [[art]] "takes an interest in various bizarre machines, full of esoteric levers, cracked-glass meters – all visually intense and pretty sinister-looking, when photographed."&lt;ref name="Dark Roasted Blend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/12/dieselpunk.html|title=Dieselpunk: Love Affair with a Machine |author=A.

==As a subculture==
A person defined as a dieselpunk draws inspiration and entertainment from the aesthetics of the diesel era to achieve independence from contemporary aesthetics by blending the literature, artwork, [[fashion]], grooming styles, modes of personal transportation, music, and technology of the diesel era with contemporary sensibilities.

Part of dieselpunk's postmodern nature can be seen in the important role that the [[internet]] as a tool of international communication plays in its development. In addition to two prominent dieselpunk [[online]] communities, ''Dieselpunks''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselpunks.org/ |title=Dieselpunk + Steampunk Culture |publisher=Dieselpunks |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Gatehouse's'' "Smoking Lounge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Ottens |url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/lounge/ |title=Smoking Lounge |publisher=Ottens.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are a growing number of online magazines dedicated to the genre including ''The Flying Fortress'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyingfortress.wordpress.com/ |title=The Flying Fortress |publisher=Flyingfortress.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dizelpanki''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/dieselpunk/ |title=Дизельпанки |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309053842/http://community.livejournal.com/dieselpunk/ |archivedate=2011-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several blogs which are simply titled "Dieselpunk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieselpunk44.blogspot.com/ |title=Dieselpunk |publisher=Dieselpunk44.blogspot.com |date=1915-08-29 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieselpunks.blogspot.com/ |title=Dieselpunk |publisher=Dieselpunks.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another active online magazine covering the dieselpunk movement is ''Vintage Future: Dieselpunk'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowan |first=Arthur S. |url=http://vintage-future.blogspot.com/search/label/dieselpunk |title=Vintage Future: dieselpunk |publisher=Vintage-future.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes itself as "Retro-futuristic resources from the golden era."

While there are many websites dedicated to the history of the diesel era, a growing number of sites are dedicated to topics that tie directly into dieselpunk. One such website of note is ''RetroTimes Production'',&lt;ref name="Icons of Dieselpunk: RetroTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dieselpunks.org/profiles/blogs/interview-carmen-johnson-of|title=Icons of Dieselpunk: Carmen Johnson of RetroTimes Productions|author=Tome Wilson |date=March 19, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an independent film production company dedicated to creating documentaries about "retro living, retro design, and retro style." A few sites are springing up that have a retro pulp feel as well, including ''Captain Spectre and The Lightning Legion'',&lt;ref name="Icons of Dieselpunk: Tom Floyd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dieselpunks.org/profiles/blogs/interview-pulp-artist|title=Icons of Dieselpunk: Pulp Artist / Creator Tom Floyd|author=Tome Wilson |date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an online comic written and drawn in the classic serial [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] style of the diesel era, and ''Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/ |title=Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual: Illustrated Interactive Fiction from Retropolis and Beyond |publisher=Thrilling-tales.webomator.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interactive [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style pulp serial.

In 2012, World Brews, a craft beer manufacturer in [[Novato, CA]], began producing "Dieselpunk Brew", a beer line (IPA, Porter and Stout) inspired and influenced by the subculture of dieselpunk, and displaying art deco-inspired dieselpunk designs on the labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bruguru.com/dieselpunk_porter|title=Dieselpunk Porter Beer Review|author=John Staradumsky|date=August 7, 2013|work=Bruguru.com|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
Dieselpunk fashion blends the styles commonly found during the diesel era with contemporary styles to create a fusion of both.  The "[[Punk subculture|punk]]" nature of the subculture comes from expressing a more complete presence in public akin to the fashion styles popular during the diesel era such as waistcoats, covered arms, hosiery, styles of shoes, and head wear. Dieselpunk emphasizes the inclusion of such accoutrements to render one's look "complete," in defiance of modern custom.

===Music===
Dieselpunk music,&lt;ref name=dailydot/&gt; which has roots in the [[Swing revival|neo-swing revival]],&lt;ref name="Icons of Dieselpunk: Wolfgang Parker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dieselpunks.org/profiles/blogs/interview-wolfgang-parker|title=Icons of Dieselpunk: Wolfgang Parker, Pioneer of Punk Swing|author=Tome Wilson |date=May 12, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; combines elements of blues, jazz, ragtime, cabaret, swing, and bluegrass commonly found during the diesel era with contemporary instrumentation, production, and composition.&lt;ref name="Radio Riel Dieselpunk Channel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radioriel.blogspot.com/2010/04/from-library-swing-jazz.html|title=Radio Riel Dieselpunk Channel|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commonly referenced examples of dieselpunk bands are: [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]],&lt;ref name="BBVD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dieselpunk44.blogspot.com/2010/02/dieselpunk-music.html|title=Dieselpunk Music|author=Larry |date=February 7, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Crown Revue]],&lt;ref name="RCR1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-4418727.html|title=Royal Crown Revue, the Penthouse Playboys and the Nicholas Barron Trio at the Cubby Bear|author=Kevin M.

There has been growth of a Dieselpunk music referred to as [[electro swing]], which combines the styles of [[Swing music]] with [[Electronica]]. Prominent bands within the Electro-Swing include [[Caravan Palace]], Good Co, and [[:de:Tape Five|Tape Five]].

==Variants==

=== Decopunk ===
Decopunk is a recent subset of Dieselpunk, inspired by the [[Art Deco]] and [[Streamline Moderne]] art styles of the period between the 1920s and 1950s. In an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayguns! Steampunk Fiction|url=http://coyotecon.com/transcripts/transcript-rayguns-steampunk-fiction/|work=Interview transcript|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=11 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521043531/http://coyotecon.com/transcripts/transcript-rayguns-steampunk-fiction/|archivedate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at CoyoteCon, steampunk author [[Sara M. Harvey]] made the distinctions "... shinier than DieselPunk, more like DecoPunk", and "DieselPunk is a gritty version of Steampunk set in the 1920s–1950s. The big war eras, specifically. DecoPunk is the sleek, shiny very Art Deco version; same time period, but everything is chrome!"

=== Atompunk ===
A similar, related pop surrealist art movement, which overlaps with dieselpunk somewhat, is atompunk (sometimes called atomicpunk). Atompunk art relates to the pre-digital period of 1945–1965, including mid-century [[Modernism]], the [[Atomic Age]], [[Jet Age]] and [[Space Age]], [[Communism]] and [[paranoia]] in the USA along with [[Soviet]] styling, [[underground cinema]], [[Googie]] architecture, the [[Sputnik]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and other early [[space program]]s, early [[Cold War]] [[espionage]], [[superhero fiction]] and the rise of the US military/industrial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bruce | last=Sterling | title=Here Comes 'Atompunk.'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">The '''Eagle Street College''' was an informal literary society established in 1885 at the home of James William  Wallace in Eagle Street, [[Bolton]], to read and discuss literary works, particularly the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]], (1819–91). The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its founder members were Wallace, Dr John Johnston and  Fred Wild.  The group held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the 31 May which was the poet's birthday.&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;{{Citation |title=C.F. Sixsmith Walt Whitman Collection|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/manchesteruniversity/data/gb133-engms1186|publisher=University of Manchester Library| accessdate=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace and Johnston corresponded with Whitman and Johnston visited Whitman at his home in Camden, [[New Jersey]]. Wallace visited Whitman in 1891. Wallace moved to [[Adlington, Lancashire|Adlington]] in the early 1890s and invited Charles Sixsmith to join the group which continued until the death of Wallace in 1926 and in a more modest form after that. After Wallace moved to Adlington in the early 1890s the group continued to meet in each other's homes.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{Citation |title=Walt Whitman and Bolton|url=http://www.boltonmuseums.org.uk/bolton-archives/walt-whitman/
|publisher=Bolton Museums|accessdate=2010-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixsmith was involved in the annual Whitman celebrations until the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="WWC"/&gt; A plaque marking one of these celebrations can be found in the grounds of [[Rivington Unitarian Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Uni"&gt;{{Citation|title=Rivington Unitarian Chapel|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/mda/RIVINGTON/|publisher=unitarian.org.uk|accessdate=2010-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927065749/http://www.unitarian.org.uk/mda/RIVINGTON/|archivedate=2010-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''empanada''' is a type of [[pastry]] baked or fried in Hispanic cultures. The name comes from the Spanish verb {{wikt-lang|es|empanar}}, and literally translates as "enbreaded", that is, wrapped or [[Breading|coated in bread]].

Empanadas are made by folding [[dough]] over a [[stuffing]], which may consist of meat, cheese, corn, or other ingredients.

== Origins ==
Empanadas trace back their origins to the northwest region of Spain, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Historia de la empanada criolla |url=http://www.produccion-animal.com.ar/temas_historia/76-empanadas.pdf | work=Dra.

==By country and region==

=== Argentina ===
[[File:Empanadas cordobesas (Argentina) caseras.JPG|thumb|Home made empanadas from Córdoba, Argentina]]

[[Argentine cuisine|Argentine]] empanadas are often served during parties and festivals as a starter or main course. Shops specialize in freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings.

The [[dough]] is made with [[wheat flour]] and beef [[dripping]]s for the fillings which differs from province to province. Some places use [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], and some places beef (cubed or ground depending on the region) spiced with [[cumin]] and [[paprika]]. Some other fillings are [[onion]], [[boiled egg]], [[olive]]s, or [[raisin]]s. Empanadas can be baked or fried. It also can contain [[ham]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], ''[[humita]]'' ([[sweetcorn]] with [[white sauce]]), or [[spinach]]; a [[fruit]] filling is used to create a [[dessert]] empanada. For the [[Hinterland|interior regions]], they can be spiced with [[Capsicum|peppers]].

In those places (usually [[take-out]] shops) where several types are served, a ''repulgue'', or [[pattern]], is added to the [[pastry]] fold to distinguish the varieties (although it is more common nowadays to burn a letter – an abbreviated indication of the filling – into the dough). In larger cities, empanadas are eaten more as take-away food, sourced from restaurants specializing in this dish. They usually carry dozens of different varieties, which is not the case in [[Argentine Northwest|northern provinces]], where empanadas are usually made at home, with more traditional recipes.

During [[Lent]] and [[Easter]], ''empanadas de Cuaresma'' fillings with fish (usually [[Dogfish sharks|dogfish]] or [[tuna]]) are popular.&lt;ref name=quericavida&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quericavida.com/en/recipes/argentine-atun-empanadas/|title=Argentine Atún Empanadas|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belize ===
[[File:Belize panades.jpg|thumb|Panades in [[Cayo District]], [[Belize]]]]
In [[Belize]], empanadas are known as ''panades''. They are made with [[masa]] (corn dough) and typically stuffed with fish, chicken, or beans.&lt;ref name="Belize.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Belizean Food |url=http://www.belize.com/belize-fast-food |website=Belize.com |publisher=ITM Ltd. |accessdate=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6dSyL6UMp?url=http://www.belize.com/belize-fast-food |archive-date=2015-12-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually deep fried and served with a cabbage or salsa topping. Panades are frequently sold as [[street food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kraig|editor1-first=Bruce|editor2-last=Sen|editor2-first=Colleen Taylor|title=Street Food Around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-59884-954-7|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cape Verde ===
[[Cape Verde]] cuisine features the [[Pastel (food)|''pastel'']], as well. Cape Verdean ''pastéis'' are often filled with spicy tuna fish. One particular variety, the ''pastel com o diabo dentro'' (literally: Pastel with the devil within), is particularly spicy, and is made with a dough made from sweet potatoes and cornmeal.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Cherie. ''Cuisines of Portuguese Encounters'', Hippocrene Books. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
[[File:Empanada tray.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean-style empanadas]]
The empanada is considered the most symbolic food of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Eyzaguirre Lyon (1986), p. 24 {{Incomplete short citation|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Allende]], the President of Chile from 1970 to 1973, emphasized the national character of his political project saying that it would be a "revolution with the flavor of red wine, and the scent of an empanada".&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Gonzalo Martner Fanta|es}}, p. 23 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating empanadas, especially the meat ones called "empanadas de pino", becomes more popular during September, the month that Chile celebrates [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|las fiestas patrias]] or their independence.&lt;ref&gt;"La ruta de las empanadas", ''[[La Segunda]]''. 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They are eaten during meals like [[asado]]s or Chilean barbeques, and are accompanied with drinks like [[Chicha|la chicha]] and red wine.&lt;ref&gt;The Chilean empanada, This is Chile, November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}}

Meat empanadas ("de pino") are filled with ground beef, fried with white onion and are seasoned with garlic, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and sometimes raisins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenio Pereira Salas|Pereira Salas]] (1977), p. 60 {{Incomplete short citation|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is known as the typical baked Chilean empanada,{{cn|date=March 2018}} although it can also be fried. 

Seafood empanadas are filled with crab, [[clam]]s, [[Concholepas concholepas|sea snails]], or special oysters called [[crassostrea]] and cheese. Different seafood can be used, and they are mixed with chopped white onion.&lt;ref&gt;Chile Travel Pulse, March 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}}

=== Philippines ===
[[File:Empanada (Philippines).jpg|thumb|Philippine fried empanadas, with ground beef, potatoes, carrots, cheese, and raisins in a thin, crisp crust]]
[[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]] empanadas usually contain ground beef, pork or chicken, potatoes, chopped onions, and raisins (somewhat similar to the Cuban ''picadillo'') in a somewhat sweet, wheat flour bread. There are two kinds available: the baked sort and the flaky fried type. To lower costs, potatoes are often added as an extender, while another filling is ''[[kutsay]]'',  or [[garlic chives]] (''kutsay'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]; 韭菜 ''kú-chhài'' in [[Lan-nang]]).

Empanadas in the northern part of the [[Ilocos]] are different. These usually have savoury fillings of green [[papaya]], [[mung bean]]s, and sometimes chopped Ilocano [[sausage]] (''[[chorizo]]'') and egg yolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/vigan-empanada-and-gastronomic-treats-ilocos |title=Vigan Empanada and the gastronomic treats of Ilocos |author=Ian Ocampo Flora |date=April 23, 2010 |work= |publisher=www.sunstar.com.ph |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505212143/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/vigan-empanada-and-gastronomic-treats-ilocos |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Sicily (Italy) ===
[[File:'Mpanatigghi.JPG|thumb|left|'Mpanatigghi]]
The 'Mpanatigghi are stuffed, consisting of  halfmoon-shaped [[panzarotti]] filled with a mixture of almonds, walnuts, chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, cloves and minced beef.&lt;ref name="corri"&gt;{{cite news |author=Red. Spe. |title=Quanto è "dolce" Ragusa |newspaper=[[Corriere del Mezzogiorno]] |date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Assenza"&gt;{{cite book |author=Giovanni Assenza |title=Miele, garofano, cannella.

They are also known as ''impanatiglie'' or ''dolce di carne'' (pasty of meat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Monica Cesari Sartoni |title=Mangia italiano. Guida alle specialità regionali italiane |publisher=Morellini Editore |date=2005 |isbn=88-89550-05-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were probably introduced by the Spaniards during their rule in Sicily which took place in the sixteenth century; this is suggested from the etymology of the name which comes from the Spanish "empanadas or empadillas" (empanada), as well as from the somewhat unusual combination of meat and chocolate, which occurs several times in the Spanish cuisine.&lt;ref name="corri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Assenza" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Touring Club of Italy |title=Authentic Sicily |publisher=Touring Editore |date=2005 |isbn=88-365-3403-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In past centuries for the preparation of 'mpanatigghi [[game meat]] was used but today beef is used.&lt;ref name="corri" /&gt;

The '''End of Watch Call''' or '''Last Radio Call''' is a ceremony in which, after a [[police officer]]'s [[death]] (usually in the line of duty but sometimes from illness), the officers from his or her unit or department gather around a [[police radio]], over which the police [[radio operator]] issues one call to the officer, followed by a silence, then a second call, followed by silence, then finally announces that the officer has failed to respond because he or she has fallen in [[Line of duty death|the line of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Listen to the Last Radio Call for Officer Doug Barney" FOX News 13 Now http://fox13now.com/2016/01/25/listen-to-the-last-radio-call-for-officer-doug-barney/&lt;/ref&gt;  An example:

Sometimes the operator will mention the officer's honors, and may add other words in [[memorial|memoriam]].

In some cases the call is made twice, once immediately after  the officer's death, then more formally closer to the date  of or actually at the officer's [[funeral]]. &lt;ref&gt;Larson, Randall D. "Making the Last Call-Broadcast" 911 Magazine, Date 2015-07-06 http://www.9-1-1magazine.com/Larson-Editor-Last-Call-Broadcast&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The practice of the end of watch call began in the mid–2000s in [[police]] departments on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. By 2010 the practice had spread to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and to [[firefighter]]s, [[forest ranger]]s, and [[game warden]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="funeralwise"/&gt;

== Media depiction ==
The custom as practiced in the [[New York City Police Department|New York Police Department]] was depicted in "End Of Watch," an episode of the [[police procedural]] ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Elementary end watch" AVCLUB  http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/elementary-end-watch-213220&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] was shown in "Reckoning," an episode of ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]''. &lt;ref&gt;"Southland End Of Watch" AVCLUB  http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/southland-reckoning-96381&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[soap opera]] ''[[General Hospital]]'', the character [[Jordan Ashford]] uses the radio to make the Last Call to [[Nathan West]], an officer killed in the line of duty by his father, [[Cesar Faison]].  An End of Watch call also occurs in one of the final episodes of the dramatic comedy ''[[The Mysteries of Laura]]'', starring Debra Messing and Josh Lucas.

'''Fausto Zonaro''' (18 September 1854 – 19 July 1929) was an Italian painter, best known for his [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style paintings of life and history of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==

===Young life and early art career===
[[Image:Ertugrulsuvarialayi zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|left|''Il reggimento imperiale di Ertugrul sul ponte di Galata'' (''The Imperial Regiment of the Ertugrul on the [[Galata Bridge]]'')]]
Fausto Zonaro was born in [[Masi, Province of Padua|Masi]], a municipality in the [[Province of Padua]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. He was the eldest child of the mason Maurizio and his wife Elisabetta Bertoncin. Maurizio intended that his son should also be a mason, yet at a young age, Fausto showed a great ability at [[drawing]].&lt;ref name =FBIO&gt;http://www.faustozonaro.it/biografia.html&lt;/ref&gt; With his parents’ consent, he enrolled first in the Technical Institute in [[Lendinara]], then in the [[Cignaroli Academy]] in [[Verona]] under [[Napoleone Nani]]. Fausto opened a small art school and studio in [[Venice]], but traveled often to [[Naples]] as well. He felt no clear direction in his life at that time.

He actively displayed works in exhibition and gained respect of critics. He painted mainly [[Genre painting|genre]] works in oil and watercolor. In 1883 at Milan, he exhibited: ''Le rivelatrici napoletane''; ''Da [[Castel Sant'Elmo|Sant'Elmo]]'', and ''Al [[Pincian Hill|Pincio]]''; in Rome, the canvases ''Passa la vacca''; ''La sofferente''; ''Le cucitrici napoletane'', and ''Il saponaro''. In 1884, at Turin: ''Tempesta''; ''Primo nato''; ''Primo tuono'', and the ''[[Mount Zoccolaro|Zoccolaro]] of Naples''; and in 1887 at Venice: ''In attesa''; ''Al Redentoretto'', and ''Lavoratrice di perle''. La casa Camerini of Padua once possessed a ''banditore''; and two canvases: ''I pigiatori'' and ''In medio stat virtus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by [[Angelo de Gubernatis]]. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 562.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fausto Zonaro - Amusement at Göksu - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''On the [[Göksu]]'']]
The turning point in Zonaro’s career occurred however in 1891, when he fell in love with Elisabetta Pante, a pupil of his in Venice, And together they traveled to Istanbul, capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They were partly inspired by [[Edmondo de Amicis]]’ orientalist travel book ''Constantinopoli''.&lt;ref name =FBIO/&gt;

===Istanbul===

In 1892, Zonaro and Pante married, and lived in the Istanbul neighborhood of [[Beyoğlu|Pera]].

In Istanbul, over time he gained patronage in aristocratic circles. [[Munir Pasha]], the Minister of Protocol, who invited him to visit [[Yıldız Palace]] and meet the prestigious local artist [[Osman Hamdi Bey]]. He was employed in teaching painting to the Pasha's wife, and in this way Zonaro and Pante got to know the important artistic figures of Istanbul of that time. In 1896 he was nominated as the [[court painter]] ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''Ressam-ı Hazret-i Şehriyari'') thanks to the intervention of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] ambassador who had presented the ruling sultan [[Abdulhamid II]] with Zonaro’s work ''Il reggimento imperiale di Ertugrul sul ponte di Galata'' (in English: ''The Imperial Regiment of the Ertugrul on the Galata Bridge''), which Abdulhamid II had then purchased.

[[Image:Conquest of Constantinople, Zonaro.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mehmed II]] and the [[Ottoman Army]] approaching [[Constantinople]], transporting a giant bombard'' by Zonaro.]]

&lt;!-- This painting is of the crew of the Ottoman warship ''[[Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul|Ertugrul]]'' which had just been sent off on a visit to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. NB: The years don't fit this guess; a cavalry regiment of the same name as the ship. --&gt;The Sultan later commissioned from Zonaro a series of paintings depicting events in the life of the 15th-century Ottoman sultan, [[Mehmed II]]. Holding the position of court painter, Zonaro viewed himself as the successor to the Venetian painter [[Gentile Bellini]], who had been commissioned by Mehmed II to paint his portrait over 300 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantinople - City of the World’s Desire 1453-1924'' by Philip Mansel&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fausto Zonaro - Kabak Taşıyan Genç Kız , Young Girl Carrying a Pumpkin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|Fausto Zonaro Young Girl Carrying a Pumpkin, 1889]]
Also during his stay in Istanbul, Zonaro witnessed the [[Day of Ashura]] processions carried out by the [[Shia]] Muslims on the tenth of Muharram, and it was the procession of [[Tatbir]] that inspired him to paint his renowned painting ''10th of Muharram'', it was reported that Zonaro said "After witnessing the horripilating procession (of Tatbir) I wish I were able to meet this man they mourn for". The "man" Zonaro speaks of indicates to the oppressed grandson of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, [[Hussein ibn Ali]].

===Return to Italy===
Zonaro remained in Istanbul until 1909, when he returned to Italy following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] that overthrew his patron Abdulhamid II and the shift to constitutional monarchy. There would be no Ottoman court painter after him.&lt;ref name =FBIO/&gt; He settled in [[Sanremo]] where he continued to paint small works depicting the [[Italian Riviera]] and the nearby [[French Riviera]] until his death.

In 1920 he separated from his wife and began living with his daughter. Nine years later, he died. He is buried in the Foce Cemetery in Sanremo. On his gravestone, underneath an Ottoman ''[[tughra]]'', it states that Zonaro was the court painter of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name =OSAR&gt;http://www.os-ar.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work and reputation==

Zonaro painted [[portrait]]s, [[landscape art|landscapes]] and [[history painting|historical paintings]]. It is claimed that “Zonaro was one of those who made a major contribution to the development of western style art in Turkey.”&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt; He was a prolific artist who created hundreds of works, most of which are of the Ottoman Empire. An exhibition of his work in Florence in 1977 "received wide acclaim in the art world".&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt;

Today, most of Zonaro’s works remain in Istanbul, and many of them are on display in the city’s leading museums. His pictures can be found in the state museums of [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] and the [[Istanbul Military Museum]]. Zonaro’s works can also be found in the private [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;http://muze.sabanciuniv.edu/collection/collection.php?lngCollectionID=12&amp;bytLanguageID=2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pera Museum]]. Also, a number of them belong to private collectors in Turkey.&lt;ref name =OSAR/&gt;

==Gallery==

Some of Zonaro's paintings are in the Pera Art Museum in Istanbul (including ''Daughter of the English Ambassador Riding in a Palanquin'') and the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art.

The '''flag of Argentina''' is a [[triband (flag)|triband]], composed of three equally wide horizontal bands coloured light blue and [[white]]. There are multiple interpretations on the reasons for those colors. The flag was created by [[Manuel Belgrano]], in line with the creation of the [[Cockade of Argentina]], and was first raised at the city of [[Rosario]] on February 27, 1812, during the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. The [[National Flag Memorial]] was later built on the site. The [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] did not approve the use of the flag, but the [[Asamblea del Año XIII]] allowed the use of the flag as a [[war flag]]. It was the [[Congress of Tucumán]] which finally designated it as the [[national flag]], in 1816. A yellow [[Sun of May]] was added to the center in 1818.

The full flag featuring the sun is called the Official Ceremonial Flag ({{Lang-es|Bandera Oficial de Ceremonia}}). The flag without the sun is considered the Ornamental Flag ({{Lang|es|Bandera de Ornato}}). While both versions are equally considered the national flag, the ornamental version must always be hoisted below the Official Ceremony Flag. In [[vexillology|vexillological]] terms, the Official Ceremonial Flag is the civil, state and war flag and [[ensign]], while the Ornamental Flag is an alternative civil flag and ensign. 
There is controversy of the true colour of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.

==History==
[[File:Belgrano y la Bandera.JPG|thumb|[[Manuel Belgrano]] holding the flag.]]
The flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. While in Rosario he noticed that both the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] and [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriotic]] forces were using the same colors, [[Spain]]'s yellow and red. After realizing this, Belgrano created the [[Cockade of Argentina]], which was approved by the First Triumvirate on February 18, 1812. Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colors nine days later. It used the colors that were used by the ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|Criollos]]'' during the [[May Revolution]] in 1810. However, recent research and studies would indicate that the colors were chosen from the Spanish [[Order of Charles III]] symbolizing the allegiance to the rightful, and then captive King [[Ferdinand VII]] of Spain. Most portraits about the creation or first uses of the flag show the modern design of it, but the [[flag of Macha]], a very early design kept at the House of Freedom in [[Sucre]], [[Bolivia]] was instead a vertical triband with two white bands and a light blue one in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museonor.gov.ar/bandera.htm La Primera Bandera y su destino] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402222250/http://www.museonor.gov.ar/bandera.htm |date=2010-04-02 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The flag was first flown for soldiers to swear allegiance to it on 27 February 1812, on the ''Batería Libertad'' (Liberty Battery), by the [[Paraná River]].
On that day, Belgrano said the following words:

{{quote|text=Soldiers of the Fatherland, we have heretofore had the glory of wearing [[Cockade of Argentina|the national cockade]]; there (pointing to the Independence battery), on the Independence Battery, where our Government has recently had the honor of bestowing it upon, shall our weapons enlarge their glory. Let us swear to defeat our enemies, internal and external, and South America will become the temple of Independence and Freedom. In testament that you so swear it, say with me: ''LONG LIVE THE FATHERLAND!'' (after the oath) "Lord Captain and troops chosen for the first time for the Independence Battery: go, take possession of it and fulfill the oath you have just sworn today.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-es|Soldados de la Patria, en este punto hemos tenido la gloria de vestir la escarapela nacional; en aquél (señalando la batería Independencia) nuestras armas aumentarán sus glorias. Juremos vencer a nuestros enemigos interiores y exteriores y la América del Sud será el templo de la '''Independencia''' y de la '''Libertad'''. En fe de que así lo juráis decid conmigo: ¡Viva la Patria!" "Señor capitán y tropa destinada por la primera vez a la batería '''Independencia''': id, posesionaos de ella y cumplid el juramento que acabáis de hacer.}} [http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/20dejunio/proclama.html Proclama dirigida por M. Belgrano a su ejército al enarbolar por primera vez la bandera]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Belgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of King [[Ferdinand VII]] of Spain who was captive of [[Napoleon]], whereas the creation of a flag was a clear [[independence|independentist]] act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of [[Juan José Castelli]] at the [[Battle of Huaqui]]. Meanwhile, the flag was hoisted for the first time in [[Buenos Aires]] atop the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari on August 23, 1812; where nowadays the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]] is located. Still not knowing about the Triumvirate's refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ceased using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. 
[[File:Bendición de la Bandera en Jujuy.jpg|thumb|left|The priest [[Juan Ignacio Gorriti]] blessing the flag.]]
The First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the [[Asamblea del Año XIII]]. Despite being one of its original goals, it did not declare independence, and so did not approve the use of a national flag either; nevertheless, the flag made by Belgrano was authorized to be used as a [[war flag]]. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the [[Salado River (Argentina)|Salado River]], which became known as the "''Río Juramento''" ("Oath River"). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the [[Battle of Salta]], a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist [[Pío Tristán]].

The flag would be finally declared the [[national flag]] by the [[Congress of Tucumán]] on July 20, 1816, shortly after the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]. The proposal was made by the deputy [[Juan José Paso]] and the text written by the deputy of Charcas, [[José Mariano Serrano|José Serrano]]. On February 25, 1818, the Congress (now working at Buenos Aires) included the Sun of May in the [[war flag]], after the proposal of deputy Chorroarín. The sun was copied after the one that the first Argentine coin featured in 1813. It was subsequently decided to keep it as part of the regular flag afterwards, and thus the sun no longer represents war.

[[File:Orillas Parana.JPG|thumb|200px|The Argentine flag flying for the first time over a [[coastal battery]] on the shores of the Paraná, 27 February 1812]]

[[José de San Martín]] was aware of the new flag, but did not employ it during the [[crossing of the Andes]] in 1817. Being a joint operation of both Argentine and Chilean forces, he thought that a new flag would be a better idea than using either the Argentine or the Chilean flag. This led to the creation of the Flag of the Andes, used in the crossing. This flag is currently used as a provincial flag by [[Mendoza province]].

On June 8, 1938, president [[Roberto Ortiz]] sanctioned national law no. 12,361 declaring June 20 "[[Flag Day]]", a national holiday. The date was decided as the anniversary of Belgrano's death in 1820. In 1957 the [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|National Flag Memorial]] (a 10,000 m{{sup|2}} monumental complex) was inaugurated in Rosario to commemorate the creation of the flag, and the official Flag Day ceremonies have customarily been conducted in its vicinity since then.

In 1978 it was specified, among other measurements, that the Official Ceremony Flag should be 1.4 meters wide and 0.9 meters high, and that the sun must be embroidered.

According to the Decree 10,302/1944 the article 2 stated that the Official Flag of the Nation is the flag with sun, approved by the "Congress of Tucumán", reunited in Buenos Aires on 25 February 1818. The article 3 stated that the flag with the sun in its center is to be used only by the Federal and Provincial Governments; while individuals and institutions use a flag without the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/55000-59999/59311/norma.htm|title=Considerando: Que el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno son símbolos de la soberanía de la Nación y de la majestad de su historia;|author=|date=|website=servicios.infoleg.gob.ar|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the Law 23,208 repealed the article 3 of the Decree 10,302/1944, saying that the Federal and Provincial Governments, as well as individuals have the right to use the Official Flag of the Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/20000-24999/24855/norma.htm|title=Norma:  LEY  23208|author=|date=|website=servicios.infoleg.gob.ar|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular belief attributes the colors to those of the [[sky]], [[cloud]]s and the [[sun]]; some anthems to the flag like "Aurora" or "Salute to the flag" state so as well. However, historians usually disregard this idea, and attribute them to loyalty towards the [[House of Bourbon]].{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

After the May Revolution, the first times of the Argentine War of Independence, the Triumvirate claimed to be acting on behalf of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII, who was prisoner of Napoleon Bonaparte during the [[Peninsular War]]. Whether such loyalty was real or a trick to conceal independentism is a topic of dispute. The creation of a new flag with those colors would have been then a way to denote autonomy, while keeping the relations with the captive king alive.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

===Shape and size===
From 1978, the flag's official proportions are 9:14, and its official size is 0.9 by 1.4 meters. It features three stripes alternating sky blue, white and sky blue. Each stripe is 30 centimeters high.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}} In the center stripe there is an emblem known as the Sun of May ({{lang-es|Sol de Mayo}}), a golden sun. Historian Diego Abad de Santillán claimed that the Sun of May was a representation of the [[Andean civilizations|Inca]] sun god [[Inti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Historia Argentina]] |trans-title=Argentine history |last=Abad de Santillán |first=Diego |authorlink=Diego Abad de Santillán |year=1965 |publisher=TEA (Tipográfica Editora Argentina) |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |oclc=9405703|id=Unknown ID 2900104629702  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flags with proportions of 1:2 and 2:3 are also in use.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

===Sun of May===
The sun is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on [[Argentine real|the first Argentine coin]], approved in 1813, whose value was eight ''escudos'' (one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

In 1978 the sun color was specified to be golden yellow ({{lang|es|amarillo oro}}), to have an inner diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm, and an outer diameter of 25&amp;nbsp;cm (the diameter of the sun equals {{frac|5|6}} the height of the white stripe. The sun's face is {{frac|2|5}} of its height). It features 32 rays, alternately wavy and straight, and from 1978 it must be embroidered in the "Official Flag Ceremony".{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

[[File:Flag of Peru (1822).svg|thumb|200px| [[Flag of Peru| Flag of Peru (1822)]]]]
The French privateer [[Louis-Michel Aury]] used the Argentine flag as a model for the blue-white-blue flag of the first independent state in Central America, which was created 1818 in [[San Andrés and Providencia|Isla de Providencia]], an island off the east coast of [[Nicaragua]]. This state existed until approximately 1821, before the [[History of Colombia|Gran Colombia]] took over control of these islands. Somewhat later (1823) this flag was again used as the model for the flag of the [[United Provinces of Central America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felipe Pigna|title=Los mitos de la Historia Argentina 2.|year=2005|publisher=Grupo Editorial Planeta S.A.I.C. 2005|location=Argentina|isbn=950-49-1342-3|page=92|url=http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/libros/mitos2.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgrano dejó descendencia en América Central|url=http://www.aimdigital.com.ar/aim/2012/08/05/belgrano-dejo-descendencia-en-america-central/|accessdate=June 20, 2013|newspaper=aimdigital|date=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El origen de las banderas de centroamérica|url=http://www.mdzol.com/nota/53509/|accessdate=June 20, 2013|newspaper=mdz online|date=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a confederation of the current Central American states of [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]], which existed from 1823 to 1838. After the dissolution of the Union, the five countries became independent, but even today all of these states except Costa Rica use flags of blue-white-blue stripes (the [[flag of Costa Rica|Costa Rican flag]] has a red stripe superimposed on the white one, added to incorporate all the colors of the French flag). The Argentine flag also inspired the flags of [[flag of Uruguay|Uruguay]] and [[flag of Paraguay|Paraguay]].

Alta en el cielo, un águila guerrera
Audaz se eleva en vuelo triunfal.
Azul un ala del color del cielo,
Azul un ala del color del mar.

Así en el alta aurora irradial.
Punta de flecha el áureo rostro imita.
Y forma estela el purpurado cuello.
El ala es paño, el águila es bandera.

Es la bandera de la patria mía,
del sol nacido que me ha dado Dios. 
Es la bandera de la Patria Mía,
del sol nacido que me ha dado Dios.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
High in the sky, a warrior eagle
rises audacious in its triumphal flight
One wing is blue, sky-colored;
one wing is blue, sea-colored.

In the high radiant aurora
its golden face resembles the tip of an arrow.
And its purple nape leaves a wake.
The wing is cloth, the eagle is a flag.

It is the flag of the Fatherland of mine
that God gave me, born of the sun.
It is the flag of the Fatherland of mine
that God gave me, born of the sun.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Lyrics by [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Héctor Cipriano Quesada]], music by [[Héctor Panizza]], it is sung during flag raising ceremonies.

Salve, argentina
bandera azul y blanca.
Jirón del cielo
en donde impera el Sol.
Tú, la más noble,

el firmamento su color te dio.

Yo te saludo,

You, the Most Noble
The Most Glorious and Holy
The sky gave its color to you

&lt;poem&gt;
Aquí está la bandera idolatrada,
la enseña que Belgrano nos legó,
cuando triste la Patria esclavizada
con valor sus vínculos rompió.

Aquí está la bandera esplendorosa
que al mundo con sus triunfos admiró,
cuando altiva en la lucha y victoriosa
la cima de los Andes escaló.

Aquí está la bandera que un día
en la batalla tremoló triunfal
y, llena de orgullo y bizarría,
a San Lorenzo se dirigió inmortal.

Aquí está, como el cielo refulgente,
ostentando sublime majestad,
después de haber cruzado el Continente,
exclamando a su paso: ¡Libertad!
¡Libertad! ¡Libertad!
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Here is the idolized flag,
the flag that Belgrano left to us,
when the sad enslaved Homeland
bravely broke its bonds.

Here is the splendorous flag
that surprised the world with its victory,
when arrogant and victoriously during the battles
the top of the Andes it has climbed.

Here is the flag that one day
triumphantly rose in the middle of the battle
and, full of pride and gallantry,
to San Lorenzo it went immortal.

Here it is, like the shining sky,
showing sublimate majesty
after having crossed the continent
shouting in its way: "Freedom!"
"Freedom! Freedom!"

== Pledge to the Flag ==
As [[Flag Day]] is celebrated on June 20, the following pledge is recited to students nationwide on this day by their respective school principals or grade level advisers. In large towns where students are gathered en masse, the pledge is taken by the local town or city executive, preceded by words of advice and honor to the memory of its creator, Manuel Belgrano, using the following or similar formulas:

=== Variant 1===

{| width="80%"

: Summons:&lt;br&gt;''Niños/Alumnos, la Bandera blanca y celeste—Dios sea loado—no ha sido atada jamás al carro triunfal de ningún vencedor de la tierra.''

: ''Niños/Alumnos, esa Bandera gloriosa representa a la Patria de los Argentinos. Prometáis rendirle vuestro más sincero y respetuoso homenaje, quererla con amor inmenso y formarle, desde la aurora de la vida un culto fervoroso e imborrable en vuestros corazones; preparándoos desde la escuela para practicar a su tiempo, con toda pureza y honestidad, las nobles virtudes inherentes a la ciudadanía, estudiar con empeño la historia de nuestro país y la de sus grandes benefactores a fin de seguir sus huellas luminosas y a fin también de honrar la Bandera y de que no se amortigüe jamás en vuestras almas el delicado y generoso sentimiento de amor a la Patria. En una palabra: ¿prometéis lo que esté en las medidas de vuestras fuerzas que la Bandera Argentina flamee por siempre sobra nuestras murallas y fortalezas, en lo alto de los mástiles de nuestras naves y a la cabeza de nuestras legiones y para que el honor sea su aliento, la gloria su aureola, la justicia su empresa?''

:''Children/Students, this glorious Flag represents the Fatherland of the Argentines. I ask you all to promise to produce your most sincere and respectful homage, to love it and form it with immense love, from the dawn of the life a fervent and indelible cult in your hearts; preparing yourselves from the school to practice to its time, with all purity and honesty, the noble virtues inherent in citizenship, studying with determination the history of our country and that of its big benefactors in order to continue its luminous traces and to end also of honoring the Flag and of which there should never get depressed in your souls the delicate and generous love feeling to the Fatherland. In one word: do you promise that what should be in the measurements of your forces that the Flag of Argentina flames forever exceeds our walls and fortitude, on top of the masts of our ships and at the head of our legions and so that the honor should be its breath, the glory its aurora, the justice its company?''

: Response: "Yes, we promise!"&lt;br&gt;(either using the [[Bellamy salute]] or using the hand over the heart gesture, if not all stand at attention)

| valign="top" |
: Summons:&lt;br&gt;''Children/Students, in the sunrise of our freedom, Manuel Belgrano created this flag, the very symbol of our fatherland, the Republic of Argentina.''

:''Children/Students, it is the symbol of our free sovereignty, which makes it sacred to the men and women and to all the peoples of the world. It was convoked by the exercise of our duties and our rights, to respect the laws and institutions. It is the expression of our history forged with the hope and the efforts of millions of men and women, those who were born in our land and those who came to settle it under our flag and our Constitution. It represents our land and seas, our rivers and forests, our plains and mountains, the efforts of its inhabitants, their dreams and achievements. It symbolizes our present, in which, day to day, we must build democracy that enables us, and conquer the knowledge that frees us; and our future, for our children and the successive generations of Argentines.''

:''Children/Students, therefore, do you promise to defend, respect, and love it, with fraternal tolerance and respect, studying with determination, committing to be free and honest citizens, in solidarity accepting their differences to all who populate in our land and manifest, in each and every one of our actions, these permanent and inalienable values?''

: Response:"Yes, we promise!"&lt;br&gt;(either using the [[Bellamy salute]] or using the hand over the heart gesture, if not all stand at attention)

The ''Glorious Revielle'' may be sounded by a [[military band]] or a [[marching band]] at this point when available, and [[confetti]] may be or may not be showered on the students.

In the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]] and civil uniformed services the pledge is similar but with a different formula and response of ''¡Si, juro!'' (''Yes, we pledge!'')

=== Military/police variant ===
{| width="85%"

The '''Four Seas''' ({{zh |c = 四海 |p = Sìhǎi}}) were four [[Body of water|bodies of water]] that metaphorically made up the boundaries of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. There is a sea for each for the four [[cardinal direction]]s. The West Sea is [[Qinghai Lake]], the [[East Sea (Chinese mythology)|East Sea]] is the [[East China Sea]], the North Sea is [[Lake Baikal]], and the South Sea is the [[South China Sea]].{{sfn|Chang|2007|p=264}} Two of the seas were symbolic until they were tied to genuine locations during the [[Han Dynasty]]'s [[Han–Xiongnu War|wars with the Xiongnu]]. The lands "within the Four Seas", a literary [[names of China|name for China]], are alluded to in [[Chinese literature]] and [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Chang|2007|pp=263–264}}

== History ==
[[File:Qinghai lake.jpg|thumb|right|[[Qinghai Lake]], the West Sea]]

The original Four Seas were a metaphor for the borders of pre-[[Han dynasty]] China.{{sfn|Chang|2007|p=264}} Only two of the Four Seas were tied to real locations, the East Sea with the [[East China Sea]] and the South Sea with the [[South China Sea]].{{sfn|Chang|2007|p=263}} During the [[Han dynasty]], [[Han–Xiongnu War|wars with the Xiongnu]] brought them north to [[Lake Baikal]]. They recorded that the lake was a "huge sea" (hanhai) and designated it the mythical North Sea. They also encountered [[Qinghai Lake]], which they called the West Sea, and the lakes [[Lop Nur]] and [[Bostang]] in [[Xinjiang]]. The Han dynasty expanded beyond the traditional West Sea and reached [[Lake Balkash]], the westernmost boundary of the empire and the new West Sea of the dynasty. Expeditions were sent to explore the [[Persian Gulf]], but went no further. The military expansion of the dynasty ended in 36 BC after the [[Battle of Zhizhi]].{{sfn|Chang|2007|p=264}}

Chinese writers and artists often alluded to the Four Seas. [[Jia Yi]], in [[The Faults of Qin|an essay]] that summarized the collapse of [[Qin dynasty]], wrote that while the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] has succeeded in "pocketing all within the Four Seas, and swallowing up everything in all Eight Directions", its ruler "lacked humaneness and rightness; because preserving power differs fundamentally from seizing power".{{sfn|Holcombe|2011|p=48}} The metaphor is also referenced in the [[Chengyu|Chinese adage]] "we are all brothers of the Four Seas", a proverb with utopian undercurrents. The lyrics of a popular Han Dynasty folk song extol that "within the Four Seas, we are all brothers, and none be taken as strangers!"{{sfn|Chang|2007|p=263}}

'''Illyricum''' {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɪ|r|ᵻ|k|ə|m}} was a [[Roman province]] that existed from 27 BC to sometime during the reign of Vespasian (69–79 AD). The province comprised Illyria/Dalmatia and Pannonia. Illyria included the area along the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and its inland mountains. With the creation of this province it came to be called Dalmatia. It was in the south, while Pannonia was in the north. Illyria/Dalmatia stretched from the [[Drin (river)|River Drin]] (in modern northern [[Albania]]) to [[Istria]] ([[Croatia]]) and the River [[Sava]] in the north. The area roughly corresponded to modern northern [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and coastal [[Croatia]]. Pannonia was the plain which lies to its north, from the mountains of Illyria/Dalmatia to the westward bend of the River Danube, and included modern [[Vojvodina]] (in modern northern [[Serbia]]), northern [[Croatia]] and western [[Hungary]]. As the province developed, [[Salona]] (near modern [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]]) became its capital.

==Name and etymology==
Illyricum is a Latin term derived from Greek ''Illyria'' (Ἰλλυρία) and ''Illyris'' (Ἰλλυρίς). A distinction was also made between ''Illyris Barbara'' or ''Romana'', which comprised the Adriatic coast down to today's northern Albania, and ''Illyris Greaca'', which was the rest of Albania, later called [[Epirus Nova]]. This latter area derived its name from the fact that, being close to Greece, it was influenced by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, A, An ancient geography, classical and sacred, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Roman province of Macedonia]].

==Geography==
Illyria stretched from the River Drilon ([[Drin (river)|Drin]]) in modern northern [[Albania]] to [[Istria]] (in modern [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]) and the River Savus ([[Sava]]) in the north. It comprised the coastal plain, the mountains of the [[Dinaric Alps]] which stretch along the eastern coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] for 645 kilometres (401 miles) with a width of about 150 kilometres) and, in the north-west, the Istrian Peninsula. There were numerous islands off the coast, but they lacked drinking water. The mountains were cultivated towards the coast, but for the most they were barren. Lack of water and poor or arid soil made much of Illyria poor agricultural area and this gave rise to piracy. The interior of the southern part of Illyricum (central and southern Albania) was more fertile. Illyria was inhabited by dozens of independent tribes and tribal groupings. Most of them were labelled as Illyrians. In the north there were also Celtic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J, The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), (1996) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapot, V, Parker, E. E, The Roman World History of civilization (1997), p. 268;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2002),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pannonian Plain|Pannonian]] (or Carpathian) plain in the north was more fertile. Its tribes were labelled as Pannonian. Archaeological finds and [[Toponymy|toponyms]] show that the Pannonians differed culturally form the Illyrians and the eastern Celts who lived to their west, in what is now [[Austria]]. They were later Celticised following a Celtic invasion of the northern part of the region at the beginning of the 4th century BC.  Some tribes in the area (the [[Eravisci]], [[Scordisci]] [[Cotini]], [[Boii]], and [[Anartes|Anartii]]) were Celtic. The Pannonians also had cultural similarities with the Illyrians. Iron mining and production was an important part of their economy in the pre-Roman days.&lt;ref&gt;Mocsy, S. F, "Pannonia and Upper Moesia", A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
===Illyrian Wars===
{{Main|Illyrian Wars}}

The Romans fought three Illyrian wars between 229 BC and 168 BC. The [[First Illyrian War]] (229–28 BC) broke out due to concerns about attacks on the ships of Rome's Italian allies in the [[Adriatic Sea]] by Illyrian pirates and the increased power of the [[Ardiaei]] (an Illyrian tribe in today's [[Montenegro]] and northern Albania). With a powerful fleet The Ardiaei had invaded the Greek cities of [[Epidamnos]] (modern [[Durrës]], [[Albania]]) Pharos ([[Stari Grad, Croatia|Stari Grad]], [[Croatia]]), the island of [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Elis]] and [[Messenia]] in the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Phoenice]] in Epirus, whose trade with Italy was thriving.  Numerous attacks on Italian ships prompted Rome to intervene. The Roman freed the Greek cities and attacked the Ardiaei. Peace terms were agreed.  In 220 BC the Ardiaei carried out attacks on the Greek coast in the west, south and southeast. They then attacked Roman allies in southern Illyria. This led to the Second Illyrian War (219–18 BC), which Rome won. In 168 BC, during the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171–168 BC) between Rome and the [[Kingdom of Macedon]], the Ardiaei joined the fight against the Romans, but they were quickly defeated (Third Illyrian War, 168 BC).  The Romans imposed a tribute which was half the amount they had been paying in taxes to their king (who was deposed) on the cities which had fought them and five neighbouring tribes which also had fought them. The cities and a tribe which had sided with the Romans were exempted from this tribute. The territory of the Ardaei and the neighbouring tribes was declared free and was divided into three cantons. Each was headed by its own council.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, The History of Rome, 45.26.11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Illyrian Wars to the Roman Civil Wars===
We only have limited and scattered information about the subsequent Roman involvement in Illyria for the next 120 years. It seems that the attention of the Romans shifted further north, to today's [[Dalmatia]] (much of the coastal part of [[Croatia]]). Most of what we know is through the work of [[Appian]].

In 156 BC the [[Dalmatae]] made an attack of the Illyrian subjects of Rome (it is not clear what Appian meant by this)  and refused to see Roman ambassadors. The consul [[Gaius Marcius Figulus (consul 64 BC)|Gaius Marcius Figulus]] undertook a campaign against them. While he was preparing his camp the Dalmatae overpowered his guards and drove him out of the camp. He fled through the plain as far as the river Naro. He then hoped to catch the Dalmatae unawares as they went back home for the winter, but they had assembled because they had heard of his arrival. Still, he drove them into the city of Delminium. He could not attack this strongly fortified town. Thus he attacked other towns which were partly deserted because of the Dalmatae concentrating their forces at Delminium. He then returned to Delminium and catapulted flaming projectiles. The greater part of the town was burned.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livy]]'s Periochae recorded the campaign of Gaius Marcius Figulus and noted that in the next year, 155 BC, the consul Cornelius Nasica subdued the Dalmatae.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Periochae, 47.9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 135 BC two Illyrian tribes, the [[Ardiaei]] and the Palarii, made a raid on Roman Illyria while the Romans were busy with the [[Numantine War]] in [[Hispania]] and the [[First Servile War]] in [[Sicily]]. The Romans sent ambassadors, but they refused to negotiate. The Romans levied an army of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. The Illyrians sent ambassadors to plea for pardon. Rome asked for indemnities for the people who had been attacked. Since the Illyrians were slow to respond the consul [[Servius Fulvius Flaccus]] marched against them. According to Appian this was only a minor expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, three Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that by Roman Illyria Appian meant four coastal towns which had a large Roman population.

According to Appian in 129 BC the consul [[Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus]] and Tiberius Pandusa waged a war with the [[Iapydes]] who lived on the Alps (in the north of Illyria), and seemed to have subjugated them.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Wars in Illyricum, 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Livy, Sempronius Tuditanus was at first unsuccessful, "but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] (the man who had subdued [[Lusitania]])."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Periochae, 59.20&lt;/ref&gt; Tuditanus was granted a triumph. He immortalized his victories with a dedication to the river god [[Timavo|Timavus]] in [[Aquileia]] which bore a victory inscription in [[Saturnian Verse|Saturnian verse]], two fragments of which were found in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptions from the time of the Roman Republic, translated by E.H.Warmington (1940) [http://www.attalus.org/docs/cil/honorary.html#652 CIL I² 652]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a passage Appian wrote that in 119 BC the consul [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus]] waged war against the Dalmatae even though they had not done anything wrong because he wanted a triumph. They received him as a friend and he wintered among them at the town of [[Salona]]. He returned to Rome and was awarded a triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, three Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 11&lt;/ref&gt; In another passage he noted "Lucius Cotta (the other consul for that year) and Caecilius Metellus seemed to have subjugated the [[Segestani]]. He also noted that both the [[Iapydes]] and the Segestani revolted again shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, three Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilius Metellus was given the [[agnomen]] Dalmanticus,

In 115 BC the consul [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]], conducted operations in [[Gallia Cisalpina]] against the [[Ligures]] in the west and against the [[Carni]] and [[Taurisci]] (two Gallic tribes which lived in today's [[Slovenia]]) in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, De Viris Illustribus, 72.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 113 BC the consul [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 113 BC)|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]] was sent to face an invasion by the [[Cimbri]] (a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe) which had entered into Illyricum and then into [[Noricum]]. He was defeated at the [[Battle of Noreia]] in Noricum.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Gallic Wars, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geographia, V, 1.8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 78–76 BC a certain Gaius Cosconius was sent into Illyricum as proconsul. He fought there for two years, reduced a great part of Dalmatia and seized [[Salona]] (near today's [[Solin]], near Split, [[Croatia]]), one of the major towns in Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, Compendium of Roman History, 6.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orosius, Seven Books of History Against the Pagans, 5.23&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Roman settlement of Colonia Martia Iulia Salona was founded, probably after the Roman civil wars.

In 59 BC the ''Lex Vatinia'' assigned to the consul [[Julius Caesar]] the [[proconsul]]ship of [[Gallia Cisalpina]] (in northern Italy) and Illyricum and the command of three legions based at [[Aquileia]]. When the proconsul [[Gallia Narbonensis]] died the senate also gave him the proconsulship of that province and the command on a legion which was stationed there, also for five years. Caesar took on his proconsulships in 58 BC. Only Gallia Narbonensis was a province in the sense of a formal administrative unit. The other two were provinces in the sense of areas of military command which were assigned to high military commanders in areas where there were rebellions or threats of attacks. In the past [[Liguria]] (which often rebelled), [[Bruttium]] (today's [[Calabria]], where there was a chance of unrest) and Gallia Cisalpina (in case of rebellions or possible invasions) had been assigned as provinces in this sense. [[Aquileia]] was a Roman town in north-eastern Italy which was founded in 180/181 BC as an outpost to defend northern Italy against hostile and warlike peoples to the east: the [[Carni]] (Gauls who lived on the mountains of [[Noricum]]), the [[Taurisci]] (a federation of Gallic tribes which lived in today's [[Carniola]], northern [[Slovenia]]), the [[Histri]] (a [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] tribe, with ties with Illyrians which lived in the [[Istria]]n peninsula), and the [[Iapydes]] (who lived east of Istrian Peninsula and inland from the [[Liburnians]]; the latter lived on a stretch of the Adriatic coast south of the Istrian peninsula and between the rivers Arsia ([[Raša (river)|Raša]]) and Titius ([[Krka (Sava)|Krka]]). The Carni settled in their area around 186 BC, invaded the plain on north-eastern Italy and founded the fortified town of Akileja. The Romans forced the Carni back to the mountains. They destroyed their settlement and founded Aquileia nearby, which was named after Akileja. It was also about 6&amp;nbsp;km from where an estimated 12,000 Taurisci had tried to settle in 183 BC. For the foundation of Aquileia 3,000 families were settled there. In 169 BC 1,500 more families were settled there. This settlement was grown into a sizable town and three legions were stationed there because of its strategic importance for the defence of northern Italy.

The fact that Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum were the areas of command initially assigned to Caesar could indicate that Caesar had an eye on Illyricum to attain military glory with which he could bolster his political clout in Rome. [[Burebista]] had led the [[Dacians]] from what is today's [[Romania]] to the conquest of the [[Hungarian Plain]] west of the River Danube and close to Illyricum and Italy. However, Burebista stopped, returned to [[Transylvania]] and turned his attention eastwards. Caesar's attention turned to troubles in Gaul and then he embarked on his [[Gallic Wars]] (58–50 BC).  After the defeat of the Belgae of northern Gaul in 57 BC Caesar thought that Gaul was at peace and went to Illyricum to visit the country and to acquaint himself with it. However, war broke out in Gaul again and he went back there. When he went to Gallia Cisalpina in 54 BC to winter there he heard that the Illyrian tribe of the [[Pirustae]] raided nearby territories. He went to Illyricum and levied troops from Illyrian peoples. The [[Pirustae]] claimed that none of the raids were due to public decisions and offered compensation. Caesar asked for hostages and said that if they were not handed over he would wage war. The Pirustae complied and Caesar appointed arbitrators to assess the damages done to the other peoples and set a penalty. He returned to Italy and then went to Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, The Gallic Wars, 3.7, 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illyricum during Caesar’s Civil War ===
Appian wrote that while Caesar was in Gaul the Dalmatae seized [[Promona]] from the [[Liburnians]], who appealed to Caesar. The Dalmatae refused his request to leave the city and he sent a strong detachment. However, it was routed. Caesar did not pursue the matter further because he was occupied with his [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]]. This suggests that this event occurred in late 50 BC, just before the beginning of this war.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 49 BC Caesar started a civil war against the forces of the senate led by [[Pompey]]. Pompey fled to Greece to gather forces to fight the war. He controlled the Roman navy. Still, in 48 BC Caesar managed to sail his troops across the Adriatic Sea and land at Palaeste ([[Palasë]], southern [[Albania]]). Marcus Octavius, one of Pompey's admirals, went to [[Salona]] ([[Solin]], near [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]]) with his fleet. He persuaded the people of the island of Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia) to defect to him. He failed to persuade the Romans in Salona and surrounded it with five camps to besiege it. The town was short of grain and sent envoys to Caesar to ask for help. As the siege continued the inhabitants stormed the nearest camp. Then they seized the other four and killed many of the enemy. Octavius was forced to withdraw to his ships and as the winter was approaching he sailed back to [[Dyrrachium]] ([[Durrës]], [[Albania]]) to rejoin Pompey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/THayer/E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Civil_Wars/home.html Caesar, The Civil War, 3.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer 48 BC Caesar sent Quintus Cornificius to Illyricum as a [[quaestor]]. This region had been quiet. However, now the Romans in the local towns supported Caesar while the natives supported Pompey. Caesar wrote that the area was quite poor and could barely support an army. Moreover, it was exhausted due to the fighting in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrachium]] between Caesar and Pompey in the south of the region (in July 48 BC) and due to rebellions. Cornificius defended Illyria and recovered it for Caesar. He stormed several mountain strongholds which were used for carrying out raids. When Marcus Octavius took refuge on the Illyrian coast after the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] (in Greece, where Caesar defeated Pompey in August 48 BC), Cornificius, with the help of the people of Iadera ([[Zadar]] ([[Croatia]]) who were loyal to Caesar, scattered his ships and added those he captured to those of his Illyrian allies, thus assembling a small fleet. Since the many Pompeian soldiers had taken refuge in Illyricum after the mentioned battle, Caesar ordered [[Aulus Gabinius]] to go to Illyricum with his force, join Cornificius and repulse any enemy operations in the region. If larger forces were needed for this, he was to go to Greece, where continued resistance was to be expected. Gabinius marched in the winter. He did not get supplies for his army because the locals were hostile and because storms in the Adriatic Sea held back supply ships. Gabinius had to storm towns and strongholds in adverse weather and suffered reverses. He had to retreat to Salona, on the coast, which had many Roman inhabitants. On his way he was attacked and routed, losing 2,000 soldiers. He went to Salona with the remnants of his force. He fell ill and died a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Alexandrian_War/C*.html Julius Caesar, The Alexandrian War, 42-43]&lt;/ref&gt; Appian wrote that Aulus Gabinius led fifteen [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (which would amount to about 7,800 soldiers) and 3,000 cavalry and that, again, being busy with the civil war, Caesar did not pursue the matter further.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Octavius sought to take advantage of this to seize Illyria. Cornificius asked [[Publius Vatinius]], who was in Brundisium ([[Brindisi]], southern Italy), to come to his aid and informed him that Octavius was making alliances with the locals and attacking Caesarian garrisons, sometimes with his fleet and sometimes with land forces, using native troops—the Caesarians were Caesar's supporters. Vatinius asked a Caesarian lieutenant in Greece to send him a fleet, but this was taking too long. He armed some civilian ships whose size was poorly suited for fighting and added them to the few warships he had and left for Illyria. He did not pursue Octavius so as not to be delayed. Instead, he recovered some coastal towns which had sided with Octavius and by-passed others, proceeding as quickly as he could. In this way he managed to force Octavius to abandon his attack on Epidaurus (Epidaurum in Latin, modern [[Cavtat]], near [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]) with his approach. Octavius thought that his fleet was superior to the small ships of Vatinius and sailed to the island of Tauris. Vatinius pursued him without knowing that he had gone to that island. While the sea was rough he was caught unawares when the fleet of Octavius appeared ready for battle and was superior in formation. Vatinius decided to try his luck and attacked first, charging Octavius’ flagship with one of his warships. The crush was hard and the ram of the latter was smashed away. The battle was fought at close range in narrow sea. Vatinius had the better and at nightfall the remnants of the enemy fleet fled. The next day Vatinius refitted his ships and 85 captured ships and the day after that he set off for the island of Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia), thinking that Octavius had retreated there. When he got there the islanders surrendered and told him that Octavius had left for Sicily. Having cleared the [[Adriatic Sea]], he returned to Brundisium.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, The Alexandrian War, 44-47&lt;/ref&gt;

In 45 BC Caesar was planning a war against [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]. The Illyrians, feared punishment again (this time for routing Aulus Gabinius) because Caesar was going to cross the south of their land to reach Parthia. They sent envoys to Rome to ask Caesar for an alliance. Caesar replied that he could not make friends because of what they had done, but that he would grant pardon if they paid a tribute and handed over hostages. They agreed and Publius Vatinius was sent to impose a light tribute and receive the hostages with three legions and a large cavalry unit. After the murder of Caesar in 44 BC and the ensuing instability in Rome, the Illyrians no longer feared Roman power. They ignored Vatinius and when he tried to use force they routed five cohorts led by Baebius, one of his lieutenants, who also died. Vatinius fled to [[Dyrrhachium]] ([[Durrës]], Albania). Once more Caesar did not pursue the matter further. In Appian's opinion, Caesar had put off dealing with the Illyrians resolutely for fourteen years because of his Gallic Wars, his civil war and his planned war with Parthia even though he had given the command over Illyria as well as the two Gauls for ten years, and despite having wintered there. This was even regardless of the fact that at times the Illyrians plundered north-eastern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC led to a conflict between the leaders of the plot murder him, [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]], and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], and the Caesarians led by the [[Second Triumvirate]] which took charge of Rome. This led to the [[Liberators' civil war|Liberator's Civil War]] (43–42 BC). Before this civil war Brutus and Cassius fled to the east. They had been assigned the Roman provinces of [[Roman Province of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (Greece) and [[Roman province of Syria|Syria]] respectively by Caesar. However, the Caesarians had the two provinces reassigned to [[Gaius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Gaius Antonius]] (the brother of Mark Antony) and [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] respectively. They were Caesarians. Brutus and Cassius were given [[Creta et Cyrenaica]] instead. They were unhappy with being given this small province and prepared to invade Macedonia and Syria. However, the senate then voted to restore the two provinces to them. Brutus was also assigned Illyria. He arrived in Macedonia when Gaius Antonius had just arrived there to take up his [[propraetor]]ship which had been assigned to him prior to the change made by the senate. His predecessor, Quintus Hortenius, joined Brutus. Vatinius marched on Dyrrachium and seized it before Brutus got there. However, the soldiers of his three legions (minus the lost cohorts), who disliked him, defected to Brutus, who then went on to engage Gaius Antonius who was in [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] (near [[Fier]], [[Albania]]). He won over the troops of Antonius (his seven cohorts and a legion under his lieutenant, Lucius Piso) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman history, 47.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, 4.57, 58, 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Philippics, 10.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===The campaigns of Octavian in Illyricum (35–33 BC)===
Ancient historians who wrote about this period often used the terms Dalmatians and Dalmatia in a different way from their previous usage. Here these terms did not necessarily refer to the Dalmatae tribe and its territory. It was usually used as a new and wider term to indicate the region of Illyria after it was conquered by [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Octavian conquered southern [[Pannonia]] (a plain north of Illyria) as well as Illyria. When the two areas became a Roman province they were given the name Illyricum. Therefore, Illyricum indicated a wider area than previously. The Romans started to use the name Dalmatia to indicate the area formerly called Illyria to distinguish it from Pannonia. Ancient historians used this terminology for the period of the campaigns of Octavian in this area in 33–35 BC as well.

Caesar's Civil War, the Liberators' Civil War and the resistance against the second triumvirate which [[Sextus Pompey]] (the son of [[Pompey the Great]]) conducted from Sicily with a powerful fleet (the [[Sicilian revolt|Sicilian Revolt]], 44–36 BC) caused instability in Illyria, neighbouring north-eastern Italy and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The [[Iapydes]] carried out raids on north-eastern Italy. There was also a problem with piracy. After these conflicts ended [[Augustus|Octavian]] undertook a series of campaigns in Illyricum. [[Velleius Paterculus]] wrote that just before the Sicilian Revolt Octavian made frequent expeditions in "Illyricum and Dalmatia" in order not to keep his troops idle and to battle-harden them.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.78.2&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that these campaigns were also linked to the instability of the region. Cassius Dio noted in passim that in 39 BC [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]] suppressed a rebellion of the [[Parthini]] after a few battles.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.41.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 35 BC Octavian campaigned against the [[Iapydes]] who had carried out raids against [[Aquileia]], plundered Tergestus ([[Trieste]]) and had destroyed Pola ([[Pula]]) in the previous year. He marched along a steep and rugged road. The Iapydes hid in the woods and ambushed him. However, Octavian had sent contingents to occupy the ridges on both sides of the road. These descended on them and defeated them. They then abandoned the town of Terponus and fled to the thickets. Octavian seized the city, but did not burn it, hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He then advanced on Metulus (near [[Ogulin]]), which was the main town of the Iapydes. It was defended by 3,000 men who defeated the Romans who surrounded the walls. Octavian began a full siege. When its battered walls begun to crumble the Metulians built another one inside. The Romans burnt the abandoned wall and built a mound by the second one and threw four bridges on top of it. Octavian ordered some if his men to go to the back of the town to divert attention. The enemy destroyed three of the bridges. Since his soldiers panicked, Octavian crossed the bridge together with Agrippa and Hiero, two of his lieutenants, and one of his bodyguards. The soldiers followed suit. The bridge fell under their weight. Octavian was injured in the right leg and in both arms. He had more bridges built. This determination discouraged the Metulians, who surrendered. The next day they sent messengers who offered to give fifty hostages and promised to receive a garrison and to assign to the Romans the highest hills while they would occupy the lower ones. When the garrison entered and ordered them to lay down their arms they shut their wives and children in their council chamber and placed guards with orders to set fire to the building if they lost the fight they decided to undertake. They attacked from the lower positions and they were routed. The guards set fire to the council chamber. Many of the women killed themselves and their children while others jumped into the fire holding their children. The city burned completely. The rest of the Iapydes surrendered and came under Roman subjection for the first time. Octavian left and the Poseni rebelled. Marcus Helvius was sent against them. He conquered them, executed the leaders of the revolt and sold the rest into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian marched on the [[Segestani]], a Pannonian tribe which had been defeated by the Romans twice but were not asked for hostages and rebelled. He advanced against them through Pannonian territory which was not under the subjection of the Romans. The enemy took to the woods and ambushed the stragglers of the army. Octavian spared the fields hoping for a voluntary surrender. Since this did not happen he ravaged the country for eight days until he reached their town, Segesta, on the River [[Sava]]. It was strongly protected by the river and a ditch. Octavian wanted to use it as a base for a campaign against the Dacians and the Bastarnae on the other side of the River Danube. [[Burebista]] had previously led them in an invasion across the Danube but then returned homeland ([[Dacia]], in today's [[Romania]]) and campaigned to its east. Octavian must have thought that there was a danger of another invasion which would destabilise the area. Alternatively, they might have been launching raids across the river. Octavian built a fleet on the Sava to bring provisions to the Danube. When he approached the city he told the Segestani envoys that he wanted a garrison in the town and as much food as they could supply. The leaders acquiesced. The people were angry but consented to giving hostages from the notable families. When the troops came they shut the city gates and manned the walls. Augustus built a bridge over the river and besieged the town. He ambushed some Pannonians who were coming to its aid, killing some of them and putting the rest to flight. The siege lasted thirty days. Augustus only imposed a fine. He placed a garrison of twenty-five [[Cohort (Roman military unit)|cohorts]] (roughly two and a half legions) and returned to Rome, intending to return in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10. 22-24&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a Roman town, Segesta was called [[Siscia]]. It is now modern [[Sisak]] in [[Croatia]].

Cassius Dio wrote that after the fall of this city the rest of Pannonia surrendered. After this Octavian left Fufius Geminus there with a small force and returned to Rome. He set out to lead an expedition into Britain and had already reached Gaul in the winter of 34 BC when some of the newly conquered peoples in Pannonia and the Dalmatians rose in revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.37.7&lt;/ref&gt; Appian wrote that there was a rumour that the garrison at Segesta had been massacred and Augustus made his way back. The rumour was exaggerated. There had been an uprising and the Romans had lost many men, but the next day they suppressed the rebellion. Octavian turned on the Dalmatians instead. They had been in arms since the rout of the troops of Aulus Gabinius in 48 BC. When he marched on them they formed a federation. They had up to 12,000 troops led by Versus, who had seized [[Promona]] (south of modern [[Knin]], Croatia) from the [[Liburnians]]) and fortified it even though it was a tough mountain stronghold. Versus placed the bulk of his forces in the city and distributed the rest on the nearby hills to obstruct the Roman advance. Octavian begun to build a wall in the plain around the town and two hills held by the enemy as a cover for contingents which were heading to the highest hills through their woods. They overpowered the guards at night and at dawn Octavian attacked the city with the bulk of his army. He sent another force to reinforce the occupied heights. The enemy thought that they were attacked from all sides. Those on the hills were afraid that they would be cut off from the water supplies and fled to the town. Octavian continued to build the wall, which reached a length of seven kilometres. Testimus, another Dalmatian commander, brought a relief army. Octavian drove him back to the mountains. He seized Promona before the [[circumvallation]] was finished. A small force made a sortie. The Romans repulsed it, pursued it and entered the town with it. The enemy took refuge in the citadel. On the fourth night they attacked a Roman cohort which was keeping watch, putting it to flight. However, the attack was repulsed and the next day the city surrendered. The cohort which had fled was punished by [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]]. The spared men were forced to subsist on barley instead of wheat for that summer. Testimus disbanded his troops and told them to scatter. The Romans did not pursue them.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.24-27&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio wrote that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] had conducted a campaign against the Dalmatians prior to this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.38.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in 34 BC, the Romans seized the town of Sunodium at the edge of the forest in which the army of Aulus Gabinius had been entrapped by the Dalmatians in a long and deep gorge between two mountains. After Octavian had burned Sunodium the Dalmatians laid an ambush. However, he was protected by soldiers he had sent to the summits of the mountains to follow him on either side while he passed through the gorge. He cut down trees and captured and burned all the towns he found on his way. In 33 BC he besieged the city of [[Setovia]]. An enemy force came to its assistance, but he prevented it from entering the place. Octavian was struck by a stone on the knee and was confined for several days. He returned to Rome to take up his consulship and got Titus Statilius to continue the siege. He then went back to Dalmatia. The Dalmatians were cut off from foreign supplies and were hungry. They met Octavian while he was on his way and surrendered. He demanded 700 of their children as hostages, and the standards of the Roman legions which had been taken from Aulus Gabinius when he was routed. They complied and also promised to pay the tribute which had been in arrears since the time of Julius Caesar. Octavian then moved on the Derbani, who also sued for peace, gave hostages, and promised to pay the tribute in arrears. Other tribes did the same on his approach. He could not reach some tribes due to sickness. These gave no hostages and made no treaties. Appian wrote that it seemed that they were subjugated later and that Octavian subdued the whole Illyrian country, including both the tribes which had rebelled and those which had never before been under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.27&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Appian was referring to just Illyria/Dalmatia, rather or the whole of that was to become the province of Illyricum. With regard to Pannonia, some historians think that Octavian probably conquered the southern part of Pannonia and that the northern part was conquered in the Pannonian War (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Dzino, D., Bellum Pannonicum: The Roman armies and indigenous communities in southern Pannonia 16‑9 BC, p. 471 [https://www.academia.edu/1986169/Bellum_Pannonicum_The_Roman_armies_and_indigenous_communities_in_southern_Pannonia_16-9_BC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Appian also wrote that Octavian overcame the Oxyaei, the Perthoneatae, the Bathiatae, the [[Taulantii]], the Cambaei, the Cinambri, the Meromenni, and the Pyrissaei, the [[Docleatae]], the Carui, the Interphrurini, the Naresii, the [[Glintidiones]], the [[Taurisci]], the Hippasini and the Bessi. The Moentini and the Avendeatae, two [[Iapydes|Iapyde]] tribes which lived on the Alps, surrendered on Octavian's approach. He took the city of the Arrepini, the largest and most warlike of the Iapydes, who had fled to the woods. He did not burn it hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He also seized the islands of Melite (Mljet) and Melaina Corcyra ([[Korčula]]) and destroyed its settlements because its inhabitants practiced piracy. He executed the young men and sold the rest into slavery. He deprived the Liburnians of their ships because they practiced piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman province==
After his campaigns in Illyricum, Octavian fought a war against [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] in 31/30 BC. He won and became the sole ruler of Rome. After that he spent a few years laying the foundations for his personal rule. Illyricum became a province as a formal administrative unit in 27 BC, with the first settlement with the Roman senate. This formalised his personal rule. The senate bestowed of the honorary title of Augustus on him. He became the first Roman emperor. Historians use the name Augustus for this period. The settlement also divided the provinces of the empire into senatorial and imperial provinces. The former were under the authority of the senate, which chose their governors form among the senators. The latter were under Augustus, who appointed their governors. Augustus held the frontier provinces, which hosted the bulk of the Roman troops. Initially Illyricum was a senatorial propreatorial province. Rebellions in the province showed the necessity of maintaining a strong force there and in 11 BC it became an imperial province under the governorship of [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (consul 10)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]].

The administrative organisation of Illyricum was carried out late in the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD) and early in the reign of Tiberius (14–37 AD). Tiberius made initial arrangements in the last weeks of the Batonian war (see below). This work was interrupted by a mutiny of the Roman troops in 14 AD, but was then resumed. We have a fairly detailed picture of the administrative arrangements of Illyricum through [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, Natural History, 2.25-26, 28&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal area was subdivided into three regions called ''conventus juridicus'' which were named after the towns of [[Scardona]] ([[Skradin]]), [[Salona]] and [[Narona]] (near [[Metković]]). The ''conventus Salonitanus'' was subdivided into 5 ''civitates'' and 927 decuriae. The ''conventus Naronitianus'' was subdivided into 13 ''civitates'' and 540 decuriae. The ''conventus Scardonitanus'' was subdivided into 14 ''civitates''. There is no information for its decuriae. In the more urbanised coastal area towns with large Greek-speaking populations and may inhabitants from Italy were organised as ''municipia'' (self-governing towns) or ''coloniae'' (Italian settlements) and had their own council. Some of the local communities enjoyed some privileges and some Librunian ones enjoyed Italian rights. In the less urbanised interior the administration relied exclusively on the ''civitates''. The jurisdiction of the governor of Illyricum was limited to the coastal area. The inland districts had their own governors in the form of the ''praefecti civitatum'' of the ''civitates''. Pannonia was subdivided into 14 civitates. Again, there is no information about the decuriae. It was also a military district under the prefect of Pannonia, who was in charge of the legions stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;Dzino, D., Illyricum in Roman Politics, pp. 162–168&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalmatia had considerable strategic and economic importance for the Romans. It possessed a number of important commercial ports along its coastline, and had [[gold]]-mines in [[Dalmatia]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. J., The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), 1996, p.  224: "... governor of Dalmatia forced the natives to wash out the gold, though they were too ignorant to appreciate its value, and there was an imperial bureau for the Dalmatian gold mines based in Salona&lt;/ref&gt; with an imperial bureau in [[Salona]]. Dyrrachium ([[Durrës]], in modern Albania) and Brundisium ( [[Brindisi]], in southern Italy) were the ports used to cross the Adriatic Sea for the journeys from Rome to the eastern Mediterranean and vice versa. Dyrrachium also became the starting point of the [[Via Egnatia]], the [[Roman road]] which went to [[Byzantium]] in the east, opposite Asia. There were important Roman communities in a number of towns on the central and southern part of the coast of today's Croatia, such as [[Iader]] ([[Zadar]]), Salona ([[Solin]], on the outskirts of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]), [[Narona]] (near [[Metković]]), and [[Epidaurus]] (Epidaurum in Latin, modern [[Cavtat]], near [[Dubrovnik]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chapot, V., Parker, E. A, The Romans, World History of civilization, 1997, p.  268&lt;/ref&gt; The capital [[Salona]] was protected by two military camps at [[Burnum]] and [[Delminium]].

===The Pannonian War (14–10 BC)===
From 14 BC to 10 BC there was a series of rebellions in southern Pannonia and northern Dalmatia which Roman writers referred to as bellum pannomicum (the Pannonian war). We have very little information about these events. Most of it comes from brief accounts by Cassius Dio and passing references by other authors. We are not told what the causes were either. The Roman sources had little interest in Illyria from the campaigns of Augustus in 35–33 BC to 16 BC. Cassius Dio wrote that in that year the governor of Illyria for 17–16 BC, [[Publius Silius Nerva]], went to fight in the Italian Alps because there were no troops there. Taking advantage of this, some Pannonians and the [[Noricum|Noricans]] entered [[Istria]] and pillaged it. Silius Nerva quickly brought the situation under control. At the same time, there was a small rebellion in Dalmatia. The [[Dentheletae]] (a [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribe in eastern [[Moesia]]), together with the [[Scordisci]] (who lived in today's [[Serbia]], at the confluence of the Rivers Savus [Sava], Dravus [Drava] and [[Danube]]) attacked the [[Roman Province of Macedonia|Roman province of Macedonia]] (Greece). At the same time a civil war broke out in [[Thrace]]. Therefore, there was instability on the eastern Alps and in the Balkan Peninsula. In 15 BC the Romans conquered the Scordisci and annexed [[Noricum]]. They also conducted other operations further west on the Alps against the [[Rhaetian people|Rhaeti]] and [[Vindelici]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.20.1‑3&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman military operations in Illyricum might have been started by [[Marcus Vinicius]] the governor for 14–13 BC. The Pannonian war led to Illyricum being transferred from being a senatorial province to being an imperial province.

Velleius Paterculus wrote that the Pannonian war started by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and Vinicius and that [[Tiberius]] ended it.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.96.2‑3&lt;/ref&gt; Florus mentioned a victory of Vinicius over the Pannonians living between the rivers [[Sava]] and [[Drava]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 2.24&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio noted in two separate passages that a rebellion by the Pannonians in 14 BC was suppressed quickly, and that in late 13 BC Augustus gave Agrippa, his most important ally, supreme command and sent him to Pannonia (this suggests that the problem was serious). Agrippa solved the situation through negotiations and personal influence.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.24.3, 28.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; After Agrippa's sudden death the Breuci refused to observe the treaty they had made with him. Tiberius was given the command in Pannonia and defeated the Pannonians with the help of the [[Scordisci]], who had been recently conquered by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.31.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius added that after this Tiberius subjugated the Dalmatians and the [[Breuci]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 9.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 BC Tiberius fought and defeated both the Dalmatians and the Pannonians. Later in the year, as already mentioned, Illyricum became an imperial province under the control of Augustus. In the winter 11/10 BC the [[Dacians]] crossed the frozen [[Danube]] and plundered the Pannonians. Some Dalmatian communities rebelled against the payment of a tribute. Tiberius, who was in Gaul, had to return to confront this. In 10 BC there were repeated uprisings in both Pannonia and Dalmatia which Tiberius suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.36.2 3, 55.2.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassius Dio referred to all of these conflicts as rebellions. Dzino argues that it is therefore unlikely that they involved any conquests. The relations of the Romans with locals in frontier areas involved alliance treaties and treaties with client states, both of which entailed nominal independence. The breaking of these treaties was considered as a rebellion and as something which had to be suppressed. Augustus in his propagandistic writing stated that under Tiberius’ command Rome extended her sphere to Pannonian peoples where the Roman army had never been before and that Augustus extended the boundaries of Illyricum to the banks of the River Danube. However, Suetonius implied that this extension to the banks of this river occurred only after the Batonian War (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 16&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that in the aftermath of the Pannonian war Roman military presence in southern Pannonia increased. Dzino argues that it is likely that the local communities acted as a compact anti-Roman block and that there may have been pro- and anti-Roman factions. Some may have surrendered peacefully and some of them may have been pro-Roman all along. The communities of the region relied on kinship relationships, rather than formal state institutions. This may have led to political competition. Being friendly to the Romans or challenging them could have involved manoeuvres by local elites to strengthen their power-base. Acquiescence or opposition to the Romans could involve often unpredictable contests over political positions locally.&lt;ref&gt;Dzino, D., Bellum Pannonicum: The Roman armies and indigenous communities in southern Pannonia 16‑9 BC, pp. 471–472 [https://www.academia.edu/1986169/Bellum_Pannonicum_The_Roman_armies_and_indigenous_communities_in_southern_Pannonia_16-9_BC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batonian War (6–9 AD)===
{{Main|Bellum Batonianum}}

The Batonian War (bellum batonianum in Latin) was a large scale rebellion which was led [[Bato the Daesitiate]] and [[Bato the Breucian]]. The Romans named this war after these two leaders with the same name. It lasted four years (6–9 AD). In 6 AD the Romans were preparing to launch a second expedition against the [[Marcomanni]] in [[Germania]]. This would have involved the legions stationed in Germania and most of the legions stationed in Illyricum. The natives were asked to provide [[auxilia]]ry troops. When these forces gathered they rebelled under the leadership of Bato the Daesitiate. [[Cassius Dio]] described his force as Dalmatian, which suggests that he had men who came from various tribes of Dalmatia. This is a very likely scenario as the native troops would have been recruited from a wide area. A Roman force which was sent against the rebels was defeated. Bato the Breucian, the military leader of the [[Breuci]], the largest tribe in southern Pannonia, marched on [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], in today's [[Serbia]]). He was defeated by [[Aulus Caecina Severus (suffect consul 1 BC)|Aulus Caecina Severus]], the governor of the neighbouring Roman province of [[Moesia]]. Bato the Daesitiate marched on [[Salona]], in Dalmatia, but was defeated by [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus]], the governor of Illyricum. Bato then went east to join the other Bato and the two of them occupied Mount Alma (Mount [[Fruška Gora]], [[Serbia]], just north of Sirmium). They were defeated by a Thracian cavalry detachment of [[Rhoemetalces I|Rhoemetalces]] (the king of the [[Odrysian kingdom|Odrysian Kingdom]] in [[Thrace]]) which supported the Romans. The Dalmatians overran the territory of the Roman allies and drew many more tribes into the revolt. [[Tiberius]] (the future emperor), who was in charge of the Roman army marched on them. However, they avoided pitched battles and kept moving around, causing great devastation. Facing an enemy with avoided bitched battle and used guerrilla tactics, Tiberius conducted counterinsurgency operations.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.110, 112.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Velleius Paterculus]] the rebels divided their forces into three parts. One was to invade Italy, which was not far from [[Nauportus]] (a Roman fort in today's Slovenia), one had already entered the [[Roman Province of Macedonia]] (Greece) and the third fought in their home territories. They executed their plan swiftly. They massacred Roman civilians and a sizable veteran contingent who were helpless in this remote area. They seized Macedonia and the pillaged everywhere. Thus, in this version the rebellion seemed to have a plan and the Dalmatians and the Breuci seemed to have acted in concert from the beginning. In Cassius Dio, instead, Bato the Daesitiate initially had a few men and his success increased his forces. After his failure to take Salona he allied with the other Bato. Tiberius divided the Roman army into several divisions to evade the united forces of the rebels. Outposts were placed to blockade them, to prevent them from breaking through and to disrupt their supplies. The situation in Illyricum, which was next to Italy, created panic in Rome and even Augustus was fearful. Levies were held all over Italy. The veterans were recalled. Rich families were ordered to supply freedmen compulsorily in proportion to their income. Augustus warned that the rebels could reach Rome in ten days if drastic action was not taken.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 7 AD Augustus sent [[Germanicus]] to Illyricum with a force of freemen and freedmen. Some of the latter were requisitioned form their masters, who were paid a compensation. Velleius Paterculus wrote that the rebels in Pannonia who faced Tiberius were not happy with the size of their forces. They were worn down and brought to the verge of famine (presumably due to ravaging), could not withstand his offensives an avoided pitched battles. They went to the Claudian Mountains (a mountain range in Pannonia, in the [[Varaždin]] County in northern [[Croatia]]) and took a defensive position in their fortifications. The second rebel force confronted the legions which Caecina Severus and [[Marcus Plautius Silvanus (consul 2 BC)|Marcus Plautius Silvanus]] were bringing to Illyricum (from Moesia and the [[Roman province of Asia]], three and two legions respectively). They surrounded the five legions, their auxiliary troops and the Thracian cavalry and almost inflicted a fatal defeat. The Thracian cavalry was routed and the allied cavalry fled. The legions suffered casualties, but they then rallied and won the day. In Cassius Dio’ version, instead, the two Batos went to wait for the arrival of Caecina Severus. He did not mention Plautius Silvanus. They attacked him unexpectedly when he was encamped near the Volcaean marshes. They were defeated. After this battle the Roman army was divided into detachments to overrun many parts of the country at once. The rebels withdrew to mountain fortresses from which they launched raids whenever they could. Aulus Caecina Severus and Marcus Plautius Silvanus joined Tiberius and a huge army was assembled. As mentioned, they had five legions. Tiberius also had five legions (three in Pannonia and two in Dalmatia). Tiberius decided to send the newly arrived armies back because the army was too large to be manageable. He escorted them with his troops. He then returned to Siscia at the beginning of a very hard winter.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29.6, 31.2, 32.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus Compendium of Roman History 2.112.3-6, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 8 BC the Dalmatians and the Pannonians wanted to sue for peace due to famine and disease, but they were prevented from doing so by the rebels, who had no hope of being spared by the Romans and continued to resist. Tiberius had pursued a policy of scorched earth to starve the Pannonians. According to Cassius Dio, Bato the Breucian overthrew Pinnes, the king of the Breuci. He became suspicious of his subject tribes and demanded hostages from the Pannonian garrisons. Bato the Daesitiate defeated him in battle and pinned him in a stronghold. He was handed over to Bato the Daesitiate and he was executed. After this many Pannonians rose in revolt. Marcus Plautius Silvanus conducted a campaign against them, conquered the Breuci and won over other tribes without a battle. Bato the Daesitiate withdrew from Pannonia, occupied the passes leading to Dalmatia and ravaged Dalmatia. In Pannonia there was some brigandage.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius Paterculus, wrote that the harsh winter brought rewards because in the following summer all of Pannonia sought peace. The Pannonians laid down their arms at the River Bathinus. Bato was made a prisoner and Pinnes gave himself up.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.114.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 9 BC the war was restricted to Dalmatia. Velleius Paterculus wrote that Augustus gave the chief command of all the forces to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. In the summer Lepidus made his way to Tiberius through areas which had not been affected by the war. He was attacked by the locals who had not been weakened by fighting. Lepidus defeated them, ravaged the fields, and burnt houses. He succeeded in reaching Tiberius. This campaign ended the war. Two Dalmatian tribes, the Perustae and Daesitiate, who were almost unconquerable because of their mountain strongholds, the narrow passes in which they lived and their fighting spirit, were almost exterminated. Cassius Dio wrote Germanicus conducted some operations in Dalmatia and seized several towns. Tiberius then spilt the army into three divisions. He sent two of them to subdue areas of Dalmatia and he went in search of Bato the Daesitiate third one. Tiberius chased the fugitive Bato around the country. He finally besieged him at Adetrium, near Salona. This was on a rock and was surrounded by steep ravines. After a long siege he managed to storm the place. Bato promised to surrender if he and his followers would be pardoned. Tiberius agreed. According to Cassius Dio Tiberius asked Bato why his people had rebelled. He replied: "You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves." It is uncertain if this quote can be attributed to Bato, however, due to the habit of ancient writers of creating fictitious quotes and attributing them to historical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 56.11-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.114.5, 115-1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7; 56.11-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regions of the province and its later dissolution===
The earliest writing which indicates that the province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia is the mention by Velleius Pareculus of Gaius Vibius Postumus as the military commander of Dalmatia under Germanicus in 9 AD., towards the end of the Batonian War.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.116.3&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that officially the province of Illyricum comprised Upper (Superius) Illyricum and Lower (Inferius) Illyricum. A transcript of an inscription of a monument in honour of Publius Cornelius Dolabella at [[Epidaurus|Epidaurum]] ([[Cavtat]], near [[Dubrovnik]]) attests that Dolabella was appointed governor of Illyricum shortly before Augustus’ death and that the statue was erected by the towns of Upper Illyricum, which implies the existence of an Upper and Lower Illyricum.&lt;ref&gt;CIL III 1741 = ILS 938&lt;/ref&gt; However, no inscriptions attesting a Lower Illyricum have been found as yet. Dalmatia was called Upper Illyricum. Whilst the names Dalmatia and Pannonia were used in common parlance, it seems that Upper Illyricum (Dalmatia) and Lower Illyricum (Pannonia) were the official names of the two regions. The provincial governor resided in Salona in Dalmatia and governed Upper Illyricum. Lower Illyricum was a military district and a military commander was in charge of this area and its three legions and performed administrative functions as something like a deputy governor.&lt;ref&gt;Šašel-Kos, Pannonia or Lower Illyricum? Tyche Beitrage zur Alten Geschichte, Paryrologie und Epigraphik, Band 25.2010, pp. 123–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the winter of AD 57–58,&lt;ref name=Halley&gt;Halley, Henry H. ''Halley's Bible Handbook'': an Abbreviated Bible Commentary, 23rd edition, Zondervan Publishing House (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] refers to Illyricum in his [[Epistle to the Romans|Letter to the Romans]] as the westernmost point of his missionary travels so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|15:19|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter reflects his intention in due course to travel to Rome.

The province of Illyricum was eventually dissolved and replaced by two smaller provinces: Dalmatia (the southern area) and Pannonia (the northern and Danubian area). It is unclear when this happened. Kovác noted that an inscription on the base of a statue of Nero erected between 54 and 68 AD attests that it was erected by the veteran of a legion stationed in Pannonia and argues that this is the first [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence that a separate Pannonia existed at least since the reign of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Kovác, P., A Pisidian Veteran and the Forst Mention of Pannonis, Tyche, 22, 2007, pp.99–107. PL1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovács, P., Some Notes on the division of Illyiricum, in Piso, I., (ed.), Die Romischen Provinzen. Bergriff und Gundung (2008), pp. 237–248&lt;/ref&gt; However, Šašel-Kos notes that an inscription attests a governor of Illyricum under the reign of Claudius (43–51 AD) and in a military diploma published in the late 1990s, dated July 61 AD, units of auxiliaries from the Pannonian part of the province were mentioned as being stationed in Illyricum.&lt;ref&gt;Dusanic, S., An Early Diploma Milirare, Starinar (1998) 51–62 = AE 1998, 1056 = M&lt;/ref&gt; Some other diplomas attest the same.&lt;ref&gt;Holder R., P Roman Military Diplomas IV (2003), no. 202&lt;/ref&gt; This was during the reign of Nero (51–68 AD). Therefore, Šašel-Kos supports the notion that the province was dissolved during the reign of Vespasian (79–89 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Šašel-Kos, Pannonia or Lower Illyricum? Tyche Beitrage zur Alten Geschichte, Paryrologie und Epigraphik, Band 25.2010, pp. 123–130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|thumb|right|The Roman province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia.]]

==Diocletian's reforms: the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum==
In 293 AD the emperor [[Diocletian]] radically reformed the administrative structure of the Roman empire. He created the [[tetrarchy]] (rule by four). This was a co-emperorship with two senior emperors (Augusti), Diocletian and [[Maximian]], and two junior emperors (Caesars), [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Galerius]]. The empire was subdivided into four [[praetorian prefecture]]s. Each was headed by one of two co-emperors or one of two Caesars (thus, a total of two co-emperors and two Caesars). Diocletian and Maximian were also in overall charge of the eastern and the western part of the empire respectively. The number of provinces was doubled and they were grouped into fifteen dioceses which were under the praetorian prefectures. The praetorian prefectures were [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Galliae]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italia et Africa]], [[Praetorian prefecture of the east|Oriens]] and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Thus, Illyricum became a praetorian prefecture. It included the dioceses of [[Diocese of Pannonia|Pannonia]], (western Hungary, a strip of land in northern [[Croatia]] along the River [[Sava]], and [[Vojvodina]], in northern [[Serbia]]), [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]] (modern western, central and northern [[Bulgaria]], central and southern [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], northern [[Albania]] and the north of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]) and [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (Greece). Hence, Illyricum came to cover the whole of the [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan Peninsula]], including [[Greece]], except for the diocese of Thrace (in modern south-eastern Bulgaria, north-eastern Greece and European [[Turkey]]). It also included [[Crete]] and the Greek islands in the north and the southwest of the [[Aegean Sea]], and [[Noricum]]. The diocese of Pannonia was subdivided into the provinces of [[Pannonia Prima]], [[Pannonia Secunda|Secunda]], [[Pannonia Savia|Savia]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Veleria]] (the north, southeast, southwest and west of Pannonia respectively), Dalmatia, Noricum Ripense ("along the river", the northern part, which was crossed by the river [[Danube]]) and Noricum Mediterraneum (the southern part).&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, R., Atlas of Classical History (1989), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum was [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]], northern [[Serbia]]). Under the tetrarchy it was headed by Galerius. The praetorian prefecture survived until the early 7th century.

==Military importance==
Pannonia was a very valuable source of military manpower. From the 3rd to the 6th century some of the most useful troops were recruited from Pannonia, Dalmatia, Moesia and Roman [[Thracia|Thrace]]. This is not entirely surprising. Pannonia and the other areas along the River [[Danube]], the frontier of the empire in the [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan Peninsula]], were exposed to attacks on the empire from across this river. Therefore, Pannonia was very important militarily. Pat Southern sees Illyricum as holding the empire together.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, P., Augustus (Roman Imperial Biographies), 1998, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Late Roman Empire]], the armies of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum had a commander in-chief, the ''[[magister militum]] per Illyricum'', based at [[Naissus]] ([[Niš]], southern [[Serbia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Croke, B., Count Marcellinus and his chronicle, 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; John Bury wrote that "The importance of Illyricum did not lie in its revenues, but in its men."&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J., The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians (2000), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The region's native peoples, renowned for their military prowess, became important for the [[Roman army]]. During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] the emperors [[Claudius II Gothicus|Claudius II]] (reigned 268–270), [[Quintilius]] (reigned 270), [[Aurelian]] (reigned 270–275) and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] (reigned 276–282) were born in [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], in today's Serbia). They have been dubbed by historians the Pannonian emperors. [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284–305) was born in [[Salona]] ([[Solin]], Croatia). [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Constantius III]] (421AD ) were  born in Naissus. His father, [[Constantius Chlorus]], was born in [[Moesia]] Superior. The Byzantine emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] (reigned 491–518) was born in [[Dyrrhachium]] ([[Durrës]], Albania). [[Justinian I]] (reigned 527–565) was born in [[Tauresium]], in the province of [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]] in the [[Diocese of Dacia]] (20 kilometres [12 miles] southeast of [[Skopje]] in today's [[Republic of Macedonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J. B., History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, Vol 2 (2008), p. 7; {{ISBN|1605204056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian I was the last Latin emperor of this empire. From then on all the emperors were Greek.

'''Institutional dichotomy''', according to [[John Federick Wolfenden, Baron Wolfenden|John Wolfenden]] (responsible for the [[Wolfenden Report]]), in his essay ''The Gap &amp;mdash; The Bridge'', states that the dichotomization of intellectual disciplines by [[education]]al institutions, specifically [[college|collegiate institutions]], is to blame for the communication gap between specialists in different fields.

Forced to pursue contrasting disciplines in college, students diverge from the broad educational background established in high school and pursue narrower studies. As a result, these students lose contact with the shared basis of their education as they venture into separate abstract studies. In effect, the communication gap of collegiate students widens as they become saturated with a curriculum of abstractions that relate to a single area of study.

For instance, a college freshman chooses [[mathematics]] as his field of study while another chooses [[English language|English]]. As they study, the two students become grossly out of touch as they adapt to new languages which will soon serve as a code in their future careers. The mathematics student becomes consumed by symbols and numbers while the English student immerses himself in a sea of classical [[literary style]]s and [[grammar|grammatical]] mechanics. Consequently, the students soon become ill-equipped to communicate with each other. The mathematics student now becomes "illiterate" by standards of the English major and the English major becomes "innumerate" by standards of the mathematics major. 

Because knowledge is increasing, some fragmentation of disciplines is inevitable. The problem with fragmentation is that students are forced to live in ignorance of studies outside of their fields.

'''Jehudi Ashmun''' (April 21, 1794 – August 25, 1828) was an American religious leader and social reformer who became involved in the [[American Colonization Society]]. He emigrated to the colony of Liberia in 1822, where he served as the United States government's agent (de facto governor) for two different terms: one from August 1822 until April 1824, and another from August 1824 until March 1828.

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[Champlain (village), New York|Champlain, New York]] in 1794, Ashmun first studied at [[Middlebury College]] in Vermont.  He spent his senior year at the [[University of Vermont]] and was ordained in Maine as a minister.

==Marriage and family==
Ashmun married in 1818 and his wife accompanied him to [[Bangor, Maine]], where he took his first position.

==Career==
Ashmun was appointed as the first principal, and one of the first two professors, of the [[Bangor Theological Seminary]] in [[Bangor, Maine]].  He retained this professorship until 1827, despite leaving the country for a few years while living and working in the new colony of [[Monrovia, Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Frederick Freeman, ''A Plea for Africa'' (1837), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quarterly"&gt;''American Quarterly Register'' (1842), pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawn by other opportunities, Ashmun moved to Washington, DC, where he worked as the editor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] monthly. Interested in the work of the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), he founded the newspaper ''[[The African Intelligencer]]'' and wrote about their mission.  His articles about the ACS, which was committed to repatriating free blacks to a colony in Liberia, led to his political appointment as representative of the U.S. government to the colony. At the age of 26, Ashmun was the leader in 1822 of a group of settlers and [[missionaries]] to Liberia on the ship ''Elizabeth''. His wife went with him but was among the many settlers who died of [[malaria]] in Liberia.

As United States representative to Liberia as well as agent of the ACS, Ashmun effectively became governor of the colony from 1822 to 1828, from ages 28 to 34. He took a leadership role in what he found to be a demoralized colony and helped build the defenses of [[Monrovia]], as well as developing trade.  During his tenure in Liberia, Ashmun increased agricultural production, annexed more lands from neighboring tribes, and exploited commercial opportunities in the interior.

He helped create a [[constitution]] for Liberia that enabled blacks to hold positions in the government. African Americans and their descendants, known as [[Americo-Liberians]], dominated the government into the late 20th century. This was unlike what happened in the early decades of the neighboring British colony of [[Sierra Leone]], which was dominated by whites although also founded for the resettlement of free blacks from Britain and Upper Canada. Ashmun's letters home and his book, ''History of the American Colony in Liberia, 1821–1823'' (1826) constitute the earliest written history of the Liberia colony.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quarterly" /&gt;

==Death==
In ill health in Liberia, Ashmun returned to the United States. He died in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] soon after. He was interred in [[Grove Street Cemetery]].

This '''list of animals with fraudulent diplomas''' includes nonhuman animals who have been submitted as applicants to suspected [[diploma mill]]s.  On occasion, they have been admitted and granted a degree, as reported in reliable sources.&lt;!-- mention inclusion criteria per [[WP:LIST]]--&gt; Animals are often used as a device to clearly demonstrate the lax standards of the awarding institutions. In one case, a cat's degree helped lead to a successful fraud prosecution against the institution that had issued it.

==Cats==

===Colby Nolan===
Colby Nolan is a [[housecat]] who was awarded an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in 2004 by Trinity Southern University, a [[Dallas]]-based [[diploma mill]], sparking a [[fraud]] [[lawsuit]] by the [[Pennsylvania]] attorney general's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026103729/http://www.nbc10.com/money/3975070/detail.html| url=http://www.nbc10.com/money/3975070/detail.html| archivedate=October 26, 2007| title=Cat Gets MBA Degree—Kitty Also Had A 3.5 GPA | work=NBC10.com Money| publisher=[[WCAU|NBC10]]| date=December 6, 2004 |accessdate=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colby Nolan lives with a deputy attorney general. In looking to [[sting operation|expose]] Trinity Southern University for fraud, some undercover agents had the then six-year-old Colby Nolan obtain a bachelor's degree in business administration for $299. On the cat's application, the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a [[community college]], worked at a fast-food restaurant, babysat, and maintained a newspaper route. Then the school informed Colby that, due to the job experience listed on his application, he was eligible for an executive MBA for $100 more. The agents then sent for Colby's [[Transcript (education)|transcript]], which claimed that he had a [[grade point average|GPA]] of 3.5.

[[Jerry Pappert]], Pennsylvania's attorney general, filed a lawsuit against Trinity Southern University upon learning that the cat had received the degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6664906/ | title=School that awarded MBA to cat sued | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | author=AP| date=December 6, 2004| accessdate=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lawsuit, Pappert also told the diploma mill, which had used [[email spam]] to sell degrees, to provide restitution to anyone who had ordered a degree from them.

In December 2004, the Texas attorney general obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against Trinity Southern and its owners, Craig B. and Alton S. Poe. The court also ordered the school's assets frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/tx_tsu.html|title=Texas Freezes Assets of Online University|work=Consumer Affairs|date=December 18, 2004|accessdate=March 31, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115014527/http://consumeraffairs.com/news04/tx_tsu.html|archivedate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the Poes were assessed penalties of over $100,000 by the court and were ordered not to market or promote fraudulent, substandard degree programs or to represent their university as being [[higher education accreditation|accredited]] or affiliated with legitimate universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=108FBC19E2DE25B4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Internet 'university' that gave cat a diploma is fined|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|location=Texas|date= March 18, 2005|page= 6B}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConsumerAffairs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/diploma_mill.html|title=Diploma Mill Operators Hit With Court Judgments|work=Consumer Affairs.|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the Poes were also associated with Wesleyan International University and Prixo Southern University.&lt;ref name="ConsumerAffairs" /&gt; Trinity Southern University's website has been offline since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.trinitysouthernuniversity.org/ Trinity Southern University website] history at ''[https://web.archive.org Web Archive]'', showing it offline as of 2005, and the domain for sale since 2006.

===George===
In 2009, George, a cat owned by Chris Jackson (presenter of the [[BBC]] show ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]] North East &amp; Cumbria''), was registered with three professional organizations: the British Board of [[Neuro-linguistic programming|Neuro Linguistic Programming]], the United Fellowship of Hypnotherapists, and the Professional Hypnotherapy Practitioner Association, securing George's accreditation as a [[hypnotherapist]].&lt;ref name="bbc-george"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6304640/Women-can-enlarge-breasts-through-mind-power-claims-hypnotist.html|title= Women can enlarge breasts through mind power, claims hypnotist|location=London|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 12, 2009|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Lakeland, Florida]] newspaper ''[[The Ledger]]'' obtained a high school diploma from "Washington High Academy" for Kitty O'Malley, a cat also known as Spanky.

The ease with which Zoe obtained these credentials became the subject of an article by the [[American Bar Association]] and a news report by [[CBS News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosgrove-Mather|first=Bootie|date=January 16, 2004 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/16/eveningnews/consumer/main593790.shtml |title=Is Your Psychotherapist Qualified?|publisher=CBS News|work=Jim Acosta Reports|accessdate= December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification of Zoe has been cited in several books and articles on credentialing scams, and has appeared in psychology and [[forensic science|forensic]] curricula. Eichel also served as the consultant to the [[BBC]] investigation that ultimately led to the certification of [[List of animals with fraudulent diplomas#George|George the cat]] by various UK hypnosis associations.&lt;ref name="bbc-george"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8303126.stm | title=Cat registered as hypnotherapist | publisher=[[BBC]]| date=October 12, 2009 | accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' reported that Sassafras, a female [[poodle]] belonging to a New York City physician, had received a diploma from the [[American Association of Nutritional Consultants|American Association of Nutrition and Dietary Consultants]]. Her owner had bought the diploma for $50 to demonstrate that "something that looks like a diploma doesn't mean that somebody has responsible training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McGrath, Cauley, Myers|date=April 2, 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954229-1,00.html |title=Education: Sending Degrees to the Dogs|newspaper=Time Magazine|accessdate= June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrett, Stephen|date=November 27, 2007 |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aanc.html |title=AANC: Who and What Does It Represent?| work=Quackwatch|accessdate= June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wally===
In 2004, the [[Albany, New York]] television station [[WRGB]] ran a report in which reporter Peter Brancato applied to and received an associate degree from [[Almeda University]] on behalf of his dog, Wally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306150129/http://www2.wrgb.com/iteam/investigation/investigation.asp?selection=article_23366|archivedate=March 6, 2012|url=http://www2.wrgb.com/iteam/investigation/investigation.asp?selection=article_23366 |title=Degrees for Sale (transcript)|work=I-Team |publisher=WRGB |date=February 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schultheis |first=Emily |date=January 30, 2010 |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20100130_Degrees_of_doubt__PUC_hire_has_unaccredited_sheepskins.html|title=Degrees of doubt: PUC hire has unaccredited sheepskins |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|archiveurl=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12D901C722080D28&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM&lt;!--http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/13826070-1.html dead--&gt; |archivedate=January 30, 2010|accessdate= June 2, 2013}}{{paywall|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the application, Brancato listed, "Plays with the kids every day ... teaches them to interact better with each other ... Teaches them responsibilities like feeding the dog." Almeda University granted Wally a "life experience" associate degree in "Childhood Development". After the report aired, Almeda University protested that Brancato [[Perjury|perjured]] himself by creating a false identity using a fabricated name and date of birth. In a public statement, an Almeda University representative wrote, "He completed an application that included a background of the following: Eight-years tutoring pre-K children, curriculum design and development, teaching coping skills, and volunteer coaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|publisher=[[Almeda University]] |title=Perjury to Prove a Point? |url=http://almedauniversity.org/press-release.html |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108181011/http://almedauniversity.org/press-release.html |archivedate=November 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Wally was featured in a [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] mayoral campaign political cartoon, with a dialogue bubble reading, "I graduated with Bill Chesen", referring to candidate Chesen's Almeda University bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bunge, Kayla|date=September 19, 2008 |url=http://gazettextra.com/news/2008/sep/19/no-charges-lake-geneva-election-flap/ |title=No charges in Lake Geneva election flap|publisher=GazetteXtra|newspaper=Janesville Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ollie===
In 2017, Mike Daube, a public health expert in Western Australia, reinvented his dog Ollie as Dr. Olivia Doll. He made up credentials including "past associate of the [[Shenton_Park,_Western_Australia#Animal_welfare|Shenton Park Institute]] for Canine Refuge Studies" (where she was a rescue dog) and submitted her application for posts on the editorial boards of some [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory journals]].  Several accepted her application, and the Global Journal of Addiction and Rehabilitation Medicine named her associate editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Leary,Cathy|date=May 21, 2017 |url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/the-perth-dog-thats-probably-smarter-than-you-ng-a4de0d201ce420e0302c69532a399419 |title=The Perth dog that's probably smarter than you|publisher=Seven West Media|newspaper=PerthNow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maxwell Sniffingwell ===
In 2009, Dr. Ben Mays, a veterinarian in [[Clinton, Arkansas]], submitted an application to [[Belford University]] on behalf of English bulldog Maxwell Sniffingwell. The application included his work as a reproductive specialist, noting his "natural ability in [[theriogenology]]" and "experimental work with felines" and his understanding of the merits of specialization despite a desire to "'do them all.'" His application was accepted upon the $549 payment to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2010/10/02/another-belford-u-doctor|title=Another proud Belford U. doctor|last=Brantley|first=Max|work=Arkansas Times|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bangladesh]] hosts a number of [[endangered language]]s that are defined as [[language]]s at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

==Status==
According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics data from 2011, the country has 27 "small anthropological groups" consisting of 17,84,000 people in total.&lt;ref name=sathi&gt;Muktasree Chakma Sathi, "[http://www.dhakatribune.com/sites/default/files/issue/2014/05/Weekend%202%EF%80%A24.pdf Disappearing Mother Tongues]", ''Daily Tribune'', page 8, May 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologists in Bangladesh and indigenous leaders claim that 48 indigenous communities, a total of 5 million people, are present in Bangladesh. They host 4 language families with 30 ethno-languages. 12-18 of them are endangered at varying degrees. International Mother Language Institute (IMLI) in Dhaka, a government institute, launched a project to reservation and mobilization of 37 languages (including [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the dominant language of Bangladesh). Only 4 of the target languages have their own scripts &amp;mdash; [Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Marma language|Marma]], [[Mru language|Mru]], and [[Meithei language|Meithei]].&lt;ref name=chron&gt;Special Correspondent, "[http://www.bdchronicle.com/detail/news/31/14848 Disappearing indigenous languages]", ''BD Chronicles'', 21 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Some other indigenous communities, especially the 2 lakh people living in Rajshahi, use a language called "Sadri" adopting alphabets from Hindi, Bangla, Urdu and other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Emran Hossain, "[http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=110250 30 Adivasi languages on verge of extinction]", ''Daily Star'', October 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the Sylhet tea garden area by [[Telegu language|Telegu]], [[Santali language|Santhali]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Kiranti languages|Rai]] communities as a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

The Hill Tracts, a forested upland area in southeastern Bangladesh, is home to more than a dozen indigenous peoples. 50% of the indigenous people of there have no formal schooling; less than 8% complete primary education, and only 2% completes secondary. Most of the children don't understand the instructions written in Bengali. In north-eastern Bangladesh, [[Hari caste|Hari]], [[Banai (sub-tribe)|Banai]], Dalui, and [[Koch Rajbongshi people|Rajbongshi]] indigenous communities have started to use Bengali leaving their native languages due to the lack of social and economical recognition.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

{{emotion}}

'''Loneliness''' is a complex and usually unpleasant [[emotion]]al response to [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Loneliness typically includes anxious feelings about a lack of [[Interpersonal relationship|connection]] or [[communication]] with other beings, both in the present and extending into the future. As such, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people. The causes of loneliness are varied and include social, mental, emotional, and physical factors.

Research has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers.&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peplau |first1=L.A. |last2=Perlman |first2=D. |year=1982 |chapter=Perspectives on loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=1–18 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a long explored theme in the literature of human beings since classical antiquity. Loneliness has also been described as [[social pain]]—a psychological mechanism meant to motivate an individual to seek social connections.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"&gt;Cacioppo, John; [[William Patrick, author|Patrick, William]], ''Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection'', New York : W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-393-06170-3}}.

==Common causes==
People can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of [[friendship]] relations during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another [[social]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] problem, such as [[Dysthymia|chronic depression]].

Many people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as [[infants]]. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a [[Relationship breakup|breakup]], [[divorce]], or loss of any important [[long-term relationship]]. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from [[social circle]]s caused by the event or the associated sadness.

The loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a [[grief|grief response]]; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a [[child]] (often expressed in [[postpartum depression]]), after [[marriage]], or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar [[community]], leading to [[homesickness]]. Loneliness can occur within unstable [[marriages]] or other close [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include [[anger]] or [[resentment]], or in which the feeling of [[love]] cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of [[Interpersonal communication|communication]], and can also result from places with low [[Population density|population densities]] in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a [[social phenomenon]], capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Pope |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/why-loneliness-can-be-contagious/ |title=Why loneliness can be contagious |accessdate=10 December 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1943748,00.html#ixzz0YZghiRRl |title=Feeling Alone Together: How Loneliness Spreads |publisher=Time.com |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[twin study]] found evidence that [[genetics]] account for approximately half of the measurable differences in loneliness among adults, which was similar to the heritability estimates found previously in children. These genes operate in a similar manner in males and females. The study found no common environmental contributions to adult loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10519-005-6040-8 |title=Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Loneliness in Adults: The Netherlands Twin Register Study |year=2005 |last1=Boomsma |first1=Dorret I. |last2=Willemsen |first2=Gonneke |last3=Dolan |first3=Conor V. |last4=Hawkley |first4=Louise C. |last5=Cacioppo |first5=John T. |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=745–52 |pmid=16273322|citeseerx=10.1.1.453.498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==

===Feeling lonely vs. being socially isolated===
There is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a [[loner]]). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]],&lt;ref name="Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18"/&gt; while [[solitude]] is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or [[over-stimulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1989 |chapter=Past the reflection and through the looking-glass: Extending loneliness research |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Hojat |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Crandall |title=Loneliness: Theory, research and applications |pages=51–6 |location=Newbury Park, California |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitude can have positive effects on individuals. One [[Research|study]] found that, although time spent alone tended to depress a person's mood and increase feelings of loneliness, it also helped to improve their [[Cognition|cognitive state]], such as improving [[Attention|concentration]]. Furthermore, once the alone time was over, people's moods tended to increase significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larson |first1=R. |last2=Csikszentmihalyi |first2=M. |last3=Graef |first3=R. |year=1982 |chapter=Time alone in daily experience: Loneliness or renewal? |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=41–53 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitude is also associated with other positive growth experiences, [[Religion|religious]] experiences, and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] building such as solitary quests used in [[rites of passage]]s for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1982 |chapter=Aloneness as a healing experience |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=54–67 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness can also play an important role in the [[creativity|creative]] process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to notable [[art]]istic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with [[poet]]s [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Isabella di Morra]], and numerous [[musician]]s{{Who|date=May 2017}}. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Transient vs. chronic loneliness===
The other important typology of loneliness focuses on the [[time]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Jong-Gierveld |first1=J. |last2=Raadschelders |first2=J. |year=1982 |chapter=Types of loneliness |editor1-first=Letitia Anne |editor1-last=Peplau |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Perlman |title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy |pages=105–19 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-08028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, loneliness can be viewed as either [[wikt:transient|transient]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. It has also been referred to as state and trait loneliness.

Transient (state) loneliness is temporary in nature, caused by something in the environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved.&lt;ref&gt;Duck, S. (1992). Human relations (2nd ed.).  London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter what goes on in the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.

===Loneliness as a human condition===
The [[existentialist]] school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being [[human]]. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="Exist"&gt;''[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/An%20Existential%20View%20Of%20Loneliness.htm An Existential View of Loneliness]'' - Carter, Michele; excerpt from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007024245/http://www.parkridgecenter.org/Page437.html Abiding Loneliness: An Existential Perspective]'', Park Ridge Center, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Sartre]], believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the isolation and nothingness of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomšik |first1=Robert |title=Relationship of loneliness and meaning of life among adolescents. In Current Trends in Educational Science and Practice VIII : International Proceedings of Scientific Studies |date=2015 |publisher=UKF |location=Nitra |isbn=978-80-558-0813-0 |pages=66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.

==Frequency==
There are several estimates and indicators of loneliness. It has been estimated that approximately 60 million people in the [[United States]], or 20% of the total population, feel lonely.&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Another study found that 12% of Americans have no one with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters.&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. A. &amp; Fowler, J. H. (2009). Connected: The surprising power of our social networks and how they shape our lives. New York, NY: Little, Brown and Company.{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time. The ''General Social Survey'' found that between 1985 and 2004, the number of people the average American discusses important matters with decreased from three to two. Additionally, the number of Americans with no one to discuss important matters with tripled&lt;ref&gt;Olds, J. &amp; Schwartz, R. S. (2009). ''The lonely American: Drifting apart in the 21st century''. Boston, MA: Beacon Press{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though this particular study may be flawed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/4/657.abstract|title=The 2004 GSS Finding of Shrunken Social Networks: An Artifact?|volume=74|issue=4|pages=657–669|work=sagepub.com|doi=10.1177/000312240907400408|year=2009|last1=Fischer|first1=Claude S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In the UK research by [[Age UK]] shows half a million people more than 60 years old spend each day alone without social interaction and almost half a million more see and speak to no one for 5 or 6 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/06/half-a-million-older-people-spend-every-day-alone-poll-shows  Half a million older people spend every day alone, poll shows] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017'', by the UK's [[Office for National Statistics]], found that young adults in [[England]] aged 16 to 24 reported feeling lonely more often than those in older age groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10 Loneliness - What characteristics and circumstances are associated with feeling lonely?] Analysis of characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness in England using the Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017.

Loneliness appears to have intensified in every society in the world as modernization occurs. A certain amount of this loneliness appears to be related to greater migration, smaller household sizes, a larger degree of [[media consumption]] (all of which have positive sides as well in the form of more opportunities, more choice in family size, and better access to information), all of which relates to [[social capital]].

Within [[Developed country|developed nations]], loneliness has shown the largest increases among two groups: seniors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |title=Most Senior Citizens Experience Loneliness, Say Researchers |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226045830/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-21-SeniorsAreLonely.htm |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isolatedseniors.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815113613/http://isolatedseniors.ca/ |archivedate=15 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and people living in low-density suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/49370|title=Isolation and Dissatisfaction in the Suburbs|work=Planetizen:  The Urban Planning, Design, and Development Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geog.ubc.ca/~ewyly/u200/suburbia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Seniors living in suburban areas are particularly vulnerable, for as they lose the ability to drive, they often become "stranded" and find it difficult to maintain [[interpersonal relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/Stranded-Seniors.html|title=Stranded Seniors|work=governing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is prevalent in vulnerable groups in society.  In New Zealand the fourteen surveyed groups with the highest prevalence of loneliness most/all of the time in descending order are: disabled, recent migrants, low income households, unemployed, single parents, rural (rest of South Island), seniors aged 75+, not in the labour force, youth aged 15-24, no qualifications, not housing owner-occupier, not in a family nucleus, Māori, and low personal income.&lt;ref name="Loneliness NZ"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Comber |first1=Cathy |title=Ms |url=https://www.loneliness.org.nz/nz/facts/loneliness-prevalent-in-the-vulnerable/ |website=www.loneliness.org.nz |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans seem to report more loneliness than any other country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down from an average of three in 1985. The percentage of people who noted having no such [[confidant]] rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their [[spouse]], thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000312240607100301 |title=Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades |year=2006 |last1=McPherson |first1=M. |last2=Smith-Lovin |first2=L. |last3=Brashears |first3=M. E. |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=353–75|citeseerx=10.1.1.101.6700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern office environment has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Sarah|title=Loneliness in the Workplace|date=16 May 2008|publisher=VDM Verlag Dr. Mull Ed Beasleyschaft &amp; Co.|isbn=978-3-639-02734-1}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] exists between [[Internet]] usage and loneliness is a subject of controversy, with some findings showing that Internet users are lonelier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carole |last=Hughes |year=1999 |title=The relationship of use of the Internet and loneliness among college students |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Boston College |oclc=313894784}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others showing that lonely people who use the Internet to keep in touch with loved ones (especially seniors) report less loneliness, but that those trying to make friends online became lonelier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0010 |title=Internet Use and Loneliness in Older Adults |year=2008 |last1=Sum |first1=Shima |last2=Mathews |first2=R. Mark |last3=Hughes |first3=Ian |last4=Campbell |first4=Andrew |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=208–11 |pmid=18422415}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, studies in 2002 and 2010 found that "Internet use was found to decrease loneliness and depression significantly, while perceived social support and self-esteem increased significantly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/109493102753770552 |title=In Defense of the Internet: The Relationship between Internet Communication and Depression, Loneliness, Self-Esteem, and Perceived Social Support |year=2002 |last1=Shaw |first1=Lindsay H. |last2=Gant |first2=Larry M. |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=157–71 |pmid=12025883|citeseerx=10.1.1.563.2946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Internet "has an enabling and empowering role in people's lives, by increasing their sense of freedom and control, which has a positive impact on well-being or happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1989244,00.html | work=Time | title=Is the Internet the Secret to Happiness? | date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The one apparently unequivocal finding of correlation is that long driving commutes correlate with dramatically higher reported feelings of loneliness (as well as other negative health impacts).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/05/your_commute_is_killing_you.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=3{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
[[File:Thoma Loneliness.jpg|thumb|''Loneliness'' by [[Hans Thoma]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]])]]

Loneliness has been linked with [[depression (mood)|depression]], and is thus a risk factor for [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="PsychTo"&gt;''[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/articles/200307/the-dangers-loneliness The Dangers of Loneliness]'' - Marano, Hara Estroff; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Thursday 21 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] has described loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called ''egoistic suicide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Polina |last=Shelkova |year=2010 |title=Loneliness |url=http://www.vzmakh.ru/refero/english/2009-2010/loneless.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}} In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marano |first=Hara |title=The Dangers of Loneliness |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200308/the-dangers-loneliness |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are socially isolated may report poor [[sleep]] quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00073-9 |title=Loneliness and pathways to disease |year=2003 |last1=Hawkley |first1=Louise C |last2=Cacioppo |first2=John T |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=98–105 |pmid=12615193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness has also been linked with a [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid character type]] in which one may see the world differently and experience [[social alienation]], described as ''the self in exile''.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |title=Disorders of the Self: Secret Pure Schizoid Cluster Disorder |year=1995 |pages=25–7 |last1=Masterson |first1=James F. |last2=Klein |first2=Ralph |quote=Klein was Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York |authorlink1=James F. Masterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[children]], a lack of social connections is directly linked to several forms of [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] and [[self-destructive]] behavior, most notably [[Hostility|hostile]] and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] behavior. In both children and adults, loneliness often has a negative impact on [[learning]] and [[memory]]. Its disruption of [[sleep]] patterns can have a significant impact on the ability to function in everyday life.&lt;ref name="PsychTo"/&gt;

Research from a large-scale study published in the journal [[Psychological Medicine]], showed that "lonely [[millennial]]s are more likely to have mental health problems, be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others, regardless of gender or wealth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/24/loneliness-linked-to-major-life-setbacks-for-millennials-study-says Loneliness linked to major life setbacks for millennials, study says].

Pain, depression, and fatigue function as a symptom cluster and thus may share common risk factors. Two longitudinal studies with different populations demonstrated that loneliness was a risk factor for the development of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster over time.  These data also highlight the health risks of loneliness; pain, depression, and fatigue often accompany serious illness and place people at risk for poor health and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaremka, L.M., Andridge, R.R., Fagundes, C.P., Alfano, C.M., Povoski, S.P., Lipari, A.M., Agnese, D.M., Arnold, M.W., Farrar, W.B., Yee, L.D.

===Physical health===
Chronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition. It has been found to be associated with an increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="pfizer"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loneliness and Isolation: Modern Health Risks|url = http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060128104835/http://www.thepfizerjournal.com/default.asp?a=article&amp;j=tpj15&amp;t=Loneliness%20and%20Isolation%3A%20Modern%20Health%20Risks|archivedate = 28 January 2006|journal = The Pfizer Journal|year = 2000|volume = IV|issue = 4|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loneliness shows an increased incidence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J. | last2 = Hawkley | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Loneliness Matters: A Theorectical and Empirical Review of Consequences and Mechanisms | url = | journal = Annals of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 218–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loneliness is shown to increase the concentration of [[cortisol]] levels in the body.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Prolonged, high cortisol levels can cause anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, sleep problems, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037|title=Chronic stress puts your health at risk|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

″Loneliness has been associated with impaired cellular immunity as reflected in lower [[Natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]] activity and higher antibody titers to the Epstein Barr Virus and human herpes viruses".&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Because of impaired cellular immunity, loneliness among young adults shows vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be less effective.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt; Data from studies on loneliness and HIV positive men suggests loneliness increases disease progression.&lt;ref name="Cacioppo, J 2010 p218-227"/&gt;

===Physiological mechanisms link to poor health===

There are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American ''[[Framingham Heart Study]]'' demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of [[Interleukin 6|Interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], a blood chemical linked to [[heart disease]]. A 2006 study conducted by the ''Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience'' at the [[University of Chicago]] found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by [[John Cacioppo]] from the [[University of Chicago]], is that doctors report providing better [[Health care|medical care]] to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs [[cognition]] and [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], alters [[DNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in [[White blood cell|immune cells]], and leads over time to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Science of Loneliness.com"/&gt; Lonelier people are more likely to show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people.&lt;ref name = "Ja_herpesvirus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.11.016 |title=Loneliness predicts pain, depression, and fatigue: Understanding the role of immune dysregulation |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Glaser |first3=Ronald |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Malarkey |first5=William B. |last6=Kiecolt-Glaser |first6=Janice K. |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1310–7 |pmid=23273678 |pmc=3633610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.&lt;ref name = "Ja_inflammation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797612464059 |title=Loneliness Promotes Inflammation During Acute Stress |year=2013 |last1=Jaremka |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Fagundes |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Peng |first3=Juan |last4=Bennett |first4=Jeanette M. |last5=Glaser |first5=Ronald |last6=Malarkey |first6=William B. |last7=Kiecolt-Glaser |first7=Janice K. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1089–97 |pmid=23630220 |pmc=3825089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When someone feels left out of a situation, they feel excluded and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease. When people feel excluded blood vessels at the periphery of the body may narrow, preserving core body heat. This class protective mechanism is known as vasoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ijzerman|first=Hans|title=Getting the cold shoulder|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/the-chill-of-loneliness.html|accessdate=1 November 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments and prevention==
There are many different ways used to treat loneliness, [[social isolation]], and [[clinical depression]]. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is [[therapy]]. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend [[group therapy]] as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |title=Psychotherapy |accessdate=29 March 2008 |work=Depression.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also frequently prescribe [[anti-depressants]] to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Truth About Antidepressants | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/truth-about-antidepressants?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative approaches to treating depression are suggested by many doctors. These treatments include [[exercise]], [[dieting]], [[hypnosis]], [[electro-shock therapy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[herbal remedies|herbs]], amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Alternative treatments for depression | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/alternative-therapies-depression?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paro robot.jpg|thumb|[[Paro (robot)|Paro]], a robot pet seal classified as a medical device by U.S. regulators]]
Another treatment for both loneliness and depression is [[pet]] therapy, or [[animal-assisted therapy]], as it is more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as [[anecdotal evidence]] provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered [[blood pressure]] and decreased levels of [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]].&lt;ref name="Pets"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health_benefits.htm Health Benefits of Pets] (from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]). Retrieved 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nostalgia]] has also been found to have a restorative effect, counteracting loneliness by increasing perceived social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02194.x |title=Counteracting Loneliness: On the Restorative Function of Nostalgia |year=2008 |last1=Zhou |first1=Xinyue |last2=Sedikides |first2=Constantine |last3=Wildschut |first3=Tim |last4=Gao |first4=Ding-Guo |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1023–9 |pmid=19000213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study found that the social aspect of [[religion]] had a significant negative association with loneliness among [[elderly]] people. The effect was more consistent than the effect of social relationships with family and friends, and the subjective concept of [[religiosity]] had no significant effect on loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/073346488900800109 |title=Religiosity and Loneliness Among the Elderly |year=1989 |last1=Johnson |first1=D. P. |last2=Mullins |first2=L. C. |journal=Journal of Applied Gerontology |volume=8 |pages=110–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the effectiveness of four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts). The results of the study indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness, possibly with the exception of social skill training. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1088868310377394 |title=A Meta-Analysis of Interventions to Reduce Loneliness |year=2010 |last1=Masi |first1=C.

'''Maquet''' is a French manufacturer of luxury stationery, leather goods, and art prints, established in Paris in 1841 by the Maquet brothers, Hector and Charles. One of the most renowned Parisian luxury houses, Maison Maquet became official purveyor to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] as well as to several royal courts, winning multiple awards and medals at various [[World's fair]]s over the course of its history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 1923|title=Le quartier de la Paix hier et aujourd'hui|journal=La Renaissance de l’Art Français et des Industries du Luxe|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Maison Maquet ==

=== Stationery manufacturer since 1841 ===
The Maquet brothers, Hector and Charles, established Maison Maquet in 1841. The eldest Maquet sibling was [[Auguste Maquet]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/espace-professionnels/professionnels/chercheurs/rech-rec-art-home/notice-artiste.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=37077&amp;retouroeuvre=%252Ffr%252Fcollections%252Fcatalogue-des-oeuvres%252Fnotice.html%253Fnnumid%253D64652|title=Photographie d'Auguste Maquet par Hector Maquet. Musée d'Orsay: Notice d'Artiste|website=musee-orsay.fr|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the novelist, playwright and famous ghost-writer of [[Alexandre Dumas]], for whom he co-wrote several masterpieces such as ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|Queen Margot]]'' and [[The Count of Monte Cristo|''The Count of'' ''Monte-Cristo'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire d'une collaboration: Alexandre Dumas et Auguste Maquet. Documents inédits, portraits et fac-similés|last=Simon|first=Gustave|publisher=Le Joyeux Roger|year=2012|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maquet company was created to commercialize the patent for the first machine-made [[envelope]]s, the use of which was still little known. This patent, the application for which was filed in 1841 and granted by the French Patent Office on 17 January 1842, described how to manufacture and use the "envelope-card-letter" (''enveloppe-carte-lettre'', in French), also called "a word in the Mail" (''un mot à la Poste'').&lt;ref&gt;Patent filed by Maquet on 16 August 1841 and granted on 17 January 1842, INPI, 1BA9546. Database of 19th-century French patents: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bases-brevets19e.inpi.fr/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the envelope was the culminating point of a variety of measures taken since the 17th century to preserve correspondence confidentiality.

In 1846, Hector and Charles Maquet separated their activities: Charles managed the envelopes factory, while Hector ran the boutique shop on [[Rue de la Paix, Paris|Rue de la Paix]]. In 1864, Hector Maquet registered as a trademark an elegant monogram mixing his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark no. 1984, filed by Hector Maquet at the Commerce Court of Paris, 1864, INPI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Maison Maquet changed address numbers several times but remained on [[Rue de la Paix, Paris|Rue de la Paix]] in Paris: the house was first located at No. 20 from 1841 to 1846, then at No. 24 from 1847 to 1867, and finally at No. 10 from 1868, where it remained for about a century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early 1970s, the house moved to 45 [[Rue Pierre Charron, Paris|Rue Pierre Charron]], where it kept a boutique shop until 1993. Though it did not have any commercial branch in the 19th century, Maquet eventually opened one in [[Nice]] at 16 Masséna Avenue (now Avenue de Verdun) in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/451697037618982326/|title=Maison Maquet (Paris-Nice)|website=Pinterest|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official Purveyor to Empress of France and to celebrity customers ===
Maison Maquet soon became one of the most fashionable personal stationery houses and enjoyed great fame during the [[Second French Empire|French Second Empire]]. It even obtained the warrant of "official purveyor to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Her Majesty the Empress]]". Empress Eugénie, wife of [[Napoleon III]] regularly visited the shop on Rue de la Paix, where she was served by Madame Maquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rapport du Comité d’Installation, Papeterie et Papetiers, Exposition Universelle Internationale de 1900|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maquet was also favored by French aristocratic elites, and its clients included the [[Pauline von Metternich|Princess Pauline von Metternich]], as well as the Rohan-Chabot and Costa de Beauregard families.&lt;ref&gt;Invoices for the wedding of their respective daughters, Countess of Rohan Chabot, February 1895, and Countess Costa de Beauregard, June 1895. Forney Library, 4-MS-FG-00122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Maquet's products were particularly trendy among foreign royal courts. Maquet notably supplied the Russian court, including the [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg|Great Duchess]] and the [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Great Duke Konstantin of Russia]]. In fact, the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported in 1875 that the "stationary was adorned with the Great Duke's [[coat of arms]], embellished with gold and colors enamel; of unparalleled richness and elegance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=21 October 1875|title=Petite Gazette|work=Le Figaro|page=3|language=fr|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k275744h/f3.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince Axel of Denmark was also a faithful client of Maquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drouotonline.com/vente-aux-encheres-drouot/4673/souvenirs-historiques?offset=0&amp;query=&amp;lotGroupTheme=|title=Collection du prince et de la princesse Axel de Danemark – Souvenirs historiques militaria|website=''drouotonline.com''|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, with the change of political regime and the onset of the [[French Third Republic|IIIrd Republic]], Maquet renewed its clientele and started to supply Republican institutions, including the Presidential Palace known as [[Élysée Palace|Palais de l’Elysée]], Paris City Hall – the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville de Paris]] – and French embassies, as well as financial institutions such as the [[Bank of France|French National Bank]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Commercial catalog of Maison Maquet, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prestigious customer was the [[Paris Opera]], for which Maquet printed several leaflets and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Théâtre national de l'opéra.

=== A new era for Maquet ===
In 1908, Maquet changed hands: it became the property of businessman and architect Léon Tissier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58270813|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=25 December 1907|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rejuvenated the company through multiple artistic collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'Art du parfum : Découverte et collection des flacons de parfum|last=Lefkowith|first=Christie Mayer|publisher=Celiv|year=|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissier, the son of a travel items manufacturer, also extended Maquet's range of leather goods products.&lt;ref&gt;"Un Lalique au Ministère de la Défense?" on ''www.memoiredeshommes.sga.defense.gouv.fr''&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on making his way into the world of printing, he invested in new buildings and printing machinery located rue de Langhouat in the [[Goutte d'Or|Goutte d’Or]] neighborhood in Paris, which he eventually yielded to the Établissements Gérault-Fouqueray in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5578233p|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=22 April 1936|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5578238r|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=24 April 1936|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Maison Maquet was acquired by stationery manufacturer and engraver Cassegrain, only to cease its operations in 1994.

Twenty years later, in 2014, Maquet was taken over by [[Luvanis]], a private investment company specializing in reviving sleeping beauty brands, which was notably behind the revival of trunk maker [[Moynat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/de-lummens-revival-model-5886947/|title=Arnaud de Lummen: Fashion’s Brand Reviver|last=Socha|first=Miles|date=2 May 2012|work=Women's Wear Daily|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of couture house [[Paul Poiret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/style/les-dessous-de-la-renaissance-de-la-griffe-paul-poiret-sur-les-podiums-paris-yiqing-yin-270218-147461|title=Les dessous de la renaissance de la griffe Paul Poiret sur les podiums parisiens|work=Madame Figaro|access-date=11 May 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Maison Maquet was long regarded as the finest luxury personal stationery in Paris.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At first, the house specialized in envelopes and luxury stationery, creating custom-made papers with coats of arms and monograms, heraldic paintings on parchment, business cards, wedding invitations, birth announcements, dinner invitations, and dance cards.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Commercial catalogs of Maison Maquet, non-dated and 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; It then extended its expertise to manufacture luxury leather goods, metalwork, and watches, before branching out to engraving and art printing.

Maquet advertized through witty commercial catalogs, theatre programs, and fashion magazines such as the luxury magazine ''Les Modes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O693530/trade-card-unknown/|title=Maquet {{!}} Trade card {{!}} V&amp;A Search the Collections|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/etrennes-objets-d-art-curiosites-fayences-montees#infos-principales|title=Maquet {{!}} Etrennes, objets d'art, curiosités, fayences montées {{!}} Paris Musées|website=parismuseescollections.paris.fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luxury stationery ===
Maison Maquet originally produced envelopes and various items of fine stationery. Its most famous in-house paper was known as the "empress paper" (''papier impératrice''), in an elegant shade of pearly grey between white and azure paper.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie de Fontanges, ''Les Succès du Jour'', May 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maquet also manufactured travel diaries and notebooks. The French author [[Prosper Mérimée]] notably wrote the short novel ''La Chambre Bleue'' in 1866,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Chambre_bleue_(M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e)|title=La Chambre bleue (Mérimée) – Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|language=fr|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], on a Maquet notebook bound with dark green Morocco leather, discreetly hand-tooled in gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogue de l’exposition organisée pour commémorer le 150e anniversaire de la naissance de Prosper Mérimée|last=|first=|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale|year=1953|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Maquet’s, one could find all manners of writing accessories, from inkpots to blotting paper, including notepads, pencils, dip pens, and even paper knives and letter openers made of chiselled silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Luxury leather goods ===
While still producing envelopes and stationery, Maison Maquet became a leading luxury leather goods manufacturer. In addition to her personal stationery, [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] also purchased her leather goods at Maquet.

Maquet's luxury leather goods department catered to a clientele of artists such as the French comedian Jane Sabrier, who matched one of her fashionable outfits with a Maquet bag in reindeer leather in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=15 November 1909|title=La mode actuelle au théâtre|journal=Comoedia Illustré|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Maquet proposed a wide range of leather goods, including handbags and travel bags, as well as vanity cases, wallets, cardholders and purses. Maquet also sold lawyers’ satchels (''serviettes d’avocats'') and garnished tourist blotters ("''buvards-touriste garnis''").&lt;ref&gt;Commercials for Maquet in ''L’Illustration'', on 5 November 1910, and 4 January 2 August and 3 November 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house developed a whole line of travel items. Inkpots, paper trays, as well as small leather goods, both sturdy and beautiful, were featured in the house's commercial catalogs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1938, Maquet was selected to contribute pieces to the trousseau of the two dolls gifted to [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] during the official visit of their parents, [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. The gift, intended to reinforce the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' between France and the United Kingdom, displayed French craftsmanship through a 360-piece trousseau in the tradition of Parisian haute couture. Maquet's contributions consisted in leather goods and accessories: two writing cases, one in blue, the other in red, each with its notepaper monogrammed to the dolls’ initials, and a miniature gold pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dolls for the Princesses: The Story of France and Marianne|last=Eaton|first=Faith|publisher=Royal Collection Enterprises|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/93234/writing-cases|title=Maquet [Paris]  - Writing cases|website=''royalcollection.org.uk''|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Hubert de Givenchy]]'s muse, shopped at Maquet's for her leather goods. She notably possessed five Maquet-branded wallets, all made of black leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/audrey-hepburn-personal-collection-part-iii/five-black-leather-wallets-55/56049|title=Maquet, Five Black Leather Wallets. Audrey Hepburn: The Personal Collection, Part III|last=Christies|website=''Christies.com''|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watches and silverware ===
Maquet added watchmaking to its activities, selling bracelet watches and clocks for [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaetons]] and automobiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Applying the same craftsmanship to tobacco articles, the house commercialized lighters, cigar and cigarette boxes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the early 20th century, it made many lighters from Chinese snuff boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.fr/claudefp/maison-maquet-paris-nice-briquets-%C3%A0-friction/|title=Maison Maquet (Paris-Nice): briquets à friction|website=Pinterest|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maquet became famous for combining old components into new objects in the [[Orientalism|orientalist fashion]] typical of [[decorative arts]] at the time.

Furthermore, Maquet boxes, renowned for their refinement, were used to store letters as much as jewels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Photographs ===
Hector Maquet notably shot the portrait of his brother [[Auguste Maquet|Auguste]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Soon he sold works of other photographers in the Paris boutique, including those of Polish photographer [[Bolesław Matuszewski|Boleslaw Matuszewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazaraki|first=Magdalena|date=1 December 2004|title=Boleslaw Matuszewski :photographe et opérateur de cinéma|url=https://journals.openedition.org/1895/301|journal=1895.

=== Engraving and art printing ===
In the early 20th century, Maison Maquet diversified into engraving, and art printing.

==== Artistic menus ====
Maquet thus made artistic menus for:

* The Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], such as the lunch offered to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on 25 April 1910;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bibliotheques-specialisees.paris.fr/ark:/73873/pf0000649974?highlight=Maquet&amp;posInPage=12&amp;bookmark=aa62aa06-ccda-4f9e-8e84-6685b670d0ba&amp;queryid=b6ccfbab-b3ff-4b81-b968-14b90435448c&amp;searchType=all|title=Municipalité de Paris.

* The [[Élysée Palace]], like the menu for the dinner offered to [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter I of Serbia]] on 16 November 1911, illustrated by [[Octave Denis Victor Guillonnet|Octave Denis Victor Guillonet]];&lt;ref&gt;Menu for the dinner offered to [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter I of Serbia]] on 16 November 1911, illustrated by [[Octave Denis Victor Guillonnet|Octave Denis Victor Guillonet]]. Private collection.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The French embassies, like the menu for the dinner offered for the reception in honor of [[George V|King George V]] by French President [[Raymond Poincaré]] at the French Embassy in London, on 25 June 1913, and illustrated by [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]];&lt;ref&gt;Menu for the dinner offered for the reception in honor of [[George V|King George V]] by French President [[Raymond Poincaré]] at the French Embassy in London, on 25 June 1913, and illustrated by [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]]. Private collection.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The opening of the French section at the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels World Fair in 1910]];
* The [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]], also known as "Transat" or "French Line", and, in particular, the menus for the France Liner.
* Drouant restaurant in Paris, which hosts both the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Prix Renaudot]] committee members’ monthly lunches since 1914 and 1926 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/restaurant-drouant-18-rue-gaillon-paris|title=Restaurant Drouant 18 rue Gaillon Paris {{!}} Les Arts décoratifs|website=collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr|language=fr|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Posters ====
Maison Maquet printed, among others, a poster for the third French National Defense Loan, which was conceived by [[Paul-Albert Besnard|Albert Besnard]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://recherche.archives.somme.fr/ark:/58483/a011353927000nPXrpu|title=Documents isolés – 3e emprunt de défense nationale.

Maquet created posters for [[Ocean liner]]s, including for the Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique  and for the [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]], commonly known as the "French Line.”

==== Bookplates ====
Maquet, with its experience in stationery, engraving, and printing, as well as its ties to literary men, quite naturally started to develop exclusive [[bookplate]]s. The Prince of Hohenlohe, who was the Chancellor of the German Empire from 1894 to 1900, had his bookplate engraved by Maquet, as did [[André Kostolany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.fr/itm/EX-LIBRIS-ANDRE-B-KOSTOLANY-1906-1999-GRAVE-PAR-MAQUET/352270162829?hash=item5204f01b8d:g:vtAAAOSwEeFVL7RK|title=Ex-libris André B. Kostolany (1906–1999), gravé par Maquet|website=eBay|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raoul Warocqué]] (who ordered no less than 10,000 ex-libris from Maquet),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=DM1HAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=maquet+ex+libris&amp;dq=maquet+ex+libris&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1suWpqNvaAhUNY1AKHTAXCYUQ6AEILDAB|title=La vie quotidienne de grands bourgeois au XIXe siècle: les Warocqué|last=Eynde|first=Maurice Van Den|date=1989|publisher=Musée Royal de Mariemont|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thyra Seillière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.edition-originale.com/en/literature/first-and-precious-books/bataille-la-vierge-folle-1910-20998|title=La vierge folle|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commercial catalogues, fans, and packaging ====
Maison Maquet developed tight commercial links to other Parisian luxury houses for which it created commercial catalogues. Specifically, Maquet devised the commercial catalogues of perfumers Rigaud,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; L.T. Piver,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalogue.gazette-drouot.com/html/g/recherche.jsp?numPage=1&amp;minEstim=&amp;query=maquet+piver&amp;maxEstim=&amp;npp=20&amp;filterDate=2&amp;_exact=&amp;email=&amp;Submit=OK|title=Divers objets créés par Maquet pour LT Piver, dont des éventails publicitaires, des emballages et boîtes|website=catalogue.gazette-drouot.com|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcampe.net/fr/collections/calendriers/grand-format-1921-40/carte-ancienne-parfumee-calendrier-1933-1934-maison-l-t-piver-parfumeur-paris-parfum-daventure-maquet-grav-554279867.html|title=Carte ancienne parfumée – Calendrier 1933 / 1934 – Maison L.T. PIVER parfumeur PARIS – Parfum d'Aventure – Maquet Grav.|website=Delcampe – La Marketplace des collectionneurs|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guerlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6495030b|title=[Notice sur l'histoire de la parfumerie Guerlain]|last=Guerlain|publisher=impr. de Maquet|location=Paris|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Maquet conceived ephemerals and various advertising materials for champagne houses such as [[Moët &amp; Chandon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/moet-chandon-epernay-maison-fondee-en-1743|title=Moët &amp; Chandon Epernay. Maison fondée en 1743 {{!}} Les Arts décoratifs|website=collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr|language=fr|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, it notably printed a commercial for [[Charles Heidsieck (Champagne)|Charles Heidsieck]].

The house conceived and printed many commercial fans, some of which are kept in the collections of the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/skinwebsearch?f%5B0%5D=field_skfulltext:maquet|title=Maquet {{!}} Les Arts décoratifs|website=collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Maquet printed many illustrations on advertising fans of [[Duvelleroy|Maison Duvelleroy]].

More importantly, Maison Maquet built fruitful partnerships with Paris haute couture houses, such as [[Paul Poiret]], for which it created heading paper,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Lepape, heading paper of Paul Poiret, printed by Maquet, 1910s, Palais Galliéra, GALK3054.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeanne Paquin]], for which it created a luxury commercial catalog for "Fans and fur at Paquin" in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coutaubegarie.com/html/fiche.jsp?id=2771326&amp;np=6&amp;lng=fr&amp;npp=20&amp;ordre=&amp;aff=1&amp;r|title=Lepape, Iribe, Barbier, L'éventail et la fourrure chez Paquin, Maquet|website=Couteau-Bégarie|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape,'' 1911 ====
Maquet printed the volume ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape'' in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/353154|title=Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose enduring success mirrors its great influence on the renewal of fashion illustration. Poiret collaborated with drawing artists, including [[Paul Iribe]] and Georges Lepape. This 1911 volume broke away from traditional fashion plates and gives both a graphic and a stylized representation of fashion.

==== The ''Modes et manières d’aujourd’hui'' magazine, 1912–1914 ====
Following the example set by ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape'' (1911), Maison Maquet began publishing an annual luxury magazine, ''Modes et manières d’aujourd’hui,'' each issue of which was beautifully illustrated by a different artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/162875|title=Modes et Manières d&amp;#39;Aujourd&amp;#39;hui {{!}} French {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue, out in 1912, relied once again on Georges Lepape who created 12 colored plates printed on Japanese paper. In 1913, the magazine commissioned Martin, and in 1914 [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]].

==== Artistic collaborations ====
Maison Maquet collaborated with drawing artists, lithographers, poster makers, and engravers,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; including:

* Guy Arnoux
* [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]]
* [[Paul-Albert Besnard|Albert Besnard]]
* [[Umberto Brunelleschi]]
* [[Octave Denis Victor Guillonnet]]
* [[Henri Lebasque]]
* Georges Lepape
* Valdo-Barbey
* [[Adolphe Willette]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7916">The "'''Mass Transit Incident'''" was an infamous event in [[professional wrestling]] that occurred at an [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) [[house show]] on November 23, 1996 at the Wonderland Ballroom in [[Revere, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Hardcore&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History|last=Williams|first=Scott|pages=106–111|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|date=2006|isbn=978-1-59670-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|last=Loverro|first=Thom|pages=175–180|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-1058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Headlocks&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last1=Assael|first1=Shaun|last2=Mooneyham|first2=Mike|pages=199–200|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-0-609-60690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved Erich Kulas (1979 – May 12, 2002), an aspiring professional wrestler using the ring name "Mass Transit", being [[blading (professional wrestling)|bladed]] too deeply by [[New Jack]] of [[The Gangstas]] during a tag-team match. Two of Kulas' arteries were severed; he bled profusely and passed out, and needed to be escorted out of the arena with medical attention. Further controversy arose when it came to light that Kulas had lied to ECW owner and booker [[Paul Heyman]] about his age and professional wrestling training. The incident led to a future ECW pay-per-view being temporarily cancelled and a lawsuit from Kulas' family.

==Incident==
[[File:New Jack.jpg|thumb|upright|New Jack]]
[[Axl Rotten]] had been scheduled to work a [[tag team]] match with [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] against [[The Gangstas]] ([[New Jack]] and [[Jamal Mustafa|Mustafa Saed]]),&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt; but could not make the show due to a family emergency.&lt;ref name="LaMotta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwmania.com/looking-at-the-mass-transit-incident-twenty-years-later|title=Looking At “The Mass Transit Incident” Twenty Years Later|last=LaMotta|first=Jim|date=27 November 2016|work=PW Mania|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erich Kulas, a wrestling fan who had just turned 17, told ECW owner and [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] [[Paul Heyman]] that he was 23 and convinced Heyman to allow him to fill in for Rotten by lying that he had been trained by [[Killer Kowalski]], a retired star wrestler who ran a notable wrestling school in the Boston area.&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt; Heyman stated afterward that he was unaware of Kulas' real age. Kulas performed as Mass Transit, a [[The Honeymooners#Ralph Kramden|Ralph Kramden]]-esque [[bus driver]] gimmick.&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt;

Before the match, Kulas asked New Jack to blade him since he never had done it himself, and New Jack agreed.&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt; During the match, Dudley and New Jack brawled outside the ring, while Saed and Transit fought inside the ring. The match was booked as a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] and Dudley was quickly isolated outside the ring. The Gangstas then double-teamed Kulas inside the ring, with New Jack pummeling him with [[crutch]]es, [[toaster]]s, and various other objects in the [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore style]] ECW was known for.&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt;&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt; At the end of the match, New Jack bladed Kulas with a surgical scalpel,&lt;ref name=HardcoreVideo&gt;{{cite video|date=2005|title=[[Hardcore Homecoming#Forever Hardcore|Forever Hardcore]]|medium=DVD|publisher=Big Vision Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the two had agreed, but cut too deeply and severed two arteries in Kulas' forehead. Kulas passed out as blood poured from his head.&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt;&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt;

The event was a house show and thus not televised; however, [[camcorder]] footage was available, which was eventually used as evidence in legal proceedings. The video showed New Jack quietly asking Kulas, after the blading, "You alright?" Next, The Gangstas proceeded to work Kulas over even more with elbow drops and various objects, prompting Kulas' father to scream, "Ring the fucking bell. He's 17!" As medics rushed into the ring to aid Kulas, New Jack grabbed the house microphone and shouted, "I don't care if the motherfucker dies!&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt; He's white. I don't like white people. I don't like people from [[Boston]]. I'm the wrong nigger to fuck with."&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt;

==Repercussions==

===Pay-per-view cancellation===
The incident led to the cancellation of ECW's first ever [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event, ''[[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]]'', by pay-per-view provider [[Request TV]]&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt; on [[Christmas Eve]], 1996. Heyman, by his own admission in ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', "begged and pleaded" with Request and finally convinced the company that they had been misled. The PPV event was placed back on the schedule on Sunday, April 13, 1997, at 9:00 PM.

===''Inside Edition'' interview===
Kulas and his family later did an interview with ''[[Inside Edition]]'' that featured footage from the incident, including New Jack cutting him and berating him after the match. The segment depicted Kulas as an innocent, unprepared victim while vilifying ECW, even going as far as showing that Heyman had not asked for any state identification. The story was completed before the Kulases launched their lawsuit, so key details of how Kulas actually got himself into the match had not been made public at that point.

===Lawsuit===
Three years after the incident, Jerome "New Jack" Young was tried on charges of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] with a dangerous weapon, and was later sued by the Kulas family. After hearing about Erich Kulas' request to New Jack to blade him, a jury [[acquittal|acquitted]] Young of all charges in the criminal trial,&lt;ref name=Headlocks/&gt; and he was later declared not liable in the [[civil court|civil]] trial. Performers who testified at Young's trial stated that Kulas was extremely arrogant and demanding backstage prior to the match and, when told that he would have to bleed as part of the match, Kulas had asked Young to blade him, since he had never done it. It was also testified that Kulas' father shouted "He's only 17!" and "Take it easy on him, he's just a kid!" when they isolated his son from D-Von Dudley during the match and double-teamed him.

The book ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' also states that as the medic crew carried Kulas out, he was escorted by [[Tommy Dreamer]], who held his hand to comfort him. Passing by the audience, Kulas began giving them [[finger (gesture)|the finger]] in an attempt to continue "playing [[Heel (professional wrestling)|the bad guy]]".&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt;

Authorities later determined that Kulas had lied to Heyman about his age and experience; Kulas claimed to be 23 years of age but he was actually 17 years old.&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt; He also claimed to have been trained by Killer Kowalski, and his father vouched for him, but Kulas was never trained to wrestle. In ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'', Paul Heyman states that Kulas' dubious credentials as a student of Killer Kowalski were endorsed by a then-known midget wrestler, who was with Kulas when he and his father approached the staff about getting Erich in the match.

==Later events==
Erich Kulas died on May 12, 2002 at the age of 22&lt;ref name=RiseAndFall/&gt; due to complications from [[gastric bypass surgery]].&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt;

'''Mentawai''' (also known as '''Mentawei''' and '''Mentawi''') people are the native people of the [[Mentawai Islands]], [[West Sumatra]] province, [[Indonesia]]. They live a [[semi-nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle in the coastal and rainforest environments of the islands. The Mentawai population is estimated to be about 64,000. The [[Mentawai language]] belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. The people are characterised by their heavy spirituality, body art and their tendency to [[Human tooth sharpening|sharpen their teeth]], a practice they feel makes one beautiful.

== Culture and lifestyle ==
[[File:Mentawai Uma.jpg|left|thumb|An Uma, the traditional communal house of the Mentawai]]

The Mentawai live in the traditional dwelling called the uma which is a [[longhouse]] and is made by weaving bamboo strips together to make walls and thatching the roofs with grass, the floor is raised on stilts and is made of wood planks.

The main clothing for men is a [[loin cloth]]. Mentawai adorn themselves with necklaces and flowers in their hair and ears. Women wear a cloth wound around the waist and small sleeveless vests. Mentawai sharpen their teeth with a chisel for aesthetic reasons. Tattooing is done with a needle and wood which is hammered on the needle by a shaman called ''sikerei''.

Tattooing on the island was an identity and a personal or communal reflection of the people's relationship to nature, called ''arat subulungan'', although there are motivational and design differences from region to region and among clans.&lt;ref name=ink/&gt;

During the pre-independence era, the cultural influence of foreign colonials and other islanders had systematically displaced or obliterated indigenous customs and religions. In postcolonial times, the Indonesian government continued this policy with a 1954 decree that prohibited indigenous religions, effectively abolishing tattooing and other customs.&lt;ref name=ink&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Rio|title=Planet Ink: The Art and Studios of the World's Top Tattoo Artists|year=2012|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-4229-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional knife of the Mentawai people is called [[Palitai]], while their traditional shield is called [[Kurabit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert G Van Zonneveld|title=Traditional Weapons of the Indonesian Archipelago|year=2002|publisher=Koninklyk Instituut Voor Taal Land|isbn=90-5450-004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men hunt wild pigs, deer and primates. Women and children gather wild yams and other wild food. Small animals are hunted by women. The Mentawai people keep pigs, dogs, monkeys and sometimes chickens as pets.

SurfAid is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the lives of Mentawain people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfaid.org/where |title=Where |publisher=SurfAid |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture''' ('''MOC''', {{Zh|c=文化部|p=Wénhùabù|poj=Bûn-hòa pō͘}}) is the ministry of the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) that promotes cultural and creative industries. The ministry also maintains the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626092727/http://nrch.cca.gov.tw/ccahome/index.jsp National Repository of Cultural Heritage].

==History==
[[File:Hui-tai Building 20160430.jpg|thumb|Council for Cultural Affairs building]]
Established in 1981 by [[Executive Yuan]], the ministry was initially called the '''Council for Cultural Affairs''' ('''CCA'''). The council was upgraded to ministerial level in May 2012 under the name '''Ministry of Culture'''.

The ministry was inaugurated on 21 May 2012, in a ceremony attended by President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], Premier [[Sean Chen (politician)|Sean Chen]] and several prominent artists, including poet [[Chou Meng-tieh]], film director [[Li Hsing]] and singer [[Lo Ta-yu]].

President Ma stated in a speech during the ceremony that if politics is a "fence", then culture is "the pair of wings that fly over the fence". He expressed hope that the MOC would spread "Chinese culture with Taiwanese characteristics" around Taiwan and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/05/22/2003533444 |title=New Ministry of Culture opened |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-30 |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5477">[[File:Moraingy fighting Madagascar sport.jpg|thumb|250px|Moraingy is a traditional martial art of Madagascar.]]
'''Moraingy''' (Malagasy) or '''Moringue''' (French) is a weaponless, bare-fisted striking style of traditional martial art that originated  during the Maroseranana dynasty (1675–1896) of the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] Kingdom of western coastal [[Madagascar]]. It has since become popularized throughout Madagascar, but particularly in coastal regions, and has spread to neighboring Indian Ocean islands including [[Réunion]], [[Mayotte]], [[Comoros]], [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]]. Participation in this form of combat was originally limited to young men, allowing elders to judge their physical fitness and strength while providing an opportunity for the youth to gain prestige and test their abilities.  Today, while the average age of participants is still between 10 and 35, young people of both genders may practice the sport. Participants are called ''kidabolahy'' (young men) or ''kidabo mpanao moraingy'' (young people who practice moraingy) and are widely respected and even feared by fellow villagers. In the North, they are called  ''Fagnorolahy'', and the assistants, ''magnafo''. Moraingy matches must by tradition be accompanied by music (often ''[[salegy]]'') to induce a trance-like state in the fighters and participants, contributing to the spiritual and communal experience of the fight. As part of this experience, participants typically engage in dances during and between the matches that are meant to provoke the supporters of the opposing party, while the crowd cheers and jeers loudly.&lt;ref name = Ratsimabazy&gt;Ratsimbazafy (2010), pp. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting style==
A typical moraingy competition consists of a series of matches pitting two fighters, typically from different villages, against one another. Prior to the fight, all the fighters parade around in the outdoor arena (typically a soccer field) to size up and select their potential adversaries, while the spectators who ring the field cheer, sing and attempt to provoke the fighters. The matches are announced and each clan sings its own chant in support of the fighter from its village. Each match lasts only one round and ends when one of the fighters exits the arena, faints, is no longer able to defend himself, is clearly unequal to the other, or is determined to be seriously injured. The judges of the match declare a victor and no contesting of the determination is permitted; both participants are cheered by the spectators for their efforts in the match.&lt;ref name = Ratsimabazy/&gt;

Moraingy is considered a half-distance or long-range fighting sport with punches predominating but with some kicks permitted. Types of punches include straight punches (''mitso''), hooks (''mandraoky''), downward slanting punches (''vangofary'') and a punch similar to an uppercut (''vangomioriky''). Defenses include guarding and sidesteps, but neither the attacks nor defenses are standardized, creating higher variability among individual fighters and between regions than in international boxing.&lt;ref name = Ratsimabazy/&gt;

Although moraingy is primarily concentrated in the coastal regions of Madagascar where it was historically popularized, Malagasy migrants took the sport with them when traveling overseas. In Reunion Island, a French territory 500 kilometers east of Madagascar, where a large number of Malagasy people were brought by the French to work as slave laborers on sugar plantations, the sport took root under the name ''moringue'', or ''batay kreol''.  Originally limited to the laborer's quarters of the sugar plantations, in 2005 it was recognized by the Reunion government as an official sport of the island. The popularization of the sport is in part due to a growing acknowledgement of the Malagasy and African origins of the island's Creole community.  The Reunionais form of moraingy is less violent and more inspired by the choreography and acrobatics of Brazilian ''[[capoeira]]'' than the original Malagasy form.  The use of jumps and stomping makes it spectacular. As in Madagascar, music is played throughout moringue matches, typically consisting of percussion or Reunionais ''maloya'' music. The government recognition of the sport was intended to foster a sense of pride and identity for the large Creole youth population of Reunion island. Moringue is now organized like other mainstream sports, with about 1000 licencees, and receives local media attention. The most celebrated Reunionais moringue athlete is Jean-Rene Dreinaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mandard | first =Stéphane  |title = A la Reunion, le moringue dans la peau | publisher = Le Monde | year = 13 April 2012 | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2012/04/13/a-la-reunion-le-moringue-dans-la-peau_1684671_3242.html| language = French | accessdate = 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mountain research''' or ''[[Mountain research#Denomination|montology]]'', traditionally also known as ''orology''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orology Merriam Webster&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' ὄρος for 'mountain' and ''logos'' λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the [[Earth's surface]]'s part covered by [[mountain]] [[landscape]]s.

==Mountain areas==
Different approaches have been developed to define ''mountainous'' areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 [[meter|m]] inside an area to define that zone as mountainous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1553/eco.mont-5-1s3 | volume=5 | title=Editorial | journal=eco.mont (Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research) | pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; others consider differences from 1000 m or more,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.293.aspx.pdf Mountain Systems. UNEP&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the areas' [[latitude]]. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding [[high plateau]]s (e.g. the Andean [[Altiplano]] or the [[Tibetan Plateau]]), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], which classifies municipalities as mountainous

* if at least 80% of their territory is situated above ≥ 600 m [[above sea level]], and/or 
* if they have an altitudinal difference of 600 m (or more) within their administrative boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/147760 Precisazione sulla classificazione dei comuni montani&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] has produced a map&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&amp;layers=0a5d90defc33466cbc3eb85a6564b6d6 UNEP-WCNC (2011): Mountains of the World – 2000.

Data&lt;/ref&gt; of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with

* elevations from 300 to 1000 m and local elevation range [[Greater-than sign|&gt;]] 300 m;
* elevations from 1000 to 1500 m and slope [[≥]] 5[[°]] or local elevation range &gt; 300 m;
* elevations from 1500 to 2500 m and slope ≥ 2°;
* elevations of 2500 m or more.

==Focus==

===Broader definition===
In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research ''in'' mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan [[Plant (botanical)|plants]], Andean [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], Alpine [[City|cities]], or Carpathian [[Ethnic group|people]]. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] (polar research) or [[coast]]s (coastal research).

===Narrower definition===
In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses ''on'' mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the [[Integrated geography|human-environment interaction]] in ([[Positive science|positive]]) and the [[sustainable development]] of ([[normative]]) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]]. Drawing on [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s work in the [[Andes|Andean realm]], [[Geography|mountain geography]] and [[Landscape ecology|ecology]] are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from [[anthropology]], [[geology]], [[economics]], [[history]] or [[spatial planning]]. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. [[Olav Slaymaker|Slaymaker]] summarizes:

{{Quotation|The science of montology [...] starts with recognition of the importance of verticality, a distinctive feature of mountain regions, which imposes vertical control of the production system; marginality, which results from low agricultural potential; centrality of mechanisms of power and violence; population growth and expansion; and religion and myth, expressed in mountains as sacred places. Montology emphasises restoration ecology to include re-vegetation, rehabilitation, reclamation and recovery of the lost landscape form and function [...]. Landscape ecological effects are arranged along altitudinal belts and form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of critical habitats for conservation and development. This approach has an underlying assumption of climax communities each fitting into a narrow altitudinal band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slaymaker | first1 = O | year = 2007 | title = The potential contribution of geomorphology to tropical mountain development: The case of the MANRECUR project | url = | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 87 | issue = 1–2| pages = 90–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.06.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denomination==
Mountain research or ''orology''—not to be confused with [[orography]]—, is sometimes denominated ''montology''. This term stems from Carl Troll's ''mountain geoecology''—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German ''[[Landscape ecology|Landschaftsökologie]]''—and appeared at a meeting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neustadtl | first1 = SJ | year = 1977 | title = Montology: the Ecology of Mountains | url = | journal = Technology Review | volume = 79 | issue = 8| pages = 64–66 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oed.com/public/update0212/december-2002-update&lt;/ref&gt; It defines montology as:

{{Quotation|The study of mountains; specifically the interdisciplinary study of the physical, chemical, geological, and biological aspects of mountain regions; (also) the study of the lifestyles and economic concerns of people living in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/montology&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the one hand, the term ''montology'' received criticism due to the mix of [[Latin language|Latin]] (''mōns'', [[Plural|pl.]] ''montēs'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''logos''). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as [[glaciology]] or [[sociology]].

The '''National Association for the Education of Young Children''' ('''NAEYC''') is a large [[nonprofit]] association in the [[United States]] representing [[early childhood education]] teachers, para-educators, center directors, trainers, college educators, families of young children, policy makers, and advocates.&lt;ref name="naeyc1"&gt;NAEYC. About NAEYC. Online July 2011. http://www.naeyc.org/content/about-naeyc&lt;/ref&gt; NAEYC is focused on improving the well-being of young children, with particular emphasis on the quality of educational and developmental services for children from birth through age 8.

==History==
[[File:NAEYC Building 001.JPG|thumb|left|The NAEYC building at 1313 L Street NW in Washington, D.C.]]
In the 1920s, concern over the varying quality of emerging nursery school programs in the United States inspired [[Patty Smith Hill]] to gather prominent figures in the field to decide how to best ensure the existence of high-quality programs.  Meeting in Washington, DC, the group negotiated the issue of a manual, called "Minimum Essentials for Nursery Education," that set out standards and methods of acceptable nursery schools.  Three years later, the group cemented the existence of a professional association of nursery school experts named the National Association for Nursery Education (NANE). NANE changed its name to NAEYC in 1964.

The association has existed for over 80 years.&lt;ref name="naeyc1"/&gt; Its holds two national early childhood conferences per year, the NAEYC Annual Conference &amp; Expo and the NAEYC National Institute for Early Childhood Professional Development.&lt;ref name="naeyc2"&gt;NAEYC. Conferences Overview. Online July 2011. http://www.naeyc.org/events&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The NAEYC Annual Conference &amp; Expo is the largest [[early childhood education]] conference in the world.&lt;ref name="naeyc2"/&gt; The association publishes periodicals, books, professional development materials, and resources, all of which relate to the education of young children. The association is also active in public policy work.  The association is well known for accrediting high-quality child care/preschool centers, and more than 10,000 centers, programs and schools have earned NAEYC [[School accreditation|Accreditation]].

==Accreditation==

NAEYC accredits early childhood programs according to health, safety and education standards it first launched in 1985 and reinvented and released in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;NAEYC. Accreditation.Online March 2009.http://www.naeyc.org/accreditation/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The new standards were intended to provide a more reliable and accountable accreditation system and to encourage the field of early childhood education to strive for a new level of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/academy/pursuing/fourstepoverview Academy for Early Childhood Program Accreditation - NAEYC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

NAEYC has a structure of state and local Affiliates that are semi-autonomous but that are required to contribute part of the membership dues to the national organization. The Office of Affiliate Relations provides direct services to NAEYC State Affiliates, Local Affiliate Chapters, and Affiliate Alliances to support them in their efforts to build capacity and become high-performing, inclusive organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/affiliates List of Affiliates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Programs==

NAEYC provides many different programs to assist professionals who work to educate young children. They are a leading publisher of educational resources, which include books, videos and posters that can assist in the teaching of young children. NAEYC also publishes two scholarly journals to help early childhood professionals and parents stay informed about the latest research on educating children age 0-8. These journals are ''Young Children'' and ''Early Childhood Research Quarterly.'' In 2007, NAEYC also developed ''Teaching Young Children'', a magazine written for preschool teachers.  The magazine provides useful, research-based ideas that teachers can use in their classrooms. Every year the NAEYC offers several conferences where participants can learn about and receive professional development in their field as well as focus on the improvements that have been made in the practices, policies and research.

NAEYC goes beyond publications, conferences and videos, and offers a program called “Supporting Teachers, Strengthening Families” that is designed to assist in the fight to prevent child abuse and promote healthy social and emotional development in young children.  This program works by teaching the educators how to better communicate with the families of their students.  Another important program sponsored by the NAEYC is the [http://www.naeyc.org/woyc “Week of the Young Child”].  This is a week-long promotion every spring that brings public awareness to the importance of early childhood development and education.

==Policy and Advocacy==

NAEYC encourages its supporters to be informed of current issues and legislation that affect the lives of young children. At the NAEYC Children's Champions Action Center,&lt;ref&gt;NAEYC Children's Champions Action Center. http://capwiz.com/naeyc/home/&lt;/ref&gt; individuals can find information about the federal legislative process, learn how to contact members of Congress, and see the daily agenda for the House and the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capwiz.com/naeyc/home/ |title=NAEYC Action Center |publisher=Capwiz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAEYC believes that our nation is at a crossroads. An integrated system of early childhood care and education that includes comprehensive approaches that directly involve families and communities in program design, implementation, and evaluation must be developed. NAEYC believes Americans can invest now in our children and families and enjoy long-term savings, with a more vibrant nation of healthy, achieving children and more stable families. Or, they can fail to make the investment and pay the price: increased delinquency, greater educational failures, lowered productivity, less economic competitiveness, and fewer adults prepared to be effective, loving parents to the next generation of children.

Federal, state and local government, communities, parents, and the private sector must share in the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of children and families.

In order to keep the programs going, NAEYC members must pay dues for funding of the programs they run. In September 2012, the NAEYC members at that time received a letter/e-mail regarding a due increase. This was the first time since 2000 that there was an increase in dues.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Jerlean1. "A Letter to NAEYC Members.." ''YC: Young Children'', vol. 67, no. 4, Sept. 2012, p. 90. EBSCO''host'', http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eue&amp;AN=85350257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals, Publications and Position Statements==

The following periodic publications are released and sponsored by NAEYC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/publications |title=Publications &amp;#124; National Association for the Education of Young Children |publisher=NAEYC |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Children'''

''Young Children'' is a peer reviewed journal published bi-monthly by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. In this journal, issues are organized around topical clusters that devote special attention to issues in the field of early childhood education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/yc/ |title=National Association for the Education of Young Children &amp;#124; NAEYC YC &amp;#124; Young Children Journal |publisher=Naeyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching Young Children'''

''Teaching Young Children'' is a magazine specifically designed for preschool teachers.  It highlights current thinking on best practices in early childhood education, innovations in the field, research and its implications, and interesting ideas for and from preschool teachers. The articles and other features reinforce the accreditation criteria for the NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards on Relationships and Teaching and encourage effective teaching in the preschool years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/tyc/ |title=National Association for the Education of Young Children &amp;#124; NAEYC TYC &amp;#124; Teaching Young Children Magazine |publisher=Naeyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Childhood Research Quarterly'''

''Early Childhood Research Quarterly'' is a research journal that is published four times a year, and contains current research in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/publications/ecrq |title=Early Childhood Research Quarterly &amp;#124; National Association for the Education of Young Children |publisher=NAEYC |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these periodicals, NAEYC produces formal position statements from time to time to "state the Association's position on issues related to early childhood education practice, policy, and/or professional development for which there are controversial or critical opinions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/positionstatements NAEYC Position Statements and Standards].

'''Caring for Children in Low-Income Families: A Substudy of the National Child Care Survey, 1990'''

''Caring for Children in Low-Income Families''  is a study that NAEYC conducted with The Urban Institute in 1990 on affordable child care facilities for low- income families. This book explores multiple different aspects of the lives of low-income children and day care. The study also examines aspects of the family lives. For example, whether a home has a single parent, two parents, unemployed parents, or other odd family situations and how that effects the children and their abilities to receive proper education. This was a very thorough and detailed study conducted by NAEYC and it helped them to better suit their own child care facilities to adapt to the needs of low-income families.&lt;ref&gt;Brayfield, April A., Sandra L. Hofferth, and Sharon G. Deich. "Caring for Children in Low-income Families." ''Google Books''. The Urban Institute, 1993.

==Films==
===Released films===
====''Nativity!'' (2009)====
{{Main|Nativity! (film)}}
Paul Maddens is a teacher who once had ambitions of being successful as an actor, producer or director. Every year St Bernadette's Primary School in [[Coventry]], where he teaches, competes with a local [[private school]] (Oakmoor) to see who can produce the best [[nativity play]]. Paul hates Christmas because his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lore, who attended drama school with him, left him at Christmas before he could propose to her.

Despite this, the St Bernadette's headteacher Mrs Bevans tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new class teaching assistant called Mr Poppy, who turns out to be as much of a child as the rest of Paul's class. As every year, it is one of Paul's other friends from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare, who runs the nativity plays at rival school Oakmoor.

Determined not to be seen as a failure by his old rival, Paul lies to Shakespeare about how a [[Hollywood]] producer, their old friend Jennifer, will be turning his production into a Hollywood film, though he hasn't even spoken to her in five years. Mr Poppy accidentally overhears this and is so excited that he has to spread the rumour. Soon, Paul finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get more and more excited, so Paul has to try to actually get Hollywood to turn their production to a film.

====''Danger in the Manger'' (2012)====
{{Main|Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger}}

Donald Peterson is an anxious teacher who has just moved to a new house with his pregnant wife Sarah. He accepts a teaching job at St. Bernadette's primary school, taking over the class formerly taught by Mr. Maddens, who by this point has left for the United States. In the interim, the enthusiastic and childlike [[Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)|teaching assistant]] Mr. Poppy has been teaching the class unaided.

The class wants to enter in a competition called "A Song for Christmas", in which each school produces a Christmas song, with the winning song earning its school £10,000 and the chance at being a Christmas #1. However, headteacher Mrs. Bevan refuses the class permission to enter without a qualified teacher, and worries that Mr. Poppy's behaviour is so inappropriate that no teacher will stay in the job.

When Mr. Poppy decides St Bernadette's should enter the National 'Song for Christmas' competition, he persuades Donald to sign the entry forms, later kidnapping him for an impromptu road trip to Gastell Llawen ("Merry Castle", not a real place) in Wales, where the competition is being held.

[[File:Map of new7wonders of nature.png|thumb|300 px|A map indicating the location of the 28 finalists (red dots) and the 42 other candidates currently on the reserve list (black dots).]]
'''New7Wonders of Nature''' (2007–2011) was an initiative started in 2007 to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen by people through a global poll. It was led by Swiss-born Canadian Bernard Weber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/about-n7w/the-founder|title=The project founder Bernard Weber - A Short History - World of New7Wonders|work=World of New7Wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://about.new7wonders.com/the-project-founder-bernard-weber-a-short-history/|title=The project founder|website=About New7Wonders|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/about-n7w/about-new7wonders|title=Learn about New7Wonders|work=World of New7Wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Swiss-based foundation which Weber founded. The initiative followed an earlier [[New7Wonders of the World]] campaign, and attracted 100 million votes from around the world before voting finished on November 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-nature/new7wonders-of-nature-voting-procedure|title=Voting procedure|work=World of New7Wonders|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331012028/http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-nature/new7wonders-of-nature-voting-procedure/|archivedate=2013-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of the campaign==
The New7Wonders of Nature campaign started in 2007, immediately after the campaign to elect the man-made New7Wonders of the World, in which more than 100 million votes were cast. From over 440 participants representing over 220 countries and through a national qualification and race to become one of the Top 77, as well as the recommendations of the Panel of Experts led by Prof. Federico Mayor, the list of 28 "Official Finalist Candidates" was determined. Voting until November 2011, during which time the New7Wonders World Tour planned to visit each of the finalists to allow them to present themselves to the voters across the globe.

==Criticisms==
Indonesia's Vice-Minister for Tourism said the company running the New7Wonders campaign used underhanded tactics, threatening to remove Indonesia's Komodo National Park from the list if Indonesia refused to host a declaration ceremony for $35m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2011/11/2011111165513200704.html|title=Controversy mars Seven Wonders of Nature list|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing in the New7Wonders voting procedure prohibited repetitive voting, making the results subject to government and tourism industry campaigns to vote often for local sites with the financial incentive of increased tourism.
Although New7Wonders is a non-profit organization that under US law has absolutely no disclosure of accounts, many activities related to administering voting and other logistical duties are run by the for-profit organization New Open World Corporation.

In South Korea, over the past four years, millions of Koreans and non-Koreans at home and abroad were encouraged by the central and Jeju provincial governments to make phone calls to vote and help the island win the designation. Employees of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province of South Korea made hundreds of millions of international phone calls to ensure Jeju island was selected as one of the New7Wonders of Nature in a worldwide poll. The payments estimated to be about 20 billion won ($17 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeju defers payment of phone bills for seven wonders |publisher=The Korea Times |date=December 14, 2011 |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/117_100815.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Len Deighton]]'s '''''Only When I Larf''''' is a late 1960s British comic thriller describing the activities of a team of three [[confidence trick]]sters led by Silas Lowther (late 40s), his girlfriend Liz Mason (late 20s) and wannabe apprentice and Liz-worshipper Bob (early 20s). It was published in 1968 by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] and in paperback by [[Sphere Books|Sphere]]. It is currently (2012) printed by Harper in the UK.

The novel interleaves [[first-person narrative]]s from Bob (76 pages in 7 chapters), Liz (78 pages in 6 chapters) and Silas (88 pages in 5 chapters). Their increasingly contradictory descriptions of shared experiences contribute to the humour. This [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]] adds to the atmosphere around deceiving "the marks", but the characters' different perspectives on their mutual relationship (interspersed with Silas's day-dreams of a dishonourable wartime incident) look more like self-deception and often add a poignant note. The title is explained in a variety of unlikely anecdotes where in each case a critically injured third party bravely replies this when asked "Does it hurt?"

==Adaptations==
A film adaptation of ''[[Only When I Larf (film)|Only When I Larf]]'', directed by [[Basil Dearden]],&lt;ref name=V&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1967/film/reviews/only-when-i-larf-1200421591/ |title=Only When I Larf |publisher=Variety |date=1967-12-31 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1968 starring [[Richard Attenborough]] as Silas, [[David Hemmings]] as Bob and [[Alexandra Stewart]] as Liz and has been well reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106764 Channel4.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Canby]].

The '''Oxford Symposium on Food &amp; Cookery''' is an annual weekend conference at which academics, food writers, cooks, and others with an interest in food and culture meet to discuss current issues in [[food studies]] and [[food history]].

==Overview==
The Symposium has taken place every year since 1983, with the proceedings published in an annual volume about a year later. Since 2006 the annual venue has been [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Eggs"&gt;''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 80 (2006) pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Symposium has been a Charitable Trust since January 2003. Influential in its field,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/12/cured-fermented-smoked-saberi-review P. D. Smith] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (12 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; the Oxford Symposium is the oldest such annual meeting in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Nurture-Proceedings-Oxford-Symposium-Cookery/dp/0953505723 2003 Proceedings at amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; though a series of scientific conferences on the anthropology and ethnology of food began in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[Alan Davidson], "Other Meetings and Conferences" in ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' no. 9 (October 1981) pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jill Norman.JPG|thumb|The publisher [[Jill Norman]], a participant since 1979]]
The Oxford Symposium is a registered charity in Britain, with a group of distinguished Trustees, and there is a support group called Friends of the Oxford Symposium.

== "Science and Cookery": the 1979 seminars ==
The origin of the Symposium is traced to a series of three historical seminars on science and cookery arranged in 1979 by the scholar and former diplomat [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] (who was Alistair Horne Research Fellow at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] for 1978/79) and sponsored by [[Theodore Zeldin]], historian of France and a fellow of St Antony's.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]], ''[[Out To Lunch (Levy)|Out To Lunch]]'' (London, 1986) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Zeldin had asked Davidson: "Tell me ... how do you propose to make manifest to the other members of the college your presence here?" The seminars were the answer.&lt;ref name="Wroe" /&gt; About twenty people attended on each occasion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;"An Oxford Symposium" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 6 (October 1980) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the first seminar, on 4 May 1979, was that of Davidson's fellowship, "Food and Cookery: the Impact of Science in the Kitchen". Academic disciplines represented ranged from the history of medicine to mathematics and French literature; [[Nicholas Kurti]], Professor Emeritus of Physics at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], was among them, and some of the 21 participants were not academics at all. [[Elizabeth David]] was among them, though she was reported to be "ambivalent at best" about the value of this academic approach to food.&lt;ref name="Wroe" /&gt; Also present were David's publisher [[Jill Norman]], [[Anne Willan]], [[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]] and [[Richard Olney (food writer)|Richard Olney]].

[[File:Accum - Culinary Chemistry (1821).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Friedrich Accum]]'s ''[[Culinary Chemistry]]'' (1821), subject of the seminar on 11 May 1979.]]
The second seminar, a week later, focused on 19th century research on food chemistry, notably [[Friedrich Accum]]'s ''[[Culinary Chemistry]]'' (1821) and the writings of [[Justus Liebig]]. The third meeting became a general discussion of cookery books in their historical context. On this occasion Elizabeth David enunciated the rule-of-thumb that it takes a generation (a minimum of 25 years) for a newly devised dish to pass from the kitchen to the written record. [[Claudia Roden]] joined the group on 11 May; by 18 May participants included [[Jane Grigson]], [[Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz]], [[Sri Owen]] and the Dutch food writers [[Berthe Meijer (food writer)|Berthe Meijer]] and [[Titia Bodon]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oxfordsymposium.org.uk/12-history/ History of the Oxford Symposium]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (London, 1986) pp. 30-32, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Cookery Books": the 1980 symposium ==
The next event in the series was a one-day meeting at St Antony's College in May 1980, chaired by Davidson and Zeldin. Participants, numbering nearly seventy, included many from overseas. The topic, the history of cookery books, had been prefigured in a brief article by Davidson, published in the first issue of the food history journal, ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'', in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], "Possible Future Bibliographies of Cookery Books" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 1 (1979) pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Kai Brodersen]], then at [[St John's College, Oxford]], on cookery writing in Europe before the era of the printed book, and Claudia Roden on Islamic cookery manuscripts. The event was "best described as a symposium, since one attractive feature of it was that everyone brought food they had prepared themselves".&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; Culinary contributions by [[Sonia Blech]] and [[Josephine Bacon]] were noted; Nicholas Kurti served ''Bombe Allotropique (Graphite-Diamant)'', a dish he had invented 25 years earlier at the annual [[Diamond Conference]] to celebrate the production of [[artificial diamond]]s at the [[General Electric Research Laboratory]] in [[Schenectady]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (London, 1986) pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings were not published in volume form, but one paper appeared in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 5 and three more in no. 6.&lt;ref&gt;Lynette Hunter, "Cookery Books: a cabinet of rare devices and conceits" in ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' no. 5 (May 1980) pp. 19-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudia Roden]], "Early Arab Cooking and Cookery Manuscripts"; Uta Schumacher-Voelker, "German Cookery Books, 1485-1800"; David Adlard, "The Role of Cookery Books in a Professional Kitchen", in ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' no. 6 (October 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raymond Sokolov - 1.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Raymond Sokolov|Ray Sokolov]] (foreground) at a plenary session]]

== "National and Regional Styles of Cookery": the 1981 symposium ==
The first full symposium, announced in October 1980,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; took place over two days in September 1981. There were nearly 150 participants, including 12 from the [[United States]] and seven from [[France]]: the latter included [[Jean-Louis Flandrin]] and {{ill|Françoise Sabban|fr}}. The majority were food writers, academics in [[food studies]], publishers and journalists; there were few chefs. Plenary sessions took place on the first day, and papers had been circulated in advance. Participants split into three groups for the sessions on the second day, which were then summarized by rapporteurs in a final plenary.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davidson, "Oxford Symposium 1981" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 9 (October 1981) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Kaneva-Johnson|Maria Johnson]], speaking on "North Balkan Food Past and Present", showed photographs of two models found in archaeological excavations in [[Bulgaria]] and claimed to be as much as 7,000 years old, one of a [[Masonry oven|bread oven]] and one of a loaf decorated with impressions of acorns.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Maria Kaneva-Johnson|Maria Johnson]], "The Eneolithic Bread Oven and Loaf of Bread" in ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' no. 9 (October 1981) pp. 49-51&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist [[Helen M. Leach]] spoke on "Cooking Without Pots" in prehistoric and traditional [[Polynesia]]n cuisine; [[Raymond Sokolov]], American cookery writer, discussed [[Southern cooking]], describing it as "the major surviving native cuisine in the USA" and defending the popularity of [[deep frying]], "an ideal method for the restaurateur". Speakers in Near Eastern cuisines included [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]], editor on the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who discussed "Three Medieval Arabic Cook Books". [[R. E. F. Smith]], professor of Russian at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], was one of two speakers on the history of [[Russian food]]. There was a session in which symposiasts attempted, but failed, to devise a test for distinguishing bogus from authentic regional styles of cookery,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]], ''[[Out To Lunch (Levy)|Out To Lunch]]'' (London, 1986) pp. 32-34&lt;/ref&gt; a question that was to be taken up again in the 2005 symposium, ''Authenticity in the Kitchen''.&lt;ref&gt;''Authenticity in the Kitchen'' ([[Richard Hosking]], ed.) Prospect Books, 2006. {{ISBN|1903018471}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1981 proceedings were published in volume form, the first occasion on which this was done.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Symposium, 1981: National &amp; Regional Styles of Cookery. Proceedings'' ([[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ed.) [[Prospect Books]], 1981. {{ISBN|0907325076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSFC 2010 4 Tilson.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Harold McGee]] tastes [[surstromming]] (Swedish fermented herring) during the 2010 symposium, ''[[Cured, Fermented and Smoked Foods]]''.]]

== Annual symposia of the 1980s ==
The 1983 symposium, described by one participant as "solemn but light-hearted",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (1986) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; had the catch-title ''Food In Motion''. The theme was the migration of foodstuffs and cookery techniques, including the most significant single such migration event in history, recently studied in [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s ''[[The Columbian Exchange]]'' (1972). Other major topics included the historical significance of the potato in Ireland, discussed by the social historian [[Jillian Strang]] and the food writer [[Joyce Toomre]]. There was a discussion by Raymond Sokolov and others of the origins of ''[[nouvelle cuisine]]'' (in and around 1972) and ''[[cuisine minceur]]'', the approach championed by [[Michel Guérard]]. Sokolov allocated the principal role in these innovations to [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Fernand Point]], Guérard's book ''[[La Cuisine gourmande]]'' and the work of the [[Troisgros family|Troisgros brothers]]; he pointed out the close relationship between [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese culinary tradition]] and ''nouvelle cuisine''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (1986) pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; At this 1983 symposium it was agreed that the event should repeat annually.

There is no published volume of proceedings corresponding to the 1984 symposium, which took as its theme "the ideal cookery book and recipe". Many contributions consisted of recipes "with comments upon their composition and their culinary possibilities", a form unsuited to reprinting in the usual volume format; some of the others were published elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Quotations from ''Cookery: Science, Lore &amp; Books'' ([[Tom Jaine]], ed.; London: Prospect Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0 907325 33 5}}) p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen remaining papers appeared in a two-year volume, alongside the 1985 symposium proceedings, under the section title "Cookery Books and the Transmission of Recipes".&lt;ref&gt;''Cookery: Science, Lore &amp; Books'' ([[Tom Jaine]], ed.; London: Prospect Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0 907325 33 5}}) pp. 2-72&lt;/ref&gt; The 1985 proceedings have the section title "Foodways, Science &amp; Lore in the Kitchen", though the original symposium title was "Science, Tradition and Superstition in the Kitchen". Organised by [[Tom Jaine]], restaurateur and restaurant critic, it was the largest symposium so far, with 150 delegates from Britain, many European countries, [[Australia]] and the United States. Among them it was possible to identify "six cooks/hoteliers, thirty-one journalists/writers, thirteen publishers/editors, nine historians, seven booksellers ... and twenty-three academics". The archaeologist [[Bruce Kraig]] traced the history of [[cynophagy]] in the prehistoric record and in anthropological reports. [[Aphrodisiacs]] were discussed by food writers and medical specialists, and at least one traditional aphrodisiac, Chinese [[three penis wine]], was available for tasting. Unusual foods at the regular bring-your-own lunch included ''[[gravad lax]]'' and chocolate-covered garlic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (1986) pp. 36-40&lt;/ref&gt; The keynote talk was "Science and the Study of Food" by [[Harold McGee]], whose ''[[On Food and Cooking|On Food and Cooking: the Science and Lore of the Kitchen]]'' had been published in 1984. Anthropologists [[Gerald Mars|Gerald]] and Valerie Mars offered a classification of food scholars and enthusiasts on the grid/group scales developed by [[Mary Douglas]]. Their title was "Classifying Cuisines: Epicures, Isolates, Messmates and Cultists".&lt;ref&gt;''Cookery: Science, Lore &amp; Books'' ([[Tom Jaine]], ed.; London: Prospect Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0 907325 33 5}}) pp. 73-187&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time the Oxford Symposium claimed imitators elsewhere in the world: there had been four recent conferences under the aegis of the [[American Institute of Wine &amp; Food]], while other series of symposia were under way in Australia, [[Turkey]] and New England (the latter hosted by the [[Culinary Historians of Boston]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, ''Out To Lunch'' (1986) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barbara Santich.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Barbara Santich]] at a Symposium session]]
Since 1986 the proceedings have been unvaryingly published in an annual volume (see "List of published symposia" below).&lt;ref&gt;Russell Harris, "[http://rdeh.tripod.com/sympcontents.html#Introduction Index to the Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1981-1998: Introduction]"&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 theme was ''The Cooking Medium'', and three data papers were circulated in advance: two by [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], "Edible Fats and Oils" and "Thickeners", and a multilingual survey by Jenny Macarthur, "Oils, Fats and Dairy Products: notes and lists of names". Many less-than-universal cooking media were discussed, including [[sheep's tail fat]] (by [[Jill Tilsley Benham]]), [[caul fat]] (by [[Jane Grigson]]) and [[almond milk]] (by the medieval scholar [[Constance B. Hieatt]]). [[Sami Zubaida]] of [[Birkbeck, London|Birkbeck College]] spoke on "Oils and Fats in the Middle East", while [[Barbara Santich]] gave a historical outline of medieval [[thickener]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cooking Medium'' (Tom Jaine, ed. Prospect Books, 1987) {{ISBN|090732536X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more unusual [[taste]]s explored in the 1987 symposium on ''Taste'' was [[pekmez]] (in a paper by [[Nevin Halici]]). [[Esther Balogh]] spoke on [[paprika]], Bruce Kraig on [[hot dog]]s and [[Joan Morgan (fruit specialist)|Joan Morgan]] on [[apple]]s, soon to be the subject of her definitive ''[[The Book of Apples]]'' (1993). Historical papers were given by [[Anna del Conte]] on 18th century [[Naples]] and [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]] on Near Eastern rotted condiments (including [[Murri (condiment)|Murri]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Taste'' (Tom Jaine, ed. Prospect Books, 1988. {{ISBN|0907325394}})&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Cooking Pot'' as the theme for 1988 was suggested by [[Patience Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford Symposium 1988" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 27 (October 1987) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; It was addressed by 25 speakers including, for the first time, [[Sophie D. Coe]], who spoke on "The Maya Chocolate Pot and Its Descendants". Others who addressed the symposium for the first time included [[Michael Abdalla]], a scholar of the modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the Near East (and an Assyrian himself), the anthropologist [[Jeremy MacClancy]], the medievalist [[Terence Scully]] and the Greek food writer [[Rena Salaman]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cooking Pot'' (Tom Jaine, ed. Prospect Books, 1989. {{ISBN|0907325394}})&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1989 symposium, which took the theme of ''Staple Foods'' and was for the first time organized by [[Harlan Walker]], plenary sessions were addressed by the archaeologist [[Keith Botsford]], the food historian [[Andrew Dalby]] and the nutritionist [[Erica F. Wheeler]], who asked: "Do Processed Societies Have Staple Foods?"&lt;ref&gt;''Staple Foods'' ([[Harlan Walker]], ed. Prospect Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0907325440}}) pp. 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symposia of the 1990s ==
From 1990 onwards conferences were held in September of each year. The theme for 1990 was ''Fasts and Feasts'',&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford Symposium 1990" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 33 (November 1989) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and plenary sessions were addressed by [[Astri Riddervold]], [[Bjorn Fjellheim]] and [[Marit Ekne Ruud]]. Historian [[Phyllis Pray Bober]] spoke on "The Black or Hell Banquet", a kind of ''jeu d'esprit'' arranged by the emperor [[Domitian]], by [[Grimod de La Reynière]] and others through history.&lt;ref&gt;''Feasting and Fasting'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Prospect Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0907325467}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Chenciner]] argued that the barbecue depicted on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] proved that the tapestry was not an 11th-century artefact: the argument rested on "not entirely firm grounds" according to [[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 48 (November 1994) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1991 symposium, on the theme of ''Public Eating'', the plenary paper, "Utility and Symbol in Public Eating", was given by [[Sami Zubaida]]. [[Richard Hosking]] spoke on "Pavement Food, Packed Meals and Picnics in Japan", [[Doreen Fernandez]] on "Balut to Barbecue: Philippine Street Food", [[Robert A. Leonard]] on "Food, Drink and Swahili Public Space", [[Barbara Ketcham Wheaton|Barbara Wheaton]] on "Expositions universelles" and [[Sharon Hudgins]] on "The Beer Taverns of Prague".&lt;ref&gt;''Public Eating'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Prospect Books, 1992. {{ISBN|0907325475}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published volume of the 1992 symposium is entitled ''Spicing Up the Palate''. Aromatics that were discussed included [[silphium]] ([[Alice Arndt]]), [[rosewater]] ([[Helen Saberi]]), [[chocolate]] (Sophie Coe and [[Alice Wooledge Salmon]]), [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]] (Rena Salaman and Nevin Halici) and [[annatto]] ([[Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz]]). [[Margaret Visser]] spoke on [[moretum]], likening it to "ancient Roman pesto", while Loret Lee discussed [[flavour water]] or ''lu sui'', a flavouring prominent in [[Chinese cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spicing Up the Palate: studies of flavourings, ancient and modern'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Prospect Books, 1993. {{ISBN|0907325505}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Look and Feel'' was the subject of the 1993 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;''Look &amp; Feel'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Prospect Books, 1994. {{ISBN|0907325564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 theme was ''Going Today: Gone Tomorrow? Endangered Foods and Dishes''.&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford Symposium 1994" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 45 (November 1993) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fat-tailed sheep]] recurred in Charles Perry's paper; [[June di Schino]] discussed and offered samples of the monastic confectionery of southern Italy, including (from the monastery of [[Santa Maria dell'Itria]] in [[Sciacca]], [[Sicily]]) honey cookies made in the shape of a woman with three breasts. Gastronomic events at the 1994 symposium included the most authentic Mexican meal yet seen in Britain, featuring [[huitlacoche]] and [[amaranth]] greens flown in from Mexico. This feast was organized by Bruce Kraig and prepared by Dudley Nieto. Plenary sessions were addressed by [[Jeremy Cherfas]] of the [[Henry Doubleday Research Association]] on "Vanishing Vegetable Varieties -- and How to Save Them" and by [[Camellia Panjabi]] of [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces|Taj Hotels]] on "The Non-Emergence of the Regional Foods of India", the [[Punjabification]] of Indian food and the universality of [[tandoori chicken]]. The Australian food journalist [[Cherry Ripe (writer)|Cherry Ripe]] had proposed the theme and gave the keynote address. Titled "Dying of Starvation in the Supermarket", her talk surveyed the problem of diminishing bio-diversity in domesticated animals and plants. As participants noted, "the continued existence of many breeds ... depends on their being eaten by man"; therefore "it could be (and was) argued that vegetarianism is immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levy, "Foodie Confab" in ''Wall Street Journal'' (September 1994); reprinted as "The Oxford Symposium 1994" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' no. 48 (November 1994) pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 symposium, on the theme of ''Cooks and Other People'', was the last to feature a Saturday do-it-yourself lunch to which symposiasts brought unusual foods from all over the world: organizers concluded this was "no longer possible with the present rules of hygiene". This lunch ended with two spectacular dessert, instant ice cream ([[Peter Barham]] poured [[liquid nitrogen]] into a bowl of [[crême anglaise]]) and [[sorbet]]: [[Robin Weir]] used [[Château d'Yquem]], the ''[[First Growth|premier cru supérieur]]'' [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]], as the basis for this costly delicacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cooks &amp; Other People'' (Totnes, 1996) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gillian Riley]] spoke on "[[Platina]], [[Maestro Martino of Como|Martino]] and Their Circle"; cooks under discussion ranged from [[Mithaecus]] to [[Dorothy Hartley]] and from [[Nikolaos Tselementes]] to [[Martha Stewart]], while "other people" who had influenced cuisine included [[Alexander the Great]], [[John Calvin]] and [[Gustaf Dalén|Nils Gustav Dalén]] (Nobel laureate and inventor of the [[AGA cooker|Aga]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Cooks &amp; Other People'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Totnes: Prospect Books, 1996. {{ISBN|0907325726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 theme was ''Food on the Move''. The title of Philip Iddison's paper was "Arabian Travellers' Observations on [[Arab cuisine|Bedouin Food]]"; [[Claudia Roden]]'s was "Food in the [[Cuisine of the Sephardic Jews|Sephardi]] diaspora". [[Helen M. Leach]] traced the history of the [[Pavlova (food)|pavlova]], [[Layinka Swinburne]] the use of [[ship's biscuit]] and [[portable soup]], and [[Colin Spencer]] the spread of the [[Allium scorodoprasum|rocambole]]. Chef [[Fritz Blank]] spoke on "[[Traveler's diarrhea|Travelers' Diarrhea]]: the Science of [[Montezuma's Revenge]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Food on the Move'' (Harlan Walker, ed.) Prospect Books, 1997. {{ISBN|0907325793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fish: Food from the Waters'' was the title of the 1997 symposium, and the papers fulfilled the promise not just of the catchword but also of the subtitle. Two American academics, both prolific food history authors, made early appearances: [[Ken Albala]] spoke on "Fish in Renaissance Dietary Theory", while  [[Andrew F. Smith]], traced the cultural links between [[garum]] and [[ketchup]]. [[Kathie Webber]] spoke on a [[South Africa]]n delicacy, [[Pondoland]] [[oyster]]s.Two food scientists contributed, [[Harold McGee]] with reference to [[snake mackerel]], [[orange roughy]] and their slippery [[lipid]]s, while [[Nicholas Kurti]] (one of the earliest symposiasts) discussed the freshwater [[carp]], catfish (''[[Silurus glanis]]'') and [[pike (disambiguation)|pike]] that were dietary staples in the [[Hungary]] of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=mPS0tH02IDUC ''Fish: Food from the Waters'']. Prospect Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; ''Food in the Arts'', the 1998 topic, was also interpreted widely. There was a generous survey by [[Joan Alcock]] of food in detective novels, with due attention to the gourmand [[Maigret]], while [[Barbara Haber]]'s topic was food in American film and [[Andrew Coe]] spoke on food in [[Santería]]. Among papers relevant to painting were [[Robert Irwin (author)|Robert Irwin]]'s "The Disgusting Dinners of [[Salvador Dali]]" and Gillian Riley's study of the [[still life]]s of [[Luis Egidio Meléndez|Luis Meléndez]].&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=H0iEWo-WJ40C ''Food in the Arts'']. Prospect Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 symposium was heralded by [[Nicholas Wroe]] in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'': "51 papers on the theme of Milk: Its Uses, Products and Substitutes, embracing history, health, chemistry and sociology will be delivered to an audience of 200 historians, scientists and writers as well as domestic and commercial cooks&lt;ref name="Wroe"&gt;[[Nicholas Wroe]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/sep/04/books.guardianreview3 Milking it with the creme de la creme]" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (4 September 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ove Fosså]] explored the true age of Norwegian [[gamalost]] cheese, and [[Carolin Young]] revisited [[Marie Antoinette]]'s dairy (''[[Château de Rambouillet|la Laiterie de la Reine]]'') at [[Rambouillet]]. The title of the published symposium volume was ''Milk: Beyond the Dairy''.&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=tuor2vcVtiQC ''Milk: Beyond the Dairy'']. Prospect Books, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symposia 2000-2005 ==
"Next year it's Food and Memory," wrote Nicholas Wroe in the article just cited. "Book early and don't forget your [[madeleine (cake)|madeleine]]s."&lt;ref name="Wroe" /&gt; Sure enough, among the speakers at the 2000 symposium, [[Rose Arnold]] took [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] as her subject and alluded to the same literary memory in her title, "Madeleines and Other Aides-Mémoire: the importance of food references in Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Recherche]]''". [[Andrew Dalby]] looked at the meals in [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[Lives of the Caesars]]'' and their sources in the collective memory. [[Geraldene Holt]] spoke on "Memories of [[M. F. K. Fisher]]". More uncomfortably, [[Andrew F. Smith]] spoke on "False Memories: the invention of culinary fakelore and food fallacies".&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=uRap8THh29gC ''Food and the Memory'']. Prospect Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Next year the symposium theme was ''The Meal'', for which [[Philip Iddison]] drew on his own experience with "Perpetual Picnics: the meal in the [[UAE]]" and [[Sami Zubaida]] also focused on the Islamic world with "Drink in the Structure of the Meal: Middle Eastern patterns". A joint paper by Chris Grocock and [[Sally Grainger]] looked at a Roman poetic lunch, "[[Moretum]]: a peasant lunch revisited".&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC ''The Meal'']. Prospect Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Fat was the subject for 2002. The title of the joint paper by [[Gerald Mars|Gerald]] and Valerie Mars, anthropologist and historian respectively, was "Fat in the Victorian Kitchen: a medium for cooking, control, deviance and crime." [[Regina Sexton]] spoke on butter in the diet of monks and penitents in medieval Ireland. Diana Farr Louis and Linda Makris both chose topics related to fat and fasting in [[Greece]]. The published volume, under the title ''The Fat of the Land'', would be the last edited by [[Harlan Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Harlan Walker, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ5qBQAAQBAJ ''The Fat of the Land'']. Footwork, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review by [[Ruth Fairchild]] in ''[[British Food Journal]]'' vol. 107 no. 3 (2005) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for 2003 was ''Nurture''. This was the last symposium attended by [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], who had founded the series of symposia in 1979. He had just been awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]], and this was celebrated at a Sunday lunch in his honour. The published volume was edited for the first time by [[Richard Hosking]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hosking]], "Introduction" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZpqBQAAQBAJ ''Nurture'']. Footwork, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; an academic who worked in Japan for many years, a specialist in Japanese food, and a regular symposiast. Until 2003 the symposia had continued to be hosted at St Antony's College. In 2004 they moved to [[Oxford Brookes University]]. The theme of the first symposium in this new location was ''Wild Food''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hosking, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=juAabiJpnn0C ''Wild Food''] Prospect Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
''Authenticity in the Kitchen'' was the subject for 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Wroe]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 A handsome feast]" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (10 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hosking, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=HflTVd898PAC ''Authenticity in the Kitchen''] Prospect Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penang Rummy''' or '''Si Rummy''' is a variant of the [[Rummy]] card game that was believed to have been invented in [[Penang]] in late 80s and became very popular in [[Malaysia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The word 'Si' in [[Penang Hokkien]] language mean 'dead'. It reflects the nature of the card game, where the hand is dead, with no drawing of new cards or exchanging of cards throughout the whole game. It is this feature that distinguish itself from other Rummy variants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Object==
The basic concept is the same as most [[Rummy]] games is to form melds, eliminating deadwood cards. "Deadwood" cards are those that do not form part of a meld. They are undesirable and counted towards players' points at the end of each game. The objective is have less points the opponents.

==The game==
Penang Rummy is played with 2 standard 52-card packs of playing cards plus 6 jokers as wildcards. A total of 110 cards is used. Sometimes 8 jokers are used instead of 6.

The ideal number of players is 4. Sometimes a game can commence with 3 players, in which case each player will receive more cards to begin with. A two-handed game is rarely played, and for five or more players an additional pack of cards is used.

===Dealing===
The first dealer is determined randomly. Subsequent dealers change from game to game. Two basic systems are used to determine the dealer. In a game where points are not recorded, the player with the highest points in the last game (the worst loser) will deal. He is deemed to "pay a small forfeit" by doing a service for all by taking up the task of dealing the cards.

In a game where points are recorded, the player who won the last game will deal. He is deemed to have benefited from the last game, especially when money is at stake, and hence should provide a service to all by doing the task of dealing as a gesture of appreciation.

The dealer starts the dealing with the player to his left. This goes on in a clockwise manner, until each player receives 20 cards. In a 3-player game, each player will receive 25 cards instead of 20. The remaining cards are put aside and play no further role in the game.

===Play===
The game starts with the player on the left of the dealer, and goes on in clockwise manner. On each turn, player must take at least 1 action of either [[#Melding|melding]] or [[#Laying off|laying off]]. He can of course decide to do both. A player, however, ''cannot'' skip his turn.

There is no upper limit in number of actions a player can take per turn. For example, a player may decide to make 2 melds, then lay off 1 card to an existing run and lay off 2 cards to an existing set, all in a single turn. In each game, a player must first do a meld, before he/she can do any lay-offs. The first meld in a game is called a "[[#Passport|passport]]".

Note that Penang Rummy or Si Rummy does not have the action of drawing a card or discarding unwanted cards. This is the distinctive feature of this Rummy variant.

===Melding===
If a player has 3 or more cards that meet the criteria of a "run" or a "set" below, he may meld by laying these cards, face up, in front of him. The melds are like typical Rummy games:

*"Runs" of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. For example, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;3♥-4♥-5♥-6♥&lt;/span&gt;. Aces can be played low as in A-2-3-4-5; or high as in 10-J-Q-K-A. However, the run is not continued after high Ace, i.e. J-Q-K-A-2-3 is not allowed. So the maximum length of a run is 14 cards (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A).
*"Sets" of 3 or more cards sharing the same rank. For example, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♥-8♥&lt;/span&gt;-8♣-8♠. Note that, unlikely many other Rummy rules, duplicate of suit is allowed in a same set. So, theoretically, a set can have a maximum of 14 cards (8 normal cards plus 6 wildcards).

===Laying off===
A player may also choose to "lay off" some cards on an existing meld. This means that if a player can add to a run or a set that is in front of them or any of the other players, they may do so.

For an existing meld of &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;3♥-4♥-5♥-6♥&lt;/span&gt;, another card of &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;2♥&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;7♥&lt;/span&gt; can be added, thereby continuing the run in either direction. For an existing meld of &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♥-8♥&lt;/span&gt;-8♣-8♠, another card of 8♠ or &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦&lt;/span&gt; can be added to the set. 

There is no limit in number of additional card a player can add to a run or set in a turn.

===Scoring===
All players sum up their points for the game just ended. The point system is as shown:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

* Joker - 20 points
* Ace - 15 points
* King, Queen, Jack - 10 points
* Number cards - Face value

Note that the lower the points is, the better it is for the player. The player with the lowest point is the winner, while the player with the highest point is the biggest loser. Points can also be optionally recorded, so that they can be summed up at the end of a gaming session to determine overall winner.

==Game rules==

===Wildcard substitution===
A player may substitute a [[Wild card (card games)|wildcard]] on table (in a run or set) with a card in his hand, provided the card fits. He can then keep the wildcard for future use.

Wildcard Substitution is not counted as an action. So a player must still take one other action of either melding or laying off, after he perform a wildcard substitution, if he has not done so for that turn. 

There is no limit how many wildcard a player can substitute in a turn.

===Passport===
At the beginning of each game, it is mandatory for a player to play a [[#Melding|meld]] before anything else. This first meld is called a "passport". Failing to do so result in an instant "[[#Declare Dead|Dead]]", and sitting out for the rest of that game round. There is no point requirement for passport meld, unlike other Rummy rules. A [[#Laying off|lay-off]] cannot be used as a passport. In addition, [[#Wildcard substitution|wildcard substitution]] cannot be carried before a player has a passport.

Failing to obtain a passport is a rare occurrence, given the large number of cards in hand, large number of wildcards, and relatively low requirement of a passport. Player considers oneself to be really unlucky if failing to obtain a passport.

===Declare Dead===
When a player can neither meld nor lay-off when it comes to his turn, he has to Declare "Dead". The game still goes on for the rest of the players, but he participates no further in the rest of that game. 

The effect is that the player can no longer reduce deadwoods in his hand, and therefore stuck with all the points in the dead hand. Even subsequently when there are new melds that the player could have been able to lay off more cards, he cannot do so because he is out of the game. So it is desirable to delay declaring "Dead" as much as possible. In other words, players try real hard to keep his hand alive.

It is not unusual to see player laying off 3-of-a-kind of Aces in his hand one-by-one, if there is already another existing set of Aces on the table. This helps to keep the hand alive for 3 more rounds. It is also a common strategy not to meld if one does not have to. Melding helps to keep other players alive, which is not desirable for oneself.

It is worth noting that the most tragic type of "Dead" declaration is failing to get a "[[#Passport|passport]]" right from the beginning. In other words, the player does not even get a chance to play in that game round.

===Declare Game===
When a player has gotten rid of all of their cards, he declare "Game" and wins the hand. This is the same as "Going Out" or "Knocking" in other Rummy variants. All other players start to total up the points of their deadwoods, which may include any wildcards. They ''cannot'' play on even though they still have melds or lay-offs that they ''can'' play in hand.

A player's attempt to keep his hand alive can backfire badly if another player suddenly declares "Game". The biggest satisfaction is to catch your opponent holding several wildcards (therefore high points) in his/her hand when one declares "Game".

Note that in Penang Rummy, it is not unusual to have no one declares "Game". Instead, many games end up with 4 players declaring "Dead". Therefore, the more realistic strategy is to minimise points in your hand when declaring "Dead".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8166">A '''periodic sentence ''' is a [[stylistic device]] employed at the sentence level, described as one that is not complete grammatically or semantically before the final clause or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Stephen Ciraolo|title=Pro Caelio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huar3SdjthAC&amp;pg=PA3|edition=2|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-461-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The periodic sentence emphasizes its main idea by placing it at the end, following all the [[subordinate clauses]] and other [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] that support the principal idea.&lt;ref name="Baldwin1909"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Charles Sears|title=Composition, Oral and Written|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3BLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=7 July 2011|year=1909|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|page=122}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence unfolds gradually, so that the thought contained in the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]/[[verb]] group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; Obviously artificial, it is used mostly in what in [[Eloquence|oratory]] is called the grand style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Harold C. Gotoff|title=Cicero's Caesarian speeches: a stylistic commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAokWH3m1aEC&amp;pg=PA279|year=1993|publisher=UNC Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4407-6|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opposite of the [[loose sentence]], also continuous or running style, where the subject and verb are introduced at the beginning of the sentence.&lt;ref name=harmon&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmon|first=William|title=A handbook to literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyrzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes&amp;dq=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes|edition=10|year=2006|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-134442-6|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic sentences often rely on [[hypotaxis]], whereas running sentences are typified by [[parataxis]].&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Ronald Carter (linguist)|last1=Carter|first1=Ronald|last2=McRae|first2=John|title=The Routledge history of literature in English: Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRR7nR8qOAMC&amp;pg=PA475|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-24317-9|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] is generally considered to be the master of the periodic sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chevalier|first=Tracy|title=Encyclopedia of the essay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJtz0iWO4O4C&amp;pg=PA179|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-30-5|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In English literature, the decline of the periodic sentence's popularity goes hand in hand with the development toward a less formal style, which some authors date to the beginning of the Romantic period, specifically the 1798 publication of the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', and the prevalence in twentieth-century literature of spoken language over written language.&lt;ref name=routledge/&gt; In American literature, scholars note the explicit rejection by [[Henry David Thoreau]] of the formal style of his time, of which the periodic sentence was characteristic; in his journal, Thoreau criticized those sentences as the "weak and flowing periods of the politician and scholar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillman|first=Richard H.|editor=Richard Fleming, Michael Payne|title=New interpretations of American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llypsBvOimUC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1988|publisher=Bucknell UP|isbn=978-0-8387-5127-5|page=93|chapter=Thoreau's Philosophy of Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical and literary usage==
According to [[William Harmon]], the periodic sentence is used "to arouse interest and curiosity, to hold an idea in suspense before its final revelation."&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; In the words of [[William Minto]], "the effect...is to keep the mind in a state of uniform or increasing tension until the ''dénouement''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minto|first=William|authorlink=William Minto|title=A manual of English prose literature: biographical and critical, designed mainly to show characteristics of style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=1895|publisher=Ginn|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''Handbook to Literature'', Harmon offers an early example in American literature found in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]’s "Snowflakes":&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;

:Out of the bosom of the Air,
:Out of the cloud-folds of her garment shaken,
:Over the woodlands brown and bare, 
:Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
:Silent and soft, and slow,
:Descends the snow.

When harm to self and others is summed, alcohol was the most harmful of all drugs considered, scoring 72%.]]

The '''short-term effects of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]''' (also known formally as '''[[ethanol]]''') consumption – due to drinking beer, wine, [[distilled spirits]] or other [[alcoholic beverages]] – range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and [[euphoria]] at lower doses to [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] (drunkenness), stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory "blackouts"), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. [[Cell membrane]]s are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body.

The concentration of alcohol in blood is measured via [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large role in determining the extent of [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Horowitz M, Maddox A, Bochner M, etal |title=Relationships between gastric emptying of solid and caloric liquid meals and alcohol absorption |journal=Am.

After [[binge drinking|excessive drinking]], stupor and unconsciousness both can occur. Extreme levels of consumption can cause [[alcohol poisoning]] and death; in fact, a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will [[median lethal dose|kill half of those affected]].&lt;ref name="Awareness"&gt;[http://www.radford.edu/~kcastleb/bac.html Alcohol Awareness Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BAC"&gt;[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/wellness/info/alcohol/bac/ Carleton College: Wellness Center: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914152127/http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/wellness/info/alcohol/bac/ |date=14 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by [[asphyxiation]] from vomiting.

Alcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During [[abstinence]], residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=Sleep maintenance and architecture are meaningless phrases to 99.9% of our readers, who are not doctors.}} are the greatest predictors of [[relapse]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feige B, Scaal S, Hornyak M, Gann H, Riemann D |title=Sleep electroencephalographic spectral power after withdrawal from alcohol in alcohol-dependent patients |journal=Alcohol.

==Effects by dosage==
Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on the subject.

The following lists the common effects of alcohol on the body, depending on the blood alcohol concentration (BAC).{{mcn|date=August 2017}} However, tolerance varies considerably between individuals, as does individual response to a given dosage; the effects of alcohol differ widely between people.  Hence, [[Blood alcohol concentration|BAC]] percentages are just estimates used for illustrative purposes.

===Grand Rapids Dip===
{{See also|Driving under the influence#Grand_Rapids_Dip}}

Studies suggest that a BAC of 0.01–0.04% would slightly lower the risk, referred to as the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' or ''Grand Rapids Dip'',&lt;ref name="grandrapids"&gt;[http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/t95/paper/s9p2.html Grand Rapids Effects Revisited: Accidents, Alcohol and Risk], H.-P. Krüger, J. Kazenwadel and M.

Some literature has attributed the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution at low BAC levels or due to "experience" in drinking.  Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol [[excitotoxicity]] and the effect of alcohol in [[essential tremor]] and other movement disorders,&lt;ref name="pmid20721919"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mostile G, Jankovic J | title = Alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2274–84 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20721919 | doi = 10.1002/mds.23240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this remains speculative.

===Moderate doses===
Ethanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the [[N-methyl-D-aspartate]] ([[NMDA]]) subtype of glutamate receptors. Stimulated areas include the [[cortex (neuroanatomy)|cortex]], [[hippocampus]], and [[nucleus accumbens]], which are all responsible for both [[thinking]] and pleasure seeking. Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, which is possibly caused by [[neurons]] transmitting electrical signals in an [[alpha waves]]-pattern; such waves are actually observed (with the aid of [[EEG]]s) whenever the body is relaxed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Short-term effects of alcohol include the risk of injuries, violence, and fetal damage.&lt;ref name="Andréasson-"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andréasson | first1 = S. | last2 = Allebeck | first2 = P. | title = [Alcohol as medication is no good. More risks than benefits according to a survey of current knowledge] | journal = Lakartidningen | volume = 102 | issue = 9 | pages = 632–7 | date = 28 February – 6 March 2005 | pmid = 15804034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol has also been linked with lowered inhibitions, although it is unclear as to what degree this is chemical or psychological as studies with [[placebo]]s can often duplicate the social effects of alcohol at either low or moderate doses. Some studies have suggested that intoxicated people have much greater control over their behavior than is generally recognized, though they have a reduced ability to evaluate the consequences of their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02198.x |vauthors=Grattan KE, Vogel-Sprott M |title=Maintaining intentional control of behavior under alcohol |journal=Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=192–7 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11236832 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0145-6008&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behavioral changes associated with drunkenness are, to some degree, contextual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant NK, Macdonald TK |title=Can alcohol lead to inhibition or disinhibition? Applying alcohol myopia to animal experimentation |journal=Alcohol Alcohol. |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=373–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15996970 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agh177 |url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/40/5/373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sirc.org/publik/drinking4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the brain that are responsible for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, which is caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is caused by increased [[metabolism]] in areas of the brain associated with movement, such as the [[dopaminergic pathways|nigrostriatal pathway]]. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.

Alcohol has been known to mitigate the production of [[antidiuretic hormone]], which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favor water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]], which relay [[osmotic pressure]] information to the [[posterior pituitary]], the site of [[antidiuretic hormone]] release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the [[antidiuretic hormone]]. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, therefore creating excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Excessive doses===
{{Unreferenced section |date=April 2017}}
[[Acute alcohol intoxication]] through excessive doses in general causes short- or long-term health effects. [[NMDA]] receptors become unresponsive, slowing areas of the brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain. GABA could also be responsible for causing the [[Anterograde amnesias|memory impairment]] that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with both the ''registration'' and the ''consolidation'' stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible.

[[Anterograde amnesia]], colloquially referred to as "[[Blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)|blacking out]]", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This is the loss of memory during and after an episode of drinking. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts failing usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but it can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers.

Another classic finding of alcohol intoxication is [[ataxia]], in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, as if each muscle were working independently from the others. Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning. Ataxia causes the observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down.  It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the [[cerebellum]].

===Mellanby effect===
The Mellanby effect is the phenomenon that the behavioral impairment due to alcohol is less, at the same BAC, when the BAC is decreasing than when it is increasing.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moskowitz |first=Herbert |title=The Mellanby Effect in Moderate and Heavy Drinkers |url=http://www.icadtsinternational.com/files/documents/1977_025.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, at a given point on the upward slope of BAC (while drinking), impairment is greater than at a given point on the downward slope (after drinking), even though the BAC is the same at the two points. This effect was confirmed in a 2017 meta-analysis of 26 studies.&lt;ref name="HollandFerner2017"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Holland |first=Michael G. |last2=Ferner |first2=Robin E. |date=2017-7 |title=A systematic review of the evidence for acute tolerance to alcohol - the "Mellanby effect" |journal=Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.) |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=545–556 |doi=10.1080/15563650.2017.1296576 |issn=1556-9519 |pmid=28277803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergic reaction-like symptoms==
{{main|Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions|Alcohol flush reaction}}

Humans metabolize [[ethanol]] primarily through NAD{{sup|+}}-dependent [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. [[ADH1A]], [[ADH1B]], and [[ADH1C]]) to [[acetaldehyde]] and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD{{smallsup|2}}-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ([[ALDH2]]) to acetic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proc Nutr Soc. 2004 Feb;63(1):49-63&lt;/ref&gt;  Eastern Asians reportedly have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations.  The issue has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese where persons with a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) variant [[allele]] of the ALDH2 gene were found; the variant allele, encodes [[lysine]] (lys) instead of [[glutamic acid]] (glu) at [[amino acid]] 487; this renders the enzyme essentially inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Science. 1972 Jan 28;175(4020):449–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allergy"&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1998 May;101(5):576-80&lt;/ref&gt; The variant allele is variously termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, and ALDH2*504lys. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are [[homozygous]] for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are [[heterozygous]] for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys.&lt;ref name="allergy"/&gt; Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a [[tetramer]] and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive (i.e. the variant allele behaves as a [[dominant negative]]), homozygote individuals for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmacol Rev. 2012 Jul;64(3):520-39. {{doi|10.1124/pr.111.005538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In consequence, Japanese individuals homozygous or, to only a slightly lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are susceptible to a set of adverse responses to the ingestion of, and sometimes even the fumes from, ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages; these responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] (i.e. the "oriental flushing syndrome" or [[Alcohol flush reaction]]), [[urticaria]], systemic [[dermatitis]], and [[alcohol-induced respiratory reactions]] (i.e. [[rhinitis]] and, primarily in patients with a history of [[asthma]], mild to moderately [[bronchoconstriction]] exacerbations of their asthmatic disease.&lt;ref name="Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2013"&gt;Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2013 Dec;111(6):439-45. {{doi|10.1016/j.anai.2013.09.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These allergic reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30–60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical [[IgE]]- or [[T cell]]-related [[allergen]]-induced reactions but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissues to release [[histamine]], the probable evoker of these symptoms.&lt;ref name="Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Feb 1;18(3):580–93. {{doi|10.1093/hmg/ddn372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous [[genotypes]] are about 35% in native [[Caboclo]] of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in [[Thai people]], 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos; percentages are essentially 0 in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos.&lt;ref&gt;Hum Genet. 1992 Jan;88(3):344-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Feb 1;18(3):580–93. {{doi|10.1093/hmg/ddn372&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in 0 or low levels of glu487lys genotypes commonly ranges above 5%.  These "ethanol reactors" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol-containing beverages.  For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol-induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about 16% in individuals homozygous for the "normal" ADH1B gene but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His SNP variant; [[in vitro]], this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and in humans, it is proposed, may form acetaldehyde at levels that exceed the capacity of ALDH2 to metabolize.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2010;153(1):86-94. {{doi|10.1159/000301583}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notwithstanding such considerations, experts suggest that the large proportion of alcoholic beverage-induced allergic-like symptoms in populations with a low incidence of the glu487lys genotype reflect true allergic reactions to the natural and/or contaminating allergens particularly those in wines and to a lesser extent beers.&lt;ref name="Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2013"/&gt;

==Sleep==
{{main|Alcohol use and sleep}}

===Moderate alcohol consumption and sleep disruptions===
Moderate alcohol consumption 30–60 minutes before sleep, although decreasing, disrupts sleep architecture. Rebound effects occur once the alcohol has been largely metabolized, causing late night disruptions in sleep maintenance.  Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06–0.08 percent and decrease 0.01–0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4–5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8-hour sleep episode. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate "rebounds" in [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also very quickly increase [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in [[glutamatergic]] activity by [[adenosine]] in the central nervous system. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.

===Alcohol consumption and sleep improvements===
Low doses of alcohol (one {{convert|360|ml|0|abbr=on}} [[beer]]) appear to increase total sleep time and reduce awakening during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol [[dissipate]] at moderate and higher doses of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(80)90427-7 |author=Stone BM |title=Sleep and low doses of alcohol |journal=Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=706–9 |date=June 1980 |pmid=6155259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous experience with alcohol also influences the extent to which alcohol positively or negatively affects sleep. Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schuckit MA |title=Low level of response to alcohol as a predictor of future alcoholism |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=184–9 |date=February 1994 |pmid=8296886 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8296886 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.2.184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[insomnia]]cs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roehrs T, Papineau K, Rosenthal L, Roth T |title=Ethanol as a hypnotic in insomniacs: self administration and effects on sleep and mood |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=279–86 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10063488 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(98)00068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol consumption and fatigue===
Conditions of fatigue correlate positively with increased alcohol consumption. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Alcohol abstinence and sleep disruptions===
Hormonal imbalance and sleep disruptions  following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are strong predictors of relapse. During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated [[melatonin]] secretion at onset of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep onset latencies. Psychiatry and core body temperatures during the sleep period contribute to poor sleep maintenance. The effect of alcohol consumption on the [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] control of human core body temperature is time dependent.

==Alcohol consumption and balance==
Alcohol can affect balance by altering the [[viscosity]] of the [[endolymph]] within the [[otolithic membrane]], the fluid inside the [[semicircular canal]]s inside the ear. The endolymph surrounds the [[ampullary cupula]] which contains [[hair cells]] within the semicircular canals.  When the head is tilted, the endolymph flows and moves the cupula. The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating the direction in which the head is tilted.  By changing the viscosity of the endolymph to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body.  This can also result in [[vertigo]], or "the spins."&lt;ref name="Why does my head spin when I'm drunk?"&gt;[http://scienceline.org/2011/02/why-does-my-head-spin-when-i%E2%80%99m-drunk/], Why does my head spin when I'm drunk?

At low or moderate doses, alcohol acts primarily as a positive [[allosteric]] modulator of [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Alcohol binds to several different subtypes of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, but not to others. The main subtypes responsible for the subjective effects of alcohol are the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;δ and α&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;δ subtypes, although other subtypes such as α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are also affected. Activation of these receptors causes most of the effects of alcohol such as relaxation and relief from anxiety, sedation, ataxia and increase in appetite and lowering of inhibitions that can cause a tendency toward violence in some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Huang Q, He X, Ma C, etal |title=Pharmacophore/receptor models for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/BzR subtypes (α1β3γ2, α5β3γ2, and α6β3γ2) via a comprehensive ligand-mapping approach |journal=J.

Alcohol has a powerful effect on glutamate as well.  Alcohol decreases glutamate's ability to bind with NMDA and acts as an antagonist of the [[NMDA receptor]], which plays a critical role in [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] by allowing [[Ca2+]] to enter the cell. These inhibitory effects are thought to be responsible for the "memory blanks" that can occur at levels as low as 0.03% blood level. In addition, reduced glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus has been linked to spatial memory loss. Chronic alcohol users experience an upregulation of NMDA receptors because the brain is attempting to reestablish [[homeostasis]].  When a chronic alcohol user stops drinking for more than 10 hours, [[apoptosis]] can occur due to [[excitotoxicity]].  The seizures experienced during alcohol abstinence are thought to be a result of this NMDA upregulation. Alteration of NMDA receptor numbers in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for some of the symptoms seen in [[delirium tremens]] during severe alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium and hallucinations. Other targets such as [[sodium channels]] can also be affected by high doses of alcohol, and alteration in the numbers of these channels in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for as well as other effects such as [[cardiac]] [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]. Other targets that are affected by alcohol include [[cannabinoid]], [[opioid]] and [[dopamine]] receptors, although it is unclear whether alcohol affects these directly or if they are affected by downstream consequences of the GABA/NMDA effects. People with a family history of alcoholism may exhibit genetic differences in the response of their NMDA glutamate receptors as well as the ratios of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subtypes in their brain.&lt;ref&gt;Shimizu, A.

Contrary to popular belief, research suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not [[neurotoxic]] in adults and actually prevents [[NMDA antagonist]]-induced neurotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Farber | first1 = N.

==Research==
Animal models using mammals and invertebrates have been informative in studying the effects of ethanol on not only [[pharmacokinetics]] of alcohol but also [[pharmacodynamics]], in particular in the nervous system. Ethanol-induced intoxication is not uncommon in the animal kingdom, as noted here:

{{quote|"Many of us have noticed that bees or yellow jackets cannot fly well after having drunk the juice of overripe fruits or berries; bears have been seen to stagger and fall down after eating fermented honey; and birds often crash or fly haphazardly while intoxicated on ethanol that occurs naturally as free-floating microorganisms convert vegetable carbohydrates to alcohol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=DeGrandpre, Richard J. |author2=Bickel, Warren K. |title=Drug Policy and Human Nature: Psychological Perspectives on the Prevention, Management, and Treatment of Illicit Drug Abuse |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-306-45241-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=et0TcXEENUgC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Drug+Policy+and+Human+Nature:+Psychological+Perspectives+On+The+Prevention,+Management,+and+Treatment+of+Illicit+Drug+Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More recently, studies using animal models have begun to elucidate the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, the Ulrike Heberlein group at [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]] has used ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as [[biogenic amine]]s in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/drunkbee.htm ''Latest Buzz in Research: Intoxicated Honey bees may clue Scientists into Drunken Human Behavior'', The Ohio State Research News, Research Communications, Columbus OH, 23 October 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901145751/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/drunkbee.htm |date=1 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abramson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2000.tb02078.x  |vauthors=Abramson CI, Stone SM, Ortez RA, etal |title=The development of an ethanol model using social insects I: behavior studies of the honey bee (''Apis mellifera L.'') |journal=Alcohol.

Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of [[alcohol addiction]].

In addition to the studies carried out in invertebrates, researchers have also used vertebrate animal models to study various effects of ethanol on behaviors.

==Traditional units==

Various units were used in [[Sri Lanka]] at different times and some only in certain regions. Some of these remained in use well into the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":ict4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pieris /&gt; The following is only a partial list.

===Length===

One covid was equal to 0.464 m (18.5&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=":wmm23" /&gt; The Bam̆ba (Fathom), still in use as of 2016, is the distance between a man's outstretched arms. It is roughly 6 feet in length. "Bam̆ba" is usually used to measure depth in wells and pits.&lt;ref name=":ict4" /&gt; Units used in measuring long distances included the "Gavuva", "Yoduna", and "Usaba" (plurals Gavu and Yodun - a Yoduna was 4 Gavu) and the "hoo kiyana dura", which was the audible distance of a shout of 'hoo' by a person.&lt;ref name=Pieris&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pieris|first1=Kamalika|title=Weights and measures in ancient and medieval Sri Lanka|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2010/05/10/fea25.asp|publisher=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Base of these system of measuring length was the human body.
* වියත ( Viyatha = Span )  Length of a spread hand
* රියන ( Riyana = Cubit )  Length from the elbow to middle finger
* බඹ  (Bamba = Fathom )  Length of two hands spreaded
[[Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa|King Nisshankamalla]] have established milestones called "Gaavutha Kanu" from a Gavu to another. Two of such have been found in Katugahagalge and Valigaththa in Southern Province.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The smallest unit was known as "Paramaanuwa", which was equal to 3.3066700127072e-11 m (1.30183858768e-9 in).  A typical [[Span (unit)|span]] was taken roughly equal to 22.86&amp;nbsp;cm (9&amp;nbsp;in). These small units of measurement were used in making of statues and buildings. Following are the relationships between the units used in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History Grade 10|last=|first=|work=Textbook|publisher=Education Publications Department - Sri Lanka|year=2015|isbn=|location=Tharanji Prints, 506, Highlevel Rd., Navinna, Maharagama.|pages=73, 74, 75|language=Sinhala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Area ===
Measurements of area used in ancient Sri Lanka was a system derived from [[Paddy field|paddy agriculture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Area was often measured in terms of the land that could be sown with a specific amount of seed or rice, including the Pǣla, Amuna, Kiriya (4 amunas), and the Riyana. In one region, a Kiriya was about 8 acres.&lt;ref name="Pieris" /&gt;  Following are relationships between some typical measures of area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Weight===

One [[candy (unit)|candy]], or one [[bahar (unit)|bahar]], was equal to 226.8&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref name=":ict4" /&gt; or 500&amp;nbsp;lbs,&lt;ref name=prinsep /&gt;{{rp|86}} or according to ''The Indian Trader's Guide'' 480 Dutch pounds or 520 pounds Avoirdupois.&lt;ref name=maccauly&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maccauly|first1=Thomas|title=The Indian Trader's complete Guide, being a correct account of coins, weights,measures &amp;c. &amp;c. at the different settlements of India and adjacent native sovereignties of Asia.|date=1818|location=Calcutta|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ENVAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;ots=bAopEr7F-O&amp;dq=ammonam&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=ammonam&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small weights could be measured in seeds, such as the Thala ([[Sesame]]), Amu, Vee ([[Rice]]) (3 Amu), Madati (8 Vee), Majadi, Maditi, Kalanda, and Manjadi.&lt;ref name="Pieris" /&gt; In ancient times, there have been an accurate system to measure weights.

===Capacity===

Different units were used for liquid and dry capacity.&lt;ref name=":wmm23" /&gt;

====Liquid====

One [[seer (unit)|seer]] was equal to 1.2 quarts and one parrah was equal to 6.75 gallons.&lt;ref name=":wmm23" /&gt; Another source suggests that a seer was equal to 1.86 imperial pints or 1.06 litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/seer.htm |title=Seer |accessdate=2 January 2015 |work=Sizes, grades, units, scales, calendars, chronologies}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly introduced in the period which coastal areas were governed by Portuguese and Dutch.

====Dry====
Units to measure dry capacities were mainly used in agriculture. Some of them are as following:

One ammonam was equal to 203.4 l.&lt;ref name=":ict4" /&gt; One parrah = 1/8 ammonam, one[[seer (unit)|seer]] = 1/288 ammonam and the chundoo was equal to nearly half a pint.&lt;ref name=":wmm23" /&gt;

Maccauly stated in 1818 that to the north of Colombo an ''Ammonam'' contained 16 ''Parahs'', and 2.5 ''Ammonams'' equalled one ''Acre'', but that to the south there were 8 ''Parahs'' to the ''Ammonam''. He describes the ''Parah'' as a measure  16.7 inches wide and 5.6 inches deep.&lt;ref name=maccauly /&gt;

{{Politics sidebar|Admin}}
'''Street-level bureaucracy''' is the subset of a  [[Public administration|public agency or government institution]] where the [[civil servant]]s work who have direct contact with members of the general public. Street-level civil servants carry out and/or enforce the actions required by a government's laws and [[public policy|public policies]], in areas ranging from safety and security to education and [[social service]]s. A few examples include [[police officer]]s, [[border guard]]s, [[social worker]]s and public school [[teacher]]s. These civil servants have direct contact with members of the general public, in contrast with civil servants who do [[policy analysis]] or [[economic]] analysis, who do not meet the public. Street-level bureaucrats act as liaisons between government policy-makers and citizens and these civil servants implement policy decisions made by senior officials in the public service and/or by elected officials.

Street-level bureaucrats interact and communicate with the general public, either in person (as with a police officer doing a [[random checkpoint]] to check for [[drunk driving]] or a civil servant in a department of transportation who helps people to register a newly purchased car and provide them with [[licence plate]]s); over the phone (as with a government [[call center]], where civil servants answer phone calls from people who are applying for or receiving [[unemployment insurance]]); or, in jurisdictions which have implemented [[electronic government]] technologies, via the [[Internet]] (e.g., a person finding out about the government's [[taxation law]]s by going onto the taxation department's official [[website]] and asking questions to a civil servant via [[email]]).

Street-level bureaucrats often have some degree of [[discretion]] on how they enforce the rules, laws and policies which they are assigned to uphold. For example, a police officer who catches a speeding motorist typically can decide whether to give the driver a warning or apply a penalty such as a fine or criminal charge; a [[border guard]] who finds undeclared rum in a border-crossing motorist's car trunk can either give the person a warning, confiscate and destroy the [[contraband]] item, or levy a fine or other penalty; a government social worker who meets with an unemployed person can decide whether or not to provide [[social assistance]] or unemployment insurance benefits; and a high school [[Principal (education)|principal]] who finds that a student is [[truancy|skipping school]] can decide whether or not to suspend the person, taking into account the student's unique circumstances and situation. Even though front-line bureaucrats have this degree of discretion, they typically must operate within the [[rule of law]], the system of government [[regulation]]s, [[law]]s and [[administrative law|administrative procedural rules]]. These regulations, laws and rules help to ensure that the street-level bureaucracy operates fairly and ethically, and that each citizen is treated fairly.

== History ==
The concept of street-level bureaucracy was first coined by [[Michael Lipsky]] in 1969(&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1969"&gt;Lipsky, Michael (1969). Toward a Theory of Street-Level Bureaucracy (IRP Discussion Papers No. 48-69) (p. 45). Madison, WI: Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP), University of Wisconsin. Retrieved from http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp4869.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), who argued that "policy implementation in the end comes down to the people [(the street-level bureaucrats)] who actually implement it". However, the process of street-level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period. A "government will be better accepted if its administrators [e.g., bureaucrats] reflect the origins [and needs] of its people", &lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Scott A.; Klay, William Earle. "George Washington's Precedents: The Institutional Legacy of the American Republic's Founding Public Administrator". ''Administration &amp; Society'' 2015: 75-91. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; an ideal which embodies the goals of an effective street-level bureaucracy in America. Some of the first street-level bureaucrats in the US were [[post office]] officials and administrators. The presidency of [[Woodrow Wilson]] helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy-making, which in turn led to larger-sized and better-funded street-level bureaucracies. However it was not until the 1950s with the [[baby boom]] that street level bureaucracy became as strong as a presence in society as it is in the 2000s.

Lipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the "human face" of policy, since these individuals interact directly with citizens.&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1980"&gt;Lipsky, Michael. Street-level Bureaucracy: Dilemmas of the Individual in Public Services. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of street-level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and  the scope of government in America, with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more public servants (e.g., Chicago which employs 26,680 teachers).(&lt;ref name="Lipsky, Michael 1980"/&gt;) Due to street-level bureaucrats' close interactions with citizens, day-to-day application of discretion in their assessment of people's cases and issues, and their role as policy interpreters, Lipsky claims that "in a sense the street-level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the [[Constitution|constitutional]] relationship of citizens to the state. In short, they hold the keys to a dimension of [[citizenship]]."(&lt;ref&gt;Lipksy, Michael. Street-level Bureaucracy. N.p.: n.p., 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) The interpretation of the duties, scope, and responsibilities of street-level bureaucrats are still debated in the 2000s, with ongoing discussion on the roles of discretion, accountability, lack of resources, and technology and concerns raised about the risks of corruption.

== Demand and need ==
Where there is population growth, there is usually growth in demand for these occupations, because there are more citizens who need public services. The demand for these occupations will vary by region but generally, the job outlook in these careers is on the rise in many countries and/or regions where there is an increase in population.

=== Education ===
In the United States' education sector there is a strong demand for teachers in numerous regions across the country. There are currently fifty-one "hot spots" with a demand for educators in these regions. Amongst these fifty-one hot spots, five of the regions are with an incredible need for educators in both the primary and secondary education sector. The areas of desperate need include: Las Vegas, Nevada; the Northern region of Oklahoma; Kansas City, Missouri; the Central region of Arkansas; and the Western region of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Maria|title=Where We Work|url=https://www.teachforamerica.org/where-we-work|website=Teach For America|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Police  ===
The demand for police officers is another occupation that will experience growth over the next ten years. Because urbanized and metropolitan regions are amongst the fastest growing in the United States, that is generally where the demand for these individuals will be.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Police and Detectives|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/police-and-detectives.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firefighters ===
Firefighters are another case in protective services where an increase in demand is expected over the next decade. A seven percent increase in career outlook is to be expected by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Firefighters|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/firefighters.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics|accessdate=8 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social workers ===
The demand for [[social worker]]s has an average growth rate in the United States. With a general population increase social workers are needed in all areas of the career field. The demand for social workers is extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child and Family Social Worker|url=http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/child-and-family-social-worker|accessdate=2015|agency=U.S. News &amp; World Report L.P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national average for growth in all careers stands at eleven percent, while a projected nineteen percent increase in social work is needed to fulfill the sectors responsibility to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook: Social Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-6|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=8 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==

=== Corruption and accountability ===
Corruption in street-level bureaucracy is a violation of the ethical codes of conduct, laws and regulations that have been established by the government and its agencies. An example of corruption would be cases where a [[police officer]] or [[border guard]] accepted a [[bribe]] from a member of the public in return for not enforcing a law or regulation. There are many agencies which define and interpret what is acceptable ethical behavior and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf|url = http://www.oge.gov/uploadedfiles/education/education_resources_for_ethics_officials/resources/code_of_ethics_poster.pdf|website = www.oge.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of these rules or ethical codes of conduct by street-level bureaucrats has repercussions that effect not only the person or agency involved, but also the general public that these street-level bureaucracies serve. Neutrality and impartiality in following policies and procedures is what is expected and most remain separate from person feelings or views.  Here is a link to a social work case that let personal feelings override there ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/EoENovDec08.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deception in Social Work|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/EoENovDec08.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-05-06|first = Great|last = Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example for corruption in street-level bureaucracy are black market payments for doctors and nurses, as part of the shadow economy. The term "black market medicine" refers to a variety of illegal actions that individuals take in order to obtain healthcare services for themselves. Such actions include direct payments to doctors in government hospitals to improve one's position on the waiting list (especially for surgeries) or payments to doctors so they will treat the patient personally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nissim|date=2016|title=How Culture Affects Street-Level Bureaucrats’ Bending the Rules in the Context of Informal Payments for Health Care: The Israeli Case|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074016665919|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|volume=48|pages=175-187|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accountability]] is the means by which these codes are upheld and to ensure moral and ethical practices within these bureaucratic agencies. There is much debate over the methodology of how exactly these agencies should be held accountable. Accountability is divided into five categories: transparency, liability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pathologies of Accountability: ICANN and the Challenge of "Multiple Accountabilities Disorder" - Koppell - 2005 - Public Administration Review - Wiley Online Library|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x|journal = Public Administration Review|access-date = 2015-05-06|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x|volume=65|pages=94–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major accountability processes are compliance based and performance based. "Traditionally, accountability has involved defining rules and procedures and then employing various means to ensure compliance with these expectations"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = THE ACCOUNTABILITY PARADOX IN AN AGE OF REINVENTION: The perennial problem of preserving character and judgment|last = Jos|first = P.H.|date = 2004|journal = Administration &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0095399704263479|pmid = |last2 = Tompkins|first2 = M.E.|issue = 3|volume = 36|pages = 255–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance-based practices rely on standardized processes that measure performance in terms of output and results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Yet compliance based, and performance based accountability has limitations for measuring the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and economy of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, accountability stems from a multidimensional perspective, which includes the general public the bureaucracy serves, peers and co-workers, office managers, public administrators, and elected officials.

=== Discretion ===

[[Discretion]] can be defined as a component in the decision making process that determines an individual's action or non-action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Is There A Need for Control?|last = Carrington|first = Keith|date = 2005|journal = Public Administration Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 29|pages = 140–161|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrington divides discretion into two major components as the freedom the decision maker has to choose between different actions; and the decision to act or not act through the rules and judgment of the decision maker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Michael Lipsky states street level bureaucrats have discretion because human judgment is in the nature of service work that machines could not replace.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Street-Level Bureaucracy|last = Lipsky|first = Michael|publisher = Russell Sage Foundation|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Street level bureaucrats are responsible for making appropriate decisions that are appropriate for clients and their situations. Lipsky states all street level bureaucrats will confront situations in which they need to depart from service ideals in order to cope with both expectations from their jobs and the public ideals. 

According to Lipsky, the exercise of discretion among street level bureaucrats is critical in how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts of discretion once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lipsky said the use of discretion by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as a major reason for the opposition of discretion in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marissa Kelly also examines the use of discretion among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Theories of Justice and Street-Level Discretion|last = Kelly|first = Marisa|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory: J-PART|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 4|issue = 2|pages = 119–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of resources ===

Lipsky concludes that the lack of resources causes street level bureaucrat to develop simplified routines for processing cases that influence their everyday tasks. These routines for decisionmaking affect public policy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He states that street level bureaucrats are taught implementation skills instead of learning about how to find more resources, knowledge and information that would help them to implement policies more effectively.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Understanding Implementation: Street-Level Bureaucrats' Resources for Reform|last = Hill|first = Heather|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Public Administration|doi = 10.1093/jpart/mug024|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 265–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill identifies several implementation resources street level bureaucrats often lack such as; research resources, appropriate resources on how to shape specific policies for their specific situation, and access to expertise and skills training to better their decision-making and awareness in specific challenging situations that arise at the street level.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another key resource that front-line bureaucrats often lack is time to fully assess individual cases. In social services, social workers often have such a large caseload that they can only see social assistance recipients or applicants for a very short time each week. As a result, social workers have to make very rapid decisions as to whether to approve or deny welfare benefits.

== Role of technology==
[[File:RIAN archive 440889 Mamonovo-Avtodorozhnoye border-control checkpoint on the Russian-Polish border in the Kaliningrad Region.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A border guard checks a computer display when a citizen comes to the service window.]]
Technological advances such as the widespread availability of the Internet and online databases have had a major impact on street-level bureaucracy and the front-line civil servants who provide services to citizens. There are two major theories on how technology has impacted this sector: curtailment theory and enablement theory. Curtailment theory holds that increasing technological advances hinder street-level bureaucrats and their ability to perform effectively; especially concerning their ability to exercise discretion on complex cases. Enablement theory holds that increasing technological advances, at best, empower the existing abilities of the street-level bureaucrat and better inform the citizen. At worst, the effects of technology are ambiguous.

=== Curtailment theory ===

It was first argued by Snellen that increasing  technological advances (ITA) "deeply challeng[e] [the street-level bureaucrat's] ability to manipulate information."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Snellen|first1 = I|title = Electronic Governance: Implications for Citizens, Politicians and Public Servants|journal = International Review of Administrative Sciences|date = 2002|volume = 68|issue = 2|pages = 183–198|doi=10.1177/0020852302682002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snellen believed it was the ability to manipulate information that gave the SLB's their power. He further argued that as more decisions are made by computers or software, SLB's will lose their discretionary powers and they will shift to other actors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Buffat|first1 = Aurelien|title = Street-Level Bureaucracy and E-Government|journal = Public Management Review|date = 2013|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 149–161|doi=10.1080/14719037.2013.771699}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 2010, some government organizations use online application forms for programs in which the computer program, rather than a human front-line bureaucrat, will reject applications which are incomplete. In a pre-technological advances era, a front-line bureaucrat might have used his or her discretion over decisions to allow an application in which some of the information requests are not completed (e.g., due to urgent need on the part of the citizen or the existence of an emergency situation). For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, if a social worker received a hand-written, pen-and-paper application from a [[homeless]] person for [[social assistance]], the bureaucrat might approve the application even if the applicant did not have a street address or the required identification documents, to ensure that the applicant remained housed and safe.
 
However, there are four problems with this thesis. First, it is implied, but never proven, that with the arrival of more technology, discretion at the frontline will diminish or become non-existent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Second, Snellen's definition of the SLB's source of power is too narrow and does not take into account other sources of discretion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Third, this thesis only pertains to particular public organizations and does not apply to more common types of street-level bureaucracies such as police departments, schools, or social welfare departments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lastly, this theory does not take into account how SLB's and other caseworkers actually utilize this new technology and how that might affect their performance.

=== Enablement theory ===

In contrast to the curtailment theory, a 2007 study by Jorna and Wagenaar showed that ITA was able to increase the amount of work done while cutting down on inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Iron Cage Strengthened? Discretion and Digital Discipline|last = Jorna|first = F|date = 2007|journal = Public Administration|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00640.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Wagenaar|first2 = P|volume = 85|issue = 1|pp = 189–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meaning and content of this work was not able to be captured and understood by ITA. A 2004 study by Vitalis and Duhaut 
highlighted the ambiguous nature of ITA.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nouvelles Technologies De L'information Et De La Communication Et Relation Administrative: De La Relation De Guichet A La Relation De Reseau|last = Vitalis|first = A|date = 2004|journal = Revue Francaise D'Administration Publique|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Duhaut|first2 = N|volume = 110|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown that the [[Internet]] or other forms of technology were utilized for simpler tasks, and more elaborate and complex matters were dealt with face-to-face with citizens. Vitalis and Duhaut come to the conclusion that a SLB has their discretionary power enhanced by ITA, and citizens benefit from ITA by being better informed of their rights when dealing with SLBs and 
their institutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This theory maintains that discretion by the SLB is not hindered in anyway by ITA and will continue to do their jobs effectively. This theory also focuses more on how ITA is utilized by both citizens and state agents which puts more emphasis on the ability of ITA to further help and empower SLBs and citizens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">'''T'nalak''' is the traditional tapestry making of the [[T'boli]]s from [[South Cotabato]] in the [[Philippines]]

==Introduction==
T'nalak is a traditional cloth found in Mindanao island made by a group of people in [[Lake Sebu]], [[South Cotabato]] called T'bolis, [[Tboli people]]. This traditional cloth is hand-woven made of ''[[Abaca]]'' fibers which traditionally has three primary colors, red, black and the original color of the Abaca leaves. The colorant of the materials are naturally dyed boiled in with bark, roots and leaves of plants. It is an heritage and believed that the intricate and creative patterns of the Tinalak was seen on their dreams and made it on to work. They can't create a design of the Tinalak if they haven't dreamed of it. They are sometimes called the "''Dream Weavers''".

The T’nalak fabric holds a special and prominent place in [T’boli] culture.  It is ever present in significant turning points in a [Tboli] life, such as birth, marriage, and death. It is the medium which sanctifies these rites, enveloping them in the length of its fabric like a benediction. It has also often been referred to as “woven dreams”. It is exactly that, and more. In a culture which didn’t have a form of writing, the T’nalak served as both Literature and Art. The [T’bolis] expressed everything they are in the T’nalak: their dreams, beliefs, myths and even their religion. Making use of the various geometrical patterns and the trademark red, black and white colors, the [T’bolis] weave the natural and the supernatural in the abaca strands of the T’nalak. 
Furthermore, the weaving process integrates the personal, the social and the cultural. After a weaver reaches a certain degree of expertise, she becomes a “master weaver” – someone who can interpret and take inspiration from dreams, hence the term “dreamweavers”. By all accounts, this seems to be an intense personal experience for the weaver, and the moment she succeeds in doing this is the moment she becomes an artist. And then it is also social because the T’nalak binds together all that the [T’boli]people believe in. The skill of the weaver gathers in the T’nalak all the elements that make the [T’boli] social life. Finally, it is cultural in that it is the means through which other tribes identify the [T’bolis] since the T’nalak is uniquely and distinctly [T’boli].
from Gida Ofong (T'boli tribeswoman and dreamweaver)

Tinalak are also their prized possession at marriage, even the covering for childbirth for ensuring safe delivery and for trading. Whenever they sell their work, they put a brass ring around it as for the spirits to allow them or to please. They're not even allowed to cut the Tinalak 'cause of what they believe it would deliver them sickness.

==Plot==
The story opens in a Tokyo police station where 34-year-old Lucy Fly is being questioned over the murder of her friend Lily Bridges. Lucy has been in Tokyo for 10 years, is fluent in Japanese, and employed in translating manuals into English. She is evasive in her answers to the police but recounts to the readers what led to her current situation; her estrangement from her family in England, her relationship with Teiji an enigmatic photographer, and the recent arrival of Lily, who like Lucy comes from East Yorkshire. On a trip to [[Sado Island]], jealousy appears, and relationships break down.

==Reception==
Reviews were generally positive :
*[[A. N. Wilson]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' writes "Without giving away the secret, Lucy is obsessed, sexually obsessed, by a young man called Teiji who works in a noodle bar, and who likes taking arty photographs of tall buildings reflected in the puddles of Tokyo's pavements, and of her in the nude. In its spare way, this novel, which I have now read three times, is one of the best accounts - and this is not all that it is - of female sexuality, that subject of and mystery for any male reader. It is not, very decidedly not, a book however which will reveal what "they" feel when in love, or in bed - only what she, and a pretty distinctive she, feels."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3584442/World-of-books.html 'Shocking prose paired with sexual obsession', ''The Telegraph'', 25 Nov 2002] Retrieved 2016-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' concludes "The descriptions of Japan's landscapes, language, people and customs are delivered with fluency and intimacy, yet with the slightly detached clarity of an expat. Some readers may find Jones's intermingling of first- and third-person narration self-conscious and distracting...and the hazy ending raises more questions than it answers. But this is less a whodunit than an examination of the slippery nature of truth and memory, obsessions and betrayals, all of which Jones handles with confidence and skill"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-89296-742-1 www.publishersweekly.com Fiction Book Review] Retrieved 2016-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''''' (originally titled '''''Der Schatz der Sierra Madre''''') is a 1927 [[adventure novel]] by bilingual German author [[B. Traven]], whose identity remains unknown.,&lt;ref&gt;James Goldwasser (1993)“''Ret Marut: the Early B. Traven''” in The Germanic Review, Volume 63, 1993 – Issue 3, reprinted Libcom.org https://libcom.org/history/ret-marut-early-b-traven-james-goldwasser&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, two destitute American men in Mexico of the 1920s join an older American prospector in a search for [[gold]]. [[John Huston]] adapted the book as a [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|1948 film of the same name]].

==Historical setting==
The novel is set in the decade following the global upheavals of the [[World War I |First World War]] and social revolutions in [[Russian Revolution|Russia]] and [[Mexican Revolution |Mexico]]. The United States has emerged as the dominant imperialist power globally. European and US corporations are aggressively seeking foreign markets, natural resources and cheap labor. Elements within the [[Catholic Church]] are struggling to retain their authority as [[Plutarco Elías Calles| liberal Mexican administrations]] institute social reforms, including an 8-hour day, literacy programs and health care. This is the context of the story.

==Plot==
The author employs a [[Narrator | third person-omniscient]] in a [[Dramatic structure| dramatic-progressive structure]], where  Howard is the [[Focal character|focal character]]. Three [[story within a story |stories within a story]] provide historical and social significance for the outer narrative.

===Summary===

The story opens in the oil boomtown of [[Tampico]], Mexico in the early 1920s. Dobbs, an expatriate who hails from “an industrial American city” is unemployed, penniless and reduced to bumming spare change from American tourists. Loitering on Tampico's main plaza, he collects a number of generous handouts from well-to-do men who wear white suits. To Dobbs’ dismay, he discovers that he has been accosting the same individual repeatedly. The irate tourist at last unbraids the panhandler, dismissing him with a half-peso tip.

At the ''Hotel Oso Negro'' (the Black Bear Hotel), a vermin-infested flophouse, Dobbs pays for a cot and a cold shower at 50 centavos per night. The hotel clientele comprises both employed and unemployed international workers, as well as a number of gamblers, thieves and tramps. The ''Oso Negro'', nevertheless, is operated efficiently by its sharp-eyed front desk clerks. The guests themselves collectively provide a degree of good order and security.

In a café, a young Mexican lottery vendor exhorts Dobbs to purchase a ticket. Dobbs insults the boy, but finally consents to risk his last 20 centavos on the drawing.

Dobbs lands a gig unloading agricultural machinery at four pesos per day. Desperate for better wages, he joins a rigging crew as a [[roughneck]], run by American contractor Pat McCormick. A shrewd bidder on lucrative drilling projects, McCormick has a reputation for fast-paced operations and high productivity. He postures as an anti-capitalist and comrade to revolutionaries so as to win the loyalty of his newly arrived European laborers, who are sympathetic to Bolshevism. Americans are wise to his phony appeals to worker solidarity and McCormick avoids hiring them. The pay is $8 a day, less $1.80 for meals. The crews work 18-hour shifts, seven days a week for the duration of the project and no overtime pay. Mexican labor is never hired due to their national eight-hour day provision. When the rigging job is completed, the crew is sent back to Tampico to await payment. McCormick advances a few employees 5% of their pay. Dobbs argues for and gets 30% of his earning in cash. 

Weeks pass while Dobbs, along with Californian co-worker named Curtin seek the evasive contractor. The men spot McCormick in the central plaza, promenading with his meretricious mistress. When they confront him, he invites the resentful Dobbs and Curtin into a ''cantina'' for a drink. Plying the men with liquor, McCormick pleads that he has not yet been reimbursed by the oil company. Curtin curses his lie, while Dobbs thrusts him against the bar, demanding their wages. McCormick, himself a brawler, and capable of beating up the men one-on-one, mentally calculates his losses if he ends up in a hospital after a desperate bar fight against both determined workers. He pulls out the cash he owes Dobbs and Curtin and throws it on the bar top. Vowing to never hire them again, he strides out of the ''cantina''.

When Dobbs returns to the ''Oso Negro'', he encounters the greying Howard, an old-timer who has travelled the world in search of gold. The loquacious old man is holding forth with his bunkmates on the perils of striking it rich. Discovered in quantity, he avers, gold distorts a man's estimate of vice and virtue. Invariably he succumbs to greed, and no amount of gold will satisfy him. Overhearing this, Dobbs becomes agitated, swearing that he is immune to the sinister forces of gold, that he would be happy with a $20,000 fortune, no more. Howard quietly takes the measure of Dobbs with a long look, then returns to his sermon. He assures them that, though no longer in his prime, he is ready to share expenses on a gold-prospecting expedition. Dobbs and the others feel the powerful lure of the precious metal.

====[[Story within a Story]]: The Legend of ''La Mina Agua Verde'' ====

{{Quotation|Howard tells the story of ''La Mina Agua de Verde'' (the Green Water Mine), as told to him by a Harry Tilton, former mentor and fellow-prospector. Tilton was one of a 15-man expedition to the legendary mine, and the only one who survived to carry away a sizeable fortune. The historic diggings are said to be located on todays’ border between the American state of [[Arizona]] and the Mexican state of [[Sonora]].

Tilton’s narrative sets forth the early history of the mine and carries an indictment of the imperial powers and profit systems that exploited its unbelievably rich and apparently inexhaustible deposits of gold. The social history associated with the mine presents a litany of horrors, beginning with the [[Aztec|Aztecs]] and proceeding to the forced labor of indigenous people by the Spanish conquerors. The complicity of the Catholic Church in maintaining order among the Indian workers is detailed, including their authorization of torture. A malediction is placed on the mine.
 
In 1762 local inhabitants launch a revolt, exterminating the Spanish officials presiding over the slave laborers. Spain’s military retaliates with a program of terror, burning villages and hanging women and children attempting to flee the oppression. A pattern of retaliatory killings escalates, until the Indian insurgents obliterate the mine and utterly transform the landscape to conceal any evidence of the its existence. Attempts by Spanish authorities to relocate the diggings fail. 

The legend of the cursed ''La Mina Agua Verde'' persists nonetheless in subsequent decades, revived when the United States takes possession of northern Mexico in the 1840s. The fate of those who seek the fabled mine ends in madness or death.

During the 1870s, three American students from a distance college are on vacation in Arizona. As guests of a local priest, they secretly copy a map of ''La Mina Agua Verde'' – the Green Water Mine – found in the clerics’ library. The boys enter into a partnership with a number of seasoned prospectors, among them Harry Tilton, who finance the 15-man party to rediscover the lost mine.

The map leads them to the vicinity of the mine. After weeks of relentless excavation, a three-man crew unearths some rich gold-laden ore. They attempt to conceal their discovery from their fellow prospectors, but the deception is exposed. Their revengeful comrades murder them. The mine proves to contain immense quantities of gold. Harry Tilton, satisfied with his $28,000 of gold, departs from the dig early. He settles down on a farm in his native Kansas. Unbeknownst to him, the remaining 11 men are massacred by bands of Indians, and the mine sinks back into legend.

Near the turn of the century, gold fever grips the world with the great [[Gold rush|gold rushes]] in the Alaska, Australia and South Africa. Tilton is coerced, against his better judgment, to lead an expedition to relocate the legendary Green Water Mine. The members of the prospecting party include the much younger Howard. 

Tilton fails to relocate the historic diggings. Disappointed members of his party become furious and try to extract the location from him by torture. They consider murdering Tilton, but he survives and returns to Kansas, only to find that his farm has been burned down in retaliation. Howard reports that Tilton fled the state, never to be heard of again. This ends the Howard’s cautionary tale.}}

Dobbs shares the legend of the Green Water Mine with Curtin, and has a premonition that he may be subject to a gold curse. Curtin discounts any “curse” associated with gold and holds that a person's character determines its effects; it may be used for bad or good.

With many oil fields beginning to shut down operation in Mexico and relocate to other countries, the two men are impelled to partner with Howard to seek gold. Curtin is skeptical as to the old man's fitness, but Dobbs assures him that Howard is indispensable to the success of their venture, wondering if the old timer will even entertain shouldering two greenhorn prospectors. Howard gladly consents, and offers to invest the bulk of his savings, $200, towards the endeavor. Dobbs discovers that his lottery ticket has netted 100 pesos, and Curtin, in turn, collects an outstanding loan repayment with interest to the amount of $200. With about $600 in pooled funds, the trio depart immediately by train for city of [[Durango]], in the Mexican interior.

In Durango, Howard selects a promising region in the remote [[Sierra Madre Occidental| Sierra Madre Mountains]] to search for gold. Purchasing supplies and pack animals in local villages they begin their ascent. Dobbs and Curtin are staggered by the hardships they experience in wilderness travel. Several promising sites are tested, but show only traces of gold. The two inexperienced men begin to despair and consider quitting.

Howard suddenly begins to berate his companions, disparaging their pessimism and ignorance. The old man's outburst is such that Dobbs and Curtin suspect he has gone mad. Listening to him, they begin to grasp what he is saying: the keen-eyed miner recognizes that the terrain is laden with placer gold.

An excavation site is selected and the base camp is situated over a mile away for security. The men intend to pose as professional game hunters seeking commercial hides. The approach to the diggings are carefully camouflaged with boulders and trunks. The local people take little interest in their activities and do not molest them. They establish a placer gold operation, using a sluice box, with the water hauled to the apparatus by burros from a nearby creek. Driven by entrepreneurial self-interest, Dobbs and Curtin work to the limits of their endurance. The gold accumulates slowly but surely.

As the fortune piles up, the prospectors class identity shifts. With property to defend, they adopt a bourgeois outlook, suspicious of the have-nots. They cease to be proletariats.  Even as the men share the same hardships, they do not forge friendships, merely alliances for profit. Their willingness to rescue a partner in distress is self-serving: the loss of one man to death or injury could cripple the profitable enterprise.
 
Months of hard labor and privations in the wilderness begins to show on the men. They are sick of the grub, the monotony of the work regimen and, especially, of one another. Howard has constantly to intervene to diffuse fights between the younger men. In a number of violent confrontations, they pull their pistols and come close to shooting each other over trifles.

The miners begin to anticipate the end of the operation and a return to civil society. Curtin raises the question as to how much each gold share will bring in cash. Howard calculates this to be about $15,000 apiece. The claim is beginning to show signs of depletion and the men set a date of departure of 6-8 weeks. They collaborate in planning the safe transportation and conversion of their riches to currency. For the first time in months, they begin to think of their personal futures.

Curtin makes a final resupply trip to the local village. He takes a few hides at usual to sell at the dry goods store; this, to keep up the pretense he is a hunter. Curtin is accosted by a friendly American newcomer visiting the store. The man insinuates that there is much gold in the nearby mountains; Curtin emphatically denies it. The stranger guesses the significance of Curtin's aloofness and trails him into the mountain wilderness.

Without warning, the intruder steps silently into their fire circle. The prospectors are momentarily taken off guard by his arrival. Dobbs recovers, and emphatically tells the man to clear out, but the stranger stands his ground. The miners cunningly ignore the unwelcome guest, and pretend to discuss “hunting” strategies. The stranger bluntly informs them the area is unfit for commercial hunting – rather, they are sitting on a gold field. The prospectors return to their tent intensely suspicious of the man's purpose. They permit him to stay the night. The stranger introduces himself as Robert W. Lacuad of Phoenix, Arizona, “Tech, Pasadena”. 

When Howard goes to check the burros, he spots mounted men in the distance approaching the encampment. They are not Mexican soldiers or police. Lacuad warns the miners that the horsemen are dangerous bandits, led by the notorious Gold Hat. Tipped off by locals, they are searching for the “hunter” (Curtin) to seize his guns and ammunition. Lacuad assures his companions that their lives are in imminent danger. As they anxiously watch the bandits slowly ascend the trail, Lacuad relates to them the story of Gold Hat, conveyed to him by a local nobleman, don Genaro Montereal, while visiting his estate the previous week.

====[[Story within a story]]: Lacaud’s narrative of an incident in the [[Cristero War |''Viva Nuestro Rey Cristo'' Uprising]]====

{{Quotation|In a remote region of western Mexico, a passenger train stops to pick up mail at a small station. At nightfall, twenty mestizos, dressed in peasant garb, silently board the train with prepaid tickets. 

The second-class carriages are crowded with working class families with children; the first-class Pullman cars carry tourists, officials and merchants. A small detachment of federal troopers occupies another car. The mestizos, wrapped in ponchos, take up positions in the standing room only cars. When the train reaches full speed, someone cries “Viva Nuestro Rey Cristo! (Long live our King Jesus!).  At this signal, the mestizos withdraw concealed firearms and begin shooting at the occupants: men, woman and children are indiscriminately slaughtered. The soldiers, caught by surprise, are shot down before then can retrieve their rifles. With the passengers subdued, the looting begins.

Despair and madness prevail among the survivors, as they are stripped of their possessions. Stopping the train, the bandits and their 200 confederates waiting along the tracks, carry away the loot before setting all the carriages on fire. The trains’ engineer, though mortally wounded, escapes with the locomotive to the nearby depot. A rescue train is sent and the outlaws are driven away. 

The federal military forces in the adjoining states are mobilized to pursue the perpetrators. Two catholic priests are apprehended and admit to directing the attack on the train. The bandits, or rebels, as the case may be, are poor and politically ignorant agrarians who perform these deeds in struggle between the Catholic Church and the government of Mexico. 

The federal troopers who comprise the rural military units are 80% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|''Indios'']] and 20% rest [[Mestizo| Mestizos]]. Led by junior officers, the detachments are deployed to track down and liquidate the 200 or more participants in the train assault.

The military ''modus operandi'' consists of making sweeps through remote villages for transient peasants. The luckless men are detained and questioned as to their residence and their clothing is searched. If contraband is found that does not match their social status or gender, they are assumed to be bandits. (In the post-Mexican Revolution period of the 1920s, possession of a firearm is not grounds for suspicion, as the peasant soldiers in the conflict retained their rifles after the fighting.) The detainees are automatically assumed to be desperados, guilt of capital crimes. They are immediately put to death by the soldiers, after diggings their own graves. 

Lacaud concludes his report, informing his cohorts that the approaching bandits, led by Gold Hat, are the last surviving members of the outlaws that had joined in the deadly train assault. The men prepare themselves for a desperate struggle.}}

The prospectors take up positions in a trench-like ravine with a view of the campsite, fortifying it like a military bunker. Howard assumes command with the consent of the others and holds a war council.

Gold Hat and his men dismount and enter the campsite on foot, expecting to encounter only a lone hunter. Failing to find him, they quarrel and consider returning to the village. The prospectors silently observe these developments from their hidden defenses. As the 20-man bandit group prepare to spend the night, one member explores the vicinity and discovers Curtin in the trench. Curtin warns him away, and the bandit alerts his companions.
 
Gold Hat approaches Curtin and identifies his cohorts as [[Federales| ''policia montada'']] (mounted police), searching for outlaws who robbed a train. Curtin in turn demands that they show their police badges. Gold Hat, affronted, threatens Curtin with arrest for hunting without a license and possessing unregistered firearms. Curtin brandishes his rifle and the bandits determine to lay siege to his foxhole; they prefer to take him alive so as to torture him to death for entertainment. The methods they will use matches the iconography of Catholic Church and the practice of torture by the Inquisition. The bandits wear the icons of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph, believing they will protect them in their endeavors.

Gold Hat tries to lure Curtin from his foxhole with promises of a gold watch. Rebutted, the outlaws construct movable barriers to assault the trench. Before they can deploy them,  a company of genuine mounted police, alerted by villagers, appear and pursue Gold Hat and his gang as they flee the encampment.

With the ordeal over, Howard, Dobbs and Curtin express a desire to terminate operations and return immediately to civilization, Howard confides to Dobbs and Curtin that Lacuad is an eccentric “eternal” – a prospector who becomes obsessed over a coveted diggings and will not abandoned even after decades of failure. They leave him to his fate. Howard directs the dismantling of their mine so as to leave no trace of its existence. Howard warns his cohorts that the next phase – transferring the gold dust back to civilization – may be the riskiest phase and they become preoccupied with its challenges. Howard illustrates these dangers in his tale of the Dona Maria Mine.

==== [[Story within a Story]]: Legend of Dona Catalina Maria de Rodriguez and the “Dona Maria” Mine. ====

{{Quotation|The story is set in the late 18th Century in [[Chihuahuan Desert]] region of Northern Mexico.

A Chiricahuan chieftain named ''Aguila Bravo'' (Brave Eagle) lives a contented life. The chieftains’ only son, approaching adulthood, is handsome and intelligent, but has been born blind. This is his father’s sole regret. A parasitic monk, who live off the hospitality of the local villagers, promises to provide the chieftain with the method by which to restore his son’s vision, for a fee. The secret, he tells father, is to appeal to the heavenly ''Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe'' (Our Lady of Guadalupe), on behalf of the Catholic Church. 

The chief, as instructed, makes a 1400-mile pilgrimage on foot to Mexico City in company with his wife and son, carrying all his money and jewelry as an offering to the Saint. The family travels the final three miles on their knees to the holy site of Cerrito de Tepeyac ([[Hill of Tepeyac]]), saying [[Hail Mary| Ave Marias]] as they go. For three days, the chief and his dependents pray before the icons, without food or water. Nothing happens. Aguila Bravo, hoping to appease the Saint, offers his cattle and next year’s crops so as to induce a miracle. After seven more days, encouraged by the clergy, the chief offers to transfer his entire estate to the church to obtain eyesight for his son. No miracle takes place. The boy’s health begins to fail due to the privations they’ve endured, and the father fears for his life. Exasperated, he renounces his faith in the Virgin. The priests accuse him of blasphemy and warn that he may be tortured by a court of the holy [[Inquisition]]. The fathers of the church explain that the Virgin has withheld her intervention because the chief has failed to perform the requisite number of Ave Marias, or perhaps took a sip of water in violation of the fast. He admits as much, and departs in disgust.

In Mexico City, he consults a doctor – a quack – named Don Manuel, who agrees to restore the boy’s eyesight, for a price, payable in gold. The two men strike a quid pro quo: if the doctor provides his son with sight, the chief will reveal the location of a rich gold and silver mine. A caveat allows the doctor to reverse the effects of the operation if the mine turns out to be a hoax. 
Spurred by the promise of great riches, Don Manuel fully succeeds in giving the boy sight. Aguila Bravo is good for his word. The location of the mine, long concealed by his ancestors despite cruel torture by Spanish invaders, is provided to Don Manuel for his personal enrichment. The mine proves to be rich in silver, less so in gold. Cunningly, Don Manuel transfers only small shipments to Mexico City to purchase food and provisions.  He is fearful that church leaders might spread rumors that he doubted the miracle of Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, torture him and confiscate his property. The staggering wealth of the mine is thus concealed; the bulk of the treasure is buried at the diggings.

Don Manuel abuses his Indian laborers, and in time, they rebel. His wife, Dona Maria escapes, but her husband is killed in the uprising. The Indians take no further interest in the mine and return to their homes. The widow Dona Maria goes to bury her deceased spouse. She finds the hidden stockpiles of silver untouched.

Despite possessing this fortune, she determines to amass enough to become the richest woman on Earth. A daughter of impoverished city dwellers, she dreams of marrying into Spanish nobility of the highest rank. She reopens the mine, and makes generous donations to the Church so as to insure they do not molest the operations. The mine, meanwhile, continues to disgorge huge amounts of rich ore. At the remote diggings, she endures privations better than her husband, and handles her poorly paid employee adroitly. She adopts the manners of hard-drinking wench, but impresses the visiting monks with her devoutness to the church. 

Revolutionary movements in the late 18th Century in Europe destabilize the social relations in the Americas, as Spain begins to lose its grip on its colonial holdings. Egalitarian political and economics are taking hold. Dona Maria’s mine is perpetually threatened with attack by desperados. She cleverly poses as a madwoman who seeks atonement through hard work, rather than a besieged member of the discredited elites. Before long, she becomes discontented with her primitive lifestyle and yearns for a more cultured existence. Her wealth is such that she can now realize her dream to marry into the Spanish nobility.

The silver and gold, smelted into bars, must be carried across 1400 miles across the Sierra Madre mountains and the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] to reach Mexico City. Dona Maria enlists two ex-soldiers from Spanish army to oversee the convoy, placing them in command of a detachment of armed Mestizos and a dozen Indian teamsters and 130 mules.
 
One of the soldier mutinies with the Mestizos, and he demands that Dona Maria marry him and make him master of the fortune. If she refuses, he threatens to rape her and divide the bullion with the mutineers. Unfazed, she spars with him verbally, then takes hold of a horsewhip, and brutally beats him until he collapses. She assaults the bewildered mutineers, and they submit to her authority. She orders the disloyal soldier hanged. The loyal soldier she bribes and makes common cause with the Indian muleskinners and Dona Maria maintains control of the convoy. She sustains her spirits imagining a personal audience with the Pope.

Dona Maria arrives in Mexico City and instantly becomes a celebrity. The rich and powerful court her. With the silver and gold safely ensconced in the vaults of the King’s treasury, her wealth is secured – by the nobility. Dona Maria mysteriously disappears, never to be heard of again. Here, Howard ends his cautionary tale.

Curtin inquires as to whether the mine still holds riches, and if it could possibly be rediscovered. Howard disabuses the younger man: the mine is owned by an American outfit – the Dona Maria Mine Company. The operation yields ten times the ore extracted under Dona Catalina Maria de Rodriguez. Employees of the mine earn $40 a week.}}

Howard, Curtin and Dobbs take leave of Lacuad and head for Durango. The threesome avoid populated areas and refrain from acting suspicious so as not to draw attention from locals. Passing through a tiny village, they are detained by Mexican officials. Expecting the worst – that they will be fined for operating an unregistered mine – the officials turn out to be medical technicians for the Health Commission vaccinating the residents for smallpox. The prospectors gladly submit to be inoculated and go their way.

Setting up camp, they are intercepted by a delegation of mounted ''indios''. The farmers request that the American accompany them to their village: the son of one of the men has been pulled from a swimming hole unconscious and cannot be revived. Howard consents to accompany them to their village and examine the boy. There, he applies basic First Aid to the child and he recovers. The villagers regard Howard's powers as those of a medicine-man or magician.

Howard rejoins Dobbs and Curtin and they resume their journey, but they are shortly overtaken by the father of the boy he saved. The man and his companions insist that Howard return to the village so they can pay back the debt – a matter of etiquette and honor. The prospectors recognize that the ''indios'' are in earnest, and Howard relents. He relinquishes his possessions - including his share of gold - to the care of Dobbs and Curtin. They promise to rendezvous with him in Durango. Howard is welcome as a hero by the villagers upon his return.

Dobbs and Curtin, struggling to cross the high Sierra Madre, begin to quarrel in the absence of the Howard's steadying influence.  Dobbs, regretting having agreed to transport Howard's gear, lashes out at Curtin. Curtin maintains his composure and shoulders most of the work. Despite this, the unstable Dobbs descends into a homicidal rage, which Curtin, though anxious, is slow to grasp. When Dobbs proposes that they abscond with Howard's share, Curtin flatly vetoes the notion. Dobbs reacts to his comrade's defense of Howard as a symptom of Bolshevism. Curtin does not deny being a socialist, but emphatically refuses to betray the old man. Though not above some unscrupulousness himself, his actions are directed toward those who have power and wealth, not against his companions. When Dobbs pulls his pistol, Curtin is thunderstruck; he realizes that Dobbs is a homicidal maniac. Curtin manages to disarm Dobbs, but cannot, on principle, bring himself to kill an unarmed man. Dobbs’ hatred and contempt for Curtin deepens when he interprets this restraint as “Bolshevik” in character.
 
The unarmed Dobbs bides his time in the ensuing days, taunting his bewildered companion. Curtin is forced to remain awake at night to fend off an assault by Dobbs. Exhausted, he finally slips into sleep. Dobbs instantly seizes his pistol and marches Curtin into the underbrush where he shoots him point blank. Returning minutes later to make sure the man is dead, he shoots into the prostrate body a second time.

In an attempt to rationalize his crime, Dobbs recalls that he killed German soldiers in combat serving in the US military in Europe. His conscience troubles him, but he finally falls into a deep sleep. He awakes and searches for Curtin's body, but cannot find it. He begins to hallucinate as his alienation and guilt take hold of him.

He departs camp and makes good progress towards Durango, in possession of all the gold. When he spots a locomotive in the distant valley, his anxiety fades and he contemplates a trip to the British Isles, the home of his ancestors. His only concern is that his crime will be discovered before he can cash in and escape. In sight of Durango, he is reassured that the law and order that protects property in civilized areas will assert itself. Dobbs gloats over his presumed killing of Curtin and his double-dealing of Howard.

On the outskirts of Durango, Dobbs and his pack train stumble onto three Mestizo desperados – Miguel, Nacho and Pablo - at a secluded site off the main road. Dobbs senses his life is in danger. The Mestizos begin to ransack the packs. Dobbs pulls his pistol, only to find it is unloaded. Miguel, the leader of the gang, quickly dispatches Dobbs with a machete. The men don his clothing, and escape with the pack train.

The outlaws, upon examining the contents of the pack, find only what appears to be sand in burlap bags. They guess that this is ballast placed in the packs to inflate the value by weight of commercial hides, or perhaps samples taken by a mining company engineer. They cannot fathom that it could be a fortune in placer gold. Frustrated at the paucity of loot, they slash the bags and contents pour out, swept away by the wind.

The desperados travel to a tiny village in the high Sierra Madre and offer the stolen burros for sale. The village elders casually examine the animals and the men's outfits. The brands on the burros are recognized as those sold to three prospectors months before. The village mayor is sent for; he engages the three Mestizos in an unassuming, yet probing interrogation regarding their acquisition of the burros and packs. The thieves are equivocal. The mayor quietly assembles the men of the village. After further cross-examination and more inconsistences in the scenario, a posse is sent to locate Dobbs and discover his decapitated remains. The local military garrison is notified, and a captain arrives with a platoon of troopers to take the Mestizos into custody. While being marched back to the garrison, the accused murderers are shot to death while trying to “escape”. Their corpses are buried where they fell, with a cynical display of decorum.

Curtin, wounded and barely alive, is found crawling through the underbrush by a local woodsman.  He takes Curtin to his home, and Howard is notified that a gringo needs medical care. When Howard arrives, Curtin relates his ordeal with Dobbs, and swears revenge. Howard, reflecting on the incident, and without exonerating Dobbs, does not consider him a natural killer. The old timer points to the temptation of $50,000 in gold, and declares that any person might be tempted to murder for it. The two men agree to pursue Dobbs and retrieve their fortunes – not yet knowing Dobbs’ fate.

While Curtin convalesces, Howard embarks for Durango, but he is intercepted by the mayor who presided over the interrogation of Dobbs’ murderers and tells him the story. Howard is informed that the gold has been lost. He returns to his village and relates the tragic news to Curtin. Grasping the enormity of the disaster, Howard roars with “[[Homer|Homeric]]” laughter. Curtin is at first offended, distraught at the loss of the fortune, but finally joins the old prospector in his ironic mirth.

Howard is content to remain in the village as a medicine-man and offer Curtin to accompany him as an apprentice doctor. When Howard makes a thorough examination of the recovered burros and packs, he finds two bags of placer gold overlooked by the thieves. Now possessing some capital, the two ex-prospectors consider opening a movie theatre or a grocery store in Tampico, but with the decline in the oil boom, they doubt their profitability. 

Howard remains enthusiastic about a life as an honored member of the Indio community. Curtin bids Howard farewell, and promises to visit his old comrade when he fully recovers.

== Adaptations ==

===Film===
* [[John Huston]] successfully adapted the book as a [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|1948 film]] of the same name.
* The 1984 made-for-television movie ''[[Wet Gold]]'' has been called an unofficial remake of ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', borrowing the basic storyline but set in the modern-day Caribbean and concerning a sunken treasure of gold bars.

===Television===
*  Episode 3 of the [[List of Cheyenne episodes#Season 1: 1955.E2.80.9356|first season]] of the 1955 TV series ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' gives a writing credit (novel) to [[B. Traven]], and contains the same basic plot as the novel, with the main character, Cheyenne, standing in the role of the old prospector, Howard, of the original story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cheyenne" The Argonauts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0540151/?ref_=ttep_ep3|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Games===
* The first DLC for the game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', titled ''Dead Money'', borrows from the basic themes of the novel, with some post-apocalyptic twists, replacing the Sierra Madre mountains with the ruins of a casino known as the Sierra Madre, and having the antagonist of the DLC "solving" the novel's issue of greed by equipping the player character and all of the other NPCs in the DLC with bomb collars equipped with [[dead man's switch|dead man's switches,]] so that if one of the group dies, they all die.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Water marble nail method3.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dragging]]
[[File:Water marble nail method2.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dropping]]
There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yissum Research Development Company''' is the [[technology transfer]] company of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biojerusalem.org.il/database_tto.asp?ID=1 Biojerusalem Database: Yissum Research Development Company]&lt;/ref&gt; Yissum was founded in 1964 to market ideas and innovation of university researchers and employees.
 
In 2005, Yissum ranked second in commercial profit earnings among Israel's academic institutions, the first being the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]'s company, Yeda Research and Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/hebrew-university-patent-company-yissum-enjoys-record-revenues-royalties-in-2004-1.158190 Hebrew University patent company Yissum enjoys record revenues, royalties in 2004, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yissum has founded more than 80 start-up companies. Products brought to market by Yissum are sold in billions of dollars annually. Yissum has registered more than 8,000 individual patent applications in more than 2,200 patent families and signed over 700 license agreements.

Yissum has signed collaboration agreements with [[Cornell]], [[UCBerkeley]], [[Caltech]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Children's Medical Center]], [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[MIT]], [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Michigan State University]], [[NYU]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Rockefeller University]], [[Stanford University]] and other educational institutions.

==History==
Yissum Research Development Company was founded in 1964 to protect and market the Hebrew University’s intellectual property. Products generate $2 billion in annual sales. Yissum has registered over 8,100 patents covering 2,300 inventions; licensed 700 technologies and formed 80 companies. Yissum’s business partners include Syngenta, Monsanto, Roche, Novartis, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Intel and Teva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/09/16/makhteshim-agan-and-yissum-partner-to-develop-a-novel-method-for-protecting-plants-using-yeast-isolated-from-strawberry-leaves/ Mahkteshim Agan and Yissu partner to develop a novel method for protecting plants using yeast isolated from strawberry leaves]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, [[technology transfer]] entities are organized as companies, unlike the United States. In the United States technology transfer operations only began after the [[Bayh–Dole Act]] in 1982. The formation of companies for doing technology transfer greatly influences the operation of technology transfer.

Yissum is a for-profit company which is fully owned by the Hebrew University which is a not-for-profit entity. This makes Yissum a non-typical entity which unlike regular for-profit companies has additional goals.

In 2005, Yissum developed a TTM solution considered the leading solution for universities in Israel. Yissum maintains ongoing contacts with [[Association of University Technology Managers]] which allows exchange of technologies, ideas, methods of work and many other valuable information.

In 2014, QLight Nanotech, a subsidiary of Yissum partly owned by Merck, opened an R&amp;D facility in [[Jerusalem]] for developing LED lighting and flat-panel display products using semiconductor nanocrystal materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Merck-backed-QLight-opens-new-Jerusalem-nanotech-site-328111 Merck-backed QLight opens new Jerusalem nanotech site]&lt;/ref&gt;
