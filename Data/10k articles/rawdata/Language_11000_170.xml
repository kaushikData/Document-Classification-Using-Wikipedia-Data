The '''Atayalic languages''' are a group of [[Formosan languages]] spoken in northern [[Taiwan]]. [[Robert Blust]] considers them to form a primary branch within the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]], However, [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]] groups them into the Northern Formosan branch, which includes the Northwestern Formosan languages.

==Classification==
[[File:Atayal.svg|thumb|210px|Atayal people resides in central and northern Taiwan, along the [[Hsuehshan]] mountains. The image depicts two major dialect groups of Atayal language.]]

Li (1981) and Li (1982) classify the Atayalic languages and dialects as follows:&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 1981. "Reconstruction of Proto-Atayalic Phonology." In Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2004. Selected Papers on Formosan Languages. Taipei, Taiwan: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
The Proto-Atayalic language was reconstructed by Taiwanese linguist Paul Jen-kuei Li in 1981.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Proto-Atayalic had final voiced stops, which are preserved in the Mayrinax dialect of Cʔuliʔ Atayal.&lt;ref name="Li2"&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 1982. "Atayalic Final Voiced Stops." In Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2004. Selected Papers on Formosan Languages. Taipei, Taiwan: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt; These voiced stops include *-b, *-d, *-g, and *-g'. However, they are now lost in many dialects of Atayal, Seediq, and also Pazeh (Blust 2009:615).

'''Aweer''' (Aweera), also known as '''Boni''' (Bon, Bonta), is a [[Cushitic language]] of Eastern [[Kenya]]. The [[Aweer people]], known by the arguably derogatory [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] "Boni," are historically a hunter gatherer people, traditionally subsisting on hunting, gathering, and collecting honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biber|first=Douglas|last2=Heine|first2=Bernd|date=1984|title=The Waata Dialect of Oromo: Grammatical Sketch and Vocabulary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/413828|journal=Language|volume=60|issue=4|pages=992|doi=10.2307/413828|issn=0097-8507|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ancestral lands range along the Kenyan coast from the [[Lamu County|Lamu]] and [[Ijara District|Ijara]] Districts into Southern [[Somalia|Somalia's]] [[Badhadhe District|Badaade District]].&lt;ref&gt;A.H.J. Prins. 1960 Notes on the Boni, a Tribe of Hunters in Northern Kenya. ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological  Research.'' Vol. 1 (3): 25-27; 1963 The Didemic Diarchic Boni. ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute.'' Vol. 93 (2): 174-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are around 8,000 speakers of Aweer. Aweer has similarities with the [[Garre language]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethngex"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gex Ethnologue - Garre language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mauro|last=Tosco|year=1994|title=The Historical Reconstruction of a Southern Somali Dialect: Proto-Karre-Boni|journal=Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika|volume=15|pages=153–209|url=https://www.academia.edu/4248545/The_historical_reconstruction_of_a_Southern_Somali_dialect_Proto-Karre-Boni}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, its speakers are ethnically distinct from Garre speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"&gt;[http://archive.ethnologue.com/16/show_language.asp?code=bob Ethnologue - Aweer language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that the Aweer are remnants of the early hunter-gatherer inhabitants of Eastern Africa. According to linguistic, anthropological and other data, these groups later came under the influence of [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Eastern]] and [[South Cushitic languages|Southern Cushitic]] peoples and adopted [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref name="Aminmoll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mohamed Amin|first=Peter Moll|title=Portraits of Africa|year=1983|publisher=Harvill Press|isbn=0002726394|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2263">The '''capsize screening formula''' (CSF) is a somewhat controversial figure.  It is defined for [[sailboats]] as:

CSF = [[Beam (nautical)|Beam]] / ([[Displacement (fluid)|Displacement]]/64.2)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;

It came into being after the [[1979 Fastnet race]] in England where a storm shredded the race fleet. The [[Cruising Club of America]] (CCA) put together a technical committee that analyzed race boat data. They came up with this formula to compare boats based on readily available data. The CCA characterizes the formula as "rough". 

A lower value is supposed to indicate a [[sailboat]] is less likely to [[capsize]].  A value of 2 is taken as a cutoff for acceptable to certain race committees.  However this is an arbitrary cutoff based on the performance of boats in the [[1979 Fastnet race]].  The CSF does not consider the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] shape or [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] location.

Any two [[sailboats]] will have the same CSF value if their displacement and beam are the same. As an example, one could have a light hull with 50% [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] in a bulb at the bottom of an eight foot fin [[keel]], the other could have a heavy [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] with 20% ballast in a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} full-length [[keel]]. The stability characteristics of the two [[sailboats]] will be drastically different despite the identical CSF value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1829">'''Collocation extraction''' is the task of extracting [[collocation]]s automatically from a [[text corpus|corpus]] using a computer.

Within the area of [[corpus linguistics]], '''collocation''' is defined as a sequence of words or [[terminology|terms]] which [[co-occurrence|co-occur]] more often than would be expected by chance. 'Crystal clear', 'middle management', 'nuclear family', and 'cosmetic surgery' are examples of collocated pairs of words. Some words are often found together because they make up a [[compound noun]], for example 'riding boots' or 'motor cyclist'. 

The traditional method of performing collocation extraction is to find a formula based on the statistical quantities of those words to calculate a score associated to every word pairs. Proposed formulas are [[mutual information]], [[t-test]], [[z test]], [[chi-squared test]] and [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Common areas often exist in [[apartment]]s, [[gated communities]], [[condominium]]s, [[cooperative]]s and [[shopping mall]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=definitions.uslegal.com |title=Landlord Tenant Common Areas Law &amp; Legal Definition |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/l/landlord-tenant-common-areas/ |accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any situation where there is a [[tenancy in common]], all the tenants in common collectively own the common areas, meaning that any one individual owner does not possess more control over the land than any other owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm City of davis web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725173135/http://cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This differs from a '''commons''' or [[common land]], as used in [[England|English]] law, which is owned by one person, but which may be used by a group of persons.

==Case law==
In ''[[Maryland v. Garrison]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] found that police may enter a common area when executing a [[search warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have no difficulty concluding that the officers' entry into the third-floor common area was legal; they carried a warrant for those premises, and they were accompanied by McWebb, who provided the key that they used to open the door giving access to the third-floor common area. If the officers had known, or should have known, that the third floor contained two apartments before they entered the living quarters on the third floor, and thus had been aware of the error in the warrant, they would have been obligated to limit their search to McWebb's apartment." ''[[Maryland v. Garrison]]'', 480 U.S. 79, 87 (1987), found at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/480/79.html Findlaw.com web site].  Accessed May 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Rakas v. Illinois]], 439 U.S. 128 (1978), dissent by Justice [[Byron White]], dissenting, footnote 11, citing ''[[United States v. Matlock]],'' 415 U.S. 164, 169, and 171 n. 7 (1974) ("The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, . . . but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched"), found at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/439/128.html Findlaw.com].  Accessed May 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in ''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'' the US Supreme Court held that "a warrantless entry is valid when based upon the consent of a third party whom the police, at the time of the entry, reasonably believe to possess common authority over the premises, but who in fact does not do so."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'', 497 U.S. 177, 179 (1990), found at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/497/177.html Findlaw.com]. Accessed May 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the court held:
{{quote|a person who permits others to have "joint access or control for most purposes ... assume[s] the risk that [such persons] might permit the common area to be searched."&lt;ref&gt;This also cites ''[[United States v. Matlock]],'' 415 U.S. 164, 171 n. 7 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; 415 U.S., at 171, n. 7; see also ''[[Frazier v.

As the Court's [[assumption of risk|assumption-of-risk]] analysis makes clear, third-party consent limits a person's ability to challenge the reasonableness of the search only because that person voluntarily has relinquished some of his [[expectation of privacy]] by sharing access or control over his property with another person.|&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'', 497 U.S. 177, 194 (1990), found at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/497/177.html Findlaw.com].

==Residence halls==
In [[residence hall]]s of colleges and universities, the common areas are those spaces in a dorm that are for the use of all the student residents.  In order to paint murals, improve with [[Fixture (property law)|fixture]]s, or otherwise change the common area, permission may have to be obtained from the director of residential life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.appstate.edu/files/documents/paintauth.pdf Appalachian State University, Dept. of Housing and Residence Life web site (Boone, NC)]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.  (Pdf document.)  Accessed May 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, there is nothing that a tenant can do if they do not approve of their common area furnishings, decorations, etc. unless it interferes directly with a disability. Anything pertaining to religion or beliefs are all covered under the Fair Housing Law. The only way to control common areas in this regard is if a serious threat was posed. State-run universities do have the authority to prohibit use of common areas should they see fit (whether that be decorating, furnishings, or physical use). For-profit housing can only limit these things to some extent. They cannot legally control every aspect of common area use because of the aforementioned Fair Housing Laws.

==Business spaces==

Common area also applies to organizations such as shopping malls and strip malls, in which multiple businesses operate.&lt;ref name="lawscomre" /&gt; Oftentimes, business parks, malls, and other multi-company facilities will have a common area. This could be any one of the examples listed above or it could take form of a “break room”. These areas are generally centrally located and for everyone’s use within the businesses involved. There can be stipulations on conduct within the common areas as well as availability of the common areas. Businesses may also have common areas within themselves. Typically the businesses with common areas will have their own rules that cater to their business type, policy, and company vision.

==Real estate taxation of common areas==
States vary in how they tax common areas, for real estate tax purposes.  It may depend on whether it is a condo or a co-op.  For example, the [[United States|state]] of [[Arizona]] taxes "residential common areas" in housing developments with a flat tax, but common areas of condominiums and [[golf course]]s are assessed separately.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Department of Revenue, Property Tax Division, Guideline, Residential Common Areas, March 31, 2000, citing Arizona Revised Statutes sections 42-13401 et seq., found at [http://pinalcountyaz.gov/Departments/Assessor/Documents/Downloads/commonareaguide.pdf Pinal County, AZ web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030225/http://www.pinalcountyaz.gov/Departments/Assessor/Documents/Downloads/commonareaguide.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}. (pdf doc).  Accessed May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stipulations with Various Common Area Types==
Dependent upon the common area type (i.e. Business, Residential, State-owned) there are certain precautions one must take with utilizing them. Some require leases, some require contracts, and some only require only “at your word”. 
For example, businesses may share common areas in a store like Black Lion or a store that accepts vendors from multiple backgrounds. It is understood in a lease or contract that they will share space with these different vendors. 
With apartments, there are two different types of common areas you can have. One would be under contract and the other would be under lease. Apartments that rent by the unit (i.e. conventional housing) are signed for by one individual. That one individual legally decides the use of the common area should they ever gain a roommate in the future. If an apartment complex leases by the bedroom, there is a clause or paragraph detailing how the space is to be used equally between all lease holders. 
Lastly, there are state-owned and mandated common areas. Forts and bases, government run facilities, and even jails have common areas. There is no agreement in a lease stating how those areas should be used. 
There are different kinds of common areas and all of them have different rules and stipulations. The all have different legal proceedings should something happen in those areas.

== Loss factor ==
In commercial real estate in the US, a building's '''loss factor''' is the percentage of the building's area shared by tenants or space that are dedicated to the common areas of a building used to calculate the difference between the net (usable) and [[Gross leasable area|gross (billable) areas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Real Estate Investment and Finance|publisher=[[Building Owners and Managers Association]]|location=[[Arnold, Maryland]]|pages=G16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That portion of the space is considered "lost" because it cannot be directly leased and the maintenance and operation costs must be covered by the other rentable areas.&lt;ref name=realdeal&gt;{{cite web|title=How is loss factor calculated?...and more questions answered|url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/how-is-loss-factor-calculated-and-more-questions-answered|work=The Real Deal online|publisher=Korangy Publishing Inc|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''loss factor'' is often confused with [[Load factor (real estate)|load factor]], but the formulas for each term vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Square Footage Terms|url=http://www.buildingareameasurement.com/glossary.htm|publisher=Building Area Measurement LLC|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss factor is calculated as follows:

Loss Factor = (Rentable Area – Usable Area) / Rentable Area

The [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] has established a standard with [[American National Standards Institute]], ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-2010 for measuring floor area and calculating gross leasable area and loss factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Controlled vocabularies''' provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval.  They are used in [[subject indexing]] schemes, [[subject heading]]s, [[thesauri]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204132228/http://www.imresources.fit.qut.edu.au/vocab/ Controlled Vocabularies]  Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090314094707/http://www.fao.org/aims/kos_list_type.htm Controlled Vocabularies]  Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes used in the domain of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry etc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and other forms of [[knowledge organization system]]s. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction.

== In library and information science ==

In [[library and information science]] controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of [[word (linguistics)|word]]s and [[phrase]]s, which are used to [[Tag (metadata)|tag]] units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Warner, [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~i385e/readings/Warner-aTaxonomyPrimer.html A taxonomy primer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fast, Fred Leise and Mike Steckel, [http://boxesandarrows.com/what-is-a-controlled-vocabulary/]&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of [[homographs]], [[synonyms]] and [[polyseme]]s by a [[bijection]] between concepts and authorized terms. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.

For example, in the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/controlled-vocabularies/|title=Controlled Vocabularies  {{!}} Librarians {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms—subject headings in this case—have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (''cockroach'' versus ''Periplaneta americana''), and choices between synonyms (''automobile'' versus ''car''), among other difficult issues.

Choices of authorized terms are based on the principles of ''user warrant'' (what terms users are likely to use), ''literary warrant'' (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and ''structural warrant'' (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).

Controlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of [[homographs]], with qualifiers. For example, the term ''pool'' has to be qualified to refer to either ''swimming pool'' or the game ''pool'' to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept.

There are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.

Historically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not.

For example, the [[Library of Congress Subject Heading]] itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term "[[Hypernym|Broader term]]" and "[[Hyponym|Narrow term]]".

The [[terminology|terms]] are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress system]], [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], and [[Sears Subject Headings|Sears]]. Well known thesauri include the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] and the [[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] Thesaurus.

Choosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue.

Controlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as [[Tag (metadata)|tags]], to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as [[metadata]].

== Indexing languages ==

There are three main types of indexing languages.

* Controlled indexing language – only approved terms can be used by the indexer to describe the document
* [[Natural language]] indexing language – any term from the document in question can be used to describe the document
* Free indexing language – any term (not only from the document) can be used to describe the document

When indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document.

In recent years [[free text search]] as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is ''indexed''). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.

Controlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce [[Relevance (Information Retrieval)|irrelevant]] items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items ([[false positives]]) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of [[natural language]]. Take the English word [[football (word)|''football'']] for example. ''Football'' is the name given to a number of different [[team sport]]s. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is [[Football (soccer)|association football]], which also happens to be called ''[[soccer]]'' in several countries. The word ''football'' is also applied to [[rugby football]] ([[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]), [[American football]], [[Australian rules football]], [[Gaelic football]], and [[Canadian football]]. A search for ''football'' therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated.

Compared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually [[relevance|relevant]] to the search topic).

In some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.

However, a controlled vocabulary search may also lead to unsatisfactory [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question.

This is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer.

Another possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with "football" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless.

On the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination.

Controlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words.

The use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts  or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry.  Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.

Numerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including [[faceted classification]], which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.

==Applications==
Controlled vocabularies, such as the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]],  are an essential component of [[bibliography]], the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in [[library and information science]]. In the 1950s, government agencies  began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) developed by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup [[X.25]] networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first [[full text]] databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.

In large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve [[technical communication]]. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing.  This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in [[technical writing]] and [[knowledge management]], where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a [[document]] or [[organization]] instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.

Web searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a [[Semantic Web]], in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable [[metadata]] scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the [[Dublin Core]] Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for [[Web indexing|indexing web pages]] is [[Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System|PSH]].

It is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web.&lt;ref&gt;Cory Doctorow, [http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm Metacrap].&lt;/ref&gt; To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on [[faceted classification]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Pilgrim, [http://petervandijck.com/xfml/ eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}

Controlled vocabularies of the [[Semantic Web]] define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of "Person", such as the Friend of a Friend ([[FOAF]]) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of [[Schema.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Person |title=The Person vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of [[Schema.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Book |title=The Book vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general publication terms from the [[Dublin Core]] vocabulary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event with the Event vocabulary of [[Schema.org]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Event |title=The Event vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

To use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, [[Microdata (HTML)|HTML5 Microdata]], or [[JSON-LD]] in the markup, or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.

==Activism==

===''Arudou v. Earth Cure''===
[[File:Japanese only sign.jpg|thumb|right|The "Japanese only" sign at the Yunohana Onsen, as it originally appeared in 1999]]
Arudou objected to the policies of three bathhouses in Hokkaido, Japan, in the late 1990s that had posted "No Foreigners" or "Japanese Only" signs on their doors.&lt;ref name= Reconstituting&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Webster | first = Timothy | authorlink = | title = Reconstituting Japanese Law: International Norms and Domestic Litigation | journal = [[Michigan Journal of International Law]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = | publisher = [[University of Michigan Law School]] | date = Fall 2008 | ssrn = 1664639 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arudou led a multinational group of 17 people of various nationalities (United States, Chinese, German, and Japanese) to enter the Yunohana bathhouse in [[Otaru, Hokkaidō|Otaru]]&lt;ref name=Reconstituting/&gt; and test the firmness of the "No Foreigners" policy posted on its door.&lt;ref name="Arudou v. Earth Cure"/&gt;  The group attempted the walk-ins twice.&lt;ref name=Reconstituting/&gt;  Arudou returned to Yunohana in October 2000 for a third time as a naturalized Japanese citizen, but again was refused entry. The manager accepted that Arudou was a Japanese national, but refused him entry on the grounds that his foreign appearance could drive Japanese customers to take their business elsewhere.&lt;ref name="NanporoJournal"/&gt;

Arudou and two co-plaintiffs, Kenneth Lee Sutherland and [[Olaf Karthaus]], in February 2001 sued Earth Cure in district court pleading racial discrimination, and the City of Otaru for violation of the United Nations [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], a treaty which Japan ratified in 1996. On November 11, 2002, the Sapporo District Court ordered Earth Cure to pay the plaintiffs [[Japanese yen|¥]]1 million each (about [[United States dollar|US$]]25,000 in total) in damages.&lt;ref&gt;"THE WORLD; Japanese Court Ruling Favors Foreigners; Bathhouse must pay three men who were denied entry." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

===Other protests===
In 2003, Arudou and several other long-term foreign residents dressed up as seals to protest the granting of an honorary [[jūminhyō]] (residency registration) to [[Tama-chan]], a male [[bearded seal]], in [[Nishi-ku, Yokohama|Nishi Ward]], [[Yokohama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Matsubara | first = Hiroshi | title = Foreigners seek same rights as seal | work = | pages = | newspaper = [[The Japan Times]] | location = Tokyo | date = 2003-02-23 | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/02/23/national/foreigners-seek-same-rights-as-seal/#.VPwOykaQWPU | accessdate = 2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters asserted that if the government could grant jūminhyō to animals and animation characters, as was the case in [[Niiza]] and [[Kasukabe]] Cities, Saitama Prefecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=David |title=Zainichi Korean Identity and Ethnicity |volume=17 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cpuVfSUrGkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=crayon+shin+chan+debito|isbn=0-415-42637-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; then there was no need to deny foreign residents the same. At the time, non-Japanese residents were registered in a separate [[Alien registration in Japan|alien registration system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Asahi Shinbun'', 22 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Arudou participated in a protest against an over-the-counter [[Japanese language|Japanese-language]] publication titled ''[[Kyōgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File – Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007]]'' ''(Secret Files of Foreigners' Crimes)''.&lt;ref name=Biggs&gt;{{cite news | last = Biggs | first = Stuart |author2=Kanoko Matsuyama | title = Japan Store Withdraws `Foreigner Crime File' Magazine | work = | pages = | newspaper = Bloomberg.com | date = 2007-02-07 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=aYcwt1Z7zy_E&amp;refer=japan | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine highlighted alleged crimes committed by foreigners. Arudou, calling the magazine "ignorant propaganda" that "focuses exclusively on the bad things that some foreigners do, but has absolutely nothing about crimes committed by Japanese".&lt;ref name=Ryall&gt;{{cite news | last = Ryall | first = Julian | title = JAPAN: Magazine's focus on crimes by foreigners sparks outrage | newspaper = [[South China Morning Post]] | location = Tokyo | date = 2007-02-07 | url = http://www.scmp.com/article/581109/magazines-focus-crimes-foreigners-sparks-outrage | accessdate = 2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arudou posted a bilingual letter for readers to take to [[FamilyMart]] stores protesting discrimination against non-Japanese residents of Japan.&lt;ref name=Biggs /&gt;

In June 2008, Arudou lodged a complaint with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police that its officers were targeting foreigners as part of a security sweep prior to the [[34th G8 summit]] in [[Tōyako, Hokkaido|Tōyako]], Hokkaido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kyodo | first = | title = G8 Summit 2008: Police questioning 'discriminatory' | work = | pages = | newspaper = [[The Japan Times]] | date = 2008-06-26 | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/06/26/national/police-questioning-discriminatory/ | accessdate = 2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed an incident where Arudou asserted his right under the Police Execution of Duties Law to not need to show identification when requested by a police officer at [[New Chitose Airport]]. After meeting with police representatives at their headquarters, Arudou held a press conference covered by a local television station.&lt;ref&gt;STV News. June 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Arudou—acting as the chair of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing campaign to protest an advertisement by McDonald’s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese.&lt;ref name= Houpt &gt;{{cite news | last = Houpt | first = Simon | title = Dispatches from the World of Media and Advertising | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] (Canada) | pages = B4 | publisher = | date = 2009-08-21 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Japan Times'', Arudou argued that the "Mr. James" campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald’s Japan withdraw the advertisement: "Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a bathrobe and platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich?'"&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{cite news | last = Yang | first = Jeff | title = McRacism in Japan? | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | pages = | location = San Francisco | publisher = | date = 2009-09-02 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2009/09/02/apop090209.DTL | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Coco Masters concluded: "To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring the fact that there really aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Masters | first = Coco | title = Not Everyone Is Lovin' Japan's New McDonald's Mascot | newspaper = [[Time Magazine]] | pages = | location = Tokyo | publisher = | date = 2009-08-25 | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918246,00.html#ixzz1VmeO1liW | accessdate = 2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanologist [[Alex Kerr (Japanologist)|Alex Kerr]] has criticized Arudou for his "openly combative attitude", an approach that Kerr thinks usually "fails" in Japan and may reinforce the conservative belief "that gaijin are difficult to deal with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McNicol | first = Tony | title = Japan sees beginning of change: Tony McNicol talks to 'Dogs &amp; Demons' author Alex Kerr | newspaper = [[The Japan Times]] | pages =  | publisher =  | date = 2005-10-25 | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20051025zg.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090517000824/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20051025zg.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-05-17 | accessdate = 2011-08-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Weiner]] described Arudou as an "outspoken man that rejects the notion that there's one Japanese way of doing anything";&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Naturalized Japanese citizen David Aldwinckle | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1319816 | series = All Things Considered | serieslink = | credits = Anchor: [[Robert Siegel]], Reporter: [[Eric Weiner]] | network = [[NPR|National Public Radio]] | station = [[All Things Considered]] | location = [[Tokyo]] | airdate = 2003-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself as a "loudmouth with an Internet connection".&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;{{cite news | last = Lev | first = Michael A. | title = Crusader-Citizen Takes on Japan | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | pages = | location = Sapporo | publisher = | date = 2003-05-08 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-08/news/0305080196_1_david-aldwinckle-japanese-children-bathhouse | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doug Struck described Arudou as emerging "as the Outraged Man, tilting at uncomfortable truths about Japanese racial discrimination".&lt;ref name=Struck&gt;{{cite news | last = Struck| first = Doug| title = In Japan, U.S. Expat Fights the Yankee Way | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | location = Sapporo | publisher = | date = 2003-07-04 | url = http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/article_7d12b49e-253b-5654-8f03-e7e9def40d57.html | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Murphy described Arudou as "the quintessential indefatigable civil rights campaigner".&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite news | last = Murphy| first = Paul| title = Profile: Crusader of Sapporo shrugs off threats in defiant push for change | newspaper = [[The International Herald Tribune]]/[[Asahi Shimbun]] | pages = 33 | date = 2002-11-23 | url = http://www.debito.org/ihtasahi112302.html | accessdate = 2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleavage of a woman.jpg|thumb|Downblouse view]]
'''Downblouse''' is a form of [[sexual fetishism]] or [[voyeurism]] involving watching a person's [[breast]]s while looking down their dress.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor, ''Sex Slang'', page 51, Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|9781134194926}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may take the form of making [[secret photography|unauthorized photographs]] down the top of a person's [[dress]], [[blouse]] or other garment, capturing an image of their breasts or [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]].

The practice is regarded as a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar in nature to [[upskirt]]ing. With the advent of digital photography and [[camera phone]]s, covert photography of cleavage became popular with some websites becoming dedicated to such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Guerin, ''Smart Policies for Workplace Technologies'', page 215, Nolo, 2013, {{ISBN|9781413318432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anil Aggrawal, ''Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices'', page 134, CRC Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9781420043099}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of American and Australian states and Germany have specific statutes that prohibit such photography.&lt;ref&gt;Lance E Rothenberg, "[http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/49/vol49-5rothenberg.pdf Re-thinking privacy]", ''American University Law Review'', Washington College of Law&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical and legal issues relating to downblouse photography are also that of upskirt photography.

A '''dummy stamp''' is a stamp-like label which is not valid for postal use. Dummy stamps are a form of [[cinderella stamp]] and the two principal types are [[Test stamp|test or training stamps]], used to test postal equipment&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;Sutton, R.J. &amp; K.W.

In the United States the term relates primarily to test and training stamps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary/glbrowse.php?alpha=de Glossary of Terms for the Collector of United States Stamps.]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hs7qVi6x?url=http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary/glbrowse.php?alpha=de |date=2013-07-05 }} [[United States Stamp Society]], 2012.

The term has been in use in the U.K. since at least 1949 when reports of proceedings of the [[Royal Philatelic Society London|Royal Philatelic Society, London]] referred to a display of "dummy stamps" produced in connection with the negotiation of a printing contract for the postage stamps of South Africa.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. LVIII, No. 678, May 1949, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the [[British Philatelic Bulletin]] illustrated printer's sample stamps from the [[Reginald M.

[[File:Dyck lattice D4.svg|thumb|Lattice of the 14 Dyck words of length 8 - ''['' and '']'' interpreted as ''up'' and ''down'']]
In the theory of [[formal languages]] of [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], and [[linguistics]], a '''Dyck word''' is a balanced [[string (computer science)#Formal theory|string]] of square brackets [ and ]. The set of Dyck words forms '''Dyck language'''.

Dyck words and language are named after the mathematician [[Walther von Dyck]]. They have applications in the [[parsing]] of expressions that must have a correctly nested sequence of brackets, such as arithmetic or algebraic expressions. 

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{ [, ] \}&lt;/math&gt; be the alphabet consisting of the symbols [ and ]. Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; denote its [[Kleene closure]].
The '''Dyck language''' is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\{ u \in \Sigma^* \vert \text{ all prefixes of } u \text{ contain no more ]'s than ['s} \text{ and the frequency of ['s in } u \text{ equals the frequency of ]'s}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Context-free grammar ===
It may be helpful to define the Dyck language via a [[context-free grammar]] in some situations.
The Dyck language is generated by the context-free grammar with a single non-terminal {{math|''S''}}, and the production:

: {{math|''S'' → ''ε'' {{pipe}} "[" ''S'' "]" ''S''}}

That is, ''S'' is either the [[empty string]] ({{math|''ε''}}) or is "[", an element of the Dyck language, the matching "]", and an element of the Dyck language.

An alternative context-free grammar for the Dyck language is given by the production:

: {{math|''S'' → ("[" ''S'' "]")&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}

That is, ''S'' is [[Kleene star|zero or more occurrences]] of the combination of "[", an element of the Dyck language, and a matching "]", where multiple elements of the Dyck language on the right side of the production are free to differ from each other.

=== Alternative definition ===
In yet other contexts it may instead be helpful to define the Dyck language by splitting &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; into equivalence classes, as follows.
For any element &lt;math&gt;u \in \Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;| u |&lt;/math&gt;, we define [[partial function]]s &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{insert} : \Sigma^{*} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{delete} : \Sigma^{*} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{insert}(u, j)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with "&lt;math&gt;[]&lt;/math&gt;" inserted into the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th position
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{delete}(u, j)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with "&lt;math&gt;[]&lt;/math&gt;" deleted from the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th position

with the understanding that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{insert}(u, j)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined for &lt;math&gt;j &gt; |u|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{delete}(u, j)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined if &lt;math&gt;j &gt; |u| - 2&lt;/math&gt;. We define an [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; as follows: for elements &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;(a, b) \in R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a sequence of zero or more applications of the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{insert}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{delete}&lt;/math&gt; functions starting with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and ending with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  That the sequence of zero operations is allowed accounts for the [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. [[symmetric relation|Symmetry]] [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the observation that any finite sequence of applications of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{insert}&lt;/math&gt; to a string can be undone with a finite sequence of applications of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{delete}&lt;/math&gt;. [[transitive relation|Transitivity]] is clear from the definition.

The equivalence relation partitions the language &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; into equivalence classes. If we take &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to denote the empty string, then the language corresponding to the equivalence class &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cl}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Dyck language'''.

==Properties==
*The Dyck language is closed under the operation of [[concatenation]].
*By treating &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; as an algebraic [[monoid]] under concatenation we see that the monoid structure transfers onto the [[quotient monoid|quotient]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*} / R&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the '''[[syntactic monoid]] of the Dyck language'''.  The class &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cl}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; will be denoted &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
*The syntactic monoid of the Dyck language is not [[commutative]]:  if &lt;math&gt;u = \operatorname{Cl}([)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v = \operatorname{Cl}(])&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;uv = \operatorname{Cl}([]) = 1 \ne \operatorname{Cl}(][) = vu&lt;/math&gt;.
*With the notation above, &lt;math&gt;uv = 1&lt;/math&gt; but neither &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are invertible in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*} / R&lt;/math&gt;.
*The syntactic monoid of the Dyck language is isomorphic to the [[bicyclic semigroup]] by virtue of the properties of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cl}([)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cl}(])&lt;/math&gt; described above.
*By the [[Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem]], any [[context-free language]] is a homomorphic image of the intersection of some [[regular language]] with a Dyck language on one or more kinds of bracket pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Kambites, Communications in Algebra Volume 37 Issue 1 (2009) 193-208&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Dyck language with two distinct types of brackets can be recognized in the [[complexity class]] [[TC0|&lt;math&gt;TC^{0}&lt;/math&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrington and Corbett, Information Processing Letters 32 (1989) 251-256&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of distinct Dyck words with exactly ''n'' pairs of parentheses is the ''n''-th [[Catalan number]].

==Examples==
We can define an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on the Dyck language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;u,v\in\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;(u,v)\in L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|u| = |v|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; have the same length. This relation partitions the Dyck language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} / L = \mathcal{D}_{0} \cup \mathcal{D}_{2} \cup \mathcal{D}_{4} \cup \ldots = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{n} = \{ u\in\mathcal{D} \mid |u| = n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is empty for odd &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. E.g. there are 14 words in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{8}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. [[[[]]]], [[[][]]], [[[]][]], [[][[]]], [[[]]][], [[][][]], [][[[]]], [[][]][], [[]][[]], [][[][]], [[]][][], [][[]][], [][][[]], [][][][].

Having introduced the Dyck words of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we can introduce a relationship on them. For every &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; we define a relation &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;; for &lt;math&gt;u,v\in\mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;(u,v)\in S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; can be reached from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by a series of '''proper swaps'''. A proper swap in a word &lt;math&gt;u\in\mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; swaps an occurrence of '][' with '[]'.
For each &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; the relation &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; into a [[partially ordered set]]. The relation &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] because an empty sequence of proper swaps takes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. [[transitive relation|Transitivity]] follows because we can extend a sequence of proper swaps that takes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by concatenating it with a sequence of proper swaps that takes &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; forming a sequence that takes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. To see that &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is also [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] we introduce an auxiliary function &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}:\mathcal{D}_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; defined as a sum over all prefixes &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n(u) = \sum_{vw=u} \Big( (\text{count of ['s in } v) - (\text{count of ]'s in } v) \Big)&lt;/math&gt;

The following table illustrates that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Monotonic function|strictly monotonic]] with respect to proper swaps.

{| border="1" class="wikitable"
|+ Strict monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! partial sums of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}(u)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P-1&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || ] || [ || &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || [ || ] || &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! partial sums of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}(u')&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P+1&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Difference of partial sums
| 0 || 2 || 0 || 0
|-
|}

Hence &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}(u') - \sigma_{n}(u) = 2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}(u) &lt; \sigma_{n}(u')&lt;/math&gt; when there is a proper swap that takes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt;. Now if we assume that both &lt;math&gt;(u,v), (v,u)\in S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u\ne v&lt;/math&gt;, then there are non-empty sequences of proper swaps such &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is taken into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa. But then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{n}(u) &lt; \sigma_{n}(v) &lt; \sigma_{n}(u)&lt;/math&gt; which is nonsensical. Therefore, whenever both &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v,u)&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is antisymmetric.

The partial ordered set &lt;math&gt;D_{8}&lt;/math&gt; is shown in the illustration accompanying the introduction if we interpret a [ as going up and ] as going down.

== Generalizations ==

There exist variants of the Dyck language with multiple delimiters, e.g., on the alphabet "(", ")", "[", and "]". The words of such a language are the ones which are well-parenthesized for all delimiters, i.e., one can read the word from left to right, push every opening delimiter on the stack, and whenever we reach a closing delimiter then we must be able to pop the matching opening delimiter from the top of the stack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4453">'''European Union wine growing zones''' are used in the common [[European Union wine regulations]] to [[wine law|regulate]] certain aspects of [[winemaking]]. The zones differ in terms of [[climate]] and examples of what is regulated by wine growing zone are required grape maturity at harvest and allowed levels of [[chaptalisation]]. There are 21 [[List of wine producing countries|wine producing countries]] in the European Union, with 14 of them having significant levels of production. In the 2004-2005 [[vintage]], total European Union wine production was around 184 million [[hectoliter]]s (4.8 billion [[gallon]]s) which accounted for nearly 70% of total worldwide production. Of that total, nearly 55% was classified as [[table wine]] with 4% used in the production of grape-based [[distilled spirits]] such as [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] and [[Cognac]].

The remaining 41% were produced as "quality wine"-wine that produced under one of the quality wine designation in a country's [[appellation]] systems such as [[Germany]]'s [[German wine classification|QmP &amp; QbA classifications]], [[France]]'s ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC), [[Spain]]'s ''[[Denominación de Origen]]'' (DO) and [[Italy]]'s ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) systems. In 1997, the European Union had over 3.4 million [[hectare]] (8.4 million [[acre]]s) planted under [[grape vine|vine]] which accounted for nearly 44% of the world's wine, [[table grape|table]] and [[raisin]] grape production.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 261"&gt;[[Jancis Robinson]] (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 261 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine zones==
The wine growing zones and the [[wine region]]s that belong to them are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:148:0001:0061:EN:PDF Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 of 29 April 2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine - Annex IX: Wine-growing zones]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Zone A (the coldest), comprising [[German wine|Germany]] except [[Baden (wine region)|Baden]], [[Luxembourg wine|Luxembourg]], [[Belgian wine|Belgium]], [[Dutch wine|The Netherlands]], [[Wine from the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the [[Čechy pod Kosířem|Čechy]] region of the [[Czech wine|Czech Republic]] and those countries in northern Europe where commercial winemaking is a very marginal business.
* Zone B, comprising Baden in Germany, [[Austrian wine|Austria]], the [[French wine|French]] regions of [[Alsace wine|Alsace]], [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]], [[Jura wine|Jura]], [[Loire wine|Loire]], [[Moselle wine|Lorraine]] and [[Savoie wine|Savoie]] and parts of the Czech Republic, [[Slovak wine|Slovakia]], [[Slovene wine|Slovenia]] and [[Romanian wine|Romania]].
* Zone C (the warmest), which is subdivided into:
** Zone C I, comprising the French regions of [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], [[Provence wine|Provence]], [[Rhône wine|Rhône]] and [[South West France (wine region)|Sud-Ouest]], some areas in the far north of [[Italian wine|Italy]], some areas in northern [[Spanish wine|Spain]], most of [[Portuguese wine|Portugal]], [[Hungarian wine|Hungary]], and parts of Slovakia and Romania.
** Zone C II, comprising much of [[Languedoc-Roussillon wine|Languedoc-Roussillon]] in France, most of northern and central Italy, most of northern Spain and parts of Slovenia, [[Bulgarian wine|Bulgaria]] and Romania.
** Zone C III a, comprising parts of [[Greek wine|Greece]], [[Cyprus wine|Cyprus]] and Bulgaria.
** Zone C III b, comprising small parts close to the [[Mediterranean]] coast of France and [[Corsica wine|Corsica]], southern Italy and Spain, some parts of Portugal, most of Greece, parts of Cyprus and all of [[Maltese wine|Malta]].

In 2008, the division into zones was slightly changed. Previously, the current zone C I had been divided into two zones, C I a and C I b.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:179:0001:0084:EN:PDF Council Regulation (CE) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine - Annex III: Wine-growing zones]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Family provenance===
Friedrich Ludwig Lindner was born in [[Jelgava|Mitau]], a prosperous midsized town in [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]] which at that time was an increasingly semi-detached territory in the [[History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1764–95)|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].   (Today - 2016 - [[Jelgava|Mitau]], usually known as Jelgava, is in [[Latvia]].)   His father, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ehregott Friedrich Lindner|de}} (1733-1816) was a physician:&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindner, Friedrich Ludwig:  Schriftsteller, Journalist, * 23.10.1772 Mitau, † 11.5.1845 Stuttgart. (lutherisch)|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd117026379.html|author=Konrad Feilchenfeldt |work=[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] |volume=14|date=1985|publisher=[[:de:Duncker &amp; Humblot|Duncker &amp; Humblot]], Leipzig &amp; Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München |page=610 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; his mother, born Henriette Marie Wirth (1744–1807), was the daughter of another physician.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;

===Early years===
He attended school in Mitau before moving on, in 1790, to start his university level education, under the sponsorship of [[Johann Friedrich von Recke]],&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt; at Mitau's Academia Petrina where he studied [[theology]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   In Autumn 1791 he moved on to [[University of Jena|Jena]] where, having enrolled to pursue his study of theology,&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt; in 1792, he switched to [[Medicine]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   One of his fellow medical students at Jena, who became a friend, was [[David Veit]].&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   There were also early literary efforts at this stage which involved the poet [[Sophie Mereau]].   From Jena he moved on to [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] where he found time to start work on a novel entitled "Die Wanderungen und Schicksale des Paters Abilgärd" (''"The wanderings and destinies of Father Abilgärd"'').&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   In 1797 he returned to [[University of Jena|Jena]] where he concluded his studies with a dissertation for which he received his doctorate in medicine.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   In 1800 he worked, briefly, in [[Vienna]] as a physician.&lt;ref name=FLLlautBBH&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lp6o5fFQcvsC&amp;pg=PA642&amp;lpg=PA642|title=Lindner, Friedrich Ludwig|work=Die deutschsprachige Presse: Ein biographisch-bibliographisches Handbuch|author=Bruno Jahn (compiler-editor) |date=30 April 2005 |volume=1: A-L| isbn=3-598-11710-8 |page=642 |publisher=K.G.Sauer, München}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1802 he introduced vaccinations against [[Chickenpox]] in [[Brno]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautBBH/&gt;   At the end of 1803, still from Vienna, he renewed his literary relationship with [[Sophie Mereau]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   Working with [[Joseph Schreyvogel]], during this period he co-edited a weekly newspaper in Vienna called "Das Sonntagsblatt" (''"The Sunday News sheet"'').&lt;ref name=FLLlautBBH/&gt;   He remained in Vienna till the end of 1809.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;

===Middle years===
In 1809 Lindner abandoned his medical work, which he found insufficiently fulfilling&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt; and moved again, traveling via [[Munich]], [[Regensburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Bayreuth]].&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt; He ended up relocating to [[Weimar]], close to Jena where he had studied as a student, and where he now took a writing job with the polymath publisher [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch]].   It was also in 1810 that he visited his uncle, the physician-theologian Gottlob Immanuel Lindner (1734–1818), who had been born (like Lindner's father) in [[Königsberg]], but at this stage lived and worked in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   Here he fell seriously ill, which caused him to stay with his uncle for longer than originally planned:  he was nursed by a widow whose husband had been a French government official.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   It was still 1810 when he married Elise, who had been born at [[Huningue]] (on the southern tip of [[Alsace|Elsaß]], close to [[Basel]]) in 1789, as Elise Reiffinger.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   The marriage was childless but not joyless:  sources indicate that during their later years Elise Lindner became an unusually influential spouse.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;

In 1813, by now living in Jena, with a fresh outbreak of [[Lützow Free Corps|fighting]], Lindner was officially entrusted with the billeting of francophone troops, partly because he had mastered the French language.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   As calm returned to the streets he was rewarded for his hitherto unacknowledged teaching work, when he was given a post as a [[University of Jena|university professor]] of philosophy.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLLlautBBH/&gt;   Although little is known of his attitude to the respective belligerents in the [[Napoleonic Wars|25 year "world war"]] that provided the backdrop for much of his life, it does appear that the successive reverses suffered by [[First French Empire|the French]] as [[Grande Armée|their armies]] were rolled back after [[Battle of Leipzig|October 1813]] left him unmoved.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;   However, in 1814 he surrendered his professorship at Jena and returned initially to Weimar and then, with Elise, moved back to his father's home in Courland.   He stayed and ran his father's affairs till the latter's death in May 1816.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;

===After the war===
In April 1817 Lindner returned to [[Weimar]] where he took on the editorship of a newspaper called the "Oppositionsblatt" (''"Opposition Newspaper"'').   However, the backwash from a "press scandal" caused him to leave Weimar later the same year.   This resulted from an "indiscretion" involving a secret report written by a man called [[August von Kotzebue]].

Von Kotzebue was employed by the [[Alexander I of Russia|Russian Tsar's]] "Foreign Ministry" and provided the Tsar with reports covering developments in politics, literature, economics, finance, education and what was going on more generally at the local university (in Jena).&lt;ref name=TherHube/&gt;   Although he came to be detested by liberals as a "Russian spy" it might be argued that von Kotzebue's reports contained nothing that was not in the public domain, and were no more than any foreign office employee working for any foreign power might have been expected to provide in a period of heightened political nervousness.&lt;ref name=TherHube&gt;{{cite book|work=Therese Huber Briefe (letters) Juli 1815 bis September 1818: 1: Briefe. 2: Erläuterungen|author1= Magdalene Heuser (editor-compiler)|author2=Petra Wulbusch (editor-compiler)|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E7eMdWgreFMC&amp;pg=PA1143&amp;lpg=PA1143|title=Anmerkungern ... 28 (footnote ... 28)|page=1143|publisher=De Gruyter, Berlin|isbn=|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Von Kotzebue and the Tsar were not in sympathy with liberal developments in political thought.   In his report von Kotzebue criticised a newspaper called [[:de:Nemesis (Zeitschrift)|"Nemesis"]].   Lindner happened to live in the same house as a copying clerk employed by von Kotzebue's:&lt;ref name=FLLlautABB/&gt; a copy of the report fell into Lindner's hands and Lindner sent it, accompanied by an anonymous letter, to the editor of "Nemesis", whose name was [[Heinrich Luden]], in order that von Kotzebue's secret report might be published in the publication of which it was critical.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   The efficiency of the censor saw to it that the edition of "Nemesis" containing the report was not widely seen,&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt; but another editor, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwig Wieland|de}} got hold of the document and published it in another (low circulation) newspaper called "Der Volksfreunde" (''The Friend of the People'') in January 1818.&lt;ref name=TherHube/&gt;  The Russian government put pressure on the authorities locally to ensure Lindner's expulsion.&lt;ref name=FLLlautABB/&gt;   (Von Kotzebue became so detested that he, too, had to leave the area, moving to [[Mannheim]] where in 1819 he was assassinated by the theology student, [[Karl Ludwig Sand]].&lt;ref name=WohnhausAvKMA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mannheim.de/tourismus-entdecken/wohnhaus-august-kotzebue|title=Wohnhaus von August von Kotzebue |publisher=Stadt Mannheim|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Lindner now settled for a period in [[Mulhouse]], not far from the town where his wife had been born, but he did not remain in [[Alsace|Elsaß]] for long.&lt;ref name=FLLlaudEF/&gt;  He was able to use his contacts to embark on a new career focused on diplomatic work and journalism.   He participated in the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in September 1818 as a representative of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and of neighbouring [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   In December of the same year he took over the editorship of a publication owned by the wealthy industrialist-publisher [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]], and relocated to Stuttgart.   The publication in question appears to have been shortlived, but in July 1819 he took on another title in von Cotta's collection, the newly founded "Tribüne, Würtemberg. Zeitung für Verfassung und Volkserziehung zur Freiheit" (''"... newspaper for constitutional and popular education towards freedom"'').&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;

As a journalist Lindner showed himself to be a supporter of the new king, [[William I of Württemberg]], even where this sometimes ran counter to the views of his newspaper's proprietor,  [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]].   The most significant outcome of collaboration between Lindner and the king was a document that appeared in 1820 entitled "Manuscript aus Süddeutschland".&lt;ref name=Manuscript&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Mj8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Manuscript+aus+S%C3%BCd-Deutschland&amp;ei=_CtNStvBHIGEzQT_u6XvDw#v=onepage&amp;q=Manuscript%20aus%20S%C3%BCd-Deutschland&amp;f=false|title=Manuscript aus Süd-Deutschland|author=G. Erichson which seems to have been a pseudonym for Friedrich [Georg] Ludwig Lindner|date=1820}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The document advocated some form of alliance between the three or four larger states of southern Germany, together with other significant states in the central regions, in order to provide a more effective counterweight to the might of [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] within in the [[German Confederation]], a pan-German political structure which had emerged in 1815 to fill the vacuum left by the termination in 1806 of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].   The proposal was seen as a move to reinvent the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] which, starting in [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|1805]], had operated under the sponsorship of [[First French Empire|France]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   Among many who held power within the German lands, such ideas were not to be welcomed :  the document was actually published in London.  The proposals in it were powerfully and sometimes violently attacked both within and outside [[German Confederation|Germany]].  The name of its author, G. Erichson, was assumed to be a pseudonym, but the real author's identity was not immediately known, and Lindner himself was accordingly spared the sanctions that would otherwise have fallen upon him.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   The initiative for the publication is indeed believed to have come from the king of Württemberg, but it subsequently became widely believed&lt;ref name=AnsBootIntro/&gt; that the "Manuscript" had actually been written by Friedrich Ludwig Lindner.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Heinrich Elias: Friedrich Ludwig Lindner. Arzt, Geheimrat, Publizist (1772–1845). In: Lebensbilder aus Schwaben und Franken, 15.. Stuttgart 1983, {{ISBN|3-17-008111-X}}, pp. 155–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance in 1824 of a second incendiary publication entitled "Geheime Papiere" (''"Secret Papers"'') proved more demaging since the work was quickly attributed to him despite initial expressions of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=GehPap&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1161177381|title=Geheime Papiere|author=Friedrich Ludwig Lindner|date=1824|work=Some details quoted here refers to a subsequent reissue dated 2010|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10769734_00005.html| publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München (online version)}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Around this time he also became involved in a dispute with a young ambitious delegate to the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention (Bundestag)]] called [[Friedrich von Blittersdorf]].   The upshot of all this was that he was obliged to leave [[Stuttgart]], relocating to [[Augsburg]] in 1825.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;

In May 1827 he moved on to Munich, where he re-established contact with [[Johann Friedrich Cotta|Cotta]] and took on the editorship of the "Politische Annalen", a position that from 1828 he shared with the poet [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   The journal proved relatively short-lived, but a friendship with Heine endured.&lt;ref name=AnsBootIntro&gt;{{cite book|work=The Absolute Boot, or, The Journeyman Cobbler Steeped in Hegel's Philosophy |page=12 |title=Translators' Note |author2=Friedrich Ludwig Lindner|author1=Lawrence G.

He returned to [[Stuttgart]] in 1833, where he was now provided by [[William I of Württemberg|the king]] with a pension.&lt;ref name=FLLlautNDB/&gt;   Relatively little is known of his final years, but he produced several translations as well as a satirical play attacking [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who during his final years had become, in the eyes of some, Prussia's unofficial national philosopher.&lt;ref name=AnsBootIntro/&gt;

&lt;!---
1825 ließ er sich in Augsburg nieder, im Mai 1827 in München, wo er weiterhin in Verbindung mit Cotta die Redaktion der „Politischen Annalen“ innehatte und sich seit 1828 mit →Heinrich Heine in dieses Amt teilte. 1832 erhielt er das bayer. Indigenat und wurde zum bayer. Legationsrat ernannt. Im März desselben Jahres übernahm er die Redaktion der neugegründeten „Bayerischen Staatszeitung“. 1833 kehrte er nach Stuttgart zurück und lebte hier von einer Pension des württ. Königs. Aus dieser letzten Lebensphase stammen Übersetzungsarbeiten und ein satirisches Drama gegen Hegel.

'''Fuyu Kyrgyz''' (''Fuyü Gïrgïs, Fu-Yu Kirgiz''), also known as '''Manchurian Kirghiz''', is the easternmost [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language. Despite its name, it is not a variety of [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] but is closer to [[Khakas language|Khakas]].  The people originated in the Yenisei region of Siberia but were relocated into [[Dzungaria]] by the [[Dzungars]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzG5llo3YCMC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Tchoroev (Chorotegin) 2003], p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pozzi &amp; Janhunen &amp; Weiers 2006, p. 113.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StaryPozzi2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giovanni Stary|author2=Alessandra Pozzi|author3=Juha Antero Janhunen|author4=Michael Weiers|title=Tumen Jalafun Jecen Aku: Manchu Studies in Honour of Giovanni Stary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05378-5|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1761, after the Dzungars were defeated by the Qing, a group of [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] were deported (along with some Öelet or [[Oirat language|Oirat]]-speaking Dzungars) to the [[Nen River|Nonni]] (Nen) river basin in [[Manchuria]]/[[Northeast China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juha Janhunen|title=Manchuria: An Ethnic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfJiAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Oelet|year=1996|publisher=Finno-Ugrian Society|isbn=978-951-9403-84-7|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lFW1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA831#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas |editors= Stephen A. Wurm, Peter Mühlhäusler, Darrell T. Tryon |page= 831 |publisher= de Gruyter|isbn=9783110819724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kyrgyz in Manchuria became known as the Fuyu Kyrgyz, but many have become merged into the Mongol and Chinese population. Chinese and Oirat replaced Oirat and Kirghiz during Manchukuo as the dual languages of the Nonni-based Kyrgyz.&lt;ref name="Janhunen1996 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juha Janhunen|title=Manchuria: An Ethnic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfJiAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Oirat|year=1996|publisher=Finno-Ugrian Society|isbn=978-951-9403-84-7|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fuyu Kyrgyz language is now spoken in northeastern [[China|China's]] [[Heilongjiang]] province, in and around [[Fuyu County, Heilongjiang|Fuyu County]], [[Qiqihar]] (300&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Harbin]]) by a small number of [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]] who are classified as [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sounds==
Although a complete [[phoneme|phonemic]] analysis of Girgis has not been done,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu and Imart have made numerous observations about the sound system in their tentative description of the language. They describe Girgis as having the short [[vowel]]s noted as "a, ï, i, o, ö, u, ü" which correspond roughly to [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[a, ə, ɪ, ɔ, œ, ʊ, ʉ]}}, with minimal rounding and tendency towards centralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vowel length is phonemic and occurs as a result of consonant-deletion (Girgis {{IPA|/pʉːn/}} vs. Kyrgyz {{IPA|/byɡyn/}}). Each short vowel has an equivalent long vowel, with the addition of {{IPA|/e/}}.  Girgis displays [[vowel harmony]] as well as [[consonant harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[consonant]] sounds in Girgis, including [[allophone]] variants, are {{IPA|[p, b, ɸ, β, t, d, ð, k, q, ɡ, h, ʁ, ɣ, s, ʃ, z, ʒ, dʒ, tʃ, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j]}}.  Girgis does not display a phonemic difference between the stop set {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} and {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}; these stops can also be aspirated to {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}} in Chinese loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speakers==
In 1980, Fuyu Girgis was spoken by a majority of adults in a community of around a hundred homes.  However, many adults in the area have switched to speaking a local variety of [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and children have switched to [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] as taught in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hu|Imart|1987|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">A '''graphite lined stamp''' is a [[postage stamp]] on which vertical lines of [[Electrical conductor|electro-conductive]] [[graphite]] are printed on the reverse. Graphite lined stamps were used in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1957 to 1960 as an experiment in the automation of [[mail sorting]].&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17"&gt;"Great Britain" in ''Commonwealth &amp; British Empire Stamps 1840-1970'', [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2008, page GB17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and appearance ==
In the United Kingdom, [[graphite]] lines were used exclusively on five stamps of the [[Wilding series]] from December 1957.&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17"/&gt; They appear as one or two black lines printed vertically under the gum.&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17"/&gt; The two lined stamps were to identify ''fully paid'' mail, which eventually became ''first class'' mail, while stamps with only one line paid the ''printed matter'' rate, or ''second class'' mail as it eventually became. On the two lined stamps, the bands are usually found widely spaced so that one appears at either side of the stamp, but they may also be found close together due to printing errors on the one and a half pence stamp.&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17"/&gt; Several other errors of misplaced graphite lines are also known and not all are included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;The 2003 Catalogue of Queen Elizabeth II British Postage Stamp Errors, Tom Pierron, Bacchic Multimedia, 2003. pp.285-288. {{ISBN|0-9544501-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of graphite lines was developed by British Post Office scientists in conjunction with the stamp printers [[Harrison &amp; Sons]] of High Wycombe and the stamps were first used in an experimental machine at [[Southampton]]. The machine used scanners to detect the graphite lines and to ''face'' the letters so that the stamp was always in the top right corner. The machine could also sort the letters according to the number of graphite lines on the stamps so that fully paid and printed matter stamps were separated. The machine then cancelled the letters. This was the first time that this had been done automatically.&lt;ref&gt;"The Realm of Stamps" by Montor in ''The Canadian Philatelist'', Vol.8, No.6, Nov-Dec 1957, p.8. [http://www.rpsc.org/CP_scans/Canadian%20Philatelist,%20Vol.%208.%20No.%206,%20November-December,%201957.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 1959, graphite lined stamps were issued with [[phosphor banded stamp|phosphor band]]s printed on the front of the stamp.&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17-18"&gt;"Great Britain" in ''Commonwealth &amp; British Empire Stamps 1840-1970'', [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2008, page GB17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, graphite band marking was superseded by the use of phosphor band marking which was a more effective form of mail sorting and only phosphor bands remained on Wilding stamps after {{#dateformat:22 June 1960}}.&lt;ref name="SGCBES pGB17-18"/&gt;

== Graphite ==
The term ''graphite'' refers to the substance ''Naphthadag'' or ''Deflocculated Acheson's Graphite'' &lt;ref&gt;''Philatelic Terms Illustrated'', James Mackay, Stanley Gibbons, London, 4th edition, 2003, p.63. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was graphite in a solution of ''naphtha''. This graphite substance went under the brand name ''dag'' which was a registered trademark of Acheson Colloids Ltd. The substance is still a product of the firm today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=527337 Registered trademark ''dag''. UK Intellectual Property Office. Retrieved 31 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forgeries ==
Graphite lined stamps have become very collectable and often command high prices. This has attracted forgers, however, most forgeries are easily identified by comparison with a genuine stamp. Crucially, on the genuine stamps the lines appear ''underneath'' the gum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18253">'''Hyperkino''' is a standardized system of referencing and [[Annotation|annotating]] films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The name of the method, Hyperkino, is based on the intertwining of the concepts of [[textual criticism]] and [[hypertext]].

== From Theory to Practice ==
Hyperkino was developed by [[Natascha Drubek]] and Nikolai Izvolov between 2005 and 2008:&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of textus and apparatus cf. Michal Kosák, K podobě komentáře: nad filmovou sérií Hyperkino. Slovo a smysl, 10, 2013, č. 20, p. 314-317. http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/499&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have connected the traditional principles of annotation with digital technologies and their markup languages, applying hypermedia principles of commentary to the linear medium of film. HYPERKINO annotations of a film are comparable to the [[footnotes]] and the commentary in historical-critical editions of texts, with the only difference being that they are {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} various media forms (text, sound, pictures). […] The tradition of scholarly editions provides sophisticated ways of preserving texts over centuries, keeping them alive in constantly evolving receptions and commentaries. The idea of indexing a text, turning it into a network of interrelations and linking it with other texts, goes back to the tradition of editing scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperkino.net/hyperkino/What-is-HYPERKINO|title=What is HYPERKINO / hyperkino / convergence - Website Interface|last=Systems|first=eZ|website=hyperkino.net|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Digital humanities scholar Christian Gosvig Olesen stresses the importance of the analytical and theoretical phase preceding practical steps towards developing and designing the Hyperkino method: “In 2006 Drubek and Izvolov penned an article together that formulated this vision, Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats, which was published in the eighth edition of the international film studies review Cinema &amp; Cie.&lt;ref&gt;“Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats”, Cinema &amp; Cie (autumn 2006). A second English edition appeared in Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema, Volume 2, 2008, Issue 2, 205-216. The method was first described in the 2005 Russian original of the article: Natascha Drubek-Meyer/ Nikolaj Izvolov: “Kommentirovannoe izdanie fil’mov na DVD: neobchodimost’ naučnych standartov”. In: Kinovedcheskie zapiski 72, 2005, p. 372-383.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 2006.”

He characterizes Hyperkino as a philological reaction to audio commentaries which were the early and most popular forms of extras on DVDs: &lt;blockquote&gt;The article departed from a critique of current presentations in academic and contextualizing analyses of films on DVD to conceptualize a new way of DVD editorship relying on annotations and a more extensive and effective use of the hyperlinked structure of the DVD format. One of the points of critique was that existing DVD editions much too often overburdened the works in question […] Drubek and Izvolov instead advocated for a use of annotations which could appear in conjunction with the film but also exist independently of it. As the basis of this proposition they proposed a distinction between the film in itself as textus, which should be able to stand alone and be viewed independently of an analytical interpretive layer, and on the other hand an apparatus including all that which is not part of the filmic text itself: notes on the film’s historical context, script, stills or for example correspondences or business documents related to the film’s production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmhistoryinthemaking.com/2013/08/10/what-is-hyperkino-ruscicos-academia-dvd-series-and-the-historical-critical-film-edition/|title=What Is Hyperkino? Ruscico’s Academia DVD series and the historical-critical film edition|last=Olesen|first=Christian Gosvig|date=2013-08-10|website=Film History in the Making|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hyperkino commentaries were made possible by the DVD format, introduced in 1996. In the ten years of its existence this format had produced several noteworthy audio commentaries by either filmmakers or scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterbosma.info/?p=blog&amp;blog=30|title=Hyperkino. Een dvd met voetnoten (2010)|last=Bosma|first=Peter|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it hardly had contributed to creating a standard of critical editions of films on digital carriers. In the academic environment of film studies the digital representation of film seemed to usher in a welcome convergence of film and writing on film. Digital technologies offered an option to explore the old medium of film from a new angle. The idea of a scholarly digital edition of a film surfaced several years after the first “Deluxe” editions of films with “deleted scenes” and other DVD extras were published. Scholarly interest in the DVD was driven by the requirement to have a stable “textus” which could be the basis of citations. In addition, film analysis asked for tools to annotate shots or even single frames in a film without destroying the cinematic text itself by intrusive modifications such as inserting talking heads or acousmatic voices of commentators.
From this perspective Hyperkino was an exercise in understatement compared to other DVD extras. Its principle was a hidden annotation linked to the film frame marked by a minimal sign, usually a number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clicking the number leads the viewer onto an off-screen commentary text section. “These sections we call 'footnotes' for the film. The main difference to current DVD commentaries is the presentation of scholarly research: It happens not in an audio but in a written format which makes the commentary quotable. Every HYPERKINO DVD edition is tantamount to an introductory article about the film published. The film and texts about the film merge on the digital carrier.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/48480_en.html|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Final Activity Report Summary - HYFIP (Hypertextual Film Presentation. Designing Digital Editions for the European Cinematographic Heritage)|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperkino DVDs ==
As a commercially available DVD format Hyperkino materialized itself three years after the programmatic article by Drubek and Izvolov. In 2008 Drubek produced a Hyperkino DVD in Berlin and Prague, publishing Nikolai Izvolov’s reconstruction of [[Lev Kuleshov]]’s until then unpublished first film: ''Proekt inzhenera Praita''.

Gosvig Olesen writes: “First in the fold of the German DVD publisher Absolutmedien and later as the series KinoAcademia published by RUSCICO. The film to launch the format was Lev Kuleshov’s debut feature Proekt inzhenera Prayta (Engineer Prite’s Project), USSR, 1918). Not only was it the first time the film was made available digitally, it had also, as pointed out by film historian Kristin Thompson, for a long time only existed in a version without intertitles, which left the impression that the film was incomplete.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hyperkino editions emphasize the importance of incorporating different versions of the film. Two versions can be found on the German DVD of Engineer Prite’s Project allowing to compare the fragmented film as it lies in Gosfilmofond without intertitles with Izvolov’s 2001 reconstruction of the film which incorporated textual material from a surviving original libretto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinando.com/en/Film/engineer_prites_project_59063/Detail|title=ENGINEER PRITE'S PROJECT|website=cinando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD contains the TV documentary The Kuleshov Effect (USSR, 1969) by Semyon Raitburt (ЭФФЕКТ КУЛЕШОВА, 1969, Семён Райтбурт). The Hyperkino “footnotes” quote from interviews with Kuleshov and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].

In the following years around a dozen of Hyperkino DVDs were released by the Russian publisher RUSCICO under the series title “Kino Academia” containing the annotations of international film scholars specializing in Russian and Soviet film:  Aleksandr Deriabin, Natascha Drubek, Bernard Eisenschitz, Jeremy Hicks, Nikolai Izvolov, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Milena Musina, Sergei Kapterev, Natalia Riabchikova, and Yuri Tsivian. Not all of the initially announced DVDs have been published yet, due to the high production costs.

In line with the aims described in Drubek’s and Izvolov’s 2005 article, every Hyperkino DVD edition consists of a textus and an apparatus. The apparatus in Hyperkino editions consists of alternative versions and “footnotes” connected to the film. Footnote numbers on all Hyperkino DVDs appear during playback in the upper right corner of the frame. In the RUSCICO editions the textus is on disc 1 (language versions) and the apparatus on disc 2 (film without language versions but with Hyperkino footnotes).

== Awards ==
In 2010 at the Bologna festival Il Cinema Ritrovato three Hyperkino titles were awarded with the  “DVD Awards 2010, VII edition. Best Special Features (Bonus) for their innovative handling of printed and illustrated commentaries”. The three DVDs were:
* THE GREAT CONSOLER (Russia/1933) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Ekaterina Khokhlova
* ENGINEER PRITE’S PROJECT (Russia/1918) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by N. Drubek-Meyer / Nikolai Izvolov
* OCTOBER (Russia/1927) by Sergey Eisenstein, Grigori Aleksandrov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Yuri Tsivian
In the same year Hyperkino received another award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics and Scholars, the “Elephant 2010” (Kinovedenie i kinokritika v elektronnych SMI, novye technologii).

== Reviews and Reactions ==
“The idea of Hyperkino is a sensational breakthrough: imagine what a potential is looming here!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his article "The Mosaic Approach. In defense of a nonlinear film criticism" Jonathan Rosenbaum describes Hyperkino as "a hybrid form—existing somewhere between reading and watching, like various computer-related activities—is part of what seems forward-looking about them […] What all these forms of criticism suggest is not merely a less linear way of approaching film experience but also a more interactive methodology. The fact that movies are being seen more and more often away from public theaters shouldn't necessarily mean that the way we all experience them and share our experiences is any less social. Perhaps it's more pertinent to note that the very forms of our social interactions in relation to films are changing as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-mosaic-approach-20100818|title=The Mosaic Approach by  Jonathan Rosenbaum - Moving Image Source|website=www.movingimagesource.us|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Graffy discusses Hyperkino from the perspective of the “commentarist”: “Engaging with the Hyperkino commentaries leads to thoughts about the fundamental differences between a spoken commentary, the only version most viewers will so far have encountered, and the (predominantly written) Hyperkino approach.” Graffy mentions the time factor which challenged the performance of audio commentators: “bottlenecks, where too much is happening at once for you to cover all you want to say; and longueurs, where you wonder how to fill the space, or worry about extended periods of silence. […] None of these problems exists, of course, for the Hyperkino commentarist – he or she is not time-bound, and the notes can be as short or as long as required. They can also be more scholarly – the notes on Strike especially are full of references to sources both printed and archival – indicating to the scholar/student viewer where to do further research. And, above all, they have the advantage of hybridity, which is why the Hyperkino notes are more than just a book on screen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graffy|first=Julian|year=2010|title=[Hyperkino] DVD Reviews|url=|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|volume=4|issue=3|pages=345–354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 film critic and media scholar Joachim Schätz called the Hyperkino publication of the Kuleshov debut a "mediated revolution" (“vermittelte Revolution”)  and Hyperkino "one of the most exciting forms of reflection on film one can experience today."

[[File:Johann Ernst von Hanxleden.jpg|right|thumb|Arnos Paathiri]]
'''Johann Ernst Hanxleden''' (1681-1732), famously known as '''Arnos Paathiri''' was a German [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priesthood|priest]], missionary in [[India]] and a [[Malayalam]]/[[Sanskrit]] poet, [[Philologist|grammarian]], [[lexicographer]], and [[philologist]].

==Early life==
Hanxleden was born at [[Ostercappeln]], near [[Osnabrück]], in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany in 1681. After doing philosophical studies in his home town, Osnabruck, Hanxleden volunteered for service in [[India]]. Together with the Jesuits Wilhelm Weber and Wilhelm Meyr, and a doctor, Franz Kaspar Schillinger (who left us an account of the perilous voyage), he set forth (30 October 1699) on a long arduous overland journey to [[India]], travelling through Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Armenia]], and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], and set foot in [[India]] at [[Surat]] (in contemporary Gujarat) on 13 December 1700. During the journey Hanxleden was formally accepted as a member of the [[Society of Jesus]]. Weber and Meyr had died at sea, before reaching [[Surat]]. Left alone, Hanxleden proceeded to [[Goa]] where there was a large community of [[Jesuits]].

==In India==
After completing his spiritual formation ([[Novitiate]]) in Goa, Hanxleden was sent to the [[Jesuit]] Seminary at Sampaloor in Thrissur District, Kerala, S. India.  The remains of the seminary where he did his priestly studies in Sampallor and the church still kept as a historical monument at St. Francis Xavier's church sampaloor.  The word Sampallor has got its origin from 'san-paul-ur', means land of St. Paul. It was the Jesuit priests who have given this name to this land which was formerly called as Ambalakad to commemorate St. Paul the Apostle of Jesus who travelled at length from middle East to the western Europe to preach the Gospel.  It is also assumed that Jesuits had great reverence to Pope Paul III who approved the Plan of St. Ignatius of Lyola to form a congregation by name "Society of Jesus"in 1540 by the bull "Formula of the Institute".

It is in St. Paul's Seminary in Sampalloor, Hanxleden did his Theological studies;the immediate preparation to receive priesthood. He took time also to initiate himself to the local language, [[Malayalam]] and more importantly even to the [[liturgical]] language of the [[Thomas Christians]] of [[Kerala]], the [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. He was ordained priest in 1706. In addition to his mother tongue German, and his mastery of [[Malayalam]], Hanxleden also had a good command over [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

He moved to [[Palayoor]] and after surmounting several formidable barriers, learnt [[Sanskrit]] too and improved his [[Malayalam]] from two [[Namboothiri]] [[Brahmins]], Kunjan and Sankaran from [[Angamaly]], who were students in the [[Thrissur]] [[Sanskrit]] School. From 1707 to 1711 Hanxleden served as secretary to John Ribeiro who was [[Archbishop]] of [[Cranganore]]. During this time he travel led the length and breadth of [[Kerala]] on various tasks such as preaching and [[Catechesis]]. It is recorded that he served as the vicar of the main church in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]].

Hanxleden moved to [[Velur, Thrissur]], a small village near [[Thrissur]] District in 1712 and built a church there. This would be his abode for most of his remaining life. Ernest wrote ''Puthen Pana'' based on the [[New Testament]], sitting by the well of [[Pazhuvil]] Forane church. From 1729 onwards, he lived at Sampallor, and [[Palayoor]]. He died on 20 March 1732 at [[Pazhuvil]] of a snake-bite, and was buried there in the church. Later a memorial was built outside the church, and his mortal remains were removed to it. To maintain his memory a historical museum has also been started.

==Poetic and religious writings==
* ''[[Puthen Pana]]''
The ''Puththenpaana'', a Malayalam epic on the life of Christ, is his most celebrated poem. This is one of the earliest poems written in simple Malayalam. It has been an inalienable part of Christian (not restricted to [[Catholic]]) life in Kerala since the time of its composition; its ''paadham''s are sung in a characteristic manner in Christian households on various solemn occasions, the most notable ones being [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], and other days of [[Holy Week]] and [[Lent]] and evenings preceding funerals.

The poem consists of fourteen ''Paadhams''; the couplets are written in the ''Sarppini'' ''Vruththam'', except for those in the twelfth ''Paadham'', which are in the ''Nathonnatha'' metre. The twelfth ''Paadham'' on the lament of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] at the [[crucifixion]] and death of Jesus is the heart of the poem. Other important ''Paadham''s are concerned with the [[The Fall of Man|Fall of Man]] (second), the [[Annunciation]] (fourth), the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] (fifth), the [[Sermon on the Mount]] (seventh), the [[The Last Supper|Last Supper]] (tenth), the trial and [[Crucifixion]] (eleventh), the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] (thirteenth), and the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] (fourteenth). The first ''paadham'' has the poet telling us that he is writing the poem at the request of Antonio Pimental, Archbishop of Cranganore since Pimental held the ecclesiastical office from 1721 to 1752, the poem was composed some time during the period 1721–1732.

* ''Chathuranthyam'' 
The ''Chathuranthyam'' is a mystic poem on the four ends of man: ''Maranam'', ''Vidhi'', ''Moksham'' and ''Narakam'' parts of the poem are sung on occasions similar to the ''Puththenpaana'' recitals. While his poems are written works, they also have a strong [[oral tradition]]; many pious Christians retain his poetical works in their minds and are able to recite it by heart.

==Legacy==
Hanxleden was the first to compile a [[Malayalam]] [[Dictionary]]. His [[lexicon]] describes [[Malayalam]] words in both [[Sanskrit]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. He also wrote a short and succinct [[grammar]] for the [[Malayalam]] language. Hanxleden and his predecessor, [[Heinrich Roth]], were the pioneering European [[Sanskrit]] scholars, he was the first European to write a [[Sanskrit]] grammar ''Grammatica grandonica'' and also the first European to compose Sanskrit [[Poetry|verse]].&lt;ref&gt;His Sanskrit Grammar was released in Belgium on 13 April 2013. See http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-14/india/38528267_1_sanskrit-snake-bite-missionary&lt;/ref&gt; His Velur home, and the church he built are preserved as historical monuments. Among various exhibits at the museum are the bed used by Hanxleden and the ''[[Chaturanga|chathurangam]]'' (which Hanxleden used to play) columns marked on the floor of his home. [[Mar Francis Vazhapilly]], [[Metropolitan Archbishop of Thrissur]] from 1921 to 1942, used to stay at the [[St. Francis Xavier Forane Church, Velur|Velur Forane Church]] for a few days during [[Lent]] so that he could sleep on the bed used by Arnos Paathiri and drink from the well dug during his times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lars Johan Wictor Gyllensten''' (12 November 1921 – 25 May 2006) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] author and physician, and a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], which has the aim of furthering the "purity, vigour and majesty" of the [[Swedish language]] and selects the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] each year.

Gyllensten was born and grew up in a middle-class family in [[Stockholm]], son of Carl Gyllensten and Ingrid Rangström, and nephew of [[Ture Rangström]]. He studied at the [[Karolinska Institute]], becoming a doctor of medicine in 1953, and was an associate professor of [[histology]] there from 1955 to 1973.

His first written work, published under the pseudonym Jan Wictor in 1946, was a collection of poetry by Gyllensten and [[Torgny Greitz]] entitled ''Camera Obscura'', a straight-faced parody of Swedish [[modernist]] 1940s poetry. The Swedish Academy biography refers to his "dialectic" prose trilogy ''Moderna myter'' ("Modern myths", 1949), ''Det blå skeppet'' ("The blue ship", 1950) och ''Barnabok'' ("Childbook", 1952) as the "real" beginning of his authorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/ledamotsregisternew/lars-johan-wiktor-gyllensten "Stol nr 14 – Lars Gyllensten"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112202148/http://www.svenskaakademien.se/akademien/ledamotsregisternew/lars-johan-wiktor-gyllensten |date=12 November 2013 }}, the [http://www.svenskaakademien.se Swedish academy website]. Accessed 12 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His last work was published in 2004. He left the Karolinska Institute to become a full-time author in 1973. He has been described as a Swedish counterpart to [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Albert Camus]]. Few of his works have been translated into English, French or German.

He became a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1966, was permanent secretary of the Academy from 1977 to 1986, served on the Swedish Academy's Nobel Prize committee from 1968 to 1987, became a member of the [[Nobel Foundation]] in 1979 (serving as chairman from 1987 to 1993), and was an honorary member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]].

Gyllensten left the Swedish Academy in 1989 as a result of its failure to support [[Salman Rushdie]] following the [[fatwa]] calling for Rushdie's death because of his controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''. According to the rules of the Academy, Gyllensten remained a passive member for the remainder of his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="812">A '''legal constitution''' is a constitution where the judiciary form the greatest check upon the use of executive power. A legal constitution can be contrasted with a [[political constitution]] where political accountability is the greatest method of controlling government. In a legal constitution, methods of official review and the striking down of unconstitutional legislation may be used in order to control government power. A move from a political to a legal constitution has been noted in the United Kingdom after the passing of the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningmatters.co.uk/sampleChapters/pdfs/1846410274.pdf 10157_02_CH01.QXD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Li Europan lingues''''' is a quotation in [[Occidental language|Occidental]], an [[international auxiliary language]] devised by [[Edgar von Wahl]] in 
1922. It is used in some [[HTML]] [[Web template|template]]s as a fill-in or [[Filler text|placeholder]] text.  

One of the most common placeholder texts is [[lorem ipsum]]. A similar text of this type is the [[pangram]] ''[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]'', which is often used in fill-in text and to demonstrate and compare [[typeface]]s because it contains all 26 letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].

==Text==

When used as placeholder text, ''Li Europan lingues'' is usually one or two paragraphs and reads as follows:

:''Li Europan lingues es membres del sam familie. Lor separat existentie es un myth. Por scientie, musica, sport etc, litot Europa usa li sam vocabular. Li lingues differe solmen in li grammatica, li pronunciation e li plu commun vocabules. Omnicos directe al desirabilite de un nov lingua franca: On refusa continuar payar custosi traductores.''

:''At solmen va esser necessi far uniform grammatica, pronunciation e plu commun paroles. Ma quande lingues coalesce, li grammatica del resultant lingue es plu simplic e regulari quam ti del coalescent lingues. Li nov lingua franca va esser plu simplic e regulari quam li existent Europan lingues. It va esser tam simplic quam Occidental in fact, it va esser Occidental. A un Angleso it va semblar un simplificat Angles, quam un skeptic Cambridge amico dit me que Occidental es.''

;English translation:

:''The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.''

:''To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me that Occidental is.''

==History and discovery of ''Li Europan lingues'' text==

The text of ''Li Europan lingues'' is found in many HTML templates and through copying and uploading of templates this phrase seems to have found its use in many websites.

[[Don Harlow]] posted a message to the Auxlang List on 5 August 2006, mentioning its appearance in the "[[CSS Cookbook]]" from [[O'Reilly]] by [[Christopher Schmitt]], and in templates of webpages which implement [[CSS]]. [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0608a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=7343]

[[Don Gasper]] posted another message to the same list suggesting a possible source:
:I have a theory, but it is only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, who later adopted the name [[Charles Sprague (linguist)|Charles Sprague]] and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the "[[Financial Times]]" in London. I think in the newspaper press. It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, I never asked him about this when I got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.

William Patterson was pleasantly surprised that evening to read about the appearance of [http://www.kafejo.com/misc/lorem.htm his version] of ''Lorem ipsum'' in the "CSS Cookbook" and quickly confessed. In June 1998, at a time when he was dabbling in Occidental, he had come across the ''Lorem ipsum'' text somewhere and learned about its use as a template. As was his wont when learning something new like that, he created a webpage about it. But while warning about the existence of "corrupt" versions, he offered one himself which included some Occidental text, a dash of [[Esperanto]], some variations of his given name, and a little bit of nonsense. In September 2002 he came across a copy of his version on the Web. Curious, he searched for other instances, and found that on 10 September 2002, an [[AllTheWeb]] search for the strings "ulliam" and "willum" returned 513 hits; by 10 December 2002, 962; and by 14 October 2003, 2337. (One page which he found particularly amusing was a Swedish translation of his own webpage&amp;mdash; Occidental, commentary, page colors, page title ''"Ailanto : Lorem ipsum"'' and all!) And now it's in the "CSS Cookbook"!

An HTML comment in the page that started it all attributes the Occidental text itself to [[S. W. Beer]].

The '''London International Awards''', or '''LIA''' (formerly known as '''London International Advertising Awards''',''' LIAA'''), are a worldwide awards annually honoring "pioneers, and embodiments of excellence" in advertising, digital media, production, design, music &amp; sound and branded entertainment. It was the first truly international advertising award of its kind to acknowledge all media and methods from all over the world to be judged by a diverse global jury.&lt;ref name="AdNews"&gt;[http://www.adnews.com.au/awards/london-international-awards "AdNews: London International Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Awards, founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy, began by celebrating advertising in the realms of cinema, television, print, and radio internationally, evolving since its inception into 22 unique media types: Ambient, Billboard, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health &amp; Wellness, Health &amp; Wellness - Craft, Integration, Medical, Medical - Craft, Music &amp; Sound, Music Video, Non-Traditional, Package Design, Poster, Print, Production &amp; Post-Production, Radio &amp; Audio, Social Influencers, The NEW, Television/Cinema/Online Film and Verbal Identity.&lt;ref name="Categories"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/ "2017 Categories"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the word "Advertising" was removed from the competition's name to reflect the fact that it observes more than just "advertising" in an ever-changing industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyFour"&gt;London International Awards 2004 Winners &amp; Finalists Annual, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, LIA, along with creative Faris Yakob, developed "The NEW,"&lt;ref name="Digital"&gt;Pont, Simon (2013). ''Digital State: How the Internet is Changing Everything''. Kogan Page, {{ISBN|978-0749468866}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medium that takes notice of new ''kinds'' of ideas rather than merely new ideas, for works that demonstrate concepts that don't fit comfortably among the standard media divisions, with a focus in fields of technology.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

In 2014, LIA added Branded Entertainment as a medium. The judging category, first chaired by Jimmy Smith of Amusement Park Entertainment, awards "creativity and the power of the idea across films, television programming, live events, audio, gaming and music videos that engage consumers by entertaining them, rather than through traditional advertising."&lt;ref name="Branded"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-the-inaugural-branded-entertainment-competition-led-by-jimmy-smith-amusement-park-entertainment/ "LIA Announces the Inaugural Branded Entertainment Competition Led by Jimmy Smith, Amusement Park Entertainment"] Press Release, May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, LIA introduced a medium called [[Verbal Identity]],&lt;ref name="LBBVerbal"&gt;[https://lbbonline.com/news/lia-becomes-first-awards-festival-to-introduce-verbal-identity-category/ "LIA Becomes First Awards Festival to Introduce ‘Verbal Identity’ Category"]&lt;/ref&gt; centered on "the long-term verbal assets" of a brand, with sub-categories devoted to naming, taglines, copywriting and tone of voice.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

New developments for 2017 include the addition of a Health &amp; Pharma competition in response to a "large number of requests from creatives";&lt;ref name="HealthPharma"&gt;[https://www.adgully.com/lia-2017-adds-health-pharma-jeremy-perrott-to-chair-inaugural-juries-71201.html "LIA 2017 adds Health &amp; Pharma; Jeremy Perrott to Chair inaugural Juries"]&lt;/ref&gt; a Social Influencers medium "based on Creativity and Engagement",&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/the-influencer-awards/ "Social Influencers"]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Chinese Creativity Show featuring a unique red statue and executed through a first round of judging in [[China]] and a final judging session simultaneous with the annual LIA Judging.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/InBrief/45/12/13293.html "LIA Chinese Creativity Show to recognize works in Chinese"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIAChina"&gt;[http://www.liachina.com/ "LIA China"]&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Judging|Judging]])

[[File:London International Awards Grand LIA Statue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The statue for the Grand LIA award|Grand LIA Award]]
LIA is one of the largest and most comprehensive awards programs in its field.

As of 2017, the thirteen LIA Jury panels, each one headed by a Jury President, are composed of nearly 100 experienced members of agencies, production companies, design houses, and technology companies. These panels decide on the Gold, Silver and Bronze Statue Winners, as well as the finalists, with each Jury given the non-compulsory opportunity to award a '''Grand LIA''' to a piece of work that has achieved a Gold statue. The judging process is unique in that each Juror sees every piece of work entered within the medium/media that he or she is required to judge.&lt;ref name="2014 Jury Comments"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/jury-comments/2014/ "2014 Archives | LIA Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; Judging is held annually in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] over a 7-to-10-day period in late September/early October.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/ "Key Dates"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
[[File:London International Awards Gold Statue.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The statue for the Gold LIA award|Gold LIA Award]]
For 26 years, LIA held its one-night awards ceremony in London. In 2012, it was decided to allocate the budget for the ceremony in favor of bringing a small group of young International Creatives from around the world together to share their experiences and to discuss the future of advertising, design, production, brand-building and the overall state of the creative global markets.&lt;ref name="PressCreate"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/press/press_archive/press_article.cfm?press_id=370&amp;start=51 "LIA 2012 Judging and Inaugural Creative Conversations"] Press Release, October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Creative LIAisons|Creative LIAisons]])

In 1985, LIA commissioned a British art student named Mary Griffiths to design the LIA statue. The 17" LIA statue is a winged figure that is hand cast in metal prior to a gold, silver, bronze, or black plating (for Grand LIA winners). It stands on a custom black nickel finished base with an engraved plate displaying the year, medium, category, client/brand and the recipient's name and location.&lt;ref name="Statue"&gt;[http://www.rsowens.com/m/Galleries/PrestigeAward "London International Award"] R.S. Owens, Prestige Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in 2010, the same year as the Awards' 25th Anniversary,&lt;ref name="Shoot"&gt;[https://www.shootonline.com/spw/45070 "London International Awards Honours Network of the Year Agency of the Year Production Company of the Year"] Shoot Publicity Wire, November 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; LIA awarded global '''Network of the Year''', '''Agency of the Year''', and '''Production Company of the Year''' designations. Subsequently, in 2011, LIA added '''Post-Production Company of the Year'''.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;[http://www.themill.com/awards "Awards - The Mill"] The Mill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design Company of the Year,''' '''Independent Agency of the Year,''' '''Music &amp; Sound Company of the Year''' and '''Radio &amp; Audio Company of the Year''' have also been recognized in recent years.&lt;ref name="Winners&amp;Finalists"&gt;[http://2016.liaentries.com/winners/ "Winners &amp; Finalists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, LIA gave a [[one-off]] award sponsored by [[JetBlue]] to filmmaker  [[Morgan Spurlock|Morgan Spurlock's]] ''[[POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'', dubbed "The Greatest Award Ever Sold" for its analysis of product placement and the inner workings of the ad industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEleven"&gt;London International Awards 2011 26th Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, LIA added '''Regional 'Of the Year'''' Awards to [[Australia]] / [[New Zealand]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], the [[Middle East]] / [[Africa]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Regional"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-regional-year-awards-recognize-best-region/ "LIA Announces Regional 'Of The Year' Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; as additional components of its global 'Of the Year' honors.

Entries submitted for consideration are required to have been broadcast, published, or released commercially with client approval in order to become part of the competition, accompanied by the payment of a required fee based on the category.&lt;ref name="Fees"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/enter/ "Rules of Entry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, LIA has published a hardbound, full-color Annual showcasing all of the winners and finalists from that given year.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/about/ "About LIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEight"&gt;London International Awards 2008 23rd Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative LIAisons ==
As a way of giving back to the industry, LIA launched the 'Creative Conversations' program in 2012. Composed of educational discussions centered on the future of advertising, brand-building and production, the campaign is enforced through a series of seminars, lunches, and dinners that run concurrent with judging. The organization and expenses, including that of travel and hotel accommodations, are wholly funded by LIA.&lt;ref name="CampaignBrief"&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2013/05/to-do-sunday-pm---london-inter.html "London International Awards Call for Entry Now Open - seven picked for jury duty from Australasia"] Campaign Brief, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the experience's purpose is to bridge relationships between veteran speakers and junior "Young Creatives" from across the globe, the advertising industry's "great teachers" and "young, energetic" minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hang Li|first1=Daniel|title=Comments|url=https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/attendees/2013/|website=www.liaawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural 2012 speakers included: Ted Royer, Susan Credle, Israel Diaz, Sonal Dabral, Tony Calcao, Jeremy Craigen, Faris Yakob, Neil French, Phil Growick, Dörte Spengler-Ahrens, Bob Garfield, Jonathon Ker, Ralph van Dijk, and Scott Elias.

The program was renamed "Creative LIAisons" for the 2015 awards, with just under 100 invited attendees.&lt;ref name="FrontPage"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/ "Creative LIAisons"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daymond John]] returned as the Keynote Speaker, with other noteworthy speakers such as Amir Kassaei at [[DDB Worldwide]], John Merrifield from [[Google]], and Mark Tutssel of [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] joining him.&lt;ref name="2015Speakers"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/creative_liaisons/speakers/2015/ "2015 Speakers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matbat''' is a heavily [[Papuan languages|Papuan]]-influenced [[Austronesian language]] spoken in [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] on the island of [[Misool]], [[Raja Ampat islands]].&lt;ref name="remijsen"/&gt; Like neighboring [[Ma'ya language|Ma'ya]], it is one of a handful of Austronesian languages with [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

Matbat has five lexical tones: high falling {{IPA|˥˩}} 41, high {{IPA|˦}} 3, low rising {{IPA|˩˨}} 12, low level {{IPA|˩}} 1, and low falling {{IPA|˨˩}} 21, which in open syllables has a peaking allophone, {{IPA|˩˨˩}} 121. Most Matbat words are monosyllabic; additional syllables in polysyllabic words are often weak and toneless, though a few words do have two tonic syllables. Examples of some of the longer monomorphemic words are {{IPA|/kamow˩˨/}} 'star', {{IPA|/wuj˦te/}} 'sea shore', {{IPA|/sapu˥˩luj˩˨/}} 'round', {{IPA|/bim˦bom˩˨˩pu/}} 'butterfly'.

'''Mauritian Creole''' or '''Morisien''' or formerly '''Morisyen'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritian_Creole#Orthography] (Mauritian Creole: ''kreol morisien'', pronunciation: [[Mauritian Creole phonology|/kʁeol moʁisjɛ̃, -iʃɛ̃/]]) is a [[French-based creole language]] spoken in [[Mauritius]]. In addition to the [[French language|French]] base of the language, there are also a number of words from [[English language|English]] and from the many African and South Asian languages that have been spoken on the island. 

Mauritian Creole is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' and ''de facto'' language of Mauritius, formerly a British colony, which has kept both English and French as its core languages, even thought English is used mostly for Administration and educational purposes and French for media and for second speaking language.  

Mauritians tend to speak Mauritian Creole at home and French in the workplace. French and English are spoken in schools. Though many Mauritians are of of Indian descent, they primarily speak Creole. It is their ancestral language in the sense that their ancestors, along with those of African, European and Chinese descent, helped create the creole language together centuries ago, when Mauritius was the meeting place of peoples from different continents who together founded a nation with its own culture and history. Today, around 1.3 million people speak the language.

== Classification ==
Mauritian Creole is a [[French-based creole language]], closely related to [[Seychellois Creole]], [[Rodriguan Creole]] and [[Chagossian Creole]]. Mauritian's relationship to other French-based creole languages is controversial. [[Robert Chaudenson]] (2001) and [[Henri Wittmann]] (1972, 1987, etc.) have argued that Mauritian Creole is closely related to [[Réunion Creole]], but Philip Baker and [[Chris Corne]] (1982) have argued that Réunion influence on Mauritian was minimal and that the two languages are barely more similar to each other than they are to other French-based creoles.

== History ==
{{main|History of Mauritius}}
Although the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were the first [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] to visit Mauritius, they did not settle there. Rather, the small Portuguese element in the vocabulary of Mauritian derives from the Portuguese element in European maritime jargon (such as the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]]) or from enslaved Africans or Asians who came from areas in which Portuguese was used as a trade language. Similarly, while the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had a colony on Mauritius between 1638 and 1710, all the Dutch settlers evacuated the island to Réunion, leaving behind only a few runaway slaves who would have no discernible impact on Mauritian. The French then claimed Mauritius and first settled it between 1715 and 1721.

As they had done on [[Réunion]] and in the [[West Indies]], the French created on Mauritius a plantation economy, based on slave labour. Slaves became a majority of the population of Mauritius by 1730 and were 85% of the population by 1777. They came from [[West Africa]], [[East Africa]] and [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Toussaint, ''Histoire de l'île Maurice'', Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the resulting linguistic fragmentation, French became the lingua franca among the slaves. However, the small size of the native French population on the island, their aloofness from most of their slaves, and the lack of formal education for slaves ensured that the slaves' French developed in very different directions from the slave owners' French.

Historical documents from as early as 1773 note the "creole language" that the slaves spoke.

The [[British Empire|British]] took over Mauritius during the [[Napoleonic era]], but few English-speakers ever settled there and Mauritian Creole had already been firmly entrenched.

The abolition of slavery in the 1830s made many leave the plantations, and Indian indentured workers replaced them after they had been brought in by plantation owners. Though the Indians soon became the majority on the island, which they remain, their own linguistic fragmentation as well as their alienation from the English- and French-speaking plantation owners led them to take up Mauritian Creole as their main lingua franca.

English and French have long enjoyed greater social status and dominated [[government]], [[business]], [[education]], and the [[Mass media|media]], but Mauritian Creole's popularity in most informal domains has persisted.

== Phonology ==
{{main|Mauritian Creole phonology}}
The [[phonology]] of Mauritian Creole is very similar to that of [[Standard French]]. However, French {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} have respectively depalatalised to {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} in Mauritian, and the front vowels {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}} have respectively been unrounded to {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kreol. A description of Mauritian creole |first=Philip |last=Baker |year=1972 |publisher=Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
The language has several published [[dictionaries]], both monolingual and bilingual, written by authors such as Philip Baker (1987), the group "Ledikasyon pu travayer," and Arnaud Carpooran (2005, 2009, 2011), among others. The number of publications is increasing steadily; however, the [[orthographies]] used in them are significantly different.

The Mauritian government began supporting an orthographic reform in 2011, with a system that generally follows French but eliminates [[silent letters]] and reduces the number of different ways in which the same sound can be written. It was codified in the ''Lortograf Kreol Morisien'' (2011) and used in the ''Gramer Kreol Morisien'' (2012) as well. It has become standard upon its adoption by the second edition of the ''Diksioner Morisien'', which previously had been spelt as the ''Diksyoner Morisyen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemauricien.com/article/2e-%C3%A9dition-du-diksioner-kreol-la-langue-kreol-premier-instrument-qui-nous-rassemble-comme-ma Online edition of "Le Mauricien" on second edition of Diksioner kreol morisien (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexicon ==
Most words come from French but are not always used in the same way. For example, the French article ''le, la, les'' is often fused with the noun in Mauritian: French ''rat'' is Mauritian ''lera'' and French ''temps'' is Mauritian ''letan''. The same is true for some [[adjectives]] and [[prepositions]]: French ''femme'' ("woman") and ''riz'' ("rice") are ''bonnfam'' (from ''bonne femme'') and ''diri'' (from ''du riz'') in Mauritian.  Some words have changed their meanings altogether: Mauritian ''gagn'' ("to get" or "to obtain") is derived from french ''gagner'' ("to win" or "to earn").

Other words come from either [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] such as ''lakaz'' from Spanish ''(la) casa''.

There are also several [[loanwords]] from the languages of the African [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] slaves, who contributed such words as Mauritian ''lapang'' from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] ''ampango'' (rice stuck to the bottom of a pot), Mauritian ''lafus'' from Malagasy ''hafotsa'' (a kind of tree), and Mauritian ''zahtak'' from Malagasy ''antaka'' (a kind of plant).  In some cases, as with some of the nouns from French, the Mauritian word has fused with the French article ''le/la/les''.

Words of East African origin include Mauritian ''makutu'' from [[Makua language|Makua]] ''makhwatta'' (running sore), Mauritian ''matak'' from [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Makonde language|Makonde]] ''matako'' (buttock).

Recent loanwords tend to come from English, such as ''map'' instead of ''plan'' or ''carte'' in French ('''plan''' or '''kart''' in Mauritian Creole). English words used in Mauritian Creole retain their English spelling but should normally written with [[inverted commas]].

==Grammar==
[[Nouns]] do not change in the according to [[grammatical number]]. Whether a noun is singular or plural can usually be determined only by context. However, the particle ''bann'' (from ''bande'') is often placed before a plural. French ''un/une'' corresponds to Mauritian ''enn'' but its use has slightly different rules. Mauritian has an article (''la''), but it is placed after the noun. Compare French ''un rat'', ''ce rat'', ''le rat'', ''les rats'', and Mauritian ''enn lera'', ''lera-la'' and ''bann lera''.&lt;ref&gt;Corne (1970, 1988), Carpooran (2007), Wittmann (1972); on the subject of the characteristic article incorporation, the agglutination to the noun of an erstwhile article (in French), see Standquist (2005), Wittmann &amp; Fournier (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mauritian, there is only one form for each [[pronoun]], regardless of [[grammatical case|case]] or [[grammatical gender|gender]]; ''li'' can thus be translated as "he, she, it, him, his, her, hers" depending on the context.

[[Verbs]] do not change their form according to [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[grammatical person|person]]. Instead, the accompanying noun or pronoun determines who is engaging in the action, and several preverbal particles are used alone or in combination to indicate the tense: ''ti'' (from French ''étais'') marks [[past tense]], ''pe'', short for the now-rare ''ape'' (from "après," as [[Québec French]] still uses to mark the [[progressive aspect]], ''(f)inn'' (from French ''fini'') marks the completive or [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], and ''pou'' or sometimes ''va'' or ''av'' (from French ''va'') marks the [[future tense]].

For example, ''li finn gagn'' ("he/she/it had") can also be shortened to ''linn gagn'' and pronounced as one word. The Réunion version is ''li té fine gagne'' for past, ''li té i gagne'' for past progressive, and ''li sava gagne'' for present progressive or near future.

'''Munichi''' is a recently extinct language which was spoken in the village of Munichis, about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Yurimaguas]], [[Loreto Region]], [[Peru]]. In 1988, there were two mother-tongue speakers, but they had not met since the 1970s. The last known fluent speaker, Victoria Huancho Icahuate, died in the late 1990s. As of 2009 there were several semi-speakers who retained significant lexical, and partial grammatical, knowledge of the language (Michael et al. 2013).

== Classification ==
The language is considered an isolate (Michael et al. 2013), but the [[pronominal]] [[suffixes]] bear a close resemblance to those reconstructed for proto-[[Arawakan]] (Gibson 1996:18-19), and some lexical items are similar to ones in Arawakan languages (Jolkesky 2016:310-317). Although Jolkesky (''id''.) argues that the language belongs to a putative Macro-Arawakan stock, evidence has yet to be provided for placing it either in a sister branch to the Arawakan language family or in a branch within this language family. There is substantial borrowing from the local variety of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], and to a lesser extent from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Cahuapanan languages]] (Michael et al. 2013).

== Phonology ==
Munichi has six vowels: /a, e, i, ɨ, o, u/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naxi''' (autonym: {{IPA-all|nɑ˩ɕi˧}}), also known as ''Nakhi, Nasi, Lomi, Moso, Mo-su'', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language or group of languages spoken by some 310,000 people most of whom live in or around [[Lijiang City]] [[Yulong Naxi Autonomous County]] (Yùlóng Nàxīzú Zìzhìxiàn 玉龍納西族自治縣) of the province of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. [[Nakhi]] is also the ethnic group that speaks it, although in detail, officially defined ethnicity and linguistic reality do not coincide neatly: there are speakers of Naxi who are not registered as "Naxi", and citizens who are officially "Naxi" but do not speak it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathieu|first1=Christine|title=A History and Anthropological Study of the Ancient Kingdoms of the Sino-Tibetan Borderland - Naxi and Mosuo|date=2003|publisher=Edwin Mellen Pr.|location=Lewiston, NY|edition=Mellen Studies in Anthropology 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
{{see also|Naic languages}}
It is commonly proposed in Chinese scholarship that the Naic languages are [[Lolo-Burmese languages]]: for instance, Ziwo Lama (2012) classifies Naxi as part of a "Naxish" branch of [[Loloish languages|Loloish]].

However, as early as 1975, Sino-Tibetan linguist [[David Bradley (linguist)|David Bradley]] pointed out that Naxi does not partake in the shared innovations that define [[Loloish languages|Loloish]].&lt;ref name="Michaud"&gt;Cited in {{cite journal|last1=Michaud|first1=Alexis|title=The Tones of Numerals and Numeral-Plus-Classifier Phrases: On Structural Similarities Between Naxi, Na and Laze|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|volume=34|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurgood and La Polla (2003) state that "The position of Naxi ... is still unclear despite much speculation", and leave it unclassified within Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sino-Tibetan Languages'', pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillaume Jacques]] &amp; [[Alexis Michaud]] (2011)&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;Jacques, Guillaume, and Alexis Michaud. 2011. "[http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00537990/ Approaching the historical phonology of three highly eroded Sino-Tibetan languages: Naxi, Na and Laze]." ''Diachronica'' 28:468-498.&lt;/ref&gt; classify Naxi within the [[Naish languages|Naish]] lower-level subgroup of Sino-Tibetan; in turn, Naish is part of [[Naic languages|Naic]], itself part of a proposed "Na-Qiangic" branch.

== Dialects ==
Naxi in the broad sense (including [[Mosuo|Na/Mosuo]]) was initially split by the linguists He Jiren and Jiang Zhuyi into two major clusters, '''Western Naxi''' and '''Eastern Naxi'''.&lt;ref&gt;He Jiren 和即仁 &amp; Jiang Zhuyi 姜竹仪. 1985. ''Naxiyu Jianzhi'' 纳西语简志 (A Brief Description of the Naxi Language). Beijing 北京: Minzu Chubanshe 民族出版社.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Western Naxi''' (纳西语西部方言) is fairly homogeneous. It is spoken mainly in Lijiang, Zhongdian (Shangri-La), Weixi, and Yongsheng counties. Smaller populations of Western Naxi speakers are found in Heqing, Jianchuan, Lanping, Deqin, Gongshan, Ninglang (in Bapijiang village 坝皮匠村, Yongning Township 永宁乡) Muli (in Eya 俄亚), Yanbian (Daoju 道咀), and Tibet (in Mangkang 芒康). There over 240,000 speakers total. Western Naxi consists of the Dayan, Lijiangba, and Baoshanzhou dialects (''Naxiyu Jianzhi'' p.&amp;nbsp;752).
*'''Dayan 大研镇''': Within Lijiang County, this dialect is spoken in Dayan Town 大研镇, and also in Baishajie 白沙街, Shuhejie 束河街, Axi 阿喜, Daoxin 道新, Daoguzhai, 道古宅, and Guangzhai 光宅 by just over 50,000 people. 
*'''Lijiangba 丽江坝''': spoken mostly within Lijiang County, and in the counties of Zhongdian, Weixi, Yongsheng, Deqin, Gongshan, etc. by 180,000 people.
*'''Baoshanzhou 宝山州''': spoken in Baoshan 宝山 and Guoluo 果洛 in Lijiang County by just over 10,000 people.

'''Eastern Naxi''' (纳西语东部方言) consists of several mutually unintelligible varieties. It is spoken mainly in Yanyuan, Muli, and Yanbian counties. Eastern Naxi is also spoken by smaller populations in Yongsheng (in Zhangzidan 獐子旦), Weixi (in Qizong 其宗&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=131614|title=维西傈僳族自治县塔城镇其宗行政村|author=|date=|website=www.ynszxc.gov.cn|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Lijiang (in Hailong 海龙 and Fengke 奉科&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vindex.aspx?departmentid=230562|title=玉龙纳西族自治县奉科乡善美村委会|author=|date=|website=www.ynszxc.gov.cn|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) counties. There is a total of over 40,000 speakers (''Naxiyu Jianzhi'' p.&amp;nbsp;754).
*'''Yongningba 永宁坝''' (autonym: ''nɑ13'' 纳): spoken in Ninglang (in Yongningba 永宁坝) and Yanyuan. There is also a group of about 100 Naxi households in Weixi County who have the autonym ''mɑ33 li55 mɑ33 sɑ33''. This language is referred to in English-language scholarship as [[Mosuo|Na or Narua]].
*'''Beiquba 北渠坝''' (autonym: ''nɑ33 xi33'' 纳恒): spoken in Ninglang (in Beiquba 北渠坝) and Yongsheng (in Xiaoping 哨平 and Zhangzidan 獐子旦).
*'''Guabie 瓜别''' (autonym: ''nɑ33 zɯ33'' 纳汝): spoken in Yanbian (in Guabie 瓜别) and Muli (in Bo'ao 博凹 and Lie'ao 列凹).

== Usage ==
According to the 2000 Chinese census, 310,000 people speak Nakhi, and 100,000 of those are monolingual. Approximately 170,000 speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Bai language|Bai]], or [[English language|English]] as a second language. Almost all speakers live in Yunnan, but some are in Tibet, and it is possible that some live in [[Burma]].

The language is commonly spoken among Nakhi people in everyday life and the language is in little danger of dying out soon, although the written literacy is still a rare skill. The language can be written in the [[Geba syllabary]], [[Latin script]] or [[Fraser alphabet]], but they are rarely used in everyday life and few people are able to read Naxi.  The 1932 Naxi Gospel of Mark was published by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the [[Fraser alphabet]].

The three most common [[dialect]]s are Lijiang, Lapao, and Lutien. Lijiang, which is spoken in the western parts of the language's range, is the most uniform of the three and it is heavily influenced by Standard Chinese and Yunnanese dialects, proved by its huge volume of loan words from Chinese. The eastern dialects, which are much more native and have many dialectal differences.

== Phonology ==
The alphabet used here is the 1957 [[pinyin]] alphabet.

The '''Northern Sami Wikipedia''' is the edition of [[Wikipedia]] in the [[Northern Sami language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{se icon}} Yle Ođđasat Saamenkieliset tv-uutiset, [http://areena.yle.fi/tv/2140562?start=1m17s Digisaame], [[Yle TV1]], {{#time:2014-02-24}}. (Section in the Sami news of the main TV channel of [[Finland]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used as one example of how Wikipedia's categories system works (in the context of [[Social ontology|social ontologies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mehler |first= Alexander |last2=Pustylnikov |first2=Olga |last3=Diewald|first3=Nils   |date=2008 |title=Geography of Social Ontologies: Testing a Variant of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in the Context of Wikipedia |url= |journal=Computer Speech &amp; Language |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1016/j.csl.2010.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==

It started in 2004 and has over 7000 articles, ranking in the middle of all Wikipedias.

As for readers: it is 134th of about 290 in number of page requests: half a million page requests per month, but not possible to know how many human readers.

As for content: it is 137th of about 290 in number of articles (there are {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|se|N}}); articles are about 500 characters long on average with approximately 400 000 words in total. It's above average in terms of editors/speakers and articles/speakers, there are many articles about towns around the world (mostly automated creations).

As for activity: there were almost no new articles in 2008-2011, new articles usually come in bursts; in 2013 editing activity was lower than in previous years with fewer than 10 active editors per month making fewer than 100 edits per month.&lt;ref&gt;All these statistics from [[Erik Zachte]], [http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaSE.htm Wikipedia Statistics Northern Sami], stats.wikimedia.org (accessed 19 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
There are currently {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|se|N}} active users and activity is still low.

[[File:Buck Showalter and Matt Wieters on August 28, 2011.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Buck Showalter]] (left) engages [[Matt Wieters]] in a pound hug.]]
The  '''pound hug''' (also referred to as a '''pound shake''', '''hip-hop hug''', '''one-armed hug''', '''dude hug''', '''cootie hug''', '''homie hug''', '''shug''', '''hetero hug''', '''bro-grab''', '''bro hug''', '''brah hug''', '''thug hug''', '''man-hug''', or a '''daps''') is a stylized [[greeting]], exclusively performed between two people, that consists of a combination of a [[handshake]] and one-armed [[hug]]. Unlike the traditional hug, which symbolically and effectively removes interpersonal barriers and unites the two persons embracing, the pound hug—performed by keeping the right hand locked in handshake while the left arm wraps around the other's shoulder—interposes the obstacle of the two right arms to the joining of the two bodies. 

This type of hug has also been frequently used in urban cities and hip hop culture since at least the 70s.  An example of the pound hug aka bro hug can be seen in the Tupac Shakur video "[[I Get Around (Tupac Shakur song)|I Get Around]]" in 1993.

'''Propositional representation''' is the [[Cognitive Psychology|psychological]] theory, first developed in 1973 by [[Zenon Pylyshyn|Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, that mental relationships between objects are represented by symbols and not by mental images of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Elport, Daniel [[Wikibooks:Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Imagery|"Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience"]], ''Wikibooks, July 2007, accessed March 07, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
A propositional network describing the sentence "John believes that Anna will pass her exam" is illustrated below.

[[Image:Proprep2.png|center|Figure 1: A Propositional Network]]

Each circle represents a single proposition, and the connections between the circles describe a network of propositions.

Another example is the sentence "Debby donated a big amount of money to Greenpeace, an organisation which protects the environment", which contains the propositions "Debby donated money to Greenpeace", "The amount of money was big" and "Greenpeace protects the environment". If one or more of the propositions is false, the whole sentence is false. This is illustrated in Figure 2:

[[File:Proprep1.png|center|Figure 2: A more complex propositional network]]

Propositional representations are also:

*'''Language-like''' only in the sense that they manipulate symbols as a language does. The [[language of thought]] cannot be thought of as a [[natural language]]; it can only be a [[formal language]] that applies across different linguistic subjects, it therefore must be a language common to mind rather than culture, must be organizational rather than communicative. Thus Mentalese is best expressed through predicate and [[propositional calculus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*'''Made up of discrete symbols'''; each symbol has a smallest constituent part; i.e. limit to how far units of rep. can be broken down.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*'''Explicit'''; each symbol represents something (object, action, relation) specifically and thus explicitly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*'''Grammatical'''; symbolic manipulation follows (requires?) syntactical rules and semantical rules.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*'''Abstract and amodal'''; symbols may represent any ideational content irrespective of which [[Stimulus modality|sensory modality]] was involved in its perception. (Unlike a pictorial representation which must be modality specific to the visual sensory mode).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Each proposition consists of a set of predicates and arguments which are represented in the form of predicate calculus. For instance:

An event; (X) John hit Chris with a unicycle, the unicycle broke, because of this John started to cry, which caused Chris to be happy.

''A propositional representation''

*P [hit (John, Chris, unicycle)]
*Q [broke (unicycle)]
*R [cry (John)]
*S [happy (Chris)]
*Cause (Q,R)
*Cause (R,S)

Each set of predicates (words like hit, broke, cry, happy are first order-predicates; Cause is a [[second-order predicate]]) and arguments (often consisting of an agent/subject (e.g. John in ‘P’), a recipient/object (e.g. Chris in ‘P’) and an instrument (e.g. the unicycle in ‘P’)) are in turn manipulated as propositions: event/statement “John hit Chris with the unicycle” is represented as proposition ‘P’.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Also, features of particular objects may be characterized through attribute lists. ‘John’ as a singular object may have the attributes ‘plays guitar’, ‘juggles’, ‘eats a lot’, ‘rides a unicycle’ etc. Thus reference to ‘John’ identifies him as the object of thought in virtue of his having certain of these attributes. So in [[First-order logic|predicate calculus]], if “John (F) has the property of being ‘rides a unicycle’ (x)” we may say [[salva veritate]]: (x)(Fx). These elements have been called semantic primitives or semantic markers/features. Each primitive may in turn form part of a propositional statement, which in turn could be represented by an abstract figure e.g. ‘P’. The primitives themselves play a crucial role in categorizing and classifying objects and concepts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The meaningful relations between ideas and concepts expressed between and within the propositions are in part dealt with through the general laws of inference. One of the most common of these is Modus Ponens Ponendum (MPP), which is a simple inference of relation between two objects, the latter supervening on the former (P-›Q). Thus if we have two propositions (P, Q) and we assume a law of inference that relates to them both (P-›Q), then if we have P we must necessarily have Q. Relations of causation and may be expressed in this fashion, i.e. one state (P) causing (-›) another (Q){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

So a purely formal characterization of the event (X) written above in natural language would be something like:

*P, Q       (A)
*Q -› R    (A)
*Q	  (A1)
*R	  (2,3 MPP)
*R -› S	  (A)
*S	  (4,5 MPP)

'''Semi-cursive script'''  is a cursive [[Chinese script styles|style]] of [[Chinese character]]s. Because it is not as abbreviated as [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]], most people who can read [[regular script]] can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.

Also referred to in English both as '''running script''' and by its Mandarin Chinese name, '''''xíngshū''''', it is derived from [[clerical script]], and was for a long time after its development in the 1st centuries AD the usual style of handwriting.

Some of the best examples of semi-cursive can be found in the work of [[Wang Xizhi]] (321-379) of the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10505">[[Somali language|Somali]] is an [[agglutinative language]], using a large number of affixes and particles to determine and alter the meaning of words.

==Morphology==
As in other related [[Afroasiatic languages]], Somali nouns are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical case|case]].

[[Affixes]] change according to a number of rules.  The definite article is a [[suffix]], with the basic form being ''-ki'' or ''-ka'' for masculine nouns and ''-ti'' or ''-ta'' for female nouns.  The ''k'' or ''t'' is the actual article marker, although it can change depending on the preceding consonant, with the following vowel determined by the case of the noun.  Articles do not change for singular or plural.

===Nouns===

====Absolutive case====
The basic form of a Somali noun is in [[absolutive case]].  In this case, the article maintains the vowel ''-a''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Somali
! English
|-
| ''buug''
| (a) book
|-
| ''buugga''
| the book
|-
| ''gacan''
| (a) hand
|-
| ''gacanta''
| the hand
|}

====Nominative case====
The subject of a sentence takes [[nominative case]].  In this case, the article takes the vowel ''-u''.  If the subject of the sentence includes multiple nouns, only the last takes the nominative ending for the article.

If there is no article, a tonal change signifies nominative case, although this is not represented in the orthography.  Some feminine nouns take the suffix ''-i'' in nominative case without an article.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Somali
! English
|-
| ''nin''
| man
|-
| ''nin-ka''
| the man
|-
| ''nin-ku...''
| the man... (followed by a verb)
|-
| ''nin-ka iyo wiil-ku...''
| the man and the boy... 
|}

====Genitive case====
[[Genitive case]] is generally indicated through a tonal change.  Some feminine nouns take an ending, ''-eed, -aad'' or ''-od'', depending on the final consonant of the root word.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Somali
! English
|-
| ''áf''
| (a) language
|-
| ''carab''
| Arab (people)
|-
| ''áf carabi''
| Arabic language  
|}

====Vocative case====
[[Vocative case]] is indicated either through a tonal change or with the suffixes ''-ow'' (m. sg.), ''-ohow'' (m. pl.), ''-eey/-aay/-ooy'' (f. sg.) or ''-yahay'' (f. pl.).

====Gender====
Gender is not marked in nouns without the definite article.  The gender of nouns does not follow any particular rule and is not generally obvious.

====Number====
Nouns form their plural in three ways, including [[reduplication]].  Many nouns exhibit gender polarity, whereby they change gender in the plural form, e.g. ''buug-ga'' (the book) is masculine in the singular, but ''buugag-ta'' (the books) is feminine.

===Pronouns===
There are both subject and object forms for each [[personal pronoun]], with each form further divided into short and emphatic forms.

| ''idin/idiin''
|-
| 3. Pl.
| ''iyagu''
| ''ay''
| ''iyaga''
| ''(u)''
|}

===Verbs===
Somali verbs consist of a stem to which suffixes are added.  Verbs in [[indicative mood]] exist in four tenses, present, present continuous, past and past continuous, in addition to a [[subjunctive mood]] form for present and future tense.  Verbs in Somali conjugate mainly through the addition of suffixes, although a very small number of common verbs use a conjugation using prefixes.

====Infinitive and verbal nouns====
The infinitive is created through the suffix ''-i'' or ''-n'' depending on verb class, e.g. ''keeni'' (to bring) and ''siin'' (to give).  The infinitive is used in present tense only with the [[modal verb]] ''karid'' (to be able).  Verbal nouns are formed with the endings ''-id'', ''-n'' and ''-sho'', e.g. ''keenid'' (the bringing), ''siin'' (the giving) and ''barasho'' (the learning) and are used and declined as per normal nouns.

====Pareto principle====
According to Ahmad (2013), the [[Pareto principle]] is in effect with regard to Somali grammar. When applied to Standard Somali, the adjective and verb, which collectively represent around 20% of Somali grammatical categories, would thereby constitute about 80% of both spoken and written Somali. This is due to the fact that tenses have an effect on both grammatical categories.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad|first=Liban|title=The Standard Somali Grammar and Pareto Principle|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7QxuLt-N559cXlOTVBKZ1V2blk/edit?pli=1|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indicative mood====

=====Present=====
Present tense refers to an action which may or may not be happening at present.  It may be used to express something which happens habitually or repeatedly.  The present tense conjugation of ''keen'' (to bring) follows:
{| class="wikitable" 
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Person
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Present
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | English
|-
| 1. Sing.
| ''keenaa''
| I bring
|-
| 2. Sing.
| ''keentaa''
| you bring
|-
| 3. Sing. m.
| ''keenaa''
| he brings
|-
| 3. Sing. f.
| ''keentaa''
| she brings
|-
| 1. Pl.
| ''keennaa''
| we bring
|-
| 2. Pl.
| ''keentaan''
| you (pl.) bring
|-
| 3. Pl.
| ''keenaan''
| they bring
|}

=====Past=====
Past tense is used to describe a completed action in the past with a discrete duration. The conjugation of ''keen'' (to bring) is:
{| class="wikitable" 
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Person
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Form
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | English
|-
| 1. Sing.
| ''(waan) keenay''

| you brought
|-
| 3. Sing. m.
| ''(wuu) keenay''
| he brought
|-
| 3. Sing. f.
| ''(way) keentay''
| she brought
|-
| 1. Pl.
| ''(waan) keennay''
| we brought
|-
| 2. Pl.
| ''(waad) keenteen''
| you (pl.) brought
|-
| 3. Pl.
| ''(way) keeneen''
| they brought
|}
nb: The final ''-ay'' can also be pronounced and written ''-ey''.

=====Present continuous=====
The present continuous tense is formed with the suffix ''-ay-'' / ''-na-'' (depending on dialect) and the endings from the present tense. The present continuous forms of ''keen'' are:
{| class="wikitable" 
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Person
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Form
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | English
|-
| 1. Sing.
| ''(waan) keenayaa''
| I am bringing
|-
| 2. Sing.
| ''(waad) keenaysaa''
| you are bringing
|-
| 3. Sing. m.
| ''(wuu) keenayaa''
| he is bringing
|-
| 3. Sing. f.
| ''(way) keenaysaa''
| she is bringing
|-
| 1. Pl.
| ''(waan) keenaynaa''
| we are bringing
|-
| 2. Pl.
| ''(waad) keenaysaan''
| you (pl.) are bringing
|-
| 3. Pl.
| ''(way) keenayaan''
| they are bringing
|}

=====Past continuous=====
Past continuous is formed with the suffix ''-na'' / ''-ay'' and the past tense endings: ''keen+ay+ey'' = ''keenayey'' = I was bringing.  Is it used to describe actions in the past which happened over a period of time: ''Intuu '''akhrinayey''' wargeyska wuu '''quracanayey'''.'' = While he '''was reading''' the newspaper, he '''was eating''' breakfast.

=====Future=====
Future tense is formed with the infinitive of the required verb and the present tense of ''doon'' (to want):
{| class="wikitable" 
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Person
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | Form
! class="hintergrundfarbe6" | English
|-
| 1. Sing.
| ''(waan) keeni doonaa''
| I will bring
|-
| 2. Sing.
| ''(waad) keeni doontaa''
| you will bring
|-
| 3. Sing. m.
| ''(wuu) keeni doonaa''
| he will bring
|-
| 3. Sing. f.
| ''(way) keeni doontaa''
| she will bring
|-
| 1. Pl.
| ''(waan) keeni doonaa''
| we will bring
|-
| 2. Pl.
| ''(waad) keeni doontaan''
| you (pl.) will bring
|-
| 3. Pl.
| ''(way) keeni doonaan''
| they will bring
|}

====Subjunctive mood====
The subjunctive is used only in subordinate clauses and certain prepositional phrases.  The present subjunctive differs from the indicative only in that the vowel in the endings changes from ''a'' to ''o''.  Future subjunctive uses the infinitive plus the present subjunctive form of ''doon''.

==Syntax==
Somali has several strategies to indicate where the intention or the interest or the focus is located in the phrase: a [[topic-comment]] or focus construction. The words ''baa'', ''ayaa'', and ''waxaa'' put the focus on nouns and noun phrases.

Example:

#John baa baxay - John ''Focus'' (baa) went out
#John ayaa baxay - John ''Focus'' (ayaa) went out
#Waxaa baxay John - ''Focus'' (waxaa) went out John

Thus, the words baa, ayaa, and waxaa unconsciously raise the question of who went out? Therefore the noun.

Somali also has the word waa which puts the focus on verbs and verb phrases.

Example:

John waa baxay - John ''Focus'' (waa) went out

Waa is different from other previous one we have just seen, because it 
raises the question of what did John do? Therefore the verb.

Sentences in Somali are typically of the order Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).  Nouns have different tonal markings for number, gender (masculine and feminine), and case or role in the sentence.

The '''Sorbian languages''' ({{lang-hsb|Serbska rěč}}, {{lang-dsb|Serbska rěc}}) are two closely related, but only partially mutually intelligible, [[West Slavic languages]] spoken by the [[Sorbs]], a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] minority in the [[Lusatia]] region of eastern [[Germany]]. They are classified under the [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages]] and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] and [[Czech-Slovak languages|Czech–Slovak]].&lt;ref name=Faska&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120212191519/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~sorb/seiten/eng/03/language.html About Sorbian Language], by Helmut Faska, [[University of Leipzig]] (English)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the languages have also been known as '''Wendish''' (named after the [[Wends]], earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or '''Lusatian'''. Their collective [[ISO 639]]-2 code is &lt;tt&gt;wen&lt;/tt&gt;.

There are two literary languages: [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]] ({{lang|hsb|hornjoserbsce}}), spoken by about 40,000 people in [[Saxony]], and [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] ({{lang|dsb|dolnoserbski}}) spoken by about 10,000 people in [[Brandenburg]]. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as [[Lusatia]] ({{lang|hsb|Łužica}} in Upper Sorbian, {{lang|dsb|Łužyca}} in Lower Sorbian, or {{lang|de|Lausitz}} in [[German language|German]]).

==History==
After the settlement of the formerly Germanic territories (the part largely corresponding to the former [[East Germany]]) by the Sorbs' Slavic ancestors in the 5th and 6th centuries, the Sorbian language (or its predecessors) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of East Germany for several centuries, and still had its stronghold in (Upper and Lower) Lusatia, where it enjoys national protection and fostering to the present day. Outside Lusatia, it has been superseded by German, following official discrimination from the 13th century on.&lt;ref name=Faska /&gt; The printed language developed around the main [[Bible translations into Sorbian]].

==Geographic distribution==
In Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{year needed|date=September 2017}} In the home areas of the Sorbs, both languages are recognized as second official language next to German.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{year needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Bautzen Ortschild.jpg|thumb|left|A bilingual sign in [[Bautzen]]]]
The city of [[Bautzen]] in [[Upper Lusatia]] is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, "Bautzen/{{lang|hsb|Budyšin}}".
The city of [[Cottbus]] ({{lang|dsb|Chóśebuz}}) is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian; here too bilingual signs are found.
Sorbian has also been spoken in the small Sorbian ("Wendish") settlement of [[Serbin, Texas|Serbin]] in [[Lee County, Texas]], and it is possible that a few speakers still remain there. Until recently newspapers were published in Sorbian there. The local dialect has been heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and [[English language|English]].

The German terms "Wends" (''Wenden'') and "Wendish" (''wendisch/Wendisch'') once denoted "Slav(ic)" generally;{{cn|date=September 2017}} they are today mostly replaced by "Sorbs" (''Sorben'') and "Sorbian" (''sorbisch/Sorbisch'') with reference to Sorbian communities in Germany.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Linguistic features==
Both Upper and Lower Sorbian have the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] for [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s; very few living Indo-European languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar. For example, the word {{lang|dsb|ruka}} is used for one hand, {{lang|dsb|ruce}} for two hands, and {{lang|dsb|ruki}} for more than two hands. As with most of the [[Slavic languages]], Sorbian uses no articles.

===Grammar===
The Sorbian languages are [[Declension|declined]] in six to seven cases:
#[[Nominative case|Nominative]]
#[[Accusative case|Accusative]]
#[[Dative case|Dative]]
#[[Genitive case|Genitive]]
#[[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
#[[Locative case|Locative]]
#[[Vocative case|Vocative]] (Upper Sorbian only)

{{Spanish language}}
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the [[official language]] of the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]] from the beginning of [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish rule]] in the late 16th century, through the conclusion of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. It remained, along with English, as co-official language until 1987. It was at first removed in 1973 by a constitutional change, but after a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, with the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] re-designating it instead as an "optional and voluntary language".&lt;ref name="official languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="voluntary and optional" /&gt;

[[Philippine Spanish]] ({{lang-es|Español filipino, Castellano filipino}}) is a variant of standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], spoken in the [[Philippines]] by a minority today, though it was quite widespread up to the early 20th century. The variant is very similar to [[Mexican Spanish]], because the Philippines was ruled from [[New Spain]] in present-day [[Mexico]], for over three centuries. During that period, there was much Spanish and Mexican emigration to the [[Spanish East Indies]].

It was the language of the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the country's first official language, as proclaimed in the [[Malolos Constitution]] of the [[First Philippine Republic]] in 1899. It was the language of commerce, law, politics and the arts during the colonial period and well into the 20th century. It was the main language of many classical writers and [[Ilustrados]] such as [[Jose Rizal]], [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Antonio Luna]] and [[Marcelo del Pilar]], to name but a few. It is regulated by the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]], the main Spanish-language regulating body in the Philippines, and a member of the [[Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]], the entity which regulates the Spanish language worldwide.

{{main article|Philippine Spanish}}
[[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]] was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries of Spanish rule and continued to serve as a [[lingua franca]] until the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="florentino"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodao |first=Florentino|year=1997|title=Spanish language in the Philippines : 1900–1940|journal=Philippine studies  |volume=45 |series=12 |issue=1 |pages=94–107 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila, Philippines |issn=0031-7837 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |oclc=612174151 |id= |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2877788 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcat.inist.fr%2F%3FaModele%3DafficheN%26cpsidt%3D2877788&amp;date=2010-07-13 |archivedate=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish was the official language of the [[First Philippine Republic|Malolos Republic]], "for the time being", according to the [[Malolos Constitution]] of 1899.&lt;ref name=1897and1899&gt;The [[Malolos Constitution]] was written in Spanish, and no official English translation was released. Article 93 read, "Artículo 93.° El empleo de las lenguas usadas en Filipinas es potestativo. No puede regularse sino por la ley y solamente para los actos de la autoridad pública y los asuntos judiciales. Para estos actos se usará por ahora la lengua castellana.";&lt;br /&gt;A literal translation originally printed as exhibit IV, Volume I, ''Report of the Philippine Commission to the President'', January 31, 1900, Senate Document 188. Fifty-sixth Congress, first session.) read, "ART.93 The use of the languages spoken in the Philippines is optional. It can only be regulated by law, and solely as regards acts of public authority and judicial affairs. For these acts, the Spanish language shall be used for the time being.", {{Harvnb|Kalaw|1927||p=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=philamer;cc=philamer;idno=afj2233.0001.001;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=463;page=root;size=s 443]}};&lt;br /&gt;
In 1972, the Philippine Government [[National Historical Institute]] (NHI) published {{Harvnb|Guevara|1972}}, which contained a somewhat different English translation in which Article 93 read, "Article 93. The use of languages spoken in the Philippines shall be optional. Their use cannot be regulated except by virtue of law, and solely for acts of public authority and in the courts.

===Official language===
{{main article|Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language}}
Spanish remained an official language of government until a new constitution ratified on January 17, 1973 designated English and [[Filipino language|Pilipino]], spelled in that draft of the constitution with a "P" instead of the more modern "F", as official languages. Shortly thereafter, Presidential Proclamation No. 155 dated March 15, 1973 ordered that the Spanish language should continue to be recognized as an official language so long as government documents in that language remained untranslated. A later constitution ratified in 1987 designated [[Filipino language|Filipino]]&lt;!--with an "F"--&gt; and English as official languages.&lt;ref name="official languages"&gt;Article XIV, Section 3 of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1935-constitution.html 1935 Philippine Constitution] provided, "[...] Until otherwise provided by law, English and Spanish shall continue as official languages." The [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1943-constitution.html 1943 Philippine Constitution] (in effect during occupation by Japanese forces, and later repudiated) did not specify official languages. Article XV, Section 3(3) of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1973-constitution.html 1973 Philippine constitution] ratified on January 17, 1973 specified, "Until otherwise provided by law, English and Pilipino shall be the official languages.

===Influence===
There are thousands of Spanish [[loanword]]s in 170 native [[Philippine languages]], and Spanish orthography has influenced the spelling system used for writing most of these languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emanila.com/news/opinion/ggrivera_2001_04_10_opinion_tagalog.html |title=The evolution of the native Tagalog alphabet |first=Guillermo |last=Gómez Rivera |authorlink=Guillermo Gómez Rivera |date=April 10, 2001 |publisher=Emanila Community ([http://emanila.com/main/ emanila.com]) |at=Views &amp; Reviews |location=Philippines |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rhjRPCO9?url=http://emanila.com/news/opinion/ggrivera_2001_04_10_opinion_tagalog.html |archivedate=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Spanish colonial period===
[[File:Lopez de Legazpi.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] just outside [[Fort San Pedro]], [[Cebu City]]]]
{{See also|History of the Philippines|History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish Empire|History of Spain}}

Spanish was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador, [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of [[Cebu Island|Cebú]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|pp=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines, ruled first from [[Mexico City]] and later from [[Madrid]], was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish territory]] for 333 years (1565–1898).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=80, 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling was a priority, however. The [[Augustinians]] opened a school immediately upon arriving in Cebú in 1565; the [[Franciscan]]s followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.&lt;ref name=Arcilla1994p50&gt;{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its [[missionary|missionaries]] was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish.  The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as [[translator]]s, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |title=Language and Desire in Hiligaynon|work=[http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers.html Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics] |first=Corazón |last=Villareal |date=January 17–20, 2006 |location=Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines |page=9 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111134034/http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |archivedate=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |quote=But the real authors were really the Ladinos, natives from the Philippine who were the informants, translators, or even better, consultants of the missionaries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 19th century, the natives generally were not taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator [[Gaspar Aquino de Belén]]. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in the [[Tagalog language]]. [[Pasyon]] is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Belén, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the [[corrido]], provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the [[Philippine languages|regional languages]] for the illiterate majority.

In the early 17th century, a Tagalog-Chinese printer, Tomás Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn [[Names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]]. His book, published by the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] press where he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas's ''Arte''. Unlike the missionary's grammar (which Pinpin had set in type), the Tagalog native's book dealt with the language of the dominant rather than the subordinate other. Pinpin's book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, Tagalog conversion in the early colonial period.

[[Image:La Illustracion Filipina (1892).jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Luna]] featured on the cover of a Spanish periodical]]
By law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the [[catechism|Christian catechism]]. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. This discouraged the attendance at school and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a [[barrio]] or group of barrios had to have a priest's residence, a town hall, boys' and girls' schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops—several of whom served the churches in [[Hispanic America]]. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the [[Ilustrados]]. In 1846, French traveler [[Jean Baptiste Mallat]] was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were.&lt;ref name=Arcilla1994p50 /&gt; In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (''Normal School'', later [[Philippine Normal University]]), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Beck | first = Sanderson | title =Summary and Evaluation | url=http://www.san.beck.org/21-Summary.html#a6 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Boletín de Cebú'', the first Spanish newspaper in [[Cebu City]], was published in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Newspaper | url=http://www.ngkhai.com/pointcebu/culture/newspaper.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread, to the point where it has been estimated at around 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez-Ponga"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodríguez-Ponga}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1898 book "Yesterdays in the Philippines", covering a period beginning in 1893, the American [[Joseph Earle Stevens]], an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:
{{cquote|
Spanish, of course, is the court and commercial language and, except among the uneducated native who have a lingua of their own or among the few members of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] colony, it has a monopoly everywhere. No one can really get on without it, and even the Chinese come in with their peculiar [[pidgin]] variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|1898|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tp3eGtu54vgC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Long contact between Spanish and the local languages, Chinese dialects, and later Japanese produced a series of pidgins, known as '''Bamboo Spanish''', and the Spanish-based creole [[Chavacano]].  At one point these were the language of a substantial proportion of the Philippine population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penny|Penny|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjcrhyQlFa0C&amp;pg=PA29 29–30]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsurprisingly, given that the Philippines was administrated for centuries from [[New Spain]] in present-day [[Mexico]], Philippine Spanish is broadly similar to [[Spanish language in the United States|American Spanish]], not only in vocabulary, but in pronunciation and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penny|Penny|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjcrhyQlFa0C&amp;pg=PA30 30]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Philippines were not as culturally hispanized as [[Hispanic America]], the Spanish language was the official language used by the civil and judicial administration, and was spoken by the majority of the population and understood by just everyone, especially after the passing of the Education Decree of 1863. By the end of the 19th century, Spanish was a strong second language among the upper classes of Philippine society, having been learned in childhood either directly from parents and grandparents or through tutoring by a local priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul A. Kramer|title=Blood of Government: Race, Empire, the United States, and the Philippines: Race, Empire, the United States, and the Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_Lx0KCui5IC|year=2006|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-7717-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K_Lx0KCui5IC&amp;pg=PA61 61]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Spanish rule came to an end, Spanish was spoken as a second language by more than 60% of the population.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;

====Schools====

{{Main article|Philippines education during Spanish rule}}

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the oldest educational institutions in the country were set up by Spanish religious orders. These schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in [[Intramuros]] was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ateneo"&gt;{{cite web | title =The First Hundred Years Of The Ateneo de Manila | url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=348 | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, the [[University of San Carlos]] in Cebú, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the [[University of Santo Tomás]], considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of these schools, as well as of the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letrán]], established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women known as Beaterios was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught Religion, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic with Music and Embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in the language as well. In 1859, [[Ateneo de Manila University]] was established by the [[Jesuits]] as the Escuela Municipal.&lt;ref name="ateneo"/&gt;

In 1863, Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] decreed the establishment of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system, following the requests of the Spanish authorities in the islands, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of the Spanish language was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Historical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System  | url =http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | accessdate =2010-06-29  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160809/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | archivedate =2011-07-16  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EDUCATION | url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261. The total public schools was 841 for boys and 833 for girls and the total number of children attending these schools was 135,098 boys and 95,260 girls. In 1892, the number of schools had increased to 2,137, 1,087 of which were for boys and 1,050 for girls.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure was at the vanguard of contemporary Asian countries, and led to an important class of educated natives which sometimes followed their studies abroad, like national hero [[José Rizal]], who studied in Europe. This class of writers, poets and intellectuals is often referred to as [[Ilustrados]]. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century, that Spanish literature and press flourished. This was the result both of a majority of Spanish-speaking population, as well as the partial freedom of the press which the American rulers allowed.

====Filipino nationalism and 19th century revolutionary governments====
[[File:bandera 03.jpg|thumb|left|Early flag of the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Filipino revolutionaries]] ("Long live the Philippine Republic!"). The first two constitutions were written in Spanish.]]
{{See also|Filipino nationalism|Philippine revolts against Spain|Propaganda Movement|La Solidaridad|Philippine Revolution}}

Before the 19th century, [[Philippine revolts against Spain|Philippine revolts]] were small-scale and did not extend beyond linguistic boundaries. Thus, they were easily neutralized by Spanish forces.&lt;ref name=firstfilipino&gt;{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the small period of the spread of Spanish through a free public school system (1863) and the rise of an educated class, nationalists from different parts of the archipelago were able to communicate in a [[lingua franca|common language]].

[[File:la-solidaridad2.jpg|thumb|[[Propaganda]] in Spanish]]
Spanish was used by the first Filipino patriots like [[José Rizal]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. The 1896 Biak-na-Bato Constitution and the 1898 Malolos Constitution were both written in Spanish. Neither specified a national language, but both recognised the continuing use of Spanish in Philippine life and legislation.&lt;ref name=1897and1899 /&gt;&lt;ref name=andrewgonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114194404/http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-14|format=PDF|last=Gonzalez|first=Andrew|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|title=The Language Planning Situation in the Philippines|year=1998|volume=19|issue=5&amp;6|page=513|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguinaldo was more comfortable speaking Tagalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzalez|1998|p=521}} (Note 7)&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish was used to write the [[Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]], [[Malolos Constitution]], the original [[national anthem]], ''Himno Nacional Filipino'', as well as nationalistic propaganda material and literature.

The country's first two constitutions and historic novels were written in Spanish.  While widely understood by the majority of the population, Spanish at this time was the unifying language since Tagalog was not as prominent or ubiquitous as it is today and each region had their own culture and language, and would rather speak in their local languages. Before the spread of Filipino nationalism, the natives of each region still thought of themselves as [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] etc., and not as Filipinos.

The term "Filipino" originally referred to the natives of the Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called the natives "Filipinos," in his book ''Relación de las Islas Filipinas'' (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call the natives ''Indios''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonroyeca.blogspot.com/2012/11/sino-ang-mga-orihinal-na-pilipino.html|title=Jon E. Royeca|author=Jon E. Royeca|work=jonroyeca.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the colonial era, the Spaniards born in the Philippines, who were more known as insulares, criollos, or Creoles, were also called "Filipinos." [[Spain|Spanish-born]] Spaniards or mainland Spaniards residing in the Philippines were referred to as [[Peninsulares]]. Peoples born in Spanish America or in the North American continent of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] who were residing in the Philippines were collectively referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Americanos]]. The Catholic [[Austronesian peoples]] of the Philippines were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Indios]] and for those who were practicing the [[Islamic faith]], [[Moro people|Moros]]. The indigenous [[Aeta peoples|Aetas]] were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Negritos]]. [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] settlers were called [[Sangley]]es. Japanese settlers were called [[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|Japoneses]]. Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as [[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Mestizos]] or [[Tornatrás]]. In the 1800s, the term "Filipino" gradually became synonymous to anyone born in the Philippines regardless of ethnicity through the effort of the [[Criollo people|Insulares]], from whom, [[Filipino nationalism]] began.

In 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking [[Ilustrados]] (The Enlightened Ones), which included the Insulares, the Indios, the Mestizos, the Tornatrás, etc., were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Philippine Classical Literature]] which developed in the 19th century.

José Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. One material highly instrumental in developing nationalism was the novels entitled ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' which exposed the abuses of the colonial government and clergy composed of Peninsulares. The novels' very own notoriety propelled its popularity even more among Filipinos. Reading it was forbidden because it exposed and parodied the Peninsulares in the Philippine Islands.

The revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic|Malolos Republic]] of 1899 designated the Spanish language for official use in its [[Malolos Constitution|constitution]], drawn up during the Constitutional Convention in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]].&lt;ref name=1897and1899 /&gt;&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =1899 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines Title XIV Article 93 | url=http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1899-constitution.html | accessdate = 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the nascent republic published a number of laws, acts, decrees, and other official issuances. These were published variously in the Spanish, English, and Tagalog languages, with the Spanish language predominating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guevara|1972|p=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=philamer;cc=philamer;idno=aab1246.0001.001;size=S;frm=frameset;seq=12;page=root;view=image Contents]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish was also designated the official language of the [[Cantonal Republic of Negros]] of 1898 and the [[Republic of Zamboanga]] of 1899.&lt;ref name="zamboanga"/&gt;

Many Spanish-speaking Filipino families perished during the Philippine–American War. According to the historian James B.

By law, the [[Taft Commission]] allowed their guests to use the language of their choice.&lt;ref name=escalante2007p88&gt;{{Harvnb|Escalante|2007|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the partial freedom of the press allowed by the American rulers served to further promote Spanish-language literacy among the masses. Even in the early 20th century, a [[hegemony]] of Spanish language was still in force.&lt;ref name="florentino"/&gt;

While the census of 1903 and of 1905 officially reported that the number of Spanish-speakers have never exceeded 10% of the total population during the final decade of the 19th century, it only considered Spanish speakers as their first and only language. It disregarded the Catholic [[Chinese Filipino]]s, many of whom spoke Spanish, and the creole-speaking communities.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt; Furthermore, those who were academically instructed in the public school system also used Spanish as their second or third language. These together would have placed the numbers at more than 60% of the 9,000,000 Filipinos of that era as Spanish-speakers.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;

In the Eighth Annual Report by the Director of Education, David P. Barrows, dated August 1, 1908, the following observations were made about the use and extension of the Spanish language in the Philippines:&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eighth Annual Report, David P.

...as I traveled through the Philippine Islands, using ordinary transportation and mixing with all classes of people under all conditions. Although based on the school statistics it is said that more Filipinos speak English than any other language, no one can be in agreement with this declaration if they base their assessment on what they hear...

Spanish is everywhere the language of business and social intercourse...In order for anyone to obtain prompt service from anyone, Spanish turns out to be more useful than English...And outside of Manila it is almost indispensable. The Americans who travel around all the islands customarily use it.

The use of Spanish as an official language has been extended to January 1, 1920. Its general use seems to be spreading. Natives acquiring it learn it as a living speech. Everywhere they hear it spoken by leading people of the community and their ears are trained to its pronunciation. On the other hand, they (the natives) are practically without phonic standards in acquiring English and the result is that they learn it as a book language rather than as a living speech. | Henry Jones Ford}}

Although the English language had begun to be heavily promoted and used as the medium of education and government proceedings, the majority of literature produced by indigenous Filipinos during this period was in Spanish.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez-Ponga"/&gt; Among the great Filipino literary writers of the period were Fernando M.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Guerrero, Rafael Palma, Cecilio Apóstol, [[Jesús Balmori]], Manuel Bernabé, Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Teodoro M.

Until the Second World War, Spanish was the language of Manila.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez-Ponga" /&gt; After the war, the English-speaking U.S. having won three wars [in 1898, against Spain ([[Spanish–American War]]); in 1913 (from [[Philippine–American War]] to [[Moro Rebellion]]) against the Filipino independence; in 1945 against Japan ([[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Campaign]])], the English language was imposed.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez-Ponga" /&gt;

The Spanish language flourished in the first two decades of the 20th century due to the partial freedom of the press and as an act of defiance against the new rulers. Spanish declined due to the imposition of English as the official language and medium of instruction in schools and universities.&lt;ref name=forgotten/&gt;&lt;ref name="libradaavelino"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buscoenlaces.es/kaibigankastila/libradav_eng.html |title=The Librada Avelino-Gilbert Newton Encounter (Manila, 1913) |first=Guillermo |last=Gómez Rivera |authorlink=Guillermo Gómez Rivera |date=February 11, 2001 |publisher=Buscoenlaces ([http://www.buscoenlaces.es/ buscoenlaces.es]) |location=Spain |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rxQ7TiDi?url=http://www.buscoenlaces.es/kaibigankastila/libradav_eng.html |archivedate=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American administration increasingly forced editorials and newspapers to switch to English, leaving Spanish in a marginal position, so that [[Zobel de Ayala family|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]] founded the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]] and the Premio Zóbel in 1924 to help maintain and develop the use of Spanish among the Filipino people.

On September 11, 2012, saying that there were 318 Spanish-trained basic education teachers in the Philippines, Philippine secretary of the Department of Education [[Armin Luistro]] announced an agreement with the [[Chile|Chilean]] government to train Filipino school teachers in Spanish.

==Current status==
Since the independence of the Philippines from Spain (1898), the dialect has lost most of its speakers and it might be now close to disappearing.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and continued to serve as a [[lingua franca]] until the first half of the 20th century. In the last decades its use has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_es/zonas_es/asia-pacifico/ari27-2009|title=Nuevas perspectivas para la lengua española en Filipinas (ARI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New developments in the Philippines are slowly reversing this trend.

In December 2007, former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in [[Spain]] that require the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mecd.gob.es/filipinas/en_PH/estudiar/en-filipinas|title=Spanish in Philippine Public High School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref name=SpanishGMA2 --&gt;

The presidential decision had immediate results. The Under-Secretary of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], Vilma L. Labrador, circulated a Memorandum (17/XII/2007), on the ''"Restoration of the Spanish language in Philippine Education"''. In it, the Department mandates secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish.

There has been a resurgence of learning Spanish among Filipinos, for various reasons. Interest in the language and recuperation of it as part of their history, namely their written, cultural history, interest in their connection to the Spanish-speaking world, among others.

Due to the huge demand for Spanish speakers among [[business process outsourcing]] companies in the Philippines, Filipinos are flocking to [[Instituto Cervantes]] and other language centers in order to learn Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/hola-asian-call-centers-lure-back-spanish|title=Hola!

===Media===
Spanish-language media was present in the 2000s with one Spanish newspaper, ''[[E-Dyario]]'', the first Spanish digital newspaper published in the Philippines, and ''[[Filipinas, Ahora Mismo]]'' was a nationally syndicated, 60-minute, cultural radio magazine program in the Philippines broadcast daily in Spanish for two years in the 2000s. Since the emergence of [[social media]], Spanish speaking Filipinos have tended to use these more modern forms to continue publishing in Spanish language.

==Influence on the languages of the Philippines==

{{See also|Old Spanish language|Linguistic history of Spanish}}

There are approximately 4,000 Spanish words in Tagalog (between 20% and 33% of Tagalog words),&lt;ref name="newprospects"/&gt; and around 6,000 Spanish words in Visayan and other Philippine languages. The Spanish counting system, calendar, time, etc. are still in use with slight modifications. Archaic Spanish words have been preserved in Tagalog and the other vernaculars, such as {{wiktspa|pera}} (''coins''), {{wiktspa|sabón}} [{{wiktspa|jabón}}) at the beginning of Spanish rule, the ''j'' used to be pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] or the "sh" sound; (''soap'')], {{wiktspa|relos}} [({{wiktspa|reloj}}) with the ''j'' sound; (''watch'')], {{wiktspa|kwarta}} ({{wiktspa|cuarta}}; ''money''), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =El español en Filipinas | url =http://spanish-differences.com/Spanish/Philippines-Spanish.php | archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5rDzFAFMZ?url=http://spanish-differences.com/Spanish/Philippines-Spanish.php | archivedate =July 14, 2010 | accessdate =July 19, 2010 | deadurl =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards and the language are referred to as either ''Kastila'' or ''Katsila'' (mostly [[Visayan languages]]) after {{wiktspa|Castilla}} (''[[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]''), the original Spanish Kingdom under which Spain was unified in 1492, which later became a Spanish region.

[[Chavacano]] (also called Zamboangueño), is a Spanish-based creole language spoken mainly in the southern province of Zamboanga and, to a much lesser extent, in the province of Cavite in the northern region of [[Luzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/chabacano.pdf |title=Chabacano, Spanish and the Philippine Linguistic Identity |last=Lipski |first=John M. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rE518HM7?url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/chabacano.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavacano became the main language in the [[Zamboanga City]] and some parts of [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], as a result of the migration into the area of a large number of workers, who came from different linguistic regions to build military and other Spanish establishments.

Although the greatest linguistic impact and [[loanword]]s have been from Spanish to the languages of the Philippines, the [[Philippine languages]] have also loaned some words to Spanish.

The following are some of the words of Philippine origin that can be found in the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]]'', the dictionary published by the [[Real Academia Española]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =REAL ACADEMIA ESPAÑOLA | url=http://www.rae.es/rae.html | accessdate = 2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Patent 9,618,286 Fig. 5C, 5D.png|alt=Image from patent 9,618,286 for a pistol magazine speedloader.

This design automatically pivots the cartridges, allowing them to enter pistol and center-feed magazines. Shown is a [[9×19mm Parabellum|9x19mm]] round entering a [[Glock|Glock 17]] magazine.]]

A '''speedloader''' is a [[tool|device]] used to reduce the time and/or effort needed to reload a firearm. Speedloaders come in variety of forms for reloading [[revolvers]] or with fixed (attached) or detachable magazines.

Generally, speedloaders are used for loading all chambers of a [[revolver]] simultaneously, although speedloaders (of different designs) are also used for the loading of fixed tubular magazines of [[shotgun]]s and [[rifle]]s, or (with other designs) the loading of box or drum magazines. Revolver speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing-out cylinders or top-break cylinders. Non-top-break cylinder revolvers having fixed cylinders must be unloaded and loaded one chamber at a time.

==Revolver speedloaders==
===Circular reloaders===
[[Image:Remington Diassembly.JPG|thumb|200px|right|An [[Remington Model 1858|1858 New Model Army]] black-powder cap-and-ball revolver replica.  The cylinder has been removed from the frame.]]

The modern revolver circular speedloader holds a full cylinder complement of [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s in a secure fashion, spaced in a circular configuration so as to allow the cartridges to drop simultaneously into the cylinder easily (although non-circular types such as [[half-moon clip]]s are very common as well). A mechanism is provided that allows the cartridges to be released from the speedloader when loaded, so that when it is removed, the cartridges remain in the cylinder. The most common type of speedloader uses a rotating latch. Another type slides the cartridges out an open side; and a third type has a latch that releases when pressed.&lt;ref name=speedloader&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=4614 |title=Definition for 'speedloader' |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolver speedloaders make the process of reloading an appropriately matched revolver much faster than reloading one round at a time (provided you have ready-loaded speedloaders available). Swing-out and top-break revolvers are designed to eject all cartridges with one movement, and speedloaders allow loading with but a single additional step. Speedloaders also provide a convenient way to carry ammunition for a revolver. Speedloaders do not, however, allow revolvers to be reloaded as fast as [[Semi-automatic firearm|semiautomatic]] handguns without considerably more practice.

Prior to the introduction of speedloaders for revolvers, reloading of revolvers was always accomplished by manually loading each cartridge into each chamber from cartridge loops on a belt or [[bandolier]], a cartridge pouch, or other cartridge holder, such as a pocket. In fact, hand-loading is still the most common way of loading a revolver, speedloaders being mostly restricted to competition shooters and those who feel that they need more firepower for their personal defense revolver, since although speedloaders are useful for carrying one or several reloads at ready, one must load the speedloaders themselves prior to using.

Prior to the introduction of modern metallic cartridges, circa 1861–1873, certain models of older black powder cap and ball revolvers could be used with multiple replaceable cylinders functioning as "speedloaders". It was however generally easier to simply buy a second revolver than to locate a cylinder alone, not to mention faster than swapping cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bequette|first=Roy Marcot; edited by James W.|title=Remington: 'America's oldest gunmaker' |year=1998|publisher=Primedia|location=Peoria, IL|isbn=1-881657-00-0|author2=Gangloff, Joel J. Hutchcroft  |others=foreword by Arthur W. Wheaton; introductions by Richard F. Dietz }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the reloading process for a cap and ball revolver was lengthy and time-consuming, carrying already-loaded cylinders with [[percussion cap]]s placed on cylinder nipples was a considerable improvement in reloading time, although this is primarily a "trick" used by modern shooters who are used to having numerous shots available in short time with little work.  When  "spare cylinders" were carried, this practice was primarily done on [[Remington Model 1858|Remington revolver]]s, as their cylinders were easily removable and were held by a cylinder pin, unlike the early [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver|Colt revolver]]s, which were held together by a wedge that went through the cylinder pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/revolvers.htm |title=Civil War Revolvers of The North and South |author=Robert Niepert |publisher=Florida Reenactors Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515011025/http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/revolvers.htm |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moon clip]]s and [[half-moon clip]]s are special speedloaders for use with revolvers that chamber rimless cartridges, such as [[9×19mm Parabellum]] or [[.45 ACP]]. Double-action revolvers are designed to use rimmed cartridges, and the extractors are incapable of removing rimless cartridges. Because of this fact, a different method of extraction must be used. Moon clips are a full circle, and hold a full cylinder of cartridges, while half-moon clips are semicircles that hold half a cylinder full of cartridges.&lt;ref name=moonclip&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=5320 |title=Definition for "moon clip" |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halfmoon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=2684 |title=Definition for "half-moon clip" |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed strips===
Another variation of the speedloader for revolvers is the Speed Strip introduced by [[Bianchi International]]. Intended as an alternative to loose rounds in a pocket or dump pouch, it holds six cartridges in a re-usable [[Neoprene]] plastic strip. The strip operates by placing the cartridges one or two at a time into their respective chambers, and "breaking" the rounds off the strip into the chamber.&lt;ref name=speedstrip&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=4613 |title=Definition for "speed strip" |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine loaders==

Loading a firearm magazine, particularly one with a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds to the top of the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler, which are sometimes called '''speedloaders''' but are more commonly known as '''magazine loaders''', '''stripper clips''', '''spoons''', or '''stripper clip guides'''. The simplest are inexpensive devices that depress the top round in the magazine, allowing the next round to be partially inserted with no pressure on it. These are also called "thumb savers", and address ease of loading more than speed of loading. There are also devices available for certain popular firearms, such as the [[Ruger 10/22]], that accept loose ammunition and will load a round into the magazine with a simple push of a button or turn of a crank. These are more complex and expensive ([[United States dollar|US$]]25 to US$50), but are more truly a speedloader since they do greatly reduce the time required to load a magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Cliploader.htm |title=The Ultimate Cliploader |author=Jeff Quinn |date=July 28, 2004 |journal=GunBlast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stripper clips==
{{Main|Stripper clip}}
A stripper clip is a device that holds a number of rounds, usually from 5 to 10 rounds, and allows them to be inserted into a magazine (fixed or detachable) by attaching the clip to a special bracket and pressing the rounds into place. Military ammunition is often packaged in stripper clips, which, in older [[bolt action]] rifles, could be loaded directly into the rifle's fixed magazine using a bracket machined into the rifle's action, or in modern rifles by the use of an adapter or guide that attaches the stripper clip to a detachable magazine.&lt;ref name=stripper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=1653 |title=Definition for "cartridge clip" |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shotgun and rifle quickloaders==
While much less common than revolver speedloaders, speedloaders for tubular magazines, called ''quickloaders'', have been around for many years and offer many of the same quick reloading ability benefits. The simplest quickloader of this type is the one used for [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] rifles with front loading tubular magazines. In this case, the quickloader is simply a tube that contains a magazine-capacity number of cartridges, with a seal at one end and a gate at the other. To load the magazine, the follower is removed, the rifle is pointed upwards, the tube is placed over the end of the magazine, and the gate is opened. [[Gravity]] then pulls the cartridges from the quickloader into the magazine, the quickloader is set aside, and the follower is replaced. Any length of tubing or pipe of the right diameter can be used in this way, with a simple pin through the middle serving as a gate. Commercial rimfire quickloaders often have multiple tubes joined together in parallel, with a single rotating gate. This allows multiple reloads to be carried, with reloading accomplished by simply rotating the gate in line with the next full tube of ammunition.&lt;ref name=quickloader&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=3938 |title=Definition for "quickloader" |publisher=Midway USA GunTec Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shotgun speedloaders are slightly more complex, since shotgun magazines load from the breech. Shotgun speedloaders generally require a special bracket be mounted near the magazine loading port of the gun; many models mount by replacing existing pins that hold the trigger group in the receiver, and so can be installed easily without permanent modification of the gun. This bracket serves to hold the end of the speedloader tube in the correct position to feed the rounds out of the speedloader and into the magazine. The speedloaders themselves consist of a plastic tube containing a slot cut in it, and a plunger that rides in the slot and that forces the rounds into the magazine. Capacity is usually four or five rounds of 2{{frac|3|4}}-inch (70&amp;nbsp;mm) length [[shotgun shell|shells]]. Gravity is not suitable for operating these, as the rounds must be forced into the magazine against the pressure of the magazine spring. Shotgun speedloaders are most commonly encountered in [[action shooting]] sports like [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]] (IPSC) shotgun competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmspringsgunclub.org/3_Guns.htm |title=3 Gun Match |publisher=Palm Springs Gun Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209210741/http://www.palmspringsgunclub.org/3_Guns.htm |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial View - Landschaft Markgräflerland1.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of vineyards in [[Markgräflerland]], Baden, Germany.]]

A '''vineyard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|n|j|ər|d}}) is a [[plantation]] of [[grape]]-bearing [[vine]]s, grown mainly for [[winemaking]], but also [[raisin]]s, [[table grape]]s and non-alcoholic [[grape juice]]. The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as [[viticulture]].

A vineyard is often characterised by its [[terroir]], a [[French language|French]] term loosely translating as "a sense of place" that refers to the specific geographical and geological characteristics of grapevine plantations, which may be imparted in the wine.

==History==
[[File:Berlin Painter fragment volute-krater satyroi.jpg|thumb|[[Satyr]]s in vineyard. [[Attica|Attic]] [[Red figure pottery|red-figure]] volute-[[krater]], ca. 490 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|State Collections of Antiques]] in Munich.]]

The earliest evidence of wine production dates from between 6000 and 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000498.html |title=8,000-year-old wine unearthed in Georgia |work=Archeology |year=2003 |accessdate=24 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine making technology improved considerably with the ancient Greeks but it wasn't until the end of the Roman Empire that cultivation techniques as we know them were common throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 37"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Phillips |title=A Short History of Wine |page=37 |location= |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2000 |isbn=0-06-093737-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] the [[Catholic Church|Church]] was a staunch supporter of wine, which was necessary for the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. During the lengthy instability of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[monastery|monasteries]] maintained and developed viticultural practices, having the resources, security, stability and interest in improving the quality of their vines. They owned and tended the best vineyards in [[Europe]] and ''vinum theologium'' was considered superior to all others.

[[Europe]]an vineyards were planted with a wide variety of the ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' grape. However, in the late 19th century, the [[Great French Wine Blight|entire species was nearly destroyed]] by the [[plant]] [[louse]] ''[[phylloxera]]'' accidentally introduced to Europe from [[North America]]. Native American grapevines include varieties such as ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'', which is resistant to the bug. ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' varieties were saved by being grafted onto the rootstock of Native American varieties, although there is still no remedy for ''phylloxera'', which remains a danger to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.

The quest for vineyard efficiency has produced a bewildering range of systems and techniques in recent years. Due to the often much more fertile [[New World wines|New World]] growing conditions, attention has focussed heavily on managing the vine's more vigorous growth. Innovation in ''palissage'' ([[training of the vine]], usually along a [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]], and often referred to as "canopy management") and [[pruning]] and [[thinning]] methods (which aim to optimize the Leaf Area/Fruit (LA/F) ratio relative to a vineyard's [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]]) have largely replaced more general, traditional concepts like "yield per unit area" in favor of "maximizing yield of desired quality". Many of these new techniques have since been adopted in place of traditional practice in the more progressive of the so-called "Old World" vineyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Jackson |title=Wine Science: Principles, Practice, Perception |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |year=2000 |pages=99–100 |isbn=0-12-379062-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent practices include spraying water on vines to protect them from sub-zero temperatures ([[aspersion]]), new [[grafting]] techniques, soil slotting, and [[mechanical harvesting]]. Such techniques have made possible the development of wine industries in New World countries such as [[Canada]]. Today there is increasing interest in developing [[organic food|organic]], ecologically sensitive and sustainable vineyards. [[Biodynamics]] has become increasingly popular in viticulture. The use of [[drip irrigation (vine)|drip irrigation]] in recent years has expanded vineyards into areas which were previously unplantable.

For well over half a century, [[Cornell University]], the [[University of California, Davis]], and [[California State University, Fresno]], among others, have been conducting scientific experiments to improve viticulture and educating practitioners. The [[research]] includes developing improved grape varieties and investigating pest control. The [[International Grape Genome Program]] is a multi-national effort to discover a genetic means to improving quality, increasing yield and providing a "natural" resistance to pests.

The implementation of mechanical harvesting is often stimulated by changes in labor laws, labor shortages, and bureaucratic complications. It can be expensive to hire labor for short periods of time, which does not square well with the need to reduce production costs and harvest quickly, often at night. However, very small vineyards, incompatible widths between rows of grape vines and steep terrain hinder the employment of machine harvesting even more than the resistance of traditional views which reject such harvesting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Numbers of New World vineyard plantings have been increasing almost as fast as European vineyards are being uprooted. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of U.S. vineyards increased from {{convert|292000|to|954000|acre|km2|disp=or|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while Australian vineyard numbers more than doubled from {{cvt|146000|to|356000|acre|km2|order=flip}} and Chilean vineyards grew from {{cvt|161500|to|415000|acre|km2|order=flip}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The size of individual vineyards in the New World is significant. Europe's 1.6 million vineyards are an average of {{cvt|0.2|km2|acre}} each, while the average Australian vineyard is {{cvt|0.5|km2|acre}}, providing considerable [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]]. Exports to Europe from New World growers increased by 54% in the six years up to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/drink/story/0,,2118898,00.html |title=Grown in Italy, pressed in Sweden, sold as chianti. Europlonk nouveau has arrived |first=Ian |last=Traynor |first2=David |last2=Gow |newspaper=The Guardian |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been significant changes in the kinds of grapes that are grown. For example, in [[Chile]], large areas of low-quality grapes have been replaced with such grapes as [[Chardonnay]] and [[Cabernet Sauvignon]]. In Argentina, due to an economic down-turn, acreage of [[Malbec]] was significantly reduced in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="cfranc1"&gt;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/grape-varieties/red/malbec Malbec], Jancis Robinson.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1990s, during the quality revolution incited by Malbec Pioneer Nicolás Catena Zapata, growers started planting more Malbec, most notably in higher altitudes where cooler temperatures and more intense sunlight yields more concentrated yet smoother and more complex malbecs.&lt;ref name="cfranc2"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/wine/meet-the-man-who-scaled-argentinas-mountains-to-bring-malbec-wine-to-the-world/article20737771/ Meet the man who scaled Argentina’s mountains to bring malbec wine to the world], The Globe and Mail, September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Grape changes are often in response to changing consumer demand but sometimes result from [[vine pull schemes]] designed to promote vineyard change. Alternatively, the development of "T" budding now permits the grafting of a different grape variety onto existing rootstock in the vineyard, making it possible to switch varieties within a two-year period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Local legislation often dictates which varieties are selected, how they are grown, whether vineyards can be irrigated and exactly when grapes can be harvested, all of which in serves to reinforce tradition. Changes in the law can also change which grapes are planted. For example, during [[Prohibition]] in the U.S. (1920–1933), vineyards in [[California]] expanded sevenfold to meet the increasing demand for home-brewing. However, they were largely planted in varieties with tough skins that could be transported across the country to home wine-makers and the resulting wine was of a low quality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
   
According to the [[International Organisation of Vine and Wine]], in April 2015, [[China]] ({{convert|799,000|hectare|disp=or}}) overtook [[France]] ({{convert|792,000|hectare|disp=or}}) in terms of land devoted to vineyards, in second place behind [[Spain]] ({{convert|1,000,200|hectare|disp=or}}), the world's largest producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32480044|title=China overtakes France in vineyards|date=27 April 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terroir==
{{Main|Terroir}}
[[File:La Geria vines.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Malvasia]] grape vines growing in topsoil, covered in [[lapilli]], [[La Geria]], [[Lanzarote (DO)|Lanzarote]], [[Canary Islands]]. The low, curved walls protect the vines from the constant, drying wind.]]

[[File:Novaj - 2015.01.14 (8).JPG|thumb|Wine estate in [[Hungary]]]]
Terroir refers to the combination of natural factors associated with any particular vineyard. These factors include things such as soil, underlying rock, altitude, slope of hill or terrain, orientation toward the sun, and [[microclimate]] (typical rain, winds, humidity, temperature variations, etc.) No two vineyards have exactly the same terroir, although any difference in the resulting wine may be virtually undetectable.

Vineyards are often on located on hillsides and planted in [[soil]] that is of only marginal value to other plants. A common saying is that "the worse the soil, the better the wine." Planting on hillsides, especially those facing north (in the southern hemisphere) or south (in the northern hemisphere), is most often in an attempt to maximize the amount of sunlight that falls on the vineyard. For this reason, some of the best wines come from vineyards planted on quite steep hills, conditions which would make most other agricultural products uneconomic. The stereotypical vineyard site for wine grapes (in the Northern hemisphere) is a hillside in a dry climate with a southern exposure, good drainage to reduce unnecessary water uptake, and balanced pruning to force the vine to put more of its energy into the fruit, rather than foliage.

The terroir philosophy is predominately French in origin, the flavour and character of the place defining the individuality and the special attributes of wines and combined with hundreds of years of the finest wine making traditions, terroir gives wines their distinctive taste and signature.

==Vignette==
A vignette is a 500-square-metre vineyard which is part of a larger consolidated vineyard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Investors purchase a piece of land within a vineyard, and outsource the grape maintenance and production operations to an outside grape grower or wine producers. Because they are contracting under a [[co-op]]erative structure, they benefit from [[economies of scale]] and hence cheaper labour and operational costs.

The '''World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft''' were reporting names, often described as codenames, given by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel to [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] aircraft during the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of World War II. The names were used by Allied personnel to identify aircraft operated by the Japanese for reporting and descriptive purposes. Generally, [[Western world|Western]] men's names were given to [[fighter aircraft]], women's names to [[bombers]], [[Military transport aircraft|transports]], and [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]], bird names to [[glider aircraft|gliders]], and tree names to [[trainer aircraft]].

The use of the names, from their origin in mid-1942, became widespread among Allied forces from early 1943 until the end of the war in 1945.  Many subsequent Western histories of the war have continued to use the names.

During the first year of the Pacific War beginning on 7 December 1941, Allied personnel often struggled to quickly, succinctly, and accurately identify Japanese aircraft encountered in combat. They found the Japanese designation system bewildering and awkward, as it allocated two names to each aircraft. One was the manufacturer's alphanumeric project code, and the other was the official military designation, which consisted of a description of the aircraft plus the year it entered service. For example, the military designation of the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighter was the "Navy Type 96 Carrier Fighter". Type 96 meant that the aircraft had entered service in [[Japanese era name#Imperial year|Imperial year]] 2596, equivalent to [[Gregorian calendar]] year 1936. Other aircraft, however, which had entered service the same year carried the same type number; aircraft such as the [[Aichi D1A|Type 96 Carrier Bomber]] and the [[Mitsubishi G3M|Type 96 Land Attack Bomber]].&lt;ref name="Gam1"&gt;Gamble 2010, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the confusion, the [[United States Army|US Army]] and [[United States Navy|US Navy]] each had their own different systems for identifying Japanese aircraft.&lt;ref name="Dun1"&gt;Dunnigan 1998, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1942, Captain Frank T. McCoy, a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[military intelligence]] officer from the [[38th Bombardment Group]] assigned to the [[Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit]] in Australia, set out to devise a simpler method for identifying Japanese aircraft. Together with Technical Sergeant Francis M. Williams and Corporal Joseph Grattan, McCoy divided the Japanese aircraft into two categories; fighters and everything else. He gave boys' names to the fighters, and the names of girls to the others. Later, training aircraft were named after trees,&lt;ref name="Gam2"&gt;Gamble 2010, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dear and Foot 1995, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; single engine reconnaissance aircraft were given men's names and multi-engine aircraft of the same type were given women's names. Transports were given girls' names that all began with the letter "T". Gliders were given the names of birds.&lt;ref name="Dun1"/&gt;

[[File:A6M3 Model32-common.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M3-32 "Hamp"]] fighters]]
McCoy's system quickly caught on and spread to other US and Allied units throughout the Pacific theater. By the end of 1942, all American forces in the Pacific and east Asia had begun using McCoy's system, and [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] nations adopted the system shortly thereafter. The list eventually included 122 names and was used until the end of World War II. To this day, many Western historical accounts of the Pacific War still use McCoy's system to identify Japanese aircraft.&lt;ref name="Dun1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gamble 2010, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to make the names sound somewhat comical, McCoy gave many of the aircraft '[[hillbilly]]' names, such as "Zeke" and "Rufe," that he had encountered while growing up in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="BandG"/&gt; Others were given names of people the creators of the system knew personally; the [[Mitsubishi G4M]] bomber, with its large gun blisters was named "Betty" in homage to a busty female friend of Williams. The [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" got its name from an [[Australian Army]] sergeant.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble 2010, pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of McCoy's chosen names caught on. Many Allied personnel continued calling the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter]] "Zero" instead of McCoy's name of "Zeke."  Also, McCoy's name for an upgraded version of the Zero, "Hap," in tribute to US Army general [[Henry H. Arnold]], had to be changed to "Hamp" when it was learned that Arnold disapproved.&lt;ref name="Gam2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BandG"&gt;Bergerud 2000, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;
