'''''A View of Religions''''' is an 18th-century comprehensive survey of world religions by the American author, [[Hannah Adams]]. First published in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1784, it was a pioneering work in that it represented denominations from the perspective of their adherents, without imposing Adams' own preferences. The book was divided into sections and passed through several editions, which included minor changes in the name of the work. It was reprinted in England.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=14}} ''A View of Religions'' was Adams' first and principal literary work. It was the result of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. She began thinking on the subject after reading a manuscript from [[Thomas Broughton (writer)|Thomas Broughton]]'s ''Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times'' (1742).{{sfn|Adams|1817|p=1}}

==Development==
[[File:Hannah Adams BostonAthenaeum.png|thumb|left|Hannah Adams]]
Until she was twenty years of age, Adams's reading had been limited mostly to works of imagination and feeling. She had never been directed to those of a controversial nature, nor to a study of the disputed points between the various sects. Her curiosity being awakened by a small manuscript from Broughton's ''Dictionary'', giving an account of some of the most common of the religious denominations, she began to read all she could find on the subject. At about the age of 30,{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}} becoming disgusted with the intolerance and lack of candor of the authors, she decided to write in a blank book what seemed to her to be the truth. In doing this she had no idea of publication. The work grew upon her hands and became known to her friends. Needing money, she was urged to publish it. But to find a printer to take it without immediate pay was the difficulty. She obtained 395 subscribers, 28 of whom were women, including Rev. [[Nathaniel Emmons]], [[Franklin, Massachusetts]] (six copies), Rev. [[Charles Chauncy (1705–1787)|Charles Chauncy]], D. D., Boston, Dr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], president of [[Rhode Island College]], [[Edmund Quincy (1703–1788) |Edmund Quincy]], Esq., Hon. Oliver Wendell, [[Nathaniel Appleton]], Esq., and [[Samuel Adams]], all of Boston.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} The hard study and close reflection were so difficult, that she was attacked before she finished it by a severe fit of illness, and threatened with derangement.{{sfn|Hart|1857|p=172}}

==1784 edition==
[[File:An alphabetical compendium of the various sects (1784).png|thumb|''An alphabetical compendium of the various sects'' (1784)]]
A bargain having been made with the printer, the book appeared in 1784. Its motto is, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good." In the Advertisement at the beginning, the author says she intends to "avoid giving the least preference of one denomination above another, to give a few arguments of the principal sects from their own authors as far as possible, to endeavor to represent every sect, and be very careful to enter into the spirit of each author."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

The condition of public opinion is seen when Thomas Prentiss, pastor of the Congregational Church in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]], in the Preface, felt obliged to say:—{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}} {{quote|text="The world has been absurdly accustomed to entertain but a moderate opinion of female abilities, and to associate their pretended productions to the craft and policy of designing men; either to excite their admiration or screen their weakness from censure; whereas unbiassed reason must allow, if an invidious comparison between the sexes is in any respect justifiable, it cannot be grounded upon a defect of natural ability, but upon the different and perhaps faulty mode of female education; for under similar culture and with equal advantages, it is far from being certain that the female mind would not admit a measure of improvement that would at least equal, and perhaps in many instances eclipse, the boasted glory of the other Her father, with his other children, was living with a married son, to whom the home and property had been made over. Not wishing to add to the burden of her brother's increasing family expenses, Hannah found this the most trying time of her life, when, as she said, " it was a struggle to live." But though feeble in health, dependent upon herself for support, more or less alone in the world, she found in work her only remedy. She began to prepare additions for the second edition of her book. The task being completed, she applied to some printers for terms of publication. "Though," she says, "I wrote nearly the same letter to all, consisting of a few direct questions, their answers were generally various, prolix and ambiguous." She finally accepted an offer of one hundred dollars in books for an edition of one thousand copies. Going to Boston to attend to the matter, a friend introduced her to the Rev. James Freeman, the newly ordained pastor of King's Chapel. He became interested, transacted the business with the printer, John West Folsom, and helped her obtain some new subscribers. For this generous, personal assistance in a time of need, Adams was most grateful to the end of her life.}}

==1791 edition==
In 1791, appeared under the title of ''A View of Religions'', the second edition of her book first published seven years before. It was enlarged to 410 pages. Part First treated of nearly 300 different religious denominations which had appeared from the beginning of the Christian era; Part Second, of the worship of the Grand Lama, of Mahometans, Jews, Deists and Sceptics, followed by a short review of the religions of the people of the habitable world. A discriminating judgment was noticeable in the work. This second edition was dedicated to [[John Adams]], then [[Vice President of the United States]], a name, she said, "which excites the veneration and gratitude of fellow-citizens, the admiration and esteem of foreign nations."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Of the 400 subscribers to this second edition, 82 of whom were clergymen and 16 women, John Adams headed the list with three copies. [[Samuel Adams]], lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, followed. Among the new names gained were those of [[John Hancock]], of Boston; [[Joseph Willard]], D. D., president of [[Harvard College]]; Right Rev. [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Caroll]], D. D., Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; Hon. [[William Bradford (Rhode Island)|William Bradford]], [[governor of Rhode Island]]; Rev. [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]; [[Christopher Gore]], Esq., Boston; [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]], Boston; Rev. Adoniram Judson, Sr., [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]; Hon. Benjamin Greenleaf, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]; and many others. Mr. [[Moses Brown]], of [[Providence, Rhode Island |Providence]], took fifteen copies, and seven of the subscribers took six each.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

Such distinguished names spoke well of Adams's literary ability. The book was pronounced the best of the kind ever written, possibly the first. From its profits, Adams was enabled to pay the debts her sister's illness had contracted, and to put a small sum at interest. In its sale, her father, who was called by the townspeople "Book Adams," was of much help. On horseback, with his saddle-bag full of the books, often reading a volume, he went from place to place, to sell or to distribute them. Of decided literary tastes himself, he was never happier than when making his frequent visits to the library of Harvard College. Once, upon entering it, he lifted up both hands and exclaimed in great earnestness, "I'd rather be librarian of Harvard College than Emperor of all the Russias!" Who knows but that if Thomas Adams could have followed out his early desires, he might have been librarian of Harvard College? Circumstances obliged him to go into business, and he made a failure of it.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

After the publication of the second edition of her book, Adams taught school.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1804 edition==
[[File:A View of Religions (Third edition, 1801).png|thumb|''A View of Religions'' (1801)]]
Two years after the publication of Adams's ''History of New England from the first settlement at Plymouth to the acceptance of the Federal Constitution'', ''A view of religions, in two parts : Part I. Containing an alphabetical compedium of the various religious denominations, which have appeared in the world, from the beginning of the Christian era to the present day. Part II. Containing a brief account of the different schemes of religion now embraced among mankind '' was published, enlarged, and dedicated as before to John Adams. Through the continued kindness of Rev. James Freeman, a bargain was made with the printer whereby she was to receive five hundred dollars in yearly payments, covering a certain period, for the edition of two thousand copies. In 1804 appeared her book of nearly four hundred pages called " Truth and Excellence of the Christian Religion." Her selection of authors and the extracts from their works reveal good judgment and a wide survey of general literature. Not being able to purchase or borrow all the books she needed for this effort, she spent some time in Boston, in order to visit the booksellers' shops. In such places much of the work, as well as the additions to the third edition of her first book, was written. Adams gave this work, with its four hundred subscribers, to the printer for one hundred dollars in books.{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

==1805 edition==
''A View of Religions, in three Parts : Part I. Containing an Alphabetical Compendium of the Denominations among Christians. Part II. Containing a brief Account of Paganism, Mahomedism, Judaism, and Deism. Part III. Containing a View of the Religious of the different Nations of the World. By Hannah Adams. A new Edition, with Corrections and Additions. To which is prefixed, An Essay on Truth, by Andrew Fuller.''  was published in 1805. Griffiths &amp; Griffiths commented:—{{sfn|Griffiths|Griffiths|1807|p=217-}} {{quote|text=The Dictionary appears to be compiled with much fairness; and it contains a long article on the Friends or Quakers, on which peculiar care has been bestowed. To such as are desirous of becoming acquainted with the credenda of this church, the particulars here inserted will be interesting, especially as they are exhibited for the purpose of obviating the representation given by Mr. Evans in his “Sketch of Denominations,” of the similarity of their principles to Sociaianism. The evidence of Barclay is quoted, to prove that the Quakers, while they admit the Scriptures to be of divine authority, do not esteem them “the principal ground of truth, nor the primary rule of faith, but only a secondary rule, subordinate to the spirit.” In the 2d and 3d parts of this work, the reader will meet with curious and amusing accounts of the different religions that now prevail in the several quarters and subdivisions of the globe; and which concludes with stating that the extent of the Christian religion, compared with the parts overspread with Paganism and Mahometanism, is as five to twenty-five.}}

==1817 edition==
[[File:A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations, Jewish, Heathen ... (1817).png|thumb|''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'']]
In 1817 appeared ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations'', dedicated as before to John Adams. This was a popular book from the first. It was published in England with a preface and additions by Mr. Andrew Fuller; also in another form by Mr. Thomas Williams, who likewise made alterations. Adams acknowledged herself indebted to both these editions for some of the improvements in her fourth edition. It received the notice of Jared Sparks in the North American Review; he pronounced it the best manual of the kind he knew of. "It has the peculiar merit," he added, "of the strictest candor and impartiality; and so completely has the author divested herself of all in lividual prepossessions, that it may be doubted whether from a single passage in the whole work her own religious sentiments can be inferred. This freedom from personal bias, in exhibiting the views of others, especially on topics rarely touched without calling out private opinion, inspires confidence in her statements, as well as respect for her judgment and Christian charity."{{sfn|New England Magazine Company|1894|p=364-}}

{{Main article|Genre fiction}}

'''Action fiction''' is the [[literary genre]] that includes [[Spy fiction|spy novels]], [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] stories, tales of terror and intrigue ("[[cloak and dagger]]"), and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]].  This kind of story utilizes [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]], the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] is going to be resolved or what the solution to the puzzle of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=58,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre fiction==
Action fiction is a form of [[genre fiction]] whose subject matter is characterized by emphasis on exciting [[Action (narrative)|action]] sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling.  Action fiction is related to other forms of [[fiction]], including [[action film]]s, [[action game]]s and analogous media in other formats such as [[manga]] and [[anime]]. It  includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action [[comedy]], with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.

[[Image:Salsódromo, Feria de Cali, Colombia.JPG|thumb|right|"La Feria de Cali" (The Cali's Fair)]]
The '''Cali's Fair''' (Dec. 25 - 30) is the most important cultural event in [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], [[Colombia]].  It is a celebration of the region's cultural identity, famous for the Salsa marathon, horse riding parades and dance parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colombia.travel/en/fairs-and-festivals/cali-fair&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "La Feria de Cali" (The Fair of Cali). The Fair has been celebrated since 1957, from December 25 to December 30, and it promotes cultural, ethnical, and musical diversity in the region. Tourism around The Fair is a main driver of the city's economy during the end of the year.

In a few occasions The Fair included Vallenato and Merengue groups from Colombian and surrounding Caribbean countries, and samba schools from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Also, the Fair is known as the "Feria de la Caña" ([[sugar cane]] fair) and "Feria de la salsa" ([[Salsa music]] fair). People enjoy many activities like an opening cabalgata (parade of horseback riders), tascas (international food street), salsa concerts, bullfights (which are under a legal dispute), parades, athletic activities/competitions and cultural exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.donquijote.org/colombian-culture/holidays/feria-de-cali/|title=Feria de Cali, Colombia - Salsa Festival in Cali - don Quijote|website=www.donquijote.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/roosters-and-riders-take-part-in-fair-of-cali-parade-in-colombia-rdwxxxv96bc|title=Roosters and riders take part in Fair of Cali parade in Colombia|first=Foreign|last=Staff|date=28 December 2009|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an international stand point Cali is also known as the "Capital de la Salsa" given the city's infatuation with that type of Afro-Caribbean music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/style/colombia-salsa-clubs.html|title=The Rhythm of Colombia’s Salsa Capital|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/intelligent-travel/2014/02/20/flying-high-in-the-salsa-capital-of-the-world/|title=Flying High in the Salsa Capital of the World|date=20 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/colombia/articles/how-cali-became-the-salsa-capital-of-the-world/|title=How Cali Became the Salsa Capital of the World|first=Harry|last=Stewart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July there is also the Summer Salsa Festival which lasts for one week. It usually includes concerts by the world's great remaining salsa bands as well as dance shows and "melomano" competitions in which salsa connoisseurs try to out do each other by digging deep into the archives of salsa music and related sounds to find and reveal long lost tunes.

==Identity==
From the [[Qin dynasty]] to the late [[Qing dynasty]] (221 BC – AD 1840), the Chinese government divided Chinese people into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[landlord]], [[peasant]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], and [[merchant]]. Landlords and peasants constituted the two major classes, while merchant and craftsmen were collected into the two minor. Theoretically, except for the position of the Emperor, nothing was hereditary.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

China's majority ethnic group, the Han Chinese are an [[East Asia]]n [[ethnic group]] and [[nation]]. They constitute approximately 92% of the population of China,&lt;ref name="ciastat"/&gt; 95% of [[Taiwan]] ([[Han Taiwanese]]),&lt;ref name="Yearbook2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://yearbook.multimedia.ey.gov.tw/enebook/2016yearbook/index.html |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2016 |last= |first= |publisher= |year=2016 |isbn=|location= |pages= |via= |author=Executive Yuan, Taiwan |accessdate=2017-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 76% of [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nptd.gov.sg/Portals/0/Homepage/Highlights/population-in-brief-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216110141/http://www.nptd.gov.sg/Portals/0/Homepage/Highlights/population-in-brief-2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 23% of [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysia]],&lt;ref name="statistics.gov.my"/&gt; and about 17% of the [[World population|global population]], making them the [[List of contemporary ethnic groups|world's largest ethnic group]], numbering over 1.3 billion people.

The term [[Zhonghua Minzu]] ({{lang-zh|s=中华民族|t=中華民族}}) has been used to describe the notion of [[Chinese nationalism]] in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the [[Chinese surname|family name]].

==Regional==
{{Main|List of regions of the People's Republic of China}}
During the 361 years of civil war after the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), there was a partial restoration of [[feudalism]] when wealthy and powerful families emerged with large amounts of land and huge numbers of semi-serfs. They dominated important civilian and military positions of the government, making the positions available to members of their own families and clans.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mortimer Marsh, ''Mandarins: The Circulation of Elites in China, 1600–1900'', Ayer (June, 1980), hardcover, {{ISBN|0-405-12981-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 13, 30&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tang dynasty's yellow{{clarify|date=February 2017}} emergence, the government extended the [[imperial examination]] system as an attempt to eradicate this feudalism. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Table1.jpg]] --&gt;&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Figure1880.jpg]] --&gt;Traditional Chinese culture covers large geographical territories, where each region is usually divided into distinct sub-cultures.

{{Main|Social structure of China}}

Since the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] period, some form of [[Chinese sovereign|Chinese monarch]] has been the main ruler above all. Different periods of history have different names for the various positions within society. Conceptually each imperial or feudal period is similar, with the government and military officials ranking high in the [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], and the rest of the population under regular [[Chinese law]].&lt;ref name="Mente"&gt;Mente, Boye De. [2000] (2000). The Chinese Have a Word for it: The Complete Guide to Chinese thought and Culture. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|0-658-01078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) onwards, traditional Chinese society was organized into a hierarchic system of socio-economic classes known as the [[four occupations]].

However, this system did not cover all social groups while the distinctions between all groups became blurred ever since the [[commercialism|commercialization]] of Chinese culture in the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 CE). [[History of education in China|Ancient Chinese education]] also has a long history; ever since the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618 CE) educated candidates prepared for the imperial examinations which drafted exam graduates into government as [[scholar-bureaucrats]].This led to the creation of a [[meritocracy]], although success was available only to males who could afford test preparation. Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate mastery of the Confucian classics. Those who passed the highest level of the exam became elite scholar-officials known as ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'', a highly esteemed socio-economic position. A major mythological structure developed around the topic of the [[Imperial examination in Chinese mythology|mythology of the imperial exams]]. Trades and crafts were usually taught by a [[Sifu|shifu]]. The female historian [[Ban Zhao]] wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]'' in the [[Han dynasty]] and outlined the [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|four virtues women must abide to]], while scholars such as [[Zhu Xi]] and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] would expand upon this. [[Chinese marriage]] and [[Taoist sexual practices]] are some of the rituals and customs found in society.

With the rise of European economic and military power beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Chinese systems of social and political organization gained adherents in China. Some of these would-be reformers totally rejected China's cultural legacy, while others sought to combine the strengths of Chinese and European cultures. In essence, the history of 20th-century China is one of experimentation with new systems of social, political, and economic organization that would allow for the reintegration of the nation in the wake of dynastic collapse.

==Spirituality and values==
{{Main|Chinese spiritual world concepts|Chinese Buddhism|Chinese mythology}}

Most spirituality are derived from [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The subject of which school was the most influential is always debated as many concepts such as [[Neo-Confucianism]], [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] and many others have come about. [[Reincarnation]] and other [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] concept is a reminder of the connection between real-life and the after-life. In Chinese business culture, the concept of ''[[guanxi]]'', indicating the primacy of relations over rules, has been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Alon, Ilan, ed. (2003), Chinese Culture, Organizational Behavior, and International Business Management, Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; While many [[Chinese mythology#Important mythologies and deities|deities]] are part of the tradition, some of the most recognized holy figures include [[Guan Yin]], the [[Jade Emperor]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

Chinese Buddhism has shaped Chinese culture in a wide variety of areas including [[Chinese literature|art]], politics, [[Chinese literature|literature]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], [[Chinese medicine|medicine]], and material culture.The translation of a large body of Indian Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and the inclusion of these translations together with works composed in China into a printed canon had far-reaching implications for the dissemination of [[Buddhism]] throughout the [[Chinese cultural sphere]], including [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Vietnam]]. Chinese Buddhism is also marked by the interaction between [[religion in India|Indian religions]], Chinese religion, and [[Taoism]].

===Religion===

[[File:Hanging Monastery 02.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Monastery]], a temple with the combination of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].]]

{{Main|Religion in China|Taoism|Chinese folk religion|Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling}}
Chinese religion was originally oriented to worshipping the supreme god [[Shang Di]] during the Xia and Shang dynasties, with the king and diviners acting as priests and using [[oracle bones]]. The Zhou dynasty oriented it to worshipping the broader concept of heaven. A large part of Chinese culture is based on the notion that a spiritual world exists. Countless [[methods of divination]] have helped answer questions, even serving as an alternative to medicine. [[Chinese folklore|Folklores]] have helped fill the gap between things that cannot be explained. There is often a blurred line between myth, religion and unexplained phenomenon. Many of the stories have since evolved into [[traditional Chinese holidays]]. Other concepts have extended to the outside of mythology into spiritual symbols such as [[Door god]] and the [[Imperial guardian lions]]. Along with the belief of the holy, there is also the evil. Practices such as Taoist [[exorcism]] fighting [[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]] and [[jiangshi]] with peachwood swords are just some of the concepts passed down from generations. A few [[Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling|Chinese fortune telling]] rituals are still in use today after thousands of years of refinement.

Taoism is a religious or philosophical tradition of [[China|Chinese]] origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ({{lang|zh|[[Wikt:道|道]]}}, literally "Way", [[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized as ''Dao'']]). The ''Tao'' is a fundamental idea in most [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.&lt;ref name="Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart | last = Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor | first = Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert | publisher = Norton | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780393918472 | location = New York, New York | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism differs from [[Confucianism]] by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order.&lt;ref name="Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164"/&gt; Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: 慈 "compassion", 儉/俭 "frugality", and 谦 "humility". The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yinyang]] (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the ''[[Yijing]]'', which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The "[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]" [[Shen Buhai]] may also have been a major influence, expounding a [[realpolitik]] of wu wei.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, p.48,62–63.

===Philosophy and legalism===

{{Main|Chinese philosophy|Confucianism|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}

Confucianism, also known as Ruism, was always being the official philosophy throughout most of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]]'s history, and mastery of Confucian texts was the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]]. A number of more [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].There was often conflict between the philosophies, e.g. the [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] (not to be confused with Neo-Confucianism) have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian "Asian values".&lt;ref&gt;Bary, Theodore de. {{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm |title=Constructive Engagement with Asian Values |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311041507/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm |archivedate=11 March 2005}}. Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.{{sfnb|Yao|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20religion&amp;f=false 38–47]}} Confucianism developed from what was later called the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] from the teachings of the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the [[Zhou dynasty]] golden age of several centuries before.&lt;ref name="Rickett, Guanzi"&gt;Rickett, Guanzi – "all early Chinese political thinkers were basically committed to a reestablishment of the golden age of the past as early Zhou propaganda described it."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the "proto-Taoist" [[Huang-Lao]], as the official ideology while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.

===Hundred Schools of Thought===

[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers of the Hundred Schools of Thoughts in the Zhou dynasty.]]

{{Main|Hundred Schools of Thought|Mohism|The Art of War|School of Naturalists}}
The Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophies and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BC, during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]] of ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112694/Chinese-philosophy#ref171469 "Chinese philosophy"], Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 4/6/2014&lt;/ref&gt; An era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91219343 Graham, A.C., ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China'' (Open Court 1993).] {{ISBN|0-8126-9087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, but it was also known as the Golden Age of [[Chinese philosophy]] because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. This phenomenon has been called the ''Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought'' (百家爭鳴/百家争鸣; ''bǎijiā zhēngmíng''; ''pai-chia cheng-ming''; "hundred schools contend"). The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and [[social consciousness]] up to the present day in East Asian countries and the East Asian diaspora around the world. The [[intellectual]] society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. This period ended with the rise of the imperial [[Qin Dynasty]] and the subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of dissent]]. A traditional source for this period is the ''Shiji'', or ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]]. The autobiographical section of the ''Shiji'', the "Taishigong Zixu" (太史公自序), refers to the schools of thought described below.

Mohism was an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese philosophy]] of [[logic]], [[rational]] thought and [[science]] developed by the [[academic]] [[scholars]] who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC–c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]''. Another group is the School of the Military (兵家; ''Bingjia'') that studied warfare and strategy; [[Sunzi]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders. The School of Naturalists was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]; [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth).

The ancient written standard was [[Classical Chinese]]. It was used for thousands of years, but was mostly used by scholars and intellectuals which forms the "top" class of the society called "shi da fu (士大夫)". It was difficult but possible for ordinary people to promote to this class by passing written exams. Calligraphy later became commercialized, and works by famous artists became prized possessions. [[Chinese literature]] has a long past; the earliest classic work in Chinese, the ''[[I Ching]]'' or "Book of Changes" dates to around 1000 BC. A flourishing of philosophy during the [[Warring States period]] produced such noteworthy works as Confucius's ''[[Analects]]'' and [[Laozi]]'s ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. (See also: the [[Chinese classics]].) Dynastic histories were often written, beginning with [[Sima Qian]]'s seminal ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', which was written from 109 BC to 91 BC.The Tang Dynasty witnessed a [[Chinese poetry|poetic]] flowering, while the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of Chinese literature were written during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. [[Printmaking]] in the form of [[movable type]] was developed during the [[Song Dynasty]]. Academies of scholars sponsored by the empire were formed to comment on the classics in both printed and handwritten form. Royalty frequently participated in these discussions as well.

Chinese philosophers, writers and poets were highly respected and played key roles in preserving and promoting the culture of the empire. Some classical scholars, however, were noted for their daring depictions of the lives of the common people, often to the displeasure of authorities.At the start of the 20th century, most of the population were still [[illiterate]], and the many mutually-unintelligible languages spoken ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] ([[Cantonese]]), [[Min Nan]] (Ban-lam-gu), [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Hui]], [[Pinghua|Ping]] etc.) in different regions prevented communication with people from other areas. Nevertheless, the written language keeps the communication open and passing the official orders and documentations throughout the entire region of China. Reformers set out to establish a national language, settling on the Beijing-based [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the spoken form. After the [[May 4th Movement]], Classical Chinese was quickly replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], modeled after the vocabulary and grammar of the standard spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Calligraphy==

{{Main|Chinese calligraphy}}

Chinese calligraphy is a form of aesthetically pleasing writing ([[calligraphy]]), or, the artistic expression of human language in a tangible form. This type of expression has been widely practiced in China and has been generally highly esteemed in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] (including, historically, for example, [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Vietnam]]). There are some general standardizations of the various [[East Asian script styles|styles]] of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and [[ink and wash painting]] are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, "Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients."&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including [[Chinese seal|seal]] carving, ornate paperweights, and [[inkstone]]s.

In China, calligraphy is referred to as ''Shūfǎ'' (書法/书法), literally: "the way/method/law of writing";&lt;ref&gt;書 being here used as in 楷书/楷書, etc, and meaning "writing style".&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shodō'' ({{lang|ja|書道/书道}}) in Japan (literally: "the way/principle of writing"); and ''Seoye'' (서예; 書藝) in Korea (literally: "the skill/criterion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=王力古漢語字典|author=Wang Li|year=2000|publisher=中華書局|location=Beijing|isbn=7101012191|page=1118|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; of writing").Chinese calligraphy is normally regarded as one of the "arts" (Chinese 藝術/艺术 {{zh|p=yìshù}}) in the countries where it is practised.  Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one's character (人品)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vincentpoon.com/shodo-and-calligraphy.html|title=Shodo and Calligraphy|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught as a pursuit (－書法; {{zh|p=shūfǎ}}, "the rules of writing [[Han characters]]"&lt;ref&gt;Shu Xincheng 舒新城, ed.

==Literature==
{{Main|Chinese literature}}
The [[Zhou dynasty]] is often regarded as the touchstone of Chinese cultural development. Concepts covered within the [[Chinese classic texts]] present a wide range of subjects including [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], [[Chinese calendar|calendar]], [[Chinese constellation|constellations]] and many others. Some of the most important early texts include the ''[[I Ching]]'' and the ''[[Classic of History|Shujing]]'' within the [[Four Books and Five Classics]]. Many Chinese concepts such as [[Yin and Yang]], [[Qi]], [[Four Pillars of Destiny]] in relation to heaven and earth were theorized in the pre-imperial periods. By the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese culture would embark on a new era with [[written vernacular Chinese]] for the common citizens. [[Hu Shih]] and [[Lu Xun]] would be pioneers in modern literature. After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], the study of Chinese modern literature has gradually been increased over time. Modern-era literature has formed an aspect in the process of forming modern interpretations of nationhood and creation of a sense of national spirit.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

{{Main|Tang poetry}}
Tang poetry refers to [[poetry]] written in or around the time of or in the characteristic style of China's [[Tang dynasty]] (June 18, 618 – June 4, 907, including the 690–705 reign of [[Wu Zetian]]) or follows a certain style, often considered as the [[Golden Age]] of [[Chinese poetry]]. The ''[[Quantangshi]]'' includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Jing-Schmidt, 256, accessed July 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. Two of the most famous poets of the period were [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]]. Tang poetry has had an ongoing influence on world literature and modern and quasi-modern poetry. The ''Quantangshi'' ("Complete Tang Poems") anthology compiled in the early eighteenth century includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-15"&gt;Paragraph 15 in Paul W. Kroll "Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty", chapter 14 in Mair 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Chey, 139, accessed July 17, 2008" may also verify everything here except for the estimate of poems, which was previously given as "almost 50,000". I was unable to check in the GBooks preview. But the Columbia source is better anyway. ~Hijiri88, July 2016. --&gt; The ''[[Quantangwen]]'' (全唐文, "Complete Tang Prose"), despite its name, contains more than 1,500 ''[[fu (poetry)|fu]]'' and is another widely consulted source for Tang poetry.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-15"/&gt; Despite their names, these sources are not comprehensive, and the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang]] in the twentieth century included many ''shi'' and some ''fu'', as well as variant readings of poems that were also included in the later anthologies.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-15"/&gt; There are also collections of individual poets' work, which generally can be dated earlier than the Qing anthologies, although few earlier than the eleventh century.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-16"&gt;Paragraph 16 in Paul W. Kroll "Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty", chapter 14 in Mair 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Only about a hundred Tang poets have such collected editions extant.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-16"/&gt; Another important source is anthologies of poetry compiled during the Tang dynasty, although only thirteen such anthologies survive in full or in part.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-17"&gt;Paragraph 17 in Paul W. Kroll "Poetry of the T'ang Dynasty", chapter 14 in Mair 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Many records of poetry, as well as other writings, were lost when the Tang capital of [[Changan]] was damaged by war in the eighth and ninth centuries, so that while more than 50,000 Tang poems survive (more than any earlier period in Chinese history), this still likely represents only a small portion of the poetry that was actually produced during the period.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-16"/&gt; Many seventh-century poets are reported by the 721 imperial library catalog as having left behind massive volumes of poetry, of which only a tiny portion survives,&lt;ref name="columbia 14-16"/&gt; and there are notable gaps in the poetic œuvres of even Li Bai and Du Fu, the two most celebrated Tang poets.&lt;ref name="columbia 14-16"/&gt;

===''Ci'' in Song dynasty===
[[File:ShuYuTai.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The study house of [[Li Qingzhao]] (李清照), who was a famous Chinese Ci writer and poet in the Song dynasty.]]
{{Main|Ci (poetry)}}
Ci (辭/辞) are a poetic form, a type of [[lyric poetry]], done in the tradition of [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. ''Ci'' use a set of [[poetic meter]]s derived from a base set of certain patterns, in fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and variable line-length formal types, or model examples: the rhythmic and tonal pattern of the ''ci'' are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes. They are also known as ''Changduanju'' (長短句/长短句, "lines of irregular lengths") and ''Shiyu'' (詩餘/诗馀, "that which is beside poetry").Typically the number of [[Chinese character|characters]] in each line and the arrangement of [[Tonal language|tones]] were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called ''cípái'' 詞牌/词牌. Originally they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with set rhythm, [[rhyme]], and tempo. The [[Song dynasty]] was also a period of great scientific literature, and saw the creation of works such as [[Su Song]]'s ''Xin Yixiang Fayao'' and [[Shen Kuo]]'s ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. There were also enormous works of historiography and large encyclopedias, such as [[Sima Guang]]'s ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' of 1084 or the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' fully compiled and edited by the 11th century. [[Listing of noted Confucianists|Notable Confucianists]], [[Listing of noted Taoists|Taoists]] and scholars of all classes have made significant contributions to and from documenting history to authoring saintly concepts that seem hundred of years ahead of time. Although the oldest surviving textual examples of surviving ''ci'' are from 8th century CE [[Dunhuang manuscripts]],&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, 216&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in the [[Six dynasties poetry|poetry]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]], the ''ci'' followed the tradition of the ''[[Shi Jing]]'' and the ''[[yuefu]]'': they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre; although in the case of the ''ci'' form some of its fixed-rhythm patterns have an origin in [[Central Asia]]. The form was further developed in the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Although the contributions of [[Li Bai|Li Bo]] (also known as Li Po, 701 – 762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet [[Wen Tingyun]] (812–870) was a great master of the ''ci'', writing it in its distinct and mature form.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, lxvii&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was [[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]] Dynasty during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. However, the ''ci'' form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the [[Song poetry|poetry of the Song Dynasty]], during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the ''ci'' poetry form occurred during the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Qing Dynasty]] which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its valorization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a ''ci'' poem or a linked group of ''ci'' poems in an application of the ''[[chuanqi]]'' form of short story tales to poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, 76–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qu'' in Yuan dynasty===
{{Main|Qu (poetry)}}

The ''Qu'' form of poetry is a type of [[Classical Chinese poetry forms|Classical Chinese poetry form]], consisting of words written in one of a number of certain, set [[tone pattern]]s, based upon the tunes of various songs. Thus '''''Qu''''' poems are lyrics with lines of varying longer and shorter lengths, set according to the certain and specific, fixed patterns of rhyme and tone of conventional musical pieces upon which they are based and after which these matched variations in lyrics (or individual '''''Qu''''' poems) generally take their name.&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 306–308&lt;/ref&gt; The fixed-tone type of verse such as the '''''Qu''''' and the ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' together with the ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' forms of poetry comprise the three main forms of [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. In [[Chinese literature]], the '''''Qu''''' ({{Zh|c=曲|p=qǔ|w=chü}}) form of poetry from the [[Yuan dynasty]] may be called ''Yuanqu'' (元曲 P: ''Yuánqǔ'', W: ''Yüan-chü''). Qu may be derived from [[Chinese opera]], such as the ''[[Zaju]]'' (雜劇/杂剧), in which case these Qu may be referred to as ''[[Chinese Sanqu poetry|sanqu]]'' (散曲). The ''San'' in ''Sanqu'' refers to the detached status of the ''Qu'' lyrics of this verse form: in other words, rather than being embedded as part of an opera performance the lyrics stand separately on their own. Since the ''Qu'' became popular during the late [[Southern Song]] Dynasty, and reached a special height of popularity in the [[Yuan poetry|poetry]] of the Yuan dynasty, therefore it is often called ''Yuanqu'' (元曲), specifying the type of ''Qu'' found in [[Chinese opera]] typical of the Yuan dynasty era. Both ''Sanqu'' and ''Ci'' are lyrics written to fit a different melodies, but ''Sanqu'' differs from ''Ci'' in that it is more colloquial, and is allowed to contain ''Chenzi'' (襯字/衬字 "filler words" which are additional words to make a more complete meaning). ''Sanqu'' can be further divided into ''Xiaoling'' (小令) and ''Santao'' (散套), with the latter containing more than one melody.

Dating from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, they are well-known to most Chinese either directly or through their many adaptations to [[Chinese opera]] and other [[popular culture]] media.They are among the world's longest and oldest novels&lt;ref name=talk/&gt; and are considered to be the pinnacle of China's achievement in classic novels, influencing the creation of many stories, plays, movies, games, and other forms of entertainment throughout countries in [[East Asia]], including [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]].

Chinese fiction, rooted in narrative classics such as ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'', ''[[Sou Shen Ji]]'', ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua]]'', ''[[Da Tang Xiyu Ji]]'', ''[[Youyang Zazu]]'', ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'', and official histories, developed into the [[novel]] as early as the [[Song Dynasty]]. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th to 18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and were more historically minded. They appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, and relative emphasis on collective behavior and the welfare of the society.{{sfnb|Ropp|1990|p=310-311}}

The rise of a money economy and urbanization beginning in the Song era led to a professionalization of entertainment which was further encouraged by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy, and education. In both China and Western Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]] was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of novels. The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties represented a pinnacle of classic Chinese fiction.{{sfnb|Ropp|1990|p=311}} The scholar and literary critic [[Andrew H. Plaks]] argues that ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Water Margin'', ''Journey to the West'', and ''[[The Golden Lotus]]'' collectively constituted a technical breakthrough reflecting new cultural values and intellectual concerns. Their educated editors, authors, and commentators used the [[Narrative|narrative conventions]] developed from [[Huaben (Chinese novella)|earlier story-tellers]], such as the episodic structure, interspersed songs and folk sayings, or speaking directly to the reader, but they fashioned self-consciously ironic narratives whose seeming familiarity camouflaged a Neo-Confucian moral critique of late Ming decadence. Plaks explores the textual history of the novels (all published after their author's deaths, usually anonymously) and how the ironic and satiric devices of these novels paved the way for the great novels of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew H. Plaks, ''Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1987), esp. pp. 497–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Plaks further shows these Ming novels share formal characteristics.

===Hanfu===
[[File:Gu Hongzhong 15.jpg|thumb|12th-century Chinese painting of ''[[Gu Hongzhong|The Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|韓熙載夜宴圖}}) showing Han Chinese clothing of the era.]]

From the beginning of its history, Han clothing (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from [[silk]], supposedly discovered by the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Emperor's]] consort, [[Leizu]]. The dynasty to follow the Shang, the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]], established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one's rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the ''yi'' closed. The ''yi'' was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as ''jiaoling youren'', or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged [[left-handedness]] like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate). The [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC – 1000 BC), developed the rudiments of ''Hanfu''; it consisted of a ''yi'', a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called ''chang'', worn with a ''bixi'', a length of fabric that reached the knees.  Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time. Some research claim that historical records in [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties also used this term "Hanfu" to refer the traditional dress of Han people,&lt;ref name="李冬青"&gt;{{cite journal |script-title=zh:汉服的文化意義及傳承方式研究|author=Li Dongqing (李冬青) |journal=遼寧絲綢&lt;!-- |accessdate=2014-09-21 --&gt;|issue=|year=2014|volume=2014年第2期|pages=18–20 |author2=Liu Shou (刘涛)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:《云南志校释》|publisher=中国社会科学出版社|year=1985|page=143页|language=zh|quote={{lang|zh-hant|「裳人，本漢人也。部落在鐵橋北，不知遷徙年月。初襲漢服，後稍参諸戎風俗，迄今但朝霞纏頭，其余無異。」}}|author=Fan Chao (樊綽) |author2=Zhao Lvpu (趙吕甫校释) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-hans|《宋史》：“吾家世為王民，自金人犯邊，吾兄弟不能以死報國，避難入關，今為曦所逐，吾不忍棄漢衣冠，願死於此，為趙氏鬼。”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:《續明紀事本末》|publisher=臺灣大通書局 |year=1957|page=214|language=zh|quote={{lang|zh-hant|「（金）聲桓預作數十棺，全家漢服坐其中，自焚死。」}}|author=Ni Zaitian (倪在田)}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet scholarly research indicates that the modern definition of "Hanfu" was created on [[Baidu Baike]] and other Chinese websites by internet users, and the various styles of clothing during the Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties were referred to by their own names during their respective time periods.&lt;ref name="华梅2007"&gt;{{lang|zh-hans|华梅《汉服堪当中国人的国服吗？》，〈人民日报海外版〉}}，2007-06-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zhang2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn.dincheng.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-ZQNZ200904016.htm |script-title=zh:"汉服运动":互联网时代的种族性民族主义--《中国青年政治学院学报》2009年04期|accessdate=2005-09-01|author=|date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "carrico"&gt;Kevin Carrico, [http://chinaheritage.net/journal/chinas-state-of-warring-styles/?lang=zh A State of Warring Styles]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zhang Xian ({{lang|zh-hant|張跣}}), a [[professor]] of CYUPS([[China Youth University of Political Studies]]), the modern definition of "Hanfu" is a problematic concept publicized by advocates of [[Hanfu movement]].

===Qipao===

[[File:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qianlong Emperor]] (A [[Chinese Emperor]] of [[Qing Dynasty]]) wore Manchurian Chinese clothing – [[Qipao]].(旗袍)]]

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], China's last imperial dynasty, a dramatic shift of clothing occurred, examples of which include the [[cheongsam]] (or qipao in Mandarin). The clothing of the era before the Qing Dynasty is referred to as [[Hanfu]] or traditional [[Han Chinese clothing]]. Many symbols such as [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] have been used for decorative as well as economic purposes. Among them were the ''[[Banner system|Banners]]'' (''qí''), mostly Manchu, who as a group were called ''Banner People'' ([[wikt:旗人|旗人]] [[pinyin]]: ''qí rén''). [[Manchu]] women typically wore a one-piece dress that retrospectively came to be known as the ''qípáo'' ([[wikt:旗袍|旗袍]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: ''sijigiyan'' or ''banner gown''). The generic term for both the male and the female forms of Manchu dress, essentially similar garments, was ''chángpáo'' ([[wikt:长袍|長袍]]/长袍). The ''qipao'' fitted loosely and hung straight down the body, or flared slightly in an A-line. Under the dynastic laws after 1636, all [[Han Chinese]] in the banner system were forced to adopt the Manchu male hairstyle of wearing a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] as did all Manchu men and dress in Manchu ''qipao.'' However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted and only Han who served as officials were required to wear Manchu clothing, with the rest of the civilian Han population dressing however they wanted. Qipao covered most of the woman's body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes.  The baggy nature of the clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age.  With time, though, the ''qipao'' were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing. The modern version, which is now recognized popularly in China as the "standard" ''qipao'', was first developed in [[Shanghai]] in the 1920s, partly under the influence of Beijing styles. People eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old ''qipao'' to suit their tastes.  Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it had great differences from the traditional ''qipao''. It was high-class [[courtesans]] and celebrities in the city that would make these redesigned tight fitting ''qipao'' popular at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/14703448.html 旗袍起源与哪个民族?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Shanghai it was first known as ''zansae'' or "long dress" (長衫—Mandarin Chinese: chángshān; [[Shanghainese]]: ''zansae''; Cantonese: ''chèuhngsāam''), and it is this name that survives in English as the "cheongsam". Most Han civilian men eventually voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing while Han women continued wearing Han clothing. Until 1911, the changpao was required clothing for Chinese men of a certain class, but Han Chinese women continued to wear loose jacket and trousers, with an overskirt for formal occasions.  The ''qipao'' was a new fashion item for Han Chinese women when they started wearing it around 1925.The original ''qipao'' was wide and loose. As hosiery in turn declined in later decades, cheongsams nowadays have come to be most commonly worn with bare legs.While this development fixated the cheongsam as a one-piece dress, by contrast, the related Vietnamese [[áo dài]] retained trousers.

{{Further|Arts of China}}
Chinese art is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists. The Chinese art in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and that of [[overseas Chinese]] can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and Chinese culture. Early "[[stone age]] art" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple [[pottery]] and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling [[Dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Chinese emperors]], most of which lasted several hundred years.

Chinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

Different forms of art have swayed under the influence of great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political figures. Chinese art encompasses all facets of [[fine art]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]] and [[performance art]]. [[Chinese ceramics|Porcelain pottery]] was one of the first forms of art in the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] period. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Songs]]'', and the Chinese poet and statesman [[Qu Yuan]].

[[Chinese painting]] became a highly appreciated art in court circles encompassing a wide variety of [[Shan shui]] with specialized styles such as [[Ming Dynasty painting]]. Early [[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|Chinese music]] was based on percussion instruments, which later gave away to stringed and reed instruments. By the [[Han dynasty]] [[Chinese Paper Cutting|papercutting]] became a new art form after the invention of paper. [[Chinese opera]] would also be introduced and branched regionally in addition to other performance formats such as [[Chinese variety arts|variety arts]].

===Chinese lantern===

[[File:Red lanterns, Spring Festival, Ditan Park Beijing.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Red lanterns are hung from the trees during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Ditan Park (Temple of Earth) in Beijing.]]

{{Main|Paper lantern|Sky lantern}}
The Chinese paper lantern (紙燈籠, 纸灯笼) is a [[lantern]] made of thin, brightly colored paper.&lt;ref name=freedictionary_lantern&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese lantern|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Chinese+lantern|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a [[paper bag]] with a [[candle]] placed inside, although more complicated [[lantern]]s consist of a collapsible [[bamboo]] or metal frame of hoops covered with tough [[paper]]. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red. Often associated with [[festival]]s, paper lanterns are common in China, Korea, Japan, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Cambodia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] and, similarly, in [[Chinatown]]s, where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|the traditional styles]] include ''[[bonbori]]'' and ''chōchin'' and there is a special style of lettering called ''[[edomoji|chōchin moji]]'' used to write on them. Airborne paper lanterns are called [[sky lanterns]], and are often released into the night sky for aesthetic effect at [[lantern festival]]s.

The Chinese sky lantern (天燈, 天灯), also known as ''Kongming lantern'', is a small [[hot air balloon]] made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended. In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name "sky lantern" is a translation of the [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] name but they have also been referred to as ''sky candles'' or ''fire balloons''. The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 [[centimetre|cm]] to a couple of [[metre]]s across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the [[flame]] source and to keep it away from the walls. When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.

===Carved lacquer===

{{Main|Carved lacquer}}
Carved lacquer or  ''Qīdiāo'' ({{zh|漆雕}}) is a distinctive Chinese form of decorated [[lacquerware]].  While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years,&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China,&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Cinnabar&lt;/ref&gt; though imitated in [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] in somewhat different styles.  The producing process is called '''Diāoqī''' ({{lang|zh|雕漆}}/彫漆, carving lacquer).Though most surviving examples are from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the [[Song dynasty]], and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming.  These types were the abstract ''guri'' or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants.  To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters ''(right)'' and imperial dragons can be added.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays. Some screens and pieces of [[Chinese furniture]] were made. Carved lacquer is only rarely combined with painting in lacquer and other lacquer techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Later Chinese writers dated the introduction of carved lacquer to the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–906), and many modern writers have pointed to some late Tang pieces of armour found on the [[Silk Road]] by [[Aurel Stein]] and now in the [[British Museum]].  These are red and black lacquer on [[camel]] hide, but the lacquer is very thin, "less than one millimeter in thickness", and the effect very different, with simple abstract shapes on a plain field and almost no impression of [[relief]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 6–7 (7 quoted); [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=228794&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Lacquer+armour+aurel+Stein&amp;page=1 British Museum collection database], see "Curator's comments"; Kuwayama, 13–14; Rawson, 175; Grove, "Tang"&lt;/ref&gt; The style of carving into thick lacquer used later is first seen in the [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279), following the development of techniques for making very thick lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 7; Rawson, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence from literary sources that it had existed in the late Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Kuwayama, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  At first the style of decoration used is known as ''guri'' ({{lang|zh|屈輪}}/曲仑) from the Japanese word for the ring-pommel of a sword, where the same motifs were used in metal, and is often called the "Sword-Pommel pattern" in English.  This style uses a family of repeated two-branched scrolling shapes cut with a rounded profile at the surface, but below that a "V" section through layers of lacquer in different colours (black, red and yellow, and later green), giving a "marbled" effect from the contrasted colours; this technique is called ''tìxī'' ({{lang|zh|剔犀}}/剃犀) in Chinese.  This style continued to be used up to the [[Ming dynasty]], especially on small boxes and jars with covers, though after the Song only red was often used, and the motifs were often carved with wider flat spaces at the bottom level to be exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 26–27, 46–61, 60 for the use of green; Rawson, 178; Grove, "Song"; Kuwayama, 13–17 on the Song&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folding screen===

{{Main|Folding screen}}
A folding screen (屏风，屏風) is a type of free-standing [[furniture]]. It consists of several frames or panels, which are often connected by [[hinge]]s or by other means. It can be made in a variety of designs and with different kinds of materials. Folding screens have many practical and decorative uses. It originated from [[ancient China]], eventually spreading to the rest of East Asia, Europe, and other regions of the world. Screens date back to China during the Eastern [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] period (771–256 BCE).&lt;ref name="handler268"&gt;{{cite book|last=Handler|first=Sarah|title=Austere luminosity of Chinese classical furniture|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21484-2|pages=268–271, 275, 277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EKkblrm6sUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazurkewich|first1=Karen|first2=A.

===Chinese jade===

[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|left|A Chinese jade named [[Bi (jade)|Bi]](璧) with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]

{{Main|Chinese jade}}
Chinese jade (玉) refers to the [[jade]] [[mining|mined]] or [[hardstone carving|carved]] in China from the [[Neolithic]] onward. It is the primary [[hardstone]] of [[Chinese sculpture]]. Although deep and bright green [[jadeite]] is better known in Europe, for most of China's history, jade has come in a variety of colors and white "mutton-fat" [[nephrite]] was the most highly praised and prized. Native sources in [[Henan]] and along the [[Yangtze]] were exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most Chinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern [[provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of [[Xinjiang]]. Jade was prized for its [[scratch hardness|hardness]], [[toughness|durability]], [[yayue|musical qualities]], and beauty.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective qualities&lt;ref name=fieryglo&gt;Fiero, Gloria K. ''The Humanistic Tradition'' 6th Ed, Vol. I. McGraw-Hill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the [[Chinese soul|soul]] and [[Taoist immortal|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent early use was the crafting of the '''Six Ritual Jades''',&lt;!--Linked here. Kindly leave bolded til separate article.--&gt; found since the 3rd-millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BC}} [[Liangzhu culture]]: the ''[[jade bi|bi]]'', the ''[[jade cong|cong]]'', the ''[[huang (jade)|huang]]'', the ''hu'', the ''gui'', and the ''zhang''.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chap. IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these items are so ancient that their original meaning is uncertain, by the time of the composition of the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', they were thought to represent the [[tian|sky]], the [[di (Chinese concept)|earth]], and the [[Four Symbols (China)|four directions]]. By the [[Han dynasty]], the royal family and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in [[jade burial suits]] sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the souls attached to it. Jade was also thought to combat fatigue in the living.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; The Han also greatly improved prior artistic treatment of jade.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lYYvsRdxsX4C&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt; These uses gave way after the [[Three Kingdoms period]] to [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices and new developments in [[Taoism]] such as [[Chinese alchemy|alchemy]]. Nonetheless, jade remained part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and an important artistic medium. Although its use never became widespread in [[Japan]], jade became important to the art of [[Korean jade carving|Korea]] and Southeast Asia.

==Music, instruments and dancing==
[[File:YEAR OF THE MONKEY IN DUBLIN (CHINESE POETRY ON THE DART TO CELEBRATE THE NEW CHINESE YEAR)-111425 (24150640974).jpg|thumb|[[Guzheng]], a type of Chinese instrument.]]
{{Main|Music of China|List of Chinese musical instruments|Dance of China}}
Music and dance were closely associated in the very early periods of China.  The [[music]] of China dates back to the [[History of China|dawn of Chinese civilization]] with documents and artifacts providing evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 BCE – 256 BCE).  The earliest music of the Zhou Dynasty recorded in ancient Chinese texts includes the ritual music called ''[[yayue]]'' and each piece may be associated with a dance. Some of the oldest written music dates back to [[Confucius]]'s time.  The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was exemplified through the popularization of the [[Guqin|''qin'']] (plucked instrument with seven strings) during the [[Tang Dynasty]], although the instrument is known to have played a major role before the Han Dynasty.

There are many [[musical instrument]]s that are integral to Chinese culture, such as the [[Xun (instrument)|Xun]] ([[Ocarina]]-type instrument that is also integral in Native American cultures), [[Guzheng]] (zither with movable bridges), [[guqin]] (bridgeless zither), [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[xiao (flute)|xiao]] (vertical flute), the [[erhu]] (alto fiddle or bowed lute), [[pipa]] (pear-shaped plucked lute), and many others.

Dance in China is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]], and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances. The best known Chinese dances today are the [[Dragon dance]] and the [[Lion Dance]].

==Architecture==
[[File:泗水亭 sishuiting park.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|A Chinese garden scene in snowy weather]]
{{Main|Chinese architecture}}
Chinese architecture is a style of [[architecture]] that has taken shape in [[East Asia]] over many centuries. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]]. Chinese architecture, examples for which can be found from more than 2,000 years ago, is almost as old as Chinese civilization and has long been an important hallmark of Chinese culture. There are certain features common to Chinese architecture, regardless of specific regions, different provinces or use. The most important is its emphasis on width, such as the wide halls of the [[Forbidden City]] serve as an example. In contrast, Western architecture tends to emphasize height (though exceptions such as [[pagodas]] in Eastern architecture also focus on height). Another important feature is [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur as it applies to everything from palaces to farmhouses. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow, to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. [[Feng shui]] has played a very important part in structural development. Chinese architecture also have a huge influence on the architecture of East Asia, and to a lesser extent, Southeast Asia as well. The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]] and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref name="Michel Baridon p. 348"&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins – paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''.  p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.

===Chinese palace===

[[File:Corner towers of the Forbidden City 3335.jpg|thumb|left|Corner tower of the [[Forbidden City]], [[Beijing]]]]

{{Main|Chinese palace}}

The Chinese palace is an imperial complex where the royal court and the civil government resided. Its structures are considerable and elaborate. The Chinese character ''gong'' (宮; meaning "palace") represents two connected rooms (呂) under a roof (宀). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but it was used in reference to solely the imperial residence since the [[Qin Dynasty]] (3rd century BC). A Chinese palace is composed of many buildings. It has large areas surrounded by walls and moats. It contains large halls (殿) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, [[Chinese temple|temples]], towers, residences, galleries, courtyards, [[Chinese garden|gardens]], and outbuildings. Apart from the main imperial palace, [[Chinese dynasties]] also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called "away palaces" (離宮/离宫) where the emperors resided when traveling. Empress dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] (慈禧太后) built the [[Summer Palace]] or Yiheyuan (頤和園/颐和园 – "The Garden of Nurtured Harmony") near the [[Old Summer Palace]], but on a much smaller scale than the Old Summer Palace.&lt;ref&gt;There are currently some projects in China to rebuild the Imperial Gardens, but this appears as a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding has started.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paifang===
{{Main|Paifang}}

''Paifang'', also known as a ''Pailou'', is a traditional style of [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese architecture|architectural]] [[arch]] or gateway structure that is related to the [[India]]n ''[[Torana]]'' from which it is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.H. Longhurst|title=Story Of The Stupa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gs1sFlMGy2AC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0160-4|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''paifang'' ({{zh|c=牌坊|p=páifāng}}) was originally a collective term for the top two levels of administrative division and subdivisions of ancient Chinese cities. The largest division within a city in ancient China was a ''fang'' ({{zh|c=坊|hp=fāng|labels=no}}), equivalent to a current day [[precinct]]. Each fang was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night. Each fang was further divided into several ''pai'' ({{zh|c=牌|hp=pái|l=placard|labels=no}}), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several [[hutong]]s (alleyways). This system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the [[Tang dynasty]], and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Beijing]] was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word ''paifang'' referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the [[Song dynasty]], a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument.

{{Main|Chinese garden}}
The Chinese garden is a landscape garden cantonese style which has evolved over the years. It includes both the vast gardens of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]] and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref name="Michel Baridon p. 348"/&gt; A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings. The earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the [[Yellow River]], during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown. Early inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, ''you'', ''pu'' and ''yuan''.  ''You'' was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC), ''[[wikt:園|yuan]]'' became the character for all gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Feng Chaoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou'', preface, and Bing Chiu, ''Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis'', Editions de La Martiniere, Paris 2010, p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The old character for  ''yuan'' is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.&lt;ref&gt;Tong Jun, Records of Jiang Gardens, cited in Feng Chanoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Shiji'', one of the most famous features of this garden was the ''Wine Pool and Meat Forest'' (酒池肉林). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.&lt;ref&gt;Che Bing Chiu, "Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis", p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–481 BC), in 535 BC, the ''Terrace of Shanghua'', with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by [[King Jing of Zhou (Gui)|King Jing]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the ''Terrace of Gusu'', was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as [[Lake Tai]], the Great Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Che Bing Chiu, ''Jardins de Chine'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

China is one of the [[Origins of Asian martial arts|main birth places]] of Eastern martial arts. Chinese martial arts, often named under the [[umbrella term]]s ''[[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]]'' and ''[[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]'', are the [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|several hundred fighting styles]] that have developed over the centuries in China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as ''"families"'' (家; {{transl|zh|''jiā''}}), ''"sects"'' (派; {{transl|zh|''pài''}}) or ''"schools"'' (门/門; {{transl|zh|''mén''}}) of martial arts. Examples of such traits include ''[[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolinquan]]''  ({{zh|c=少林拳|labels=no}}) physical exercises involving [[Five Animals]] ({{zh|c=五形|labels=no}}) mimicry, or training methods inspired by [[Chinese philosophies|Old Chinese philosophies]], religions and legends. Styles that focus on [[qi]] manipulation are called ''"[[Internal martial arts|internal]] "''(內家拳/内家拳; {{transl|zh|''nèijiāquán''}}), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called ''"[[Styles of Chinese martial arts#External styles|external]]"'' (外家拳; {{transl|zh|''wàijiāquán''}}). Geographical association, as in "''northern"(''北拳; {{transl|zh|''běiquán''}}) and ''"southern"'' (南拳; {{transl|zh|''nánquán''}}), is another popular classification method.

Chinese martial arts are collectively given the name [[Kung Fu]] (gong) "achievement" or "merit", and (fu) "man", thus "human achievement") or (previously and in some modern contexts) [[Wushu (term)|Wushu]] ("martial arts" or "military arts"). China also includes the home to the well-respected [[Shaolin Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. The first generation of art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art. Over time, some art forms have branched off, while others have retained a distinct Chinese flavor. Regardless, China has produced some of the most renowned martial artists including [[Wong Fei Hung]] and [[Chinese martial arts#Notable practitioners|many others]]. The arts have also co-existed with a variety of [[:Category:Chinese melee weapons|weapons]] including the more standard [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu|18 arms]]. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Dim Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the culture.
Martial arts schools also teach the art of [[lion dance]], which has evolved from a pugilistic display of Kung Fu to an entertaining dance performance.

==Leisure==
A number of [[:Category:Chinese games|games]] and pastimes are popular within Chinese culture. The most common game is [[Mah Jong]]. The same pieces are used for other styled games such as [[mahjong solitaire|Shanghai Solitaire]]. Others include [[pai gow]], [[pai gow poker]] and other [[Chinese dominoes|bone domino]] games. [[Weiqi]] and [[xiangqi]] are also popular. Ethnic games like [[Chinese yo-yo]] are also part of the culture where it is performed during social events. Qigong pronounced (Chi Kung) is the practice of spiritual, physical, and medical techniques. It is as a form of exercise and although it is commonly used among the elderly, any one of any age can practice it during their free time. With its combination of physical flexibility and movement, breathing technique, and constant state of focus and mediation, it has also been a way to cleanse and heal the body and helps get in touch with your inner-self. Qigong has continuous rhythmic movements that help reduce stress and build stamina as well as to improve certain functions of the body such as cardiovascular and digestive.

{{Main|Chinese cuisine}}
Chinese cuisine is a very important part of ''Chinese culture'', which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the [[Chinese diaspora]] and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in [[Asia]], with modifications made to cater to local palates.The preference for [[seasoning]] and [[Chinese cooking techniques|cooking techniques]] of Chinese provinces depend on differences in [[history of Chinese cuisine|historical background]] and [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]]. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering climate of China varies from [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical]] in the south to [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] in the northeast. [[Chinese aristocrat cuisine|Imperial, royal and noble preference]] also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time. The most praised "Four Major Cuisines" are [[Sichuan cuisine|Chuan]], [[Shandong cuisine|Lu]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Yue]] and [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]], representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Major Cuisines in China|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/four-major-cuisines-in-china.html|website=CITS|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern "Eight Cuisines" of China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Cuisines of China – Shandong &amp; Guangdong|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/cuisine_drink/cuisine/eight_cuisines.htm|website=TravelChinaGuide.com|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]], [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]], [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]], [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]], and [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]] cuisines.&lt;ref name="beautyfujian"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130731165745/http://beautyfujian.com/Fujian/Fujian_Cuisine.html "Fujian Cuisine.] [http://beautyfujian.com/ Beautyfujian.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710001538/http://beautyfujian.com/ |date=10 July 2011 }}. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Color, smell and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food,&lt;ref&gt;This standard starts from [[Tang Dynasty]] in the 6th century by [[Bai Juyi]] from the ''Preface of [[Lychee]] Diagram'': After leaving branch...for four and five days, the color, smell and taste (of lychee) will be gone. (《荔枝圖序》：「若離本枝……四五日外，色、香、味盡去矣」。）&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised from ingredients used, cuttings, cooking time and seasoning. It is considered inappropriate to use knives on the dining table. [[Chopsticks]] are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food.

===Tea culture===
[[File:China tea.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional [[Chinese tea culture]] (茶艺，茶藝) set and three [[gaiwan]].]]
{{Main|Chinese tea|Chinese tea culture|History of tea in China}}
The practice of drinking [[tea]] has a long history in China, having originated there.  The history of tea in China is long and complex, for the [[Chinese people|Chinese]]  have enjoyed tea for millennia. Scholars hailed the brew as a cure for a variety of ailments; the nobility considered the consumption of good tea as a mark of their status, and the common people simply enjoyed its flavour. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known physical evidence of tea from the mausoleum of [[Emperor Jing of Han]] in [[Xi'an]] was announced, indicating that tea from the genus ''[[Camellia]]'' was drunk by [[Han dynasty]] emperors as early as 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nature.com/articles/srep18955 |title=Earliest tea as evidence for one branch of the Silk Road across the Tibetan Plateau|authors=Houyuan Lu|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/srep18955| date=7 January 2016| accessdate =11 January 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea then became a popular drink in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Tea|last=Liu|first=Tong|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-521-18680-3|location=The United States of America|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tea originated in China, during the Tang dynasty, Chinese tea generally represents tea leaves which have been processed using methods inherited from [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. According to popular legend, tea was discovered by Chinese Emperor [[Shen Nong]] in 2737 BCE when a leaf from a nearby shrub fell into water the emperor was boiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.radio86.com/lifestyle-china/tea-and-chinese-way-life|title=Tea and the Chinese way of life|publisher=radio86.com|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea is deeply woven into the history and culture of China. The beverage is considered one of the [[seven necessities]] of Chinese life, along with firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce and vinegar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ketang.dict.cn/item/4e981f95acf0a3c9df000098|title=Notes on Chinese Culture – Food and Drinks (08) – Chinese Tea|publisher=dict.cn|accessdate=January 9, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804163552/http://ketang.dict.cn/item/4e981f95acf0a3c9df000098|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 771 BC – 476 BC the Chinese tea is used for medicinal purposes.This period also known as the "Spring and Autumn Period", it is where Chinese people first enjoyed the juice extracted from the tea leaves that they chewed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}Chinese Tea culture refers to how tea is prepared as well as the occasions when people consume tea in China. Tea culture in China differs from that in European countries like Britain and other Asian countries like Japan in preparation, taste, and occasion wherein it is consumed. Even today, tea is consumed regularly, both at casual and formal occasions. In addition to being a popular beverage, tea is used in traditional Chinese medicine, as well as in Chinese cuisine. Green tea is one of the main worldwide teas originating in China.

===Food culture===

[[Chinese aristocrat cuisine|Imperial, royal and noble preference]] also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.The overwhelmingly large variety of Chinese cuisine comes mainly from the practice of dynastic period, when [[Emperor of China|emperors]] would host banquets with over 100 dishes per meal.&lt;ref name="Kong"&gt;Kong, Foong, Ling. [2002]. The Food of Asia. Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7946-0146-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A countless number of imperial kitchen staff and [[concubines]] were involved in the food preparation process. Over time, many dishes became part of the everyday-citizen culture. Some of the highest quality restaurants with recipes close to the dynastic periods include Fangshan restaurant in [[Beihai Park]] [[Beijing]] and the Oriole Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Kong"/&gt; Arguably all branches of [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong eastern style]] are in some ways rooted from the original dynastic cuisines.

''Manhan Quanxi'', literally ''Manchu Han Imperial Feast'' was one of the grandest meals ever documented in Chinese cuisine. It consisted of at least 108 unique dishes from the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] and [[Han Chinese]] culture during the [[Qing dynasty]], and it is only reserved and intended for the [[Emperor of China|Emperors]]. The meal was held for three whole days, across six banquets. The culinary skills consisted of cooking methods from all over [[Late Imperial China|Imperial China]].&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;Hoover, Michael.  Stokes, Lisa, Odham. (1999). City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema. Verso publishing. {{ISBN|1-85984-203-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Qing conquest of the Ming|Manchus conquered China]] and founded the [[Qing dynasty]], the Manchu and Han Chinese peoples struggled for power. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] wanted to resolve the disputes so he held a banquet during his 66th birthday celebrations. The banquet consisted of Manchu and Han dishes, with officials from both ethnic groups attending the banquet together. After the [[Wuchang Uprising]], common people learned about the imperial banquet. The original meal was served in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Hoover" /&gt;&lt;!--Using the book source, but I got a feeling they meant 66 in the book instead of 60 years old, so 66 is used here--&gt;

==Major subcultures==
Chinese culture consists of many subcultures. In China, the cultural difference between adjacent provinces (and, in some cases, adjacent counties within the same province) can often be as big as than that between adjacent European nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livescience.com/28823-chinese-culture.html Chinese Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions of China]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept of ''[[Han Chinese subgroups]]'' (漢族民系/汉族民系, literally "Han ethnic lineage") was born, used for classifying these subgroups within the greater Han ethnicity. These subgroups are, as a general rule, classified based on linguistic differences.

Using this linguistic classification, some of the well-known subcultures within China include:

===South===
* [[Cantonese culture]] (粵/粤)
* [[Hakka culture]] (客)
* [[Teochew culture]] (潮)
* [[Hokkien culture]] (閩/闽)
* [[Culture of Jiangxi|Jiangxi culture]] (贛)
* [[Culture of Hunan|Hunanese culture]] (湘)
* [[Sichuanese culture]] (蜀)
* [[Wuyue culture]] (吳/吴)
* [[Haipai culture]] (海)

===North===
* [[Zhongyuan culture]] (豫)
* [[Beijing#Culture|Culture of Beijing]] (京)
* [[Shandong#Culture|Culture of Shandong]] (魯/鲁)
* [[Jin culture]] (晉/晋)&lt;ref&gt;[https://kknews.cc/history/9zvzpq.html 晉語的使用範圍與歷史起源]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://kknews.cc/culture/qyozppo.html 晉語是中國北方的唯一一個非官話方言，但是否歸屬官話]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://kknews.cc/culture/aenxvv.html 山西方言與山西文化]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Northeast China#Culture|Dongbei culture]] (東北/东北)

[[File:La Barque de Dante (Delacroix 3820).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Vergil]] leading [[Dante]] on his journey in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', an image that dramatizes the continuity of the classical tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dante and Vergil in Hell'' by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1823)]]
The [[Western culture|Western]] '''classical tradition''' is the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical antiquity|classical Greco-Roman antiquity]] by later cultures, especially the post-classical West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; involving texts, imagery, objects, ideas, institutions, monuments, architecture, cultural artifacts, rituals, practices, and sayings.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], [[History of political thinking|political thought]], and [[classical mythology|mythology]] are three major examples of how classical culture survives and continues to have influence.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, entry on "mythology," in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 614 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The West is one of a number of world cultures regarded as having a classical tradition, including the [[Classical India|Indian]], [[Chinese classics|Chinese]], [[Judaism|Judaic]], and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the classical tradition differs from [[classical philology]], which seeks to recover "the meanings that ancient texts had in their original contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It examines both later efforts to uncover the realities of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and "creative misunderstandings" that reinterpret ancient values, ideas and aesthetic models for contemporary use.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. vii; Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist and translator [[Charles Martindale]] has defined the reception of classical antiquity as "a two-way process … in which the present and the past are in dialogue with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Martindale, "Reception," in ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (2007), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginning of a self-conscious classical tradition is usually located in the [[Renaissance]], with the work of [[Petrarch]] in [[Italian Renaissance|14th-century Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the [[Roman Empire]] went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Aeneas]] carrying his father and leading his son from fallen [[Troy]], a popular image in the Renaissance for the retrieval of the past as a way to make possible the future; the figure of his wife, [[Creusa]], who did not survive, represents that which was lost&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gillgren, ''Siting Federico Barocci and the Renaissance Aesthetic'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Federico Barocci]], 1598)]]
The phrase "classical tradition" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the [[Post-war#Year spans of the post-World War II era|post-World War II era]] with ''The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature'' of [[Gilbert Highet]] (1949) and ''The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries'' of [[R. R. Bolgar]] (1954). The English word "tradition," and with it the concept of "handing down" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb ''trado, tradere, traditus'', in the sense of "hand over, hand down."&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;!--note--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or [[allusion|allude]] to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through [[Comparative literature|comparative methods]] that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of [[Montaigne]]'s copy of [[Lucretius]] enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;!--here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Failings in the background research and the reproduction of the country are very common in films depicting Colombia. Some of these mistakes include showing [[Bogotá]] or [[Medellín]] as [[sylvatic]] or coastal regions, using [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] actors (with noticeable accents), Mexican [[costumes]], [[anachronism]]s and a general inaccuracy regarding the depiction of how the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|conflicts]] between government and drug-trading cartels work.

Some examples of fictional Colombian settings are:

* ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]'': The Devil makes [[Brendan Fraser]]´s character a Colombian Drug Lord, loosely resembling [[Pablo Escobar]]. Most of the Spanish phrases are at times very hard to make out, and with a lot of grammar and pronunciation mistakes. Traditional [[Spain|Spanish]] music is heard in the background, not Colombian. Beginning with the butler, almost everyone speaks with a clear Spanish accent and slang, and certain elements belong to the Spanish culture, like the "[[Bota bag]]", the traditional leather bag in the shape of a boot, used to drink alcoholic beverages. [[Medellín]] is depicted as a tropical [[jungle]].
* ''[[Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia]]'': 2009 [[war film]] about a brigade of [[United States Navy SEALs]] mounting an attack on Colombian special forces to clear their names and rescue a [[hostage]]. [[Peruvian]] folk songs are heard in the background including "Mi Llamita". Filming locations were actually in [[Puerto Rico]].
* ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'': 2001 [[drama]]/[[biopic]] film about the [[United States|American]] [[cocaine]] [[smuggler]] [[George Jung]]. It is based on the real-life stories of [[George Jung]], [[Pablo Escobar]], [[Carlos Lehder]], and the [[Medellín Cartel]].
* ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] is appointed [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) Acting Deputy Director and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against [[Cali Cartel]] drug lords in Colombia. Filming locations were actually in [[Quito]], Ecuador and [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]]. The Colombian drug lord lives in "Tepoztlan" Hotel ([[aztec]] word). In the backgrounds can be seen a billboard of Mexican politician [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], and a portrait of Mexican statesman [[Miguel Lerdo de Tejada]].
* ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'': Gordon Brewer (played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]), looks to avenge his son's and wife's deaths at the hands of a [[guerrilla]] commando, by traveling to [[Colombia]]. Gordy enters Colombia through the [[Darién Gap]]. This Gap is in the Colombian department called [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]], the most [[Afro-Colombian]] populated region of the country. However, throughout the whole movie, a black person is never shown. The [[National Police of Colombia]] and army forces use blue uniforms, instead the green they actually use. The accent of the native "Colombians" is actually Mexican. There is a scene of a soccer match, between America and [[Chivas de Guadalajara|Chivas]], two popular teams from [[Mexico]] which are mistakenly set in Colombia.
* ''[[Colombiana]]'': In the film, Cataleya Restrepo ([[Zoe Saldana]]) is a Colombian who had her parents killed in [[Bogotá]] by a [[drug lord]] ([[Beto Benites]]) and his partner ([[Jordi Mollà]]) when she was nine years old. She goes to her criminal uncle ([[Cliff Curtis]]) in [[Chicago]] and is trained as an assassin to try to get revenge. Filming was done in [[Mexico]], [[Chicago]], [[New Orleans]] and [[France]] and the use of the [[Cattleya]] orchid was depicted in the film.
* ''[[Lord of War]]'': [[Nicolas Cage]] plays an illegal arms dealer, which during a business deal with a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[drug lord]], gets paid in [[cocaine]] instead of cash. Again, the accent and slang words used by the 'Colombian' drug lord are Mexican.
* ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'': A couple of assassins tell the story of their first meeting in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], where they met during a crossfire, while both were secretly on the run from Colombian authorities. The film depicts Bogotá, the capital of Colombia as a small town, when in reality Bogotá is one of the biggest and most populous cities in [[Latin America]]. Also, Bogotá is portrayed as a warm/hot city while in reality it is located over the [[Andean]] cordilleras and has an average temperature of 58&amp;nbsp;°F all year long and has an altitude of {{convert|8530|ft|m}}. Filming locations were actually in [[California]].
* ''[[Bruce almighty]]'': In the morning, Bruce Nolan ([[Jim Carrey]]) states "I'd better manifest some coffee", and uses his god powers to conjure fictional Colombian coffee icon character [[Juan Valdez]] who pours him a cup of coffee while stating his enjoyment for fresh grown coffee in the hills of Colombia.
* ''[[Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection]]'': Colonel Scott McCoy ([[Chuck Norris]]) fights against [[Colombia]]n drug lord Ramon Cota ([[Billy Drago]]), the richest drug kingpin in the world, who controls the [[cocaine]] industry with an iron fist.

Her widowed sister, Elaine ([[Mary Ellen Trainor]]) calls Joan and begs her to come to [[Colombia]] with the package; Elaine has been kidnapped, and the package is the ransom. Though supposedly set in Colombia, all the Hispanic actors speak with a distinct Mexican accent. The supposed Colombian jungle features non-Colombian animals such as [[Australian]] [[Sulphur crested cockatoo]]s. Filming locations were actually in [[Xalapa]], Mexico.
* ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'': Xander Cage ([[Vin Diesel]]), is a [[criminal|law-breaking]] [[extreme sports]] enthusiast, which is dropped in a [[cocaine]]-producing area of rural [[Colombia]], where Xander is captured, tied, gagged and tortured by Colombian drug lord "El Jefe" ([[Danny Trejo]]). Filming locations were actually in [[California]].
* ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'': Posing as drug smugglers "Sonny Burnett" and "Rico Cooper", [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] Police detectives James Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs offer their services to a Colombian cartel. The topography of Colombia's northernmost peninsula known as [[Guajira Peninsula]] is basically an [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub|arid desert]], quite different from the jungle backdrop used to describe the smuggler's airplane. Filming locations were actually in the [[Dominican Republic]].

Webster's scheme is thwarted when Superman neutralizes the hurricane and saves the harvest. In the movie, Colombia is located in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], being actually located in the north hemisphere most of its territory. There are no hurricanes in Colombia.
*''[[Sicario (2015 film)|Sicario]]'' a 2015 film starring [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] where Del Toro portrays a Colombian ex-drug dealer seeking revenge for the killing of his family.

'''Cultural consensus theory''' is an [http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/sbp09/Presentations/paper%20presentations/William%20BatchelderCCTSBP092009(1).pdf approach to information pooling] (aggregation, data fusion) which supports a framework for the measurement and evaluation of beliefs as [[cultural]]; shared to some extent by a group of individuals.  Cultural consensus models guide the aggregation of responses from individuals to estimate (1) the culturally appropriate answers to a series of related questions (when the answers are unknown) and (2) individual competence (cultural competence) in answering those questions.  The theory is applicable when there is sufficient agreement across people to assume that a single set of answers exists.  The agreement between pairs of individuals is used to estimate individual cultural competence.  Answers are estimated by weighting responses of individuals by their competence and then combining responses.

== Theory ==
Cultural consensus theory assumes that  [[cultural]] beliefs are learned and shared across people and that there is a common understanding of what the world and society are all about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging Society: The Sociologist in a War Zone|last=Carroll|first=John|publisher=Ateneo University Press|year=2006|isbn=9789715505055|location=Manila|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the amount of information in a culture is too large for any one individual to master, individuals know different subsets of the cultural knowledge and vary in their cultural competence.  Cultural beliefs are beliefs held by a majority of culture members.  Given a set of questions, on the same topic, shared cultural beliefs or norms regarding the answers can be estimated by aggregating the responses across a sample of culture members.  When agreement is close to absolute, estimating answers is straightforward.  The problem addressed by cultural consensus theory is how to estimate beliefs when there is some degree of heterogeneity present in responses.  In general, cultural consensus theory provides a framework for determining whether responses are sufficiently homogeneous to estimate a single set of shared answers, and then estimating the answers and individual cultural competence in answering the questions.

Cultural consensus models do not create consensus or explain why consensus exists; they simply facilitate the discovery and description of possible consensus.  A high degree of agreement among raters must be present in responses in order to use consensus theory – only with high agreement does it make sense to aggregate responses to estimate beliefs of the group.  Although there are statistical methods to evaluate whether agreement among raters is greater than chance ([[Binomial test]], [[Friedman test]], or [[Kendall's W|Kendall’s coefficient of concordance]]), these methods do not provide a best estimate of the “true” answers nor do they estimate competence of the raters.  Cultural consensus theory is able to estimate competence from the agreement between subjects and then, answers are estimated by “weighting” individual responses by competence prior to aggregation.

A very important feature in the [[Aggregate data|aggregation of responses]] is that the combined responses of individuals will be more accurate than the responses of each individual included in the aggregation. [[Reliability theory]] in psychology (specifically, the reliability coefficient and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]]) provides a mathematical estimate of the accuracy or validity of aggregated responses from the number of units being combined and the level of agreement among the units.  In this case, accuracy of aggregated responses can be calculated from the number of subjects and the average [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between all pairs of subjects (across questions).

==Usage==
To use cultural consensus theory, at least three assumptions must be met:
# Informants must be asked a series of questions. The questions should all be on the same topic and at the same level of difficulty. This assumption concerns the homogeneity of items&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Culturally-Aware Intelligent Systems and in Cross-Cultural Psychological Studies|last=Faucher|first=Colette|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319670225|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and means that items should represent only one topic or domain of knowledge and that competency should be consistent across items, so that if someone does well on one subset of questions, they should also do well on another subset of questions. Responses to questions are not corrected, recoded, transformed, or reflected as they are with knowledge tests and attitudinal scales because the purpose is to use the original responses to estimate culturally correct answers.
# Each informant should provide answers independently of all other informants. This means that answers should be provided by individuals and not groups, and without consultation with others. Consensus models are not appropriate for group interviews.
# The cultural consensus model is applicable only if there is a single set of answers to the questions. This means that there must be a high level of consistency (agreement) in responses among informants, which some refer to as common truth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research methods and Applications in Environmental Studies|last=Matthias|first=Ruth|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781783474639|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aggregation of responses is not a valid estimate unless there is reasonable consistency in the underlying data. An initial step in applying consensus theory is to check whether there is a high degree of agreement among the informants (e.g., to verify that there is only one response pattern present). 

==Models of the theory==
Cultural consensus theory encompasses formal and informal models. Practically speaking, these models are often used to estimate cultural beliefs, including the degree to which individuals report such beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The formal cultural consensus model models the decision-making process for answering questions.&lt;ref name="RWB86"&gt;Romney AK, Weller SC., Batchelder WH.  Culture as consensus: A theory of culture and informant accuracy.  Am Anthro. 1986;88(2):313–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BR88"&gt;Batchelder WH, Romney AK.  Test theory without an answer key. Psychometrika. 1988;53(1):71–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  This version is limited to categorical-type responses:  multiple-choice type questions (including those with dichotomous true/false or yes/no responses) and responses to open-ended questions (with a single word or short phrase response for each question). This version of the model has a series of additional assumptions that must be met, i.e., no response bias.&lt;ref name="RWB86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, SC and Mann NC. Assessing rater performance without a “gold standard” using consensus theory.  Medical Decision Making 1997; 17:71–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal model has direct parallels in signal detection theory and latent class analysis.  An informal version of the model is available as a set of analytic procedures and obtains similar information with fewer assumptions.&lt;ref name="RBW87"&gt;Romney AK, Batchelder WH, Weller SC.  Recent applications of cultural consensus theory.  Am Behavioral Scientist.  1987; 31:163–177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The informal model parallels a factor analysis on people (without rotation) and thus has similarities to [[Q methodology|Q factor analysis (as in Q Methodology)]].  The informal version of the model can accommodate interval estimates and ranked response data.  Both approaches provide estimates of the culturally correct answers and estimates of individual differences in the accuracy of reported information. 

One specific method of the formal version used in the analysis of data is the mathematical model, which is a set of logical axioms as well as derived propositions and assumptions that explain how empirical variables fit in the model's parameters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The informal model, on the other hand, uses reliability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Social Sciences: Methods and Research Design|last=Vaccaro|first=Ismael|last2=Smith|first2=Eric Alden|last3=Aswani|first3=Shankar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521110846|location=Cambridge|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competence==
Cultural competence is estimated from the similarity in responses between pairs of subjects since the agreement between a pair of respondents is a function of their individual competencies.  In the formal model, similarity is the probability that matched responses occur (match method.&lt;ref name="RWB86"/&gt; or the probability of particular response combinations occur (covariance method&lt;ref name="BR88" /&gt;).  Simple match or covariance measures are then corrected for guessing and the proportion of positive responses, respectively.  In the informal model, similarity is calculated with a [[Pearson correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="RBW87" /&gt;

A [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of agreement coefficients between all pairs of subjects is then factored with a minimum residual factoring method ([[Factor analysis#Types of factoring|principal axis factoring without rotation]]) to solve for the unknown competence values on the main diagonal.  (For the informal model, the maximum likelihood factor analysis algorithm is preferred, but principal axis factoring can be used as well.)  To determine whether the solution meets cultural consensus criteria, that only a single factor is present, a goodness of fit rule is used.  If the ratio of the first to second [[eigenvalues]] is large with subsequently small values and all first factor loadings are positive, then it is assumed that the data contain only a single factor or a single response pattern.

===Individual competence===
'''Individual competence values are used to weight the responses and estimate the culturally correct answers'''.  In the formal model, a confidence level ([[Bayesian probability|Bayesian adjusted probabilities]]) is obtained for each answer from the pattern of responses and the individual competence scores.  In the informal model, responses are also weighted, using a [[linear model]].  When factoring a [[correlation matrix]], the estimated answers appear as the first set of factor scores.  Also, note that factor scores are usually provided as standardized variables (mean of zero), but may be transformed back to your original data collection units.

==Analysis==
When used as a method for analysis, the cultural consensus theory allows the following: the determination whether the observed variability in knowledge is cultural; the measurement of cultural competence that each individual possesses; and, the determination of culturally correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural Consensus analyses may be performed with software applications.  The formal consensus model is currently only available in  the software packages [http://www.analytictech.com/anthropac/apacdesc.htm ANTHROPAC] or [http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet/ UCINET].  Analysis procedures for the informal model are available in most statistical packages. The informal model can be run within a factor analysis procedure, requesting the minimum-residual (principal axis factoring) algorithm method that solves for the missing diagonal without rotation. However, when factor analysis is used for consensus applications, ~~the data must be transposed, so that questions are the unit of analysis (the rows in a data matrix) and people are the variables~~ (the columns in the data matrix).

An advantage of cultural consensus is the availability of necessary sample size information and that necessary sample sizes do not need to be very large.  Sample size determination in a consensus analysis is similar to other types of analyses; namely, that when variability is low, power is high and small samples will suffice.  Here, variability is the agreement (competence) among subjects.  For the formal model, sample size can be estimated from the level of agreement (e.g., assuming a low average competence level of .50), the proportion of items to be correctly classified (assuming a high level, .95), and high confidence (.999) a minimum sample size of 29 (per subgroup) is necessary.[1,5]  For higher levels of competence and lower levels of accuracy and confidence, smaller samples sizes are necessary.  Similarly, sample size can be estimated with reliability theory and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula|Spearman–Brown prophecy formula]] (applied to people instead of items).  For a relatively low level of agreement (an average correlation of .25 between people, comparable to an average competence of .50) and a high degree of desired validity (.95 correlation between the estimated answers and the true answers), a study would require a minimum sample size of 30 subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Weller SC: Cultural consensus theory: Applications and frequently asked questions.  Field Methods 2007; 19(4): 339–368.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, cultural consensus theory offers a framework for estimating cultural beliefs.  A formal model is based on the decision-making process model of how questions are answered (with parameters for competence, response bias and guessing).  The model proceeds from axioms and uses mathematical proofs to arrive at estimates of competence and answers to a series of questions.  The informal model is a set of statistical procedures that provides similar information.  Given a series of related questions, the agreement between people’s reported answers is used to estimate their cultural competence.  Cultural competence is how much an individual knows or shares group beliefs.  Since the extraction of individual competencies depends upon having a single factor solution, the ratio of the first and second eigenvalues (&gt; 3:1) serves as a goodness-of-fit indicator that a single factor is present in the pattern of responses.  Culturally correct answers are estimated by weighting and combining individuals’ responses.

'''Diablada puneña''' is a variation of the dance known as [[diablada]] performed in the region of [[Puno]], [[Peru]]. The origin of this dance is a matter of dispute between [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]],&lt;ref name="WLSspat"&gt;{{cite news |title=In This Spat Between Bolivia and Peru, The Details Are in the Devils|author=Moffett, Matt   |author2=Kozak, Robert |authorlink2=Robert Kozak|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125081309502848049|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=21 August 2009|page=A1|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because both nations celebrate the Diablada  with similar music, songs, and clothing.&lt;ref name="ValenciaMelgar"&gt;{{cite news |title=Puno: Capital Folklórica del Perú? |trans-title=Puno Peru's folkloric capital? |author=Valencia Melgar.

The ''Diablada puneña'' is part of an Andean theatrical repertoire that began during the Spanish colonization of South America in order to teach the local natives the precepts of Christian faith and history of the Spanish Empire. The Diablada causes a reform in the thinking of the indigenous altiplano cultures as missionaries from Spain, instilled the paradigm of good and evil, which is how the costumes of angels and demons became associated with the dance.

According to Diego Gonzáles Holguín, the missionaries taught the natives a representation of the seven deadly sins and the triumph of the angels over the demons. In Puno, this is a special dance which was recovered from the past along with the [[Diablada]] in [[Carnaval de Oruro|Oruro]].

==History==
In 1577, the Jesuits settled in Juli, Puno. During festivities, they performed theatre plays, comedies and actos sacramentales.

The Juli Jesuits taught the natives a song-dance about the seven capital sins and how the angels beat the demons, in order to indoctrinate the locals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''Diatonic set theory''' is a subdivision or application of [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] which applies the techniques and [[musical analysis|insights]] of [[discrete mathematics]] to properties of the [[diatonic collection]] such as [[maximal evenness]], [[Myhill's property]], [[well formed generated collection|well formedness]], the [[deep scale property]], [[cardinality equals variety]], and [[structure implies multiplicity]]. The name is something of a misnomer as the concepts involved usually apply much more generally, to any periodically repeating scale.

Music theorists working in diatonic set theory include [[Eytan Agmon]], [[Gerald J. Balzano]], [[Norman Carey]], [[David Clampitt]], [[John Clough (music theorist)|John Clough]], [[Jay Rahn]], and mathematician [[Jack Douthett]]. A number of key concepts were first formulated by [[David Rothenberg]], who published in the journal ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', and [[Erv Wilson]], working entirely outside of the academic world.

A '''dilemma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|δίλημμα}} "double [[lemma (logic)|proposition]]") is a [[problem]] offering two possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The possibilities are termed the ''horns'' of the dilemma, a [[cliché]]d usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199888771 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA257 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemmatic arguments==
The dilemma is sometimes used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] in his work ''On Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Calboli Montefusco, ''Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments'', Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 {{jstor|10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Peirce]] gave a definition of ''dilemmatic argument'' as any argument relying on [[excluded middle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sujata |last2=Prasad |first2=Sanjiva |title=Logic and Its Applications: 7th Indian Conference, ICLA 2017, Kanpur, India, January 5-7, 2017, Proceedings |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662540695 |page=177 note 5|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=etrJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion, and applied incorrectly, it constitutes a [[false dichotomy]], that is, a [[fallacy]]. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a "horned syllogism" from the [[sophism]] that attracted the Latin name ''cornutus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Sir William |title=The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, Bart |date=1863 |publisher=Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rUEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the word ''horns'' in English has been attributed to [[Nicholas Udall]] in his 1548 book ''Paraphrases'', translating from the Latin term ''cornuta interrogatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erasmus |first1=Desiderius |title=Paraphrase on Luke 11-24 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802036537 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q9ZLk_Qw0ZQC&amp;pg=PA158 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In logic==
In [[propositional logic]], ''dilemma'' is applied to a group of [[rules of inference]], which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the [[constructive dilemma]] and [[destructive dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |date=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691029067 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JDLQOMKbdScC&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the "horns of the dilemma" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept "A or B", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called "escaping through the horns of the dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Govier |first1=Trudy |title=A Practical Study of Argument |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495603406 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUxXbUvDiswC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to [[Melissus of Samos]], a [[Presocratic]] philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harriman |first1=Benjamin |title=Melissus and Eleatic Monism |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108416337 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e091DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with [[Diodorus Cronus]] (died c. 284 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sedley |first1=David |title=Diodorus Cronus |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxes of [[Zeno of Elea]] were reported by [[Aristotle]] in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what [[Plato]] said about Zeno's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=John |title=Zeno of Elea |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and ethical dilemmas==
{{main|ethical dilemma}}
In cases where two [[moral principle]]s appear to be inconsistent, an actor has a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to [[Cicero]], in book III of his ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA75 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian tradition of [[casuistry]], an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by [[Bartolomé de Medina (theologian)|Bartolomé de Medina]] in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of [[laxism]], as did casuistry itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Francis E. |title=The words and will of God |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691114617 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=26aSVSICGIEC&amp;pg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA54 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cardym.jpg |thumb|right|200px|Drama students performing on stage.]]
A '''drama school''', '''stage school''' or '''theatre school''' is an undergraduate and/or graduate [[school]] or [[academic department|department]] at a [[college]] or [[university]]; or a free-standing institution (such as the Drama section at the [[Juilliard School]]); which specializes in the pre-professional training in [[drama]] and [[theatre]] arts, such as [[acting]], [[technical theatre|design and technical theatre]], [[arts administration]], and related subjects. If the drama school is part of a degree-granting institution, undergraduates typically take a [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], or, occasionally, [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Design]].  Graduate students may take a [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Doctor of Arts]], [[Doctor of Fine Arts]], or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.

==Entry and application process==
[[File:Dramaclubssst.jpg|thumb|Romanian students (Drama Club Botosani) in "The Taming of the Shrew"]]
Entry to drama school is usually through a competitive [[audition]] process. Some schools make this a two-stage process. Places on an acting course are limited (usually well below 100) so those who fare best at the audition are selected. Most academies state that applicants must be over 18 years of age.
Auditions usually involve the performance of [[monologue]]s and group workshops, and may also include a [[singing]] activity. This varies from academy to academy. If this is the case for an [[acting]] degree, the school looks more at how an applicant can put character into the song rather than how well they can sing. For a [[musical theatre]] degree, the emphasis is on showing one's talent as a [[singer]]. Most colleges offer callback auditions, often in several stages, in which students being considered for entry onto a course are brought back to audition again, demonstrating their talents further. It is also possible to get into a drama school by previous grades. Some auditioners may be under 18.

==Course content==

The courses offered by drama schools focus on practical courses, rather than theoretical classes. Their aim is to train students as professional [[actor]]s for stage (theatre or musical theatre) and camera-based work (film and television shows). Students are required to be enthusiastic and motivated in order to meet the demands of the program. At the beginning of the final year (usually the third), most drama schools stage a series of performances throughout the academic year to which [[Talent agent|agents]] and [[casting director]]s are invited. This helps to build the future of the graduates and serves as a showcase of what the students can do.

==Funding==

===United Kingdom===
In 1833 the actress [[Frances Maria Kelly]] managed the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] where she funded and operated a dramatic school, the earliest record of a drama school in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burwick|first1=Frederick|title=British Drama of the Industrial Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Conference of Drama Schools]] comprises Britain’s 22 leading Drama Schools. CDS exists in order to strengthen the voice of the member schools, to set and maintain the highest standards of training within the vocational drama sector, and to make it easier for prospective students to understand the range of courses on offer and the application process. Founded in 1969, the 22 member schools offer courses in Acting, Musical Theatre, Directing and Technical Theatre training. Graduates of CDS courses are currently working on stage, in front of the camera and behind the scenes in theatres and studios across Britain. In September 2016, Midlands Academy of Musical Theatre opened in Birmingham. Offering West End quality training in Musical Theatre to students aged 18+, and with the same or better opportunities as many London drama schools, they offer a regional option for prospective drama school students. In 2012 it was merged with the [[National Council for Drama Training]] to create a single national authority [[Drama UK]] responsible for both the provision of Drama Training and accreditation of official courses. In 2017 Drama UK was replaced by the [[Federation of Drama Schools]].

In the UK, funding varies from drama school to drama school. Historically drama schools were not part of the mainstream academic system, and therefore were not funded on the same basis as universities. Some drama schools are now part of a university, such as [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]], which is part of the [[City University of London]], and Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance, which is part of the University of Manchester, and these tend to charge similar tuition fees to universities. Student loans, drama awards and scholarships may help to provide students with their funding.
The most prominent funding scheme for performing arts education in the UK are the [[Dance and Drama Awards]].  This is a government scheme which subsidises the training offered at a selection of the leading performing arts schools in the fields of dance, drama, musical theatre and stage management.

===Ireland===

A number of third level institutions provide courses in Drama and Theatre Studies, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from TCD [http://www.tcd.ie/drama-film-music/ Drama Dept, TCD]&lt;/ref&gt; NUI Maynooth,&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from NUIM English Dept [http://english.nuim.ie/madtherapy.shtml Dramatherapy Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin City University.  A decision by Trinity in Jan 2007 to drop its BA in Acting Studies for cost reasons met with disappointment from the theatre sector.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity News report http://www.trinitynews.ie/articles.php?tn=1&amp;issue=2&amp;id=215{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  website&lt;/ref&gt;  A Forum for Acting Training was convened with leading professionals from the industry who recommended in a report published 27 May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Acting Training Report, May 2008, [http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/pdf/forum-on-acting-training-report.pdf Forum Report]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an Academy for Dramatic Arts, independent of a University, but with third level accreditation should be created. The report was submitted to the Irish Government.  On 1 August 2008, [[The Irish Times]] reported that a [[RADA]] graduate, [[Danielle Ryan]], granddaughter of the late [[Tony Ryan]] who founded [[Ryanair]], had announced plans to develop an Irish Academy of Dramatic Arts part-funded from a Trust created by her late father, Captain Cathal Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Smyth, Irish Times, 1 August 2008 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0801/1217368811614.html Acting academy to include theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan went ahead and the academy, known as The Lir, opened in September 2011. The Lir is part of Trinity College and is situated in the Grand Canal Dock area. It is officially associated with [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art |RADA]].

'''Embodied music cognition''' is a direction within [[systematic musicology]] interested in studying the role of the human body in relation to all musical activities.

It considers the human body as the natural mediator between mind (focused on musical intentions, meanings, significations) and physical environment (containing musical sound and other types of energy that affords human action).

== Introduction ==
Given the impact of body movement on musical meaning formation and signification, the musical mind is said to be embodied. [[Embodied philosophy|Embodiment]]  assumes that what happens in the mind is depending on properties of the body, such as kinaesthetic properties.

Embodied music cognition tends to see music perception as based on action. For example, many people move when they listen to music. Through movement, it is assumed that people give meaning to music. This type of meaning-formation is corporeal, rather than cerebral because it is understood through the body. This is different from a disembodied approach to music cognition, which sees musical meaning as being based on a perception-based analysis of musical structure. The embodied grounding of music perception is based on a multi-modal encoding of auditory information and on principles that ensure the coupling of perception and action.

During the last decade, research in embodied music cognition 
has been strongly motivated by a demand for new tools in view of the interactive possibilities offered by digital media technology.

With the advent of powerful computing tools, and in particular real-time interactive music systems, gradually more attention has been devoted to the role of gesture in music. This [[musical gestures]] research has been rather influential in that it puts more emphasis on
sensorimotor feedback and integration, as well as on the coupling
of perception and action. With new sensor technology, gesture-based research has meanwhile become a vast domain of music research, with consequences for the methodological and [[epistemological]] foundations of music cognition research.

==Method==
The scientific apparatus draws upon an empirical and evidence-based methodology, which is based on measurement of sound (via audio-recording), human movement (via video-recording, kinematic recording), human biology (via bioparameter-recording) and [[semantics]] (via questionnaires). Using a scientific apparatus for measurement, statistical analysis and computational modelling, embodied music cognition aims to build up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in meaning formation.

==Applications==
Research in embodied music cognition has a strong connection with technology development, more particularly, in fields related to interactive music systems, and music information retrieval. Mediation technology is the technology by which the human body, and consequently also the human mind, can be given an extension in the digital musical domain.

==How it is distinct from (disembodied) music cognition==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] had a tremendous impact on cognitive science and in particular on cognitive musicology.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Influenced by [[Gestalt psychology]], [[music cognition]] research of the last decades of the 20th Century was mainly focusing on the perception of structure, that is, the perception of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]. It considered music perception as a faculty on its own, completely dissociated from musical action.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Instead, in studies on embodied musical activity (such as listening and music performance), subjects are invited to actively engage in the [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] process. This engagement is articulated by means of corporeal expression which can be measured, analyzed, modelled and related to the musical stimulus. [[René Descartes]]' idea that mental activity is of a separate order from body movement is refuted and, in fact reversed.

==How it is distinct from traditional musicology==
The difference with the traditional phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches to musical meaning formation is that embodied music cognition has a focus on an empirical and evidence-based methodology, rather than on subjective first-person descriptions. Embodied music cognition aims at giving a full account of the subjective involvement by taking into account the role of the social-cultural context, subjective background (involving gender, age, familiarity with music, degree of music education).

Embodied music cognition adopts a scientific methodology but its aim is not to reduce music to physics, nor to reduce gesture and embodied meaning to the biomechanics of the human body. Instead, embodied music cognition fully recognizes the contribution of all mental and bodily systems including subjective feelings, emotions and coinaesthetic (or body image) awareness.

The '''''Encyclopedia Rizaliana ''''' is one of the more recent subject-specific [[encyclopedia]]s in the [[English language]]. As the name suggests, it concerned with the life and works of Dr. [[Jose Rizal|Jose Protasio Rizal]], the [[Philippines]]' [[founding father]]. The contributors' entries were subjected to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the somewhat narrowly defined field of [[Rizaliana|Rizaline Studies]], nevertheless the peer review process involved an international community of Rizaliana experts who are qualified and able to perform impartial review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joserizal.info/gb/pepelog.htm Dr. Robert L. Yoder "The Life and Writings of Dr. Jose Rizal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/rizal/ The Jose Rizal Mailing List]&lt;/ref&gt;

The maiden one-volume edition (2008) of the encyclopedia has about 700 articles, many of them of the short-entry variety (100 words or less) but some running to considerable length (the "comics by and about Rizal" article is over 300 words long with illustrations). The work's coverage of Philippine and world geography and history may be considered too short and pales in comparison to the works of [[Ambeth Ocampo]]. Written by nine contributors, the ''Rizaliana'' includes over 900 index entries, 150 cross-references, tables, [[maps]], and black-and-white [[line art]] and color images. The contributors feel that they need not sign their specific contributions, and the references were incorporated within the articles.

==General Editor and Publisher==
The general editor, Prof. [[Jose Fadul]], a [[University of the Philippines|U.P. Diliman]] graduate currently based at the [[De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde]], was responsible for the general format of the work. He has also contributed substantially to the project itself. A review made mention that "the contributors, except for two or three, as virtually unknown in the academic field." A number of other Rizal scholars and Rizalists were earlier invited and agreed to contribute, but they had died just months before the ''Encyclopedia Rizaliana'' project formally commenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/02/01/OPED2006020155180.html Manila Bulletin Online&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518043832/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/02/01/OPED2006020155180.html |date=May 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=108399 Adrian E. Cristobal, public man of letters; 75 - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121014147/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=108399 |date=2008-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier online version of the ''Encyclopedia Rizaliana'', first introduced in June 1998 through [[Homestead Technologies]], ceased to exist in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viloria.com/secondthoughts/archives/00000217.html Synopsis of El Filibusterismo - Secondthoughts - Viloria.com&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This online version, like the latter print, is designed for high school and first-year college students along with [[public library]] users in [[Metro Manila]]. It was once available to some libraries as a [[CD-ROM]] intended for college students, with an accompanying workbook for the Course in Rizal.

Currently, ''Encyclopedia Rizaliana'' is printed and bound by the [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu Press]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mpik3raHihIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 Encyclopedia Rizaliana: Student Edition], Google Books, retrieved 2008-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; (a transnational company offering [[print-on-demand]] publishing and online order fulfillment) in [[paperback]] student edition and in casewrap-[[hardcover]] binding (i.e., a coffee-table edition). Copies of the two editions of the book were out as early December, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1430311428/ Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but they were post-dated 2008. The cover is a photo-mosaic of a popular portrait of Rizal.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Rizaliana at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde Library&lt;/ref&gt; The two said editions are also sold as downloadable [[PDF]] files.

'''''Festivals''''' is a 1973 anthology of [[festival]]-related [[folklore]] from around the world that have been compiled by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]]. According to the book's [[dust jacket]], "This potpourri of festivals reveals fascinating customs and celebrations from many countries of the world. Each special day is preceded by background material on the origins of the holiday."

Some of the special days covered are (using Manning-Sanders' words and spellings): [[New Year's Day]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bride's Day]], the [[Sapporo Snow Festival|Japanese Snow Festival]], [[Valentine's Day|Saint Valentine's Day]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], [[Shrove Tuesday]], [[Mardi Gras]], [[Easter|Easter Day]], [[April Fools' Day|All Fools' Day]], the [[Qingming Festival|Bright Weather Festival]], [[St George's Day|Saint George's Day]], [[May Day]], the [['Obby 'Oss festival|Padstow Hobby Horse]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Michaelmas|Michaelmas Day]], [[Saint Crispin's Day]], [[Halloween|Hallow E'en]], the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Fifth of November]], [[Hogmanay]], and [[Christmas]].

For many of the festivals, the book includes the writings of some famous authors or historical personalities. Among those included in the book are [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[William Sharp (writer)|Fiona Macleod]], [[Marco Polo]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles James Lyall|Sir Charles Lyall]], [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], [[Chiang Yee]], [[Flora Thompson]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Richard Cobbold]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Oliver Herford]], [[Alison Uttley]], [[Richard Crashaw]], Jon and [[Rumer Godden]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].

Editor Manning-Sanders, a [[poet]] and [[author]] who was perhaps best known for her series of [[children's books]] in which she collected and retold [[fairy tales]], contributes four pieces to this book:

* ''Not 'Zactly''
* ''The Padstow Hobby Horse''
* ''The Ghost Ship'' (an excerpt from her novel ''Mystery at Penmarth'')
* ''The Christmas Crab Apples''

'''Flying while Muslim''' or '''Muslim while flying''' is an expression referring to the problems [[Muslim]] passengers can face on [[airplane]]s, during stopovers or in airports in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. It is constructed in an analogy to the older expression [[driving while black]], which similarly satirizes [[racial profiling]] of [[African Americans]] by [[police]] and other law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/13/usnews/whispers/main2472666.shtml |title=Islamic Activists Ask, Is There A 'flying While Muslim' Bias? |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/uae-man-confronted-by-us-police-after-false-isis-accusation/news-story/c6e45cc39dce974d726ec19293af1ae8 |title=UAE man confronted by US police after false ISIS accusation |website=news.com.au |agency=AP |date=2016-07-05 |accessdate=2018-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
An early usage of the phrase is dated mid-September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=I've faced both kinds of profiling: driving while black and flying while Muslim. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00712F9345C0C768DDDA00894D9404482 |title=Metro Matters; Last Week, Profiling Was Wrong |author=Joyce Purnick |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The issue was brought to media attention in 2006 when six Muslim [[imam]]s were [[Flying Imams incident|removed]] from a [[US Airways]] flight after they allegedly engaged in suspicious behavior reminiscent of that of the 9/11 hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/michael_smerconish/20070408_Head_Strong___See_suspicious_acts__Feel_free_to_report_them.html |title=See suspicious acts Feel free to report them |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2007-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135658/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/michael_smerconish/20070408_Head_Strong___See_suspicious_acts__Feel_free_to_report_them.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0612/S00021.htm |author=William Fisher |title=Not Flying While Muslim |publisher=Scoop News |date=2006-12-01 |type=opinion |accessdate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 [[AirTran Airways]] removed nine Muslim passengers, including three children, from a flight and turned them over to the [[FBI]] after one of the men commented to another that they were sitting right next to the engines and wondered aloud where the safest place to sit on the plane was. Although the FBI subsequently cleared the passengers and called the incident a "misunderstanding", AirTran refused to seat the passengers on another flight, forcing them to purchase last minute tickets on another airline that had been secured with the FBI's assistance. A spokesman for AirTran initially defended the airline's actions and said they would not reimburse the passengers for the cost of the new tickets. Although the men had traditional beards and the women [[headscarves]], AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/01/AR2009010101932.html?hpid=topnews |title=9 Muslim Passengers Removed From Jet |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/02/AR2009010201695.html |title=Airline Apologizes For Booting 9 Muslim Passengers From Flight |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2009-01-03 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwest Airlines===
On November 18, 2015, in two separate incidents, passengers at Midway Airport were allegedly not permitted to fly aboard [[Southwest Airlines]] flights when other passengers claimed to be afraid to fly with them because they were speaking Arabic, or appeared to be Muslim. The refusal sparked widespread condemnation on the airline's social media pages and received prominent coverage, in the US and internationally, accompanied by calls for a [[boycott]] of the airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/21/southwest-airlines-muslim-middle-eastern-passengers|title=Southwest Airlines criticized after incidents involving Middle Eastern passengers|author=Lauren Gambino|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "in the two Southwest cases, it was the passengers themselves conducting their own vigilante profiling; the airline was merely bowing to their demands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southwest Airlines accused of profiling Muslims|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/11/nothing-fear-except-fear-itself|accessdate=25 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2016, [[Southwest Airlines]] removed a passenger from a flight at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] for speaking Arabic before pushback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2016/04/14/uc-berkeley-student-questioned-refused-service-speaking-arabic-flight/ |title=UC Berkeley student questioned, refused service after speaking Arabic on flight |author=Maya Eliahou |newspaper=[[Daily Californian]] |date=2016-04-15 |orig-year=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/us/student-speaking-arabic-removed-southwest-airlines-plane.html |title=College Student Is Removed From Flight After Speaking Arabic on Plane |author=Liam Stack |date=2016-04-17 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] detained the passenger, searched his belongings and questioned him for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noelle Devoe |url=http://www.seventeen.com/life/news/a39799/college-student-kicked-off-southwest-airplane-for-speaking-arabic-on-the-phone/ |title=College Student Allegedly Yanked Off Airplane for Speaking Arabic on the Phone |newspaper=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]] |date=2016-04-20 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Southwest spokesperson declined to apologize and defended Southwest's decisions by saying "We will not be apologizing for following our obligation to adhere to established procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/20/475015239/flying-while-muslim-profiling-fears-after-arabic-speaker-removed-from-plane |title='Flying While Muslim': Profiling Fears After Arabic Speaker Removed From Plane |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2016-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The passenger, Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, an Iraqi refugee, later said that those actions were "playing straight into the rhetoric of the Islamic State—they fall into the trap" and, "That is when I couldn't handle it and my eyes began to water&amp;nbsp;... the way they searched me and the dogs, the officers, people were watching me and the humiliation made me so afraid because it brought all of these memories back to me.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8527">'''Formula composition''' is a [[serialism|serially]] derived technique encountered principally in the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], involving the projection, expansion, and ''[[Ausmultiplikation]]'' of either a single [[melody]]-formula, or a two- or three-voice [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] construction (sometimes stated at the outset).

In contrast to serial music, where the structuring features are more or less abstract and remain largely inaccessible to the listener's ear, in formula composition the musical specifications of [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[timbre]], and [[tempo]] are always directly evident in the sound, through the use of a concisely articulated melodic tone succession, the formula, which defines the large-scale form as well as all the internal musical details of the composition {{harv|Blumröder|1982|loc=184–85}}.

==Stockhausen's music==
Though foreshadowed in Stockhausen's once-withdrawn ''[[Formel (Stockhausen)|Formel]]'' ("Formula") of 1951, the technique made its first appearance in ''[[Mantra (Stockhausen)|Mantra]]'' in 1970, and became the central focus of Stockhausen's music up to 2003. Stockhausen's mammoth [[opera]] cycle ''[[Licht]]'' is based on a three-strand "super-formula".

Hermann {{harvtxt|Conen|1991|loc=57}} identifies two kinds of formula composition in Stockhausen’s works prior to ''Licht'': &lt;blockquote&gt;formula compositions in which the form results from projection of the formula, . . . [and] works in which melodies in themselves possess many internal characteristics of formulas, but where the formal idea itself does not originate from the formula(s) used in their realisation&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Works of the first type include ''Mantra'' (1970), ''[[Inori: Adorations for One or Two Soloists with Orchestra|Inori]]'' (1973–74), ''[[Jubiläum]]'' (1977), and ''[[In Freundschaft]]'' (1977); works of the second type comprise ''[[Alphabet für Liège]]'' (1972), the “Laub und Regen” duet from ''[[Herbstmusik]]'' (1974), ''[[Musik im Bauch]]'' (1975), ''[[Harlekin]]'' (1975), ''[[Harlekin#Der kleine Harlekin|Der kleine Harlekin]]'' (1975), and ''[[Sirius (Stockhausen)|Sirius]]'' (1975–77). Other works from the 1970s, such as ''[[Sternklang]]'' (1971), ''[[Trans (Stockhausen)|Trans]]'' (1971), ''[[Ylem (Stockhausen)|Ylem]]'' (1972), the first three parts of ''Herbstmusik'', ''[[Atmen gibt das Leben]]'' (1974/76–77), ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'' (1974–75), and ''[[Amour (Stockhausen)|Amour]]'' (1976) do not employ formula technique, according to Conen, though the composer includes ''Atmen gibt das Leben'' amongst the works composed using "formula complexes" {{harv|Stockhausen|1989a}}.

==Other composers==
[[Pierre Boulez]] describes his composition ''[[Rituel in Memoriam Bruno Maderna|Rituel, in memoriam Bruno Maderna]]'' (1975) as a "ceremony of memory", based on "numerous repetitions of the same formulas", and it has been seen as an analogue to Stockhausen's formula compositions—especially to ''Inori'', because of the shared ritual character of the two compositions {{harv|Blumröder|1982|loc=183–84}}.

[[York Höller]], who studied with Stockhausen in 1971–72, uses a similar method, which he names ''Klanggestalt'' (literally, "sound-shape"), and at least one writer has used the expression "formula composition" to describe it {{harv|Stenzl|1991|loc=12–15}}. Finbar O'Súilleabháin, however, while accepting there are parallels between the techniques in Höller's opera ''The Master and Margarita'' (1984–85) and Stockhausen's ''Licht'' cycle (1977–2003), concludes that Höller's conception is "perfectly distinct" {{harv|O'Súilleabháin|1992}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37644">[[File:Skulptur Grieser Platz (Schmarg) Europa macht Handstand III.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the long-time chairman of the ''FBK'' Ernst Leonhardt]]
The '''Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung''' ('''FBK'''), the “Free Berlin Art Exhibition” in [[Berlin|Berlin (Germany)]], was “unique in its structure”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_05" /&gt; For 24 years, from 1971 to 1995, it was the only non-juried art exhibition of its size in Europe. It opened after the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'', the “Grand Berlin Art Exhibition”, a juried art exhibition, had closed its doors. Supported by the [[Senate of Berlin]], an association, called the ''Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung'' was registered in 1970 with the goal to organize annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name="veranstalter" /&gt; Hans-Joachim Zeidler became chairperson of this association for the first four years, followed by [[Ernst Leonhardt (Artist)]]. During the association's last four years, Karin Rech&lt;ref name="vorstand" /&gt; took over the leadership.

== History ==
[[File:Messe berlin II (441067608).jpg|thumb|Exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]]]]
The first ''FBK'' took place in the exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]] in 1971. At that time, the so-called [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] movement was already in full swing. The unrest of this period had inspired many social groups, and artists as well were “woken up”, as Zeidler reported in his review in 1983.&lt;ref name="zeidler-01" /&gt;  Already at its beginning, the ''FBK'' was able to “look back on a Berlin tradition that was dating back to the [[Weimar Republic]].”&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; However, early evidence of non-juried art exhibitions points to the 19th century. A poster collection at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] contains a poster by [[Ludwig von Hofmann]]. The draft of this poster – which he had originally designed in 1893 for the first ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'' – was rejected. The portrayal of a “sparsely clad young man was apparently seen as an offense and was removed by the Berlin police, according to contemporary reports.”&lt;ref name="fbk_1893" /&gt; As some artists had been rejected by the jury of the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'', a second exhibition, which had called itself ''FBK'', was organized, running concurrently with the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung''. Its location was close by, across the road at the [[Moltke Bridge]]. It accepted Ludwig von Hofmann's poster. [[Käthe Kollwitz]], who was still an unknown artist at that time, exhibited in 1895 in the ''FBK''&lt;ref name="kollwitz" /&gt; which had always been seen as an alternative to the juried art exhibitions.

In addition to these early historical roots, the ''Non-Juried Art Exhibition'' featured a direct predecessor in 1965, as mentioned in the archives of the ''Association of Female Artists of Berlin''.&lt;ref name="berliner_kuenstlerinnen" /&gt; After the ''FBK'' had presented its first exhibition in 1971, it took 12 years for an acting mayor of Berlin to officially comment on the exhibition.&lt;ref name="leonhardt-02" /&gt; Such comments had been anticipated for years. In 1983 [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] was the first mayor who was willing to write words of acknowledgement.&lt;ref name="weizsaecker_2" /&gt; Since then greetings from the acting mayor of Berlin became a tradition.

{{Quote
 | text=The Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung has established itself in the cultural life of Berlin and beyond. It has long embodied a piece of [[Zeitgeist]], changeable, full of surprises, appreciated or criticized, always alive. The 13th Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung will also spark discussions, raise questions and leave them unanswered, letting what is transitory and what is permanent come into contact. Berlin can not and should not do without an exhibition of this kind. I hope that it will generate the same lively interest which a receptive audience full of dedication and contradiction also devoted to its predecessors.

}}

For the first time in 1990, after what was called [[Die Wende]] – after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] but before [[German reunification]] – [[Walter Momper]], mayor of Berlin at that time, congratulated the FBK, hoping for “satisfied artists and many interested visitors from East and West”.&lt;ref name="momper" /&gt; In 1991 the time had come to announce: “The 21st FBK is finally a free exhibition for all artists of Berlin.”&lt;ref name="rech" /&gt;

From the very beginning, the “fiercely controversial but hotly loved”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; FBK faced criticism, sometimes there was even harsh rejection. The critics turned against the concept of a non-juried exhibition, as well as the inclusion of anyone who wanted to exhibit. This allowed “young, unknown, perhaps also ‘not so good’ artists, such as hobby artists, to participate.” Many rejected this concept. Leonhardt pointed out the “charm of the FBK” and stressed that for some it was “a spring-board to a great career”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; For Nicole Bröhan, the “always controversial mixture of professional and amateur artists […] created its special appeal”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; In 1994 she wrote in the [[Berliner Zeitung]]&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; that she saw the FBK as “talent forging”. Despite all the positive reports, the FBK's continued existence was always at risk. “What a triumph! The FBK, which is dead at least once every year, will turn 25. Who would have thought?”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; With these words, Ernst Leonhardt, meanwhile honorary chairman of the association, began his review at the FBK's 25th anniversary. He could not know at that time that, due to the financial situation, it would be the last opening of the FBK. For that exhibition to take place at all, there was an “art auction during which 1,000 works donated by Berlin artists were auctioned off” – “in order to support the exhibition”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt;

Unlike the usual concepts of exhibitions, the goal of the FBK was for the artists themselves, not [[Art dealer|professional gallery owners]] or [[curators]], to take over management and organization of the exhibition, as well as the hanging of the art works. A jury did not exist. Organizer of the exhibitions was the registered association of the FBK. The management of the exhibitions was led by the respective chairperson of the association, while the organizational aspects were handled by a group of seven members. The preparation and execution of the exhibitions was coordinated by the "Colleagues of the Management".&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; As a rule, the FBK took place in the second quarter of each year. Around Christmas the year before, registration forms were sent to the artists.

Two divisions were set up, a ''Free Division'' and a division for groups. The former consisted of professional artists only, the latter of non-professional artists who joined as groups. Among the many exhibiting artist groups were diverse artist associations, as well as students from the [[Berlin University of the Arts]], which regularly exhibited as a large group of their own.

The usually not conflict-free process of hanging the art work was organized based on its own concept. A “Hanging Commission” was set up for the ''Free Division''. It was the commission's responsibility to find a suitable place for about 1,200 works of art within three days.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; The groups were each assigned a location appropriate to their size in which they arranged the hanging themselves.

Two-thirds of the exhibitors were professional artists, one third ‘hobby artists’.&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_1" /&gt; At the 20th anniversary of the exhibition, the chairman expressed satisfaction that the ''Free Division'' and the groups were now “finally equal” in the allocation of space.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_03" /&gt; Among the celebrities of the exhibitors were Louise Rösler, [[Walter Stöhrer]], Fred Thieler and Jürgen Draeger. The latter presented on his website several cover pages of the catalogs.&lt;ref name="draeger" /&gt; While for almost 20 years male artists were overrepresented, the gender distribution was balanced for the first time in 1990 – “without any quotation”, as Walter Momper acknowledged in his greeting.&lt;ref name="momper" /&gt; In 1991 about 300 artists from the Eastern part of Berlin took part for the first time.

Despite financial difficulties, the FBK provided a catalog for all the exhibitions. These catalogs were printed on high-quality paper with support from the Berlin printing company ''Ruksal''. From 1987 on, the catalogs were supplemented by a hall plan which made it easier to find the artists in the ''Free Division'' as well as in the groups.

== Exhibition ==
For four weeks each year, between April and June, the FBK organizers opened the doors of the exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]] and invited the public. “Drawings, pictures, spatial as well as sound and video installations, sculptures, collages, photography” were presented.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt; In addition to depressive performances,&lt;ref name="performance" /&gt; there were also humorous inventions, such as a ''potency automat ''(1986)&lt;ref name="morgenpost_2" /&gt; or an ''art licensing machine''(1989).&lt;ref name="kunstberechtigungsautomat" /&gt; Over the years, not only the exhibition itself, but also the accompanying program developed. Prints and small sculptures were sold in a bazaar. On Saturdays there were guided tours. A traditional breakfast with jazz music and discussions enjoyed increasing popularity. A ''Kinderatelier'' (children's art room) was open daily where children, guided by artists, could paint. While the program changed at times, there were special readings by women, or “music played on historical instruments”.&lt;ref name="begleitprogramm" /&gt; The exhibition management was also interested in the outer appearance of the exhibition halls. A proposal for a ''flag project'' was repeatedly turned down by the Senate. Eventually the artists financed the project at their own expense. In 1989 “the visitors of the 19th FBK were greeted at the entrance to the exhibition halls by 70 colourful flags [...], which had never been shown before”.&lt;ref name="fahnenprojekt" /&gt; In 1991, as in previous years, a “graphic competition for students of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]]” was organized.&lt;ref name="rech" /&gt; In 1992, the project began with picture panels, 30 large-format paintings on the outside of the exhibition halls, designed to “catch the eye”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt; For the first time in 1993, art discussions were held in which artists and visitors alike participated. They took place every day, with the aim to encourage “thinking with one's eyes”.&lt;ref name="rech_2" /&gt; A five-minute-long video, published on YouTube on October 5, 2010, highlights events of the 19th FBK. It provides an impression of the atmosphere typical of the  exhibitions.&lt;ref name="kunstberechtigungsautomat" /&gt;

== Media ==
The media-echo was slow in coming. In 1983 – twelve years after the FBK's opening – Leonhardt still expressed hope “that the media would finally provide stronger support to this exhibition”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt-02" /&gt; In 1990 he was able to report that “the acceptance we have recently received from the media was positive and seems to continue to be so.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_03" /&gt; The [[Berliner Morgenpost]] which had already devoted a full, richly illustrated page&lt;ref name="morgenpost" /&gt; regarding the FBK, was also reporting regularly.

{{Quote
 | text=A forest of images rushes from Hall 20 at Hammarskjöldplatz to Hall 23, waiting for the visitors to explore it. […] Why should four halls deter Berliners […] trained by an exhibition like the [[Berlin International Green Week]]? And then there is also the matter of taste, which – as is well known – can't be disputed! Thus, Ernst Leonhardt likes to quote the words of the Secretary of State at the ''Kultursenator'', Lutz von Pufendorf: If the FBK did not exist, it would have to be invented.

== Finances ==
Besides numerous sponsors and catalog advertisers, the FBK was financed by the [[Senate of Berlin]]. Over the course of about 20&amp;nbsp;years, from 1971 to 1993, its budget had grown steadily from 120,000&amp;nbsp;[[Deutsche Mark]]&amp;nbsp;(DM) to over 760,000&amp;nbsp;DM. During that period, from 1981 to 1983, the budget of the FBK had been fixed and was slightly reduced in 1984. Well-known companies of the city helped fill the gaps. Senator Volker Hassemer secured the budget in 1985 which increased during the following eight years. The rent also increased considerably over the years and amounted to nearly 400,000&amp;nbsp;DM in 1995, leaving only 360,000&amp;nbsp;DM of the Senate's grants for the realization of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="rech_3" /&gt; This exhibition would not have been possible without donations from the artists. A year later the Senate stopped the grants entirely. That decision sealed the end of the FBK. During the jubilee exhibition in 1995 the organizers assumed that – while budget cuts had to be made – the FBK could still take place every second year, in a “2-year rhythm”,&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_2" /&gt; as the former cultural director Ulrich Roloff-Momin had stated. Nothing came out of it. There were appeals, some of them were drastic:

{{Quote

== Figures ==
The figures presented here are incomplete. A first overview was published in the catalog of the 20th FBK relating to the years 1971 to 1989,&lt;ref name="zahlen_1" /&gt; and a second one in the catalog of the 24th FBK for the years 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref name="zahlen_2" /&gt; Thus, there is no information about 1990 and the last two years.

In the documented period –&amp;nbsp;between 1983 and 1989&amp;nbsp;– the number of exhibitors increased from 750 to 2,400, with certain fluctuations. The number of groups involved rose from 25 to 82 and peaked with 91 groups in 1992. The number of visitors varied between 12,400 and 34,000 with a high in 1978. The grants made available by the [[Senate of Berlin]] for the organization and the set-up of the exhibition increased more or less continuously from 150,000 DM to more than 750,000 DM in 1993. In addition, there were not only sponsors, but also artists who sold their art to cover expenses of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="rech_3" /&gt; Nevertheless, money was always scarce, as Ernst Leonhardt's constantly admonishing words in the catalogs testify. The exhibition space had increased over the years to 9,000 square meters&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_1" /&gt; but the rent increased as well. It multiplied sixfold from the beginning to the last exhibition.

With the exception of the first two years, the number of art works that were sold increased consistently and grew steadily to a 6-figure sum, just under half a million in 1992. Yet, Leonhardt regrets: “Not more than about 5&amp;nbsp;% of the visual artists can support themselves through their work.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_04" /&gt; There were discussions about the often modest purchases of art works by the [[Senate of Berlin]] which were in the single-digit percentage range of the budget for art purchases.“Ridiculous, the disillusioned say, that of a 670,000 DM budget less than 5&amp;nbsp;% was purchased at the FBK, even though the Senator himself considers this exhibition to be the most important of the year in Berlin.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_04" /&gt;

==Early life==
Werden was born Linda Catherine Samfield in [[Austin, Texas]]. In 1972, she formally changed her name to Frieda Lindfield Werden.&lt;ref name=barbaralovebook&gt;{{cite book |last=Love|first=Barbara|date=2006|title=Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=Urbana, Ill.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=489|isbn= 9780252031892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in several other US cities before emigrating to Canada in 2002.

==Work in Media==

Werden began producing radio with the Longhorn Radio Network in 1973.  Her early radio series included ''Women Today'', a show about [[feminist movements]] in Texas.&lt;ref name=barbaralovebook/&gt;  In 1975 Werden co-produced a multipart radio series about homosexuality called ''What’s Normal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eskridge|first=William N.|date=1999|title=Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZTnDgeygHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gaylaw:+Challenging+the+Apartheid+of+the+Closet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FHmLVJLROMK3ogTx4oCgCw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gaylaw%3A%20Challenging%20the%20Apartheid%20of%20the%20Closet&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, Mass.|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=122|isbn=0674341619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 she worked for National Public Radio producing docudramas about various women writers, and, working with Judie Pasternak, formed a women’s news caucus at the National Federation of Community Radio Broadcasters conference.&lt;ref name=globalintersections&gt;{{cite book |last=Werden|first=Frieda|editor1-last=Allen|editor1-first=Donna|editor2-last=Rush|editor2-first=Ramona R.|editor3-last=Kaufman|editor3-first=Susan J.|date=1996|title="The Founding of WINGS: A Story of Feminist Radio Survival" Women Transforming Communications: Global Intersections|url=http://www.wings.org/ftp/special%20transfers/wingsfire-1995.pdf|publisher=Sage Publications|pages=218–25|isbn= 9780803972674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Werden became operations manager of Western Public Radio in [[San Francisco]]. There she co-founded ''WINGS: Women's International News Gathering Service'' (1986-  ) with Katherine Davenport and Augusta Del Zotto, heavily inspired by a newsletter called ''Media Report to Women''&lt;ref name=globalintersections/&gt; which was produced by [[The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]]. The inaugural ''WINGS'' newscast was released in May 1986 with the financial assistance of [[NPR]]’s Satellite Program Development Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gift-economy.com/wings.html 
|title= WINGS|last1=Werden |first1=Frieda |website= Gift Economy |accessdate= 7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially based out of their San Francisco home, Werden moved back to Austin, Texas after Davenport’s passing from [[Leukemia]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith|first=Amy|date=20 September 1996|title="Have Wings, Will Fly: Frieda Werden’s Women’s News Projects Take Off"|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/1996-09-20/524626/|newspaper=The Austin Chronicle|location=Austin, Texas|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Werden became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. In the 1990s, she worked with a team of women in Austin, Texas, to produce a cable access television show called Women's News Hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/02733/cah-02733.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993-2002, she worked for [[Genevieve Vaughan]]’s Foundation for a Compassionate Society in Austin, Texas, and helped to establish and staff Women's Access to Electronic Resources (WATER).&lt;ref name=barbaralovebook/&gt; In 1998, in Milan, Werden became North America Representative to the Women's International Network of [[AMARC]] (the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters).

'''Frère Jacques''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|r|ɛr|ə|_|ˈ|ʒ|ɑː|k|ə}}, {{IPA-fr|fʁɛʁ ʒɑk|lang}}, in the nursery rhyme and in song more generally {{IPA-fr|fʁɛʁə ʒɑkə|}}, also known in [[English language|English]] as '''Brother John''', is a [[nursery rhyme]] of [[French language|French]] origin. The rhyme is traditionally sung in a [[Round (music)|round]].

Besides its English and French names, "Frère Jacques" is known by a variety of names: in [[Afrikaans]] as "Vader Jakob"; in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as "Bratec Martin"; in [[Danish language|Danish]] as "Mester Jakob"; in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as "Broeder Jacob" (in [[Flanders]]) or "Vader Jacob" (in the [[Netherlands]]); in [[Esperanto]] as "Frat' Jakobo"; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as "Jaakko kulta"; in [[German language|German]] as "Meister Jakob" or "Bruder Jakob"; in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as "אחינו הנהג" ([[Romanization|romanized]] as "Achinu HaNehag"); in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as "János bácsi"; in [[Italian language|Italian]] as "Fra' Martino"; in [[Polish language|Polish]] as "Panie Janie"; in [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] as "Mojster Jaka"; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as either "Fray Santiago" or "Martinillo", and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] as "Kìa Con Bướm Vàng".

The song is about a [[friar]] who has overslept and is urged to wake up and sound the bell for the [[matins]], the midnight or very early morning prayers for which a monk would be expected to wake.

{{Listen|filename=Frère Jacques.mid|title=Frère Jacques round|description=Tune for ''Frère Jacques'' as a round}}

This translation preserves the musicality but greatly distorts the meaning: the whole point is that the bells ''are not ringing'', because brother John, who is supposed to ring them, is sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Landes, ''The wealth and poverty of nations'', W. W. Norton, NY, London, 1998, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The song concerns a monk's duty to ring the bell for ''matines''. Frère Jacques has apparently overslept, it is time to ring the bell for matines, and someone wakes him up with this song.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Landes, ''The wealth and poverty of nations'', W. W. Norton, NY, London, 1998, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In English, the word ''[[friar]]'' is derived from the [[Old French]] word ''frere'' (Modern French ''frère''; "brother" in English), as French was still widely used in official circles in England during the 13th century when [[Friar#Orders|the four great orders of Friars]] started. The French word ''frère'' in turn comes from the Latin word ''frater'' (which also means "brother").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=friar Entry for "friar" at the Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories of origin ===
A possible connection between ''Frère Jacques'' and the 17th century  [[Lithotomy|lithotomist]] [[Frère Jacques Beaulieu]] (also known as Frère Jacques Baulot&lt;ref&gt;[http://beaufort39.free.fr/baulot.htm Jacques BAULOT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Un célèbre lithotomiste franc-comtois : Jacques Baulot dit Frère Jacques (1651-1720)'', E. Bourdin, Besançon, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;), as claimed by [[Irvine Loudon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Western Medicine'', Irvine Loudon, Oxford University Press, Dec 1, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-924813-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, was explored by J. P. Ganem and C. C. Carson&lt;ref&gt;''Frère Jacques Beaulieu: from rogue lithotomist to nursery rhyme character'', Ganem JP, Carson CC, J Urol. 1999 Apr;161(4):1067-9.&lt;/ref&gt; without finding any evidence for a connection.

Francesca Draughon and Raymond Knapp argue that ''Frère Jacques'' was originally a song to taunt [[Jews]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s or [[Martin Luther]] (see [[Frère Jacques in popular culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Mahler and the Crisis of Jewish Identity'' by Francesca Draughon and Raymond Knapp, ECHO volume III, issue 2 (Fall 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Martine David and A. Marie Delrieu suggest that ''Frère Jacques'' might have been created to mock the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monks, known in France as the Jacobin order, for their sloth and comfortable lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdonline.com/fr/services/forums/message.asp?id=298382&amp;msgid=4831545&amp;poster=0&amp;ok=0 ''Refrains d'enfants, histoire de 60 chansons populaires'', Martine David, A. Marie Delrieu, Herscher, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of a book about [[Kozma Prutkov]], Richard Gregg notes it has been claimed that ''Frère Jacques'' ''Frère Jacques'' was derived from a Russian seminary song about a "Father Theofil".&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Koz'ma Prutkov: The Art of Parody'' by Barbara Heldt Monter, reviewed by Richard Gregg, [[Slavic Review]], Vol. 33, No. 2 (Jun., 1974), pp. 401-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Published record ==

=== First publication ===
[[Allmusic]] states that the earliest printed version of the melody is on a French manuscript circa 1780 (manuscript 300 in the manuscript collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]]). The manuscript is titled "Recueil de Timbres de Vaudevilles", and the Bibliothèque Nationale estimates that it was printed between 1775 and 1785. The ''Frère Jacques'' melody is labelled "Frère Blaise" in this manuscript.

Sheet music collector James Fuld (1916–2008) states that the tune was first published in 1811,&lt;ref&gt;La Cle du Caveau a l'usage de tous les Chansonniers francais, Paris, 1811&lt;/ref&gt; and that the words and music were published together in Paris in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of World Famous Music Classical, Popular, and Folk', James J. Fuld, 1995, Dover Publications, Inc., {{ISBN|0-486-28445-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier publication in 1825 included the words together with a description of the melody in [[solfège]], but not in musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Expositions et pratique des procédés de la mnemotechniques, à l'usage des personnes qui veulent étudier la mnémotechnie en général |first=Aimé |last=Paris |location=Paris |year=1825 |pages=502–505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_tQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words and music appear together in ''Recreations de l'enfance: Recueil de Rondes avec Jeux et de Petites Chansons pour Faire Jouer, Danser et Chanter les Enfants avec un Accompagnement de Piano Très-Facile'' by [[Charles Lebouc]], which was first published in 1860 by Rouart, Lerolle &amp; C. in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;the C. stands for Cie., which in English would be Co. or Company&lt;/ref&gt; This book was very popular and it was republished several times, so many editions exist.

French musicologist Sylvie Bouissou has found some evidence that composer [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] had written the music. A manuscript at the [[French National Library]] contains Frère Jacques among 86 canons, with Rameau listed as author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/frere-jacques-ete-compose-par-jean-philippe-rameau-49327 "Frère Jacques" a été composé par Jean Philippe Rameau]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with Fra Jacopino ===
''Frère Jacques'' bears resemblance to the piece ''Toccate d'intavolatura, No.14, Capriccio Fra Jacopino sopra L'Aria Di Ruggiero'' composed by [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]],&lt;ref&gt;Frescobaldi: Harpsichord Works, composer: Jacques Arcadelt, Girolamo Frescobaldi; Performer: Louis Bagger. Audio CD (August 28, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which was first published around 1615&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/cds/tct80680.htm Frescobaldi: Toccate &amp; Partite, Libro Primo], Todd M. McComb&lt;/ref&gt; - "Fra Jacopino" is one potential Italian translation for "Frère Jacques".&lt;ref&gt;''Fra Jacopino'' has additional historical importance. The [[half note]] and [[quarter note]] are [http://www.bartleby.com/61/imagepages/A4halfno.html reported] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916174607/http://bartleby.com/61/imagepages/A4halfno.html |date=2006-09-16 }} to have first appeared in Frescobaldi's publication of ''Fra Jacopino''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Kilenyi]] pointed out that ''Fra Jacopino'' shares the same ''Frère Jacques''-like melody as ''Chanson de Lambert'', a French song dating from 1650, and a Hungarian folk tune.&lt;ref&gt;''The Theory of Hungarian Music'', Edward Kilenyi, Musical Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 1 (Jan., 1919), pp. 20-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Frère Jacques'' tune is one of the most basic [[Canon (music)|repeating canons]] along with the melody of [[Three Blind Mice]]. It is also simple enough to have spread easily from place to place. For example, Barbara Mittler in a conference abstract points out that the melody of ''Frère Jacques'' is so thoroughly assimilated into [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] that it might be widely regarded as a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] folksong in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;''From Mozart to Mao to Mozart--Western Music in Modern China'', Barbara Mittler, Rethinking cultural revolution culture, Heidelberg, 22-24.2.2001&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Jews considered all of the non-Jewish nations in biblical times as [[polytheistic]] and [[idolatry|idolatrous]], the Hebrew word goy has for some time acquired the meaning "[[paganism|heathen]]". In a more comprehensive definition, the word goy corresponds to the later term ''ummot ha-olam'' (nations of the world).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6585-gentile "Gentile"]. ''Jewish Encyclopedia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
The word {{lang|he-Latn|goy}} means "nation" in [[Biblical Hebrew]]. In the [[Torah]], {{lang|he-Latn|goy}} and its variants appear over 550 times in reference to [[Israelite]]s and to [[gentile]] nations. The first recorded usage of ''goyim'' occurs in {{bibleverse|Genesis||10:5|HE}} and applies innocuously to non-Israelite nations. The first mention of ''goy'' in relation to the Israelites comes in {{bibleverse|Genesis||12:2|HE}}, when God promises [[Abraham]] that his descendants will form a {{lang|he-Latn|goy gadol}} ("great nation"). In {{bibleverse|Exodus||19:6|HE}}, the [[Jewish people]] are referred to as a {{lang|he-Latn|goy kadosh}}, a "holy nation".&lt;ref name="RoseKlein2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Or N. Rose|author2=Margie Klein|author3=Jo Ellen Green Kaiser|author4=David Ellenson|title=Righteous Indignation: A Jewish Call for Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNbvH10-jLoC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=18 November 2010|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-414-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] often use {{lang|he-Latn|goy}}  to describe the Israelites, the later Jewish writings tend to apply the term to other nations.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Some Bible translations leave the word {{lang|he-Latn|Goyim}} untranslated and treat it as the proper name of a country in {{bibleverse|Genesis||14:1|HE}}, where it states that the "King of Goyim" was [[Tidal (Bible King)|Tidal]]. Bible commentaries suggest that the term may refer to [[Gutium]]. In all other cases in the Bible, {{lang|he-Latn|goyim}}  is the plural of {{lang|he-Latn|goy}}  and means "nations".&lt;ref name = "ISB" /&gt;

One of the more poetic descriptions of the [[chosen people]] in the Hebrew Bible, and popular among Jewish scholarship, as the highest description of themselves: when God proclaims in the holy writ, {{lang|he-Latn|goy ehad b'aretz}}, or "a unique nation upon the earth!" ({{bibleref2|2 Samuel|7:23}} and {{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|17:21}}).

Because of the idolatry and immoralities of the surrounding nations, the biblical writings show a passionate intolerance of these nations. Thus the seven ''goyim'', i.e., nations (Deuteronomy 7:1, 12:2), were to be treated with but little mercy; and, more especially, marriages with them were not to be tolerated (Deut. 7:3; comp. Exodus 34:16).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6585-gentile "Gentile."] ''Jewish Encyclopedia.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic Judaism==
The [[rabbinic literature]] conceives of the nations ({{lang|he-Latn|goyim}}) of the world as numbering seventy, each with a distinct language and purpose.

[[Chaim ibn Attar]]&lt;ref&gt;On {{bibleverse|Numbers||8:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that this is the symbolism behind the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]:{{quote|The seven candles of the Menorah [in the [[Holy Temple]]] correspond to the world's nations, which number seventy. Each [candle] alludes to ten [nations]. This alludes to the fact that they all shine opposite the western [candle], which corresponds to the Jewish people.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}}

[[Maimonides]] defines plain ''goy'' in his [[Mishneh Torah]] as a worshipper of idolatry, as he explains, "Whenever we say plainly 'goy', we mean a worshipper of idolatry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5211n.htm Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot 11:8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
In [[modern Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] the word ''goy'' is the standard term for a gentile. In English, the use of the word ''goy'' can be controversial. It is sometimes used [[pejorative]]ly to refer to a non-Jew, but it is inherently no more insulting than the term ''gentile''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JewFaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfthal"/&gt;

The term ''[[shabbos goy]]'' (literally "Sabbath gentile") refers to a non-Jew who performs duties that [[Halakha|Jewish law]] forbids a Jew from performing on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].

[[File:Njal saga - Hestatingshol.jpg|thumb|240px|''Hestavíg'', [[Andreas Bloch]] (1898).]]
'''Hestavíg''' was an entertainment activity during the [[Viking Age]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] (930 - 1262), presumably a sport consisting of a brutal and bloody [[Organized horse fighting|confrontation between two stallions]], egged on by their masters, which mainly served to choose the best specimens for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Short (2010), ''Icelanders in the Viking Age: The People of the Sagas'', ed. McFarland, {{ISBN|0786456078}} p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a cultural event of great importance and sometimes behaved verbal and physical confrontations among the spectators. The triumph of a champion or the other, could impact socially and politically in the pacts and alliances between [[goði]] (chieftains) and [[bóndi]] (homesteaders), as testified in the [[Norse saga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Elwyn Hartley (1994), ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', New York, ed. Dorling Kindersley. {{ISBN|1-56458-614-6}} pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; The site where these battles held was a neutral place used to strengthen friendship or treat issues among rivals. It was also an opportunity for courtship between young couples.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, John D. (2003), ''Sports and Games in Icelandic Saga Literature''. Scandinavian Studies 75: 27–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes rivalries raised among participants and ended in bloody conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;''Laxdæla Saga'', Penguin Classics, 1975, {{ISBN|0-14044-218-9}} p. 130–131 footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples appear in the ''[[Njáls saga]]'' (chapter 59) and  ''[[Víga-Glúms saga]]'' (chapters 13-14).&lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse (1993), ''Feud in the Icelandic Saga'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|0520082591}} p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the activity came possibly from [[Norway]]. Sometimes Icelanders exported stallions specially trained for competitions in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;''Hrafnkel's Saga and Other Histories'', Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044238-0}} p. 73 footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skeið ==
''[[Skeið]]'' ([[skeidh]]) was another activity related to horses. It was a popular race competition from mainland [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Svale Solheim (1956), ''Horse-fight and Horse-race in Norse Tradition'', ed. H. Aschehoug, pp. 45, 46, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Hestavíg is featured in the Icelandic viking film ''[[In the Shadow of the Raven]]''.

A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===
{| border="0"
|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}
In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

===Usage by Muslims===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).

'''[[Hindustānī]]''', also known as Hindi-Urdu, comprises several closely related dialects in the northern, central and northwestern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It encompasses two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s in the forms of the official languages [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], as well as several [[nonstandard dialect]]s.  [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is not an immediate descendant of [[Sanskrit]], but uses a large lexicon of [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Hindi|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/hindi/guide/facts.shtml|website=BBC - Languages - Hindi|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumar|first1=Nitin|title=Hindi &amp; Its Origin|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/hindi/hindi-its-origin/|website=Hindi Language Blog|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard Hindi derives much of its formal and technical vocabulary from Sanskrit while standard Urdu derives much of its formal and technical vocabulary from [[Persian language|Persian]]. Standard Hindi and Urdu are used primarily in public addresses and radio or TV news, while the everyday spoken language is one of the several varieties of Hindustani, whose vocabulary contains words drawn from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Sanskrit]]. In addition, spoken Hindustani includes words from [[English language|English]] and the [[Dravidian languages]], as well as several others.

Hindustani developed over several centuries throughout much of the northern subcontinent including the areas that comprise modern-day India, Pakistan, and Nepal. In the same way that the core vocabulary of English evolved from Old English (Anglo-Saxon) but assimilated a large number of words borrowed from French and other languages (whose pronunciations often changed naturally so as to become easier for speakers of English to pronounce), what may be called Hindustani can be said to have evolved from Sanskrit while borrowing many Persian and Arabic words over the years, and changing the pronunciations (and often even the meanings) of these words to make them easier for Hindustani speakers to pronounce. A large number of Persian words entered the Hindustani lexicon due to the influence of the [[Turco-Mongol]] [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers of north India, who followed a very Persianised culture and also spoke Persian. Many Arabic words entered Hindustani via Persian, which had previously been assimilated into the Persian language due to the influence of Arabs in the area. The dialect of Persian spoken by the Mughal ruling elite was known as '[[Dari language|Dari]]', which is the dialect of Persian spoken in modern-day [[Afghanistan]]. Therefore, Hindustani is the naturally developed common language of north India. This article will deal with the separate categories of Hindustani words and some of the common words found in the Hindustani language.

== Traditional categorization of Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) words in Hindi pedagogy==
Words in Hindustani are analyzed in traditional Hindi pedagogy as falling into the following categories:&lt;ref name="masica_65"&gt;Masica, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Tadbhava]]''' (तद्भव/تَدبھَو ''derived from''): There are words that are derived from Sanskrit or Prakrit, but often with phonetic or morphological transformation.
* '''[[Tatsama]]''' (तत्सम/تَتسَم ''identical''): Words which are spelled exactly the same in written Hindi as they are in standard Sanskrit.
* '''Deshaja''' (देशज/دیشَج ''local''): Words that cannot be traced back to Sanskrit, and are of local origin.
* '''Videshi''' (विदेशी/وِدیشی ''foreign''): Loanwords from non-Indian languages that include Persian, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Arabic, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], or English.

The use of ''tatsama'' words was much less common in [[Apabhramsha]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The most common words in Hindustani are ''tadbhava'' and are derived through [[Prakrit]] and Apabhramsha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Urdu as spoken in Pakistan and some Indian states, and Hindi as spoken in India, other than using a different script, are often very similar. Generally Modern Standard Hindi incorporates vocabulary of [[Persian language|Persian]] and Arabic origin found in Urdu, while Urdu has not been known to incorporate much of the vocabulary of Sanskrit origin found in Hindi.

== Examples of Hindustani Word Derivations ==

=== Origin of ''āp'' (आप آپ), ''tum'' (तुम تم) and ''tū'' (तू تو) ===

In Hindustani, the pronoun ''āp'', which denotes respect or formalism, originates from [[Sanskrit]] ''ātmana'' (आत्मन),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=aap|title= aap|website= rekhta.org|publisher= Rekhta Foundation|access-date= 2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which denotes the higher self or level of consciousness.

The pronoun ''tum'', which denotes informality or intimacy, originates from [[Prakrit]] ''tumma'' (तुम्म), ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] ''yushma'' (युष्म) (the base of the 2nd person plural pronoun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=tum|title= tum|website= rekhta.org|publisher= Rekhta Foundation|access-date= 2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pronoun ''tū'', also originates from [[Prakrit]] ''tuhu'' (तुहुं).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=tu|title= tu|website= rekhta.org|publisher= Rekhta Foundation|access-date= 2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, ''tū'' is used widely in India to denote a wide range of attitudes, dependent on context, from extreme informality, to derision and even extreme reverence. However, usage of ''tū'' in most contexts is considered highly offensive in Urdu, with the exception being ''tu'' used as second-person pronoun for God. This is a trend comparable to the decline of "thou" in English and of "tu" in Brazilian Portuguese.

=== Origin of ''hai'' (है ہے) ===

One of the most common words in Hindustani is ''hai'' ("is"). It originates from the following developments:

* [[Sanskrit]]: ''asti'' ("is") / ''bhavati'' ("being") and from [[Prakrit]] ''hoi''
* [[Prakrit]]: ''ahai''  (here ''a'' and ''i'' are two separate vowels) {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sanskrit ''s'' sometimes becomes ''h'' in Prakrits.

Shortening of ''ahai'' produced ''hai''. In some older works in Hindustani literature, one can find usage of ''ahai''. For example, [[Bharatendu Harishchandra]] wrote: "निज भाषा उन्नति '''अहै''', सब उन्नति को मूल" ("نِج بھاشا اُنّتی '''اہَے'''، سب اُنّتی کو مُول "). In [[Marathi language|Marathi]] the अ remained, and the equivalent of ''hai'' is ''āhe'' (आहे). Similarly, the Sindhi word for "hai" is ''āhe''.

===Derivation of ''jātā'' (जाता جاتا) and ''gayā''  (गया گیا) ===

The word ''jātā'' ("goes") is from Sanskrit root ''yā'' (''yāti'', ''yāta'').  ''ya'' often becomes "ja" in Prakrit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The word ''gayā'' ("went") is from Sanskrit root ''gam'' (''gacchati''), from ''gatah''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 
Here ''t'' transforms to ''y'' in Prakrit.

===''Ājā'' (आजा آجا) and ''dādā'' (दादा دادا) ===

The word '''ājā''' has also been used in [[Northern India]] and Pakistan for "grandfather". 
It is indeed derived from ''arya'' meaning "sir" in this case. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 
Jains nuns are addressed either as ''Aryika'' or ''Ajji''.

The word '''dādā''' also has a similar meaning which varies by region. It is used in some regions for "father", in other regions for "older brother", or even for "grandfather" in other regions. This word is an amalgam of two sources:

* Sanskrit ''tāta''  used to address intimate persons which means either  "sir" or "dear". {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* ''Tau'' meaning "father's older brother"  is also derived from ''tāta''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== ''Baṛā'' (बड़ा بڑا) ===

The word '''"baṛā"''' ("older/bigger") is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''vridhha'' through [[Prakrit]] ''vaḍḍha''.

== Loanwords ==

The vocabulary of Hindustani includes loanwords from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]] and [[Dravidian Languages]].

===Loanwords from Sanskrit===

====Phonetic Alterations====

Many Sanskrit words which were loaned into Prakrits in the pre-modern age underwent phonetic alterations to facilitate ease of pronunciation. In spoken language, these include the merger of श (ś) and ष (ṣ), as well as ऋ (r̥) and रि (ri). Other common alterations were sh (श / ش) becoming s (स / س)، v (व / و) becoming b (ब / ب) and y (य / ی) becoming j (ज / ج). Short vowel sounds were also sometimes introduced to break up consonant clusters. Such words fall under the ''tadbhava'' category.

=== Loanwords from Persian ===
Persian loanwords not artificially added to Hindustani are derived from Classical Persian, which is a historical dialect, and not the same as modern-day Persian.

=== Loanwords from Turkic languages ===
There are a very small number of pure Turkic words in Hindustani, numbering as little as 24 according to some sources.&lt;ref name="dawn.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anwer|first1=Syed Mohammed|title=Language: Urdu and the borrowed words|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/672945/language-urdu-and-the-borrowed-words|work=dawn.com|date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other words attributed to Turkish are words which are common to Hindustani and Turkish, but which have other origins, mostly Arabic or Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado García|first1=María Isabel|last2=Yapici|first2=Mustafa|title=Common Vocabulary in Urdu and Turkish  Language: A Case of Historical Onomasiology|journal=Pakistan Vision|date=2014|volume=15|issue=1|pages=194–225|url=http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/studies/PDF-FILES/Artical-10_v15_no1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both languages also share mutual loans from English.
Most notably, some honorifics and surnames common in the Hindustani belt originate from Turkic languages. This is most probably due to the influence of Mughal rulers, who were ethnically Turkic. Examples of honorifics include 'Ḳhānam' (ख़ानम خانم), 'Bājī' (बाजी باجی), and 'Begam' (बेगम بیگم). Common surnames include 'Ḳhān' (ख़ान خان), 'Chuġtāī' (चुग़ताई چغتائی), 'Pāshā' (पाशा پاشا), and 'Arsalān' (अर्सलान ارسلان).
Some common Turkic words used in everyday Hindustani are 'Qainchī' (क़ैंची قینچی) - ''scissors'', 'Annā' (अन्ना انّا) - ''governess'', 'Tamġā' (तमग़ा تمغہ) - ''medal'', and 'Chaqmaq' (चक़मक़ چقمق) - ''flint''.

=== Loanwords from Arabic ===
Some of the most commonly used loanwords from Arabic include 'Waqt' (वक़्त وقت)-time, 'Qalam' (क़लम قلم)-pen 'Kitāb' (किताब کتاب)-book, 'Qarīb' (क़रीब قریب)-near, 'Sahī' (सही صحیح)-correct, 'Gharīb' (ग़रीब غریب)-poor, 'Amīr' (अमीर امیر)-rich, Duniyā (दुनिया دنیا)-world, 'Hisāb' (हिसाब حساب)-calculation, 'Qudrat' (क़ुदरत قدرت)- nature, 'Nasīb' (नसीब نصیب)-fate, 'Ajīb' (अजीब عجیب)-unusual, 'Qānūn' (क़ानून قانون)-law, 'Khabar' (ख़बर خبر)-news, Akhbār (अख़बार اخبار)-newspaper, 'Qilā' (क़िला قلعہ)-fort, 'Kursī' (कुर्सी کرسی)-chair, 'Sharbat' (शर्बत شربت)-drink/beverage, 'Qamīs' (क़मीस قميص)-shirt, 'Zarūrī (ज़रूरी ضروری)-necessary, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.6:1:1190.platts|title=A قميص qamīṣ, vulg. qamīz, kamīj, s.m.

=== Loanwords from Portuguese ===
A small number of words were borrowed from Portuguese due to interaction with colonists and missionaries. These include the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Hindustani !! Meaning !! Portuguese
|-
| Nāv / नाव / ناو || ''Boat'' || Nau
|-

|-
| Girjā / गिर्जा / گرجا || ''Church'' || Igreja
|-
| Almārī / अलमारी / الماری || ''Cupboard'' || Armário
|-
| Botal / बोतल / بوتل || ''Bottle'' || Botelha
|}

=== Loanwords from English ===

Loanwords were borrowed from English into Hindustani through interaction with the [[British East India Company]] and later British rule. English-language education for the native administrative and richer classes during the period of British rule accelerated the adoption of English vocabulary in Hindustani. Many technical and modern terms were borrowed from English, such as ''doctor'' (डॉक्टर ڈاکٹر), ''taxi'' (टैक्सी ٹیکسی), and ''kilometer'' (किलोमीटर کلومیٹر). The influence of English and assimilation of new loanwords continues to the present day.

====Phonetic Alterations====

Some loanwords borrowed from English undergo a significant phonetic transformation. This can be done either intentionally, in order to nativize words or to make them sound more authentic or less 'English', or it can happen as a natural process. Words often undergo a phonetic change in order to make them easier for native speakers to pronounce. Other words are changed due to corruption, where an alternate pronunciation becomes an accepted norm and overtakes the original as the most used pronunciation. Altered pronunciations may also be the result of a lack of English education, or incomplete knowledge of English phonetics.

==Neolithic architecture==
[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|left|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]]]]
{{main|Neolithic architecture}}

Neolithic architecture is the architecture of the [[Neolithic]] period. Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling us to make faithful reconstructions, they selfom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and Eneolithic rites and art.

In Southwest Asia, Neolithic [[Archaeological culture|cultures]] appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the [[Kőrös culture|Starčevo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vinča]]). With the exception of the [[Andean civilizations|Andes]], the [[Isthmo-Columbian area]] and [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|Western Mesoamerica]] (and a few copper [[hatchet]]s and [[spear]] heads in the [[Old Copper Complex|Great Lakes region]]), the people of the [[Americas]] and the Pacific remained at the Neolithic level of [[technology]] up until the time of Western contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Copper Complex: North America's First Miners &amp; Metal Artisans|url=http://copperculture.homestead.com/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jeeun|title=The History of Metallurgy and Mining in the Andean Region|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/1011/pope/sje2.html|website=World History at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=Pre-Incan Metallurgy Discovered|url=http://www.livescience.com/1442-pre-incan-metallurgy-discovered.html|website=Live Science|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado|first1=Blanco D.|title=Tarascan Copper Metallurgy at the Site of Itziparátzico, Michoacán, México|journal=Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies|date=2003|url=http://www.famsi.org/reports/02063/02063Maldonado01.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neolithic people in the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Central Asia]] were great builders, utilizing [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[Çatalhöyük]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The Mediterranean neolithic cultures of [[Malta]] worshiped in [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]].

In Europe, [[Neolithic long house|long houses]] built from [[wattle and daub]] were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousands still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s flint mines and [[cursus]] monuments.

Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] is most noted for its construction of mud brick buildings and the construction of [[Ziggurats]], religious temples made for worship of the gods and goddesses of Mesopotamia. The word Ziggurat is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ziqqurratum, the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb zaqaru, ‘to be high'. The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven. The ziggurat at Ur, excavated by [[Leonard Woolley]], is 64 by 46 meters at base and originally some 12 meters in height with three stories. It was built under [[Ur-Nammu]] (c.2100 B.C.) and rebuilt under [[Nabonidus]] (555-539 B.C.) when it was increased in height to probably seven stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg22/home.html|website=Mesopotamia.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian architecture===
[[File:Egypt.MedinetHabu.02.jpg|thumb|right|Ceiling decoration in the peristyle hall of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], an example of ancient Egyptian architecture]]
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}

In [[Ancient Egypt]] and other early societies, people believed in the [[omnipotence]] of gods, with many aspects of daily life carried out with respect to the idea of the divine or [[supernatural]] and the way it was manifest in the mortal cycles of generations, years, seasons, days and nights. [[Harvest]]s for example were seen as the benevolence of [[fertility]] deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the city and her most important buildings (the [[palace]] or [[temple]]) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by [[rituals]] intended to enter human activity into continued divine [[benediction]].

Ancient architecture is characterized by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of [[nature]] outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the gods. The architect, be he [[priest]] or [[monarch|king]], was not the sole important figure; he was merely part of a continuing tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Greek architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Ancient Greece}}
[[File:Concordiatempelagrigent2 retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Valle dei Templi#Temple of Concordia|Temple of Concordia]] in [[Valle dei Templi|Agrigento]], Sicily.]]
The architecture and urbanism of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] was very different from that of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. Civic life gained importance for all members of the community. In the time of the ancients religious matters were only handled by the ruling class; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or ''[[polis]]''.

Greek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the ''[[agora]]'' which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The ''agora'' embodied the newfound respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the ''[[acropolis]]'' for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens.

Greek architecture was typically post-and-beam (called "trabeated") and made of stone. Most surviving buildings are temples, based on strict rules of proportion. These temples typically included a [[peristyle]] (outer area with (typically [[Doric order|doric]]) columns), and three-sections in the middle, being 1. the [[Pronaos|pronaus]] (entrance), 2. the main [[cella]] or naos chamber (where a statue of the god or goddess and an altar was built), and 3. the [[opisthodomos]] behind the [[cella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Read Buildings|last=Cragoe|first=Carol Davidson|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8478-3112-8|location=New York, NY|pages= 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman architecture===
{{Main|Roman architecture}}

The Romans conquered the Greek cities in Italy around three hundred years BCE and much of the Western world after that. The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity &amp;mdash; from [[Spain|Spanish]] to [[Greece|Greek]], [[Macedon]]ian to [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] &amp;mdash; Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ''ecumene'' presented a new challenge for justice.

One way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically we find this happening in the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by [[Julius Caesar]], where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space.

As the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman [[engineering]] and construction or the newly found [[marble]] quarries which were the spoils of war; inventions like the [[arch]] and [[concrete]] gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut [[dome]]s and [[colonnade]]s, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity &amp;mdash; the [[colosseum]], the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.

The Romans widely employed, and further developed, the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[dome]] (see the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]]), all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.''(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231)&lt;/ref&gt; Their innovative use of [[Roman concrete]] facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the [[Roman empire|empire]].

Art historians such as Gottfried Richter in the 1920s identified the Roman architectural innovation as being the [[Triumphal Arch]] and it is poignant to see how this symbol of power on earth was transformed and utilized within the Christian basilicas when the Roman Empire of the West was on its last legs: The arch was set before the altar to symbolize the triumph of Christ and the after life. It is in their impressive [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the [[Pont du Gard]], the aqueduct at [[Segovia]] and the remains of the [[Aqueducts of Rome]] itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.

===Byzantine architecture===
{{main|Byzantine architecture}}
&lt;!--possible: [[File:Monastery of Hosios Loukas winter.jpg|thumb]]--&gt;

The [[Byzantine Empire]] gradually emerged as a distinct artistic and cultural entity from the Roman Empire after AD 330, when the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] moved the capital of the Roman Empire east from Rome to [[Byzantium]] (later renamed [[Constantinople]] and now called [[Istanbul]]). The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-era]] architecture in Europe and, following the capture of Constantinople by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, leading directly to the [[Ottoman architecture|architecture of the Ottoman Empire]].

Early Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of [[Roman architecture]]. [[Architectural style|Stylistic drift]], [[pendentive|technological advancement]], and [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|political]] and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric [[Cruciform|complexity]], brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, [[classical orders]] were used more freely, [[mosaic]]s replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and windows filtered light through thin sheets of [[alabaster]] to softly illuminate interiors. (see [[Hagia Sophia]])

===Persian architecture===

[[File:Persepolis recreated.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ruins of [[Persepolis]], approximately 2500 years old.]]
The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3-4 thousand years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.
Iran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]ns, and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.

The [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.
The roundness of the city of [[Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid]] era for example, points to its Persian precedents such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].&lt;ref&gt;Islam Art and Architecture. Markus Hattstein, Peter Delius. 2000. p96. {{ISBN|3-8290-2558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two designers who were hired by [[al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a former Jew from Khorasan.
The ruins of [[Persepolis]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Jiroft Civilization|Jiroft]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/jan/1290.html Discovery of brick tablet in Jiroft proves 3rd millennium BC civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sialk]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Firouzabad]], [[Arg-é Bam]], and thousands of other ruins may give us merely a distant glimpse of what contribution Persians made to the art of building.

The fall of the Sassanid Empire to invading Islamic forces ironically led to the creation of remarkable religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as [[calligraphy]], stucco work, mirror work, and mosaic work, became closely tied with architecture in [[Iran]] in the new era. Archaeological excavations have provided sufficient documents in support of the impacts of Sasanian architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world.
Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th Centuries to be the most brilliant of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges, and different palaces have mainly survived from this period.

In the old Persian architecture, semi-circular and oval-shaped vaults were of great interest, leading Safavi architects to display their extraordinary skills in making massive domes. In the words of D. Huff, a German archaeologist, the dome is the dominant element in Persian architecture. Domes can be seen frequently in the structure of [[bazaar]]s and mosques, particularly during the Safavi period in Isfahan. Iranian domes are distinguished for their height, proportion of elements, beauty of form, and roundness of the dome stem. The outer surfaces of the domes are mostly mosaic faced, and create a magical view. [[Safavid dynasty|Safavi]] [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] is the 6th [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] worldwide) knowledge about building tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was decreased in comparison with those of the 14th and 15th centuries.

The great mosques of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Tabriz]] each used local geometry, local materials, and local building methods to express in their own ways the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. And thus when the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament, and great depths of symbolic meaning.

&lt;!--[[File: Selimiye Mosque, Dome.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]].]]--&gt;

Due to the extent of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquests]], Islamic architecture encompasses a wide range of architectural styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day.  Both the religious and secular designs have influenced the design and construction of buildings and structures within and outside the sphere of Islamic culture.  Islamic architecture is typically based on the idea of relating to the secular or the religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/126412|title=The Islamic city: a colloquium [held at All Souls College, June 28-July 2, 1965] published under the auspices of the Near Eastern History Group, Oxford, and the Near East Centre, University of Pennsylvania;|date=1970|publisher=Cassirer|others=Hourani, Albert, 1915-1993,, Stern, S. M. (Samuel Miklos), 1920-1969., Near Eastern History Group, Oxford.|isbn=0571090850|location=Oxford,|oclc=126412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some distinctive structures in Islamic architecture are [[mosque]]s, [[tomb]]s, [[palace]]s, [[Turkish bath|baths]], and [[fort]]s, although Islamic architects have of course also applied their distinctive design precepts to domestic architecture.

The wide and long history of Islam has given rise to many local architectural styles, including [[Abbasid architecture|Abbasid]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], [[Architecture of Central Asia|Timurid]], [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]], [[Fatimid architecture|Fatimid]], [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]], [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]], [[Chinese mosques|Sino-Islamic]] and [[African architecture|Afro-Islamic]] architecture. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early [[Abbasid architecture|Abbasid]] buildings, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia.  Islam does not encourage the worship of idols; therefore the architecture tends to be decorated with Arabic calligraphy from the Quran rather than illustrations of scenes from it.

[[File:Lalibela Bet Giyorgis 19 (27886830573).jpg|thumb|Large, monolithic churches such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela]], were hewn out of the ground in Ethiopia.]]
Ethiopian architecture (including modern-day Eritrea) expanded from the Aksumite style and incorporated new traditions with the expansion of the Ethiopian state. Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in commoner's architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influences were manifested in the construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as [[Adadi Maryam]] (15th century), about 100&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Addis Abeba]]. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|Lalibela]] (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and ''Ethiopisant'' [[David Phillipson]] postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.&lt;ref&gt;David Keys: [http://www.archaeology.org/0411/newsbriefs/ethiopia.html Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in [[Abyssinian–Adal war|its fight against Adal]], and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see [[Habesh]]), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous [[amba (geology)|amba]]s or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of [[Sarsa Dengel]] around the [[Lake Tana]] region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), [[Gondar]]. Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were [[Beta Israel]]. With the reign of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.

[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture.]]
[[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles.

In the Western [[Sahel]] region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]], with one centered on [[Friday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore|Sankore Mosque]] in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenné]]. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with hipped roofs of [[Roof shingle|shingles]] or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]].

Indian architecture encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from [[Hindu temple architecture]] to [[Islamic architecture]] to western [[classical architecture]] to [[modern architecture|modern]] and [[post-modern architecture]].

India's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to [[Mohenjodaro]] and [[Harappa]], now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and [[civil engineering]] continued to develop, manifesting in [[temple]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as ''sthapatya-kala'', literally "the art of constructing".

[[File:Fatehpur1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall of Private Audience at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, an early example of the [[Mughal architecture|architecture of the Mughal Empire]].]]
The temples of [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] are the earliest known examples of [[Hindu temples]]. There are numerous Hindu as well as Buddhist temples that are known as excellent examples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. According to J.J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson,&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html ''Overview of Indian Mathematics''], School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Sulbasutras]]'' were appendices to the [[Vedas]] giving ''rules for constructing altars''. "They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes."

During the [[Kushan Empire]] and [[Mauryan Empire]], Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], Afghanistan. Over a period of time, the ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to [[Central Asia]].
It includes the architecture of various dynasties, such as [[Hoysala architecture]], [[Vijayanagara architecture]] and [[Western Chalukya architecture]].

The rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan Sultanates]] and [[Mughal Empire]] led to the development of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], a style that combined Islamic influences with traditional Indian styles. 

During the [[British Raj]], a new style of architecture known as the [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic revival style]] developed, which incorporated varying degrees of Indian elements into the British style. The [[Churches and convents of Goa]] which is cast in the Indian [[Baroque]] Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.

[[File:Main building of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|left|Angkor Wat temple, the highest achievement of Khmer architecture.]] 
The main evidence of [[Khmer architecture]] and ultimately for Khmer civilization, however, remains the religious buildings, considerable in number and extremely varied in size. They were destined for immortal gods and as they were built of durable materials of brick, [[laterite]] and [[sandstone]], many have survived to the present day. They were usually surrounded by enclosures to protect them from evil powers but confusion has often arisen as to which is a temple enclosure and which is that of the town of which the temple was a part.

[[Angkor Wat]] temple is a great example of Khmer architectural masterpiece, was built by king [[Suryavarman II]] in 12th century. Despite the fact that it is over 800 years old, it has still maintained its top rank to be the world's largest religious structure.

{{main|Architecture of Indonesia}}
The architecture of Indonesia reflects both the [[culture of Indonesia|cultural]] diversity of the region and its rich [[History of Indonesia|historical]] inheritance. The [[Geography of Indonesia|geographic]] position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and animistic architecture of [[Oceanic art and architecture|Oceania]]. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architectural tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. Gradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century [[Indies Style]] and modern [[New Indies Style]]. The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.

===Chinese architecture===
{{Main|Chinese architecture}}
Chinese architecture refers to a style of architecture that has taken shape in East Asia over many centuries.especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang Dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.

From the [[Neolithic]] era [[Longshan Culture]] and [[Bronze Age]] era [[Erlitou culture]], the earliest [[rammed earth]] fortifications exist, with evidence of [[timber framing|timber architecture]]. The subterranean ruins of the palace at [[Yinxu]] dates back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC&amp;ndash;1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and was eventually influenced by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] building for housing religious [[sutra]]s — the [[stupa]] — which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]] is the [[Songyue Pagoda]], a 40&amp;nbsp;m (131&amp;nbsp;ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in [[Henan]] province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone [[spandrel|open-spandrel]] segmental [[arch bridge]].

[[File:Gugong.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the [[Forbidden City]]- an example of [[Chinese architecture]] from the 15th century.]]
The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] who were drafted into the government by the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]]. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065&amp;ndash;1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.

There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.

Many current Chinese architectural designs follow [[post-modern]] and [[Western world|western]] styles.

=== Korean architecture ===
{{main|Korean architecture}}

The basic construction form is more or less similar to Eastern Asian building system.  From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the {{not a typo|k'an}} unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."

The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCE–668 CE)—in palaces in Pyongyang, for instance—a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Koryo dynasty (918–1392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.
In the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions.

[[File:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Himeji Castle]] from Nishi-no-maru]]

Japanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture.  it also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.

Two new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the [[castle]], a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the ''shoin'', a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.

Because of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern [[skyscraper]] design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New [[city planning]] ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (oku), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction. [[Modernism]] became increasingly popular in architecture in Japan starting in the 1950s.

===Mesoamerican architecture===
{{main|Mesoamerican architecture}}
Mesoamerican architecture is the set of architectural traditions produced by pre-Columbian cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], (such as the Olmec, [[Maya architecture|Maya]], and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec]]) traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures outside of [[Ancient Egypt]].

===Incan architecture===
{{main|Incan architecture}}
[[File:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|150px|left|View of [[Machu Picchu]]]]
Incan architecture consists of the major construction achievements developed by the [[Incas]]. The Incas developed an extensive [[Inca road system|road system]] spanning most of the western length of the continent. [[Inca rope bridge]]s could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (It would have been impractical for the terrain) or horses, they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-[[llama]] traffic. Much of present-day architecture at the former Inca capital [[Cuzco]] shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city [[Machu Picchu]] is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.

The [[Mississippian culture]] was among the [[Mound builder (people)|mound-building peoples]], noted for construction of large earthen [[platform mound]]s.

Impermanent buildings, which were often architecturally unique from region to region, continue to influence American architecture today. In his summary, "The World of Textiles", North Carolina State's Tushar Ghosh provides one example: the Denver International Airport's roof is a fabric structure that was influenced by and/or resembles the tipis of local cultures. In writing about [https://archive.is/20071014131553/http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/NAS/ Evergreen State College], Lloyd Vaughn lists an example of very different native architecture that also influenced contemporary building: the Native American Studies program is housed in a modern-day longhouse derived from pre-Columbian Pacific Northwest architecture.

===Medieval architecture===
{{Main|Medieval architecture}}
{{see also|Architecture of Kievan Rus'|Norse architecture}}
Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense. [[Castle]]s and [[fortified wall]]s provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes: they provided a perfect fit for a [[crossbow]]man to safely shoot at invaders from inside. [[Crenellation]] walls ([[battlement]]s) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting.

====Pre-Romanesque====
{{Main|Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
{{see also|First Romanesque}}

Western European architecture in the [[Early Middle Ages]] may be divided into [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], including [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]], [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]], and [[Asturian art and architecture|Asturian]]. While these terms are problematic, they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era. Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s "historicising" and "modernising" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.

====Romanesque====
{{Main|Romanesque architecture}}
[[File:Karlstejn.jpg|thumb|[[Karlštejn]] is a large Gothic castle founded 1348 by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]
Romanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since [[Roman architecture|Roman Imperial architecture]] and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the art it describes, but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, and cruciform piers supporting vaults.

====Gothic====
{{Main|Gothic architecture}}
The various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th- and 12th-century building projects, particularly in the [[Île de France]] area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|12th-century abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].  Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external [[flying buttress]]es, pointed [[arch]]es using the [[ogive]] shape, ribbed stone vaults, clustered columns, pinnacles and sharply pointed spires. Windows contain beautiful [[stained glass]], showing stories from the [[Bible]] and from lives of [[saint]]s. Such advances in design allowed cathedrals to rise taller than ever, and it became something of an inter-regional contest to build a church as high as possible.

===Renaissance architecture===
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].]]
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}

The [[Renaissance]] often refers to the [[Italian Renaissance]] that began in the 14th century, but recent research has revealed the existence of similar movements around Europe before the 15th century; consequently, the term "[[Early Modern]]" has gained popularity in describing this cultural movement. This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical Antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts.

The development from [[Medieval]] architecture concerned the way [[geometry]] mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in Renaissance painting, and helped shape new [[humanism|humanist]] thought.

Perspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of Perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to ''describing'' experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality.
&lt;!--should this be kept?:
[[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Cortile del Belvedere]] project is one such instance where spaces were pictured/designed together before being built. Such a space was only possible due to the powers of abstraction, offered by perspective, that allowed the composition of heterogeneous activities into a metaphor for the legitimacy of current rule. The commission was set by [[Pope Julius II]] to connect an ancient pontifical palace on the right of St Peter's with the palace, built by Pollaiolo for Innocent VIII. In doing so Bramante organised the ascent through three courts that sees the lower, theatrical level move into the upper level through increasingly planned gardens thereby creating a tension between the human realm and an idealised vision of the "ideal city", Jerusalem, this is explicitly shown in Bramante's depiction of the ascent from the perspective of Pope Julius's bedroom window.--&gt;

The Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]], and the style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–47). (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]). The [[Château de Chambord]] is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio, who was engaged after 1540 in work at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].

Architects such as [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Giacomo Vignola]], and [[Pierre Lescot]], were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carree of the [[Louvre]] in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by [[Jean Goujon]]. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henry II and Henry III.

In England the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of [[Palladio]] was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.

===Baroque architecture===
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}

The periods of [[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]] that followed the Renaissance signaled an increasing anxiety over meaning and representation. Important developments in science and philosophy had separated mathematical representations of reality from the rest of culture, fundamentally changing the way humans related to their world through architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It would reach its most extreme and embellished development under the decorative tastes of [[Rococo]].

===Return to Classicism===
{{main|Palladian architecture|Neoclassical architecture}}

In the late 17th and 18th centuries, the works and theories of [[Andrea Palladio]] (from 16th-century Venice) would again be interpreted and adopted in England, spread by the English translation of his [[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]], and pattern books such as ''Vitruvius Brittanicus'' by [[Colen Campbell]]. This [[Palladian architecture]] and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture.

By the mid-18th century, there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque, informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the [[Grand Tour]], coupled with the excavations of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].

[[Federal architecture|Federal-style architecture]] is the name for the classicizing architecture built in [[North America]] between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815.  This style shares its name with its era, the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]]. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Regency style]] in Britain and to the French [[Empire style]].

Beaux-Arts architecture&lt;ref&gt;The phrase ''Beaux Arts'' is usually translated as "[[Fine Arts]]" in non-architectural English contexts.&lt;/ref&gt; denotes the academic classical [[architectural style]] that was taught at the [[École des Beaux Arts]] in Paris. The ''style "Beaux-Arts"'' is above all the cumulative product of two and a half centuries of instruction under the authority, first of the Académie royale d'architecture, then, following the Revolution, of the Architecture section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The organization under the Ancien Régime of the competition for the [[Grand Prix de Rome]] in architecture, offering a chance to study in Rome, imprinted its codes and esthetic on the course of instruction, which culminated during the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1850–1870) and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without a major renovation until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Middleton, Editor.

Around 1900 a number of architects around the world began developing new architectural solutions to integrate traditional precedents with new social demands and technological possibilities. The work of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] in Brussels, [[Antoni Gaudí]] in Barcelona, [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new.

===Early Modern architecture===
{{Further|Modern architecture}}
&lt;!--[[File:Falling Water 01.jpg|thumb]]--&gt;

Early Modern architecture began with a number of building styles with similar characteristics, primarily the simplification of form and the elimination of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], that first arose around 1900. By the 1940s these styles had largely consolidated and been identified as the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]].

The exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate. An important trigger appears to have been the [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] credited to [[Louis Sullivan]]: "[[form follows function]]". '''Functionalism''', in architecture, is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

===Expressionist architecture===
[[File:Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|[[Goetheanum]] by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1923]]
{{Main|Expressionist architecture}}

Expressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts.

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate.

===Art Deco===
{{main|Art Deco}}
[[File:Chrysler Building spire, Manhattan, by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04444).jpg|thumb|right|140px|The [[Art Deco]] [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]] (1930)]]
The [[Art Deco]] style in architecture emerged in Paris just before [[World War I]] with the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] by [[Auguste Perret]] (1911-1913) and the Majorelle Building by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1913). Its revolutionary use of reinforced concrete, geometric forms, straight lines, and decorative sculpture applied to the outside of the building in plaques of marble, ceramics and stucco, and later in stainless steel, were a departure from [[Art Nouveau]].  The style reached its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, and took its name from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] in Paris in 1925.  Art Deco became especially popular in the United States in the late 1920s, where the style was used for [[skyscrapers]] including the [[Chrysler Building]] (1930) and [[Empire State Building]] (1931), and for lavish motion picture palaces including [[Radio City Music Hall]] (1932) in [[New York City]] and the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in [[Oakland, California]].  In the 1930s a stripped-down variation called [[Streamline Moderne]] emerged, which was inspired by the curving aerodynamic forms of ocean liners, airplanes and trains.  Art Deco was used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations and movie theaters around the world in the 1930s, but declined rapidly at the end of the decade due to the [[Great Depression]] and intense criticism of the style by modernist architects such as [[Le Corbusier]], who denounced what he felt was its excessive ornament. By 1939, the style was largely out of fashion and was replaced by the more austere [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=175-206}}

===International Style===
[[File:Glaspaleis front-east.jpg|thumb|The [[Glaspaleis|Glass Palace]], a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, The Netherlands (1935)]]
{{Main| International style (architecture)}}

The International style was a major [[architectural style|architectural trend]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before World War II. The term had its origin from the name of a book by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]] which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the International Style thus constitute part of [[modernism]].

The ideas of Modernism were developed especially in what was taught at the German [[Bauhaus]] School in [[Weimar]] (from 1919), [[Dessau]] (between 1926–32) and finally [[Berlin]] between 1932–33, under the leadership first of its founder [[Walter Gropius]], then [[Hannes Meyer]], and finally [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Modernist theory in architecture resided in the attempt to bypass the question of what [[Architectural style|style]] a building should be built in, a concern that had overshadowed 19th-century architecture, and the wish to reduce form to its most minimal expression of structure and function. In the United States, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] treated this new phenomenon in 1931 as if it represented a new style - the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]], thereby misrepresenting its primary mission as merely a matter of eliminating traditional [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]. The core effort to pursue Modern architecture as an abstract, scientific programme was more faithfully carried forward in [[Europe]], but issues of style always overshadowed its stricter and more puritan goals, not least in the work of [[Le Corbusier]].

It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.&lt;ref name=GEMbook /&gt;

Critical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in [[Modern architecture]] by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]] and later more famously by [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Frampton put forth his views in "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance." He evokes [[Paul Ricœur]]'s question of "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] to supplement his arguments.

===Postmodern architecture===

Postmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. [[Postmodernity]] in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of "wit, ornament and reference" to architecture in response to the formalism of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] and formalized shapes and spaces of the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse [[aesthetics]]: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.

Classic examples of [[modern architecture]] are the [[Lever House]] and the [[Seagram Building]] in commercial space, and the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or the [[Bauhaus]] movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the [[Portland Building]] in [[Portland, OR|Portland]] and the [[Sony Building (New York City)]] (originally AT&amp;T Building) in New York City, which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which was studied by [[Robert Venturi]] in his 1972 book ''Learning from Las Vegas'' celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that "Less is a bore", inverting [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s dictum that "Less is more".

Following the postmodern movement, a renaissance of pre-modernist urban and architectural ideals established itself, with [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] being prominent movements.

===Deconstructivist architecture===

{{Main|Deconstructivism}}

Deconstructivism in architecture is a development of [[postmodern architecture]] that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent [[non-Euclidean geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Origins of Geometry'', Introduction by Jacques Derrida&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., non-[[rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]], such as structure and [[building envelope|envelope]]. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist "styles" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos.

Important events in the history of the deconstructivist movement include the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]] (especially the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s winning entry), the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]], and the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

On January 21, 2013 architects began preparations for constructing the world's first [[3D printing|3D-printed]] building. An industrial-scale 3D printer used high strength artificial marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21121061|title=Architect plans 3D-printed buildings|publisher=BBC|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies around the world have 3D-printed numerous buildings, many only taking a few hours to be completed. 3D-printed buildings have been shown to be practical, cost effective, and environmentally friendly. The technology is being expanded to other frameworks.

[[Sustainable architecture]] is an important topic in contemporary architecture, including the trends of [[New Urbanism]], [[New Classical architecture]] and [[Eco-cities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18192">{{Inca civilization}}'''Incan architecture''' is the most significant [[pre-Columbian]] [[architecture]] in [[South America]]. The Incas inherited an architectural legacy from [[Tiwanaku]], founded in the 2nd century B.C.E. in present-day [[Bolivia]].  A core characteristic of the architectural style was to use the topography and existing materials of the land as part of the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Carolyn|date=2007|title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place|url=|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=LXXXIX|pages=502–517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of the Inca empire, [[Cusco|Cuzco]], still contains many fine examples of Inca architecture, although many walls of Inca masonry have been incorporated into [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] structures. The famous royal estate of [[Machu Picchu]] (Machu Pikchu) is a surviving example of Inca architecture.  Other significant sites include [[Sacsayhuamán]] and [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Incas also developed an extensive road system spanning most of the western length of the continent and placed their distinctive architecture along the way, thereby visually asserting their imperial rule along the frontier.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dean |first1=Carolyn |title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place |journal=The Art Bulletin |date=2007 |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=502–518 |doi=10.1080/00043079.2007.10786358 |jstor=25067338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Inca buildings were made out of [[fieldstone]]s or semi-worked stone blocks and dirt set in [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; [[adobe]] walls were also quite common, usually laid over stone foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The material used in the Inca buildings depended on the region, for instance, in the coast they used large rectangular adobe blocks while in the Andes they used local stones.&lt;ref&gt;Vergara, Teresa, “Arte y Cultura del Tahuantinsuyo”, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common shape in Inca architecture was the rectangular building without any internal walls and roofed with wooden beams and [[thatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several variations of this basic design, including [[gabled roof]]s, rooms with one or two of the long sides opened and rooms that shared a long wall.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''inca settlement'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Rectangular buildings were used for quite different functions in almost all Inca buildings, from humble houses to palaces and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, there are some examples of curved walls on Inca buildings, mostly in regions outside the central area of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-story buildings were infrequent; when they were built the second floor was accessed from the outside via a stairway or high terrain rather than from the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wall apertures, including doors, niches and windows, usually had a [[trapezoidal]] shape; they could be fitted with double or triple [[jamb]]s as a form of ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of decoration were scarce; some walls were painted or adorned with metal plaques, in rare cases walls were sculpted with small animals or geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CuscoPiedra12angulo.jpg|thumb|[[Twelve-angled stone]] in the Hatun Rumiyoc street of Cusco, is an example of Inca masonry]]
The most common composite form in Inca architecture was the ''kancha'', a rectangular enclosure housing three or more rectangular buildings placed symmetrically around a central courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kancha'' units served widely different purposes as they formed the basis of simple dwellings as well as of temples and palaces; furthermore, several ''kancha''  could be grouped together to form blocks in Inca settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; A testimony of the importance of these compounds in Inca architecture is that the central part of the Inca capital of [[Cusco]] consisted of large ''kancha'', including [[Qurikancha]] and the Inca palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 181, 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved examples of ''kancha'' are found at [[Ollantaytambo]], an Inca settlement located along the [[Urubamba River]].&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inca architecture is widely known for its fine masonry, which features precisely cut and shaped stones closely fitted without mortar ("[[dry stone|dry]]").&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this fame, most Inca buildings were actually made out of fieldstone and adobe as described above.&lt;ref&gt;Protzen, ''Inca architecture'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, American archaeologist [[John H. Rowe]] classified Inca fine masonry in two types: coursed, which features rectangular shaped stones, and polygonal, which features blocks of irregular shape.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, ''An introduction'', pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, Peruvian architect Santiago Agurto established four subtypes by dividing the categories identified by Rowe:&lt;ref&gt;Agurto, ''Estudios acerca'', pp. 144–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cellular polygonal masonry: with small blocks
* [[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry: with very large stones
* Encased coursed masonry: in which stone blocks are not aligned
* Sedimentary coursed masonry: in which stones are laid out in horizontal rows (i.e., [[ashlar]]s)
The first two types were used on important buildings or perimeter walls while the last two were employed mostly on terrace walls and river canalization.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry at [[Sacsayhuamán]]]]
According to [[Graziano Gasparini]] and Luise Margolies, Inca stonemasonry was inspired by the architecture of [[Tiwanaku]], an archaeological site in modern Bolivia built several centuries before the Inca Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that according to [[ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] accounts the Incas were impressed by these monuments and employed large numbers of stoneworkers from nearby regions in the construction of their own buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these references, they also identified some formal similarities between Tiwanaku and Inca architecture including the use of cut and polished stone blocks, as well as of double jambs.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with this hypothesis is the question of how was expertise preserved in the three hundred years between the collapse of Tiwanaku and the appearance of the Inca Empire and its architecture. As a solution, John Hyslop has argued that the Tiahuanaco stonemasonry tradition was preserved in the [[Lake Titicaca]] region in sites such as [[Tanka Tanka]], which features walls resembling Inca polygonal masonry.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major influence on Inca architecture came from the [[Wari culture|Wari]] culture, a civilization contemporary to Tiwanaku. According to Ann Kendall, the Huari introduced their tradition of building rectangular enclosures in the Cusco region, which formed a model for the development of the Inca ''kancha''.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, ''Aspects of Inca architecture'', p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that such traditions were preserved in the Cusco region after the decline of the Wari as is attested by the enclosures found at sites such as [[Choquequirao]] (Chuqi K'iraw), 28 kilometers southeast of the Inca capital.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water engineer Ken Wright estimates that 60 percent of the Inca construction effort was underground. The Inca built their cities with locally available materials, usually including [[limestone]] or granite. To cut these hard rocks the Inca used stone, bronze or copper tools, usually splitting the stones along the natural fracture lines. Without the wheel the stones were rolled up with wood beams on earth ramps. Extraordinary manpower would have been necessary. Hyslop comments that the 'secret' to the production of fine Inca masonry “…was the social organization necessary to maintain the great numbers of people creating such energy-consuming monuments.” It is speculated that the stones were swung into place using friction to create perfectly convex and concave sides. Visible marks of facture like stone bosses were made using rope; these elements demonstrated the artistic value of labor and the power of Inca rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=2881b5f8-8bb4-4c01-b8ac-f417feea55a3@sessionmgr4008&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=26518585&amp;db=aph|title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place.|last=Dean|first=Carolyn|date=|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the walls of Incan buildings were slightly inclined inside and the corners were rounded. This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a peerless [[seismic resistance]] thanks to high static and dynamic steadiness, absence of [[resonance|resonant]] [[frequency|frequencies]] and [[stress concentration]] points. During an [[earthquake]] with a small or moderate magnitude, masonry was stable, and during a strong earthquake stone blocks were “ dancing ” near their normal positions and lay down exactly in right order after an earthquake.

Another building method was called "pillow-faced" architecture. Pillow faced building was achieved by using fired adobe bricks. The Incas would then sand large, finely shaped stones, and then they would fit the bricks and stones together in jigsaw like patterns. Pillow-faced architecture was typically used for temples and royal places like Machu Picchu.

[[Ashlar]] masonry was used in the most sacred, elite Inca structure; for example, the Acllawasi ("House of the Chosen Woman"), the [[Coricancha]] ("Golden Enclosure") in Cuzco, and the Sun Temple at Machu Picchu. Thus it seems that ashlar may have been more greatly valued by the Inca, perhaps considered more difficult than polygonal ("pillow-faced") masonry. Though polygonal masonry may be aesthetically more impressive, the facture of ashlar masonry tends to be unforgiving to mistakes; if a corner is broken in the process it can be reshaped to fit into the mosaic of polygonal masonry whereas you cannot recover a damaged rock in ashlar masonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At Home with the Sapa Inca: Architecture, Space, and Legacy at Chinchero|last=Nair|first=Stella|publisher=University of Texas Print|year=2015|isbn=1477302506|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism and Patronage ==

=== Aesthetics: Combining the Built and Natural Environments ===
Inca architecture is strongly characterized by its use of the natural environment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/chapter-pdf/497021/9780822393177-005.pdf|title=Rock and Rule {{!}} A Culture of StoneInka Perspectives on Rock {{!}} Books Gateway {{!}} Duke University Press|website=read.dukeupress.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inca managed to seamlessly merge their architecture into the surrounding land and its specificities.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=At Home with the Sapa Inca : Architecture, Space, and Legacy at Chinchero|last=Nair|first=Stella|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=9781477302491|location=University of Texas|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak, the [[Inca Empire]] spanned from [[Ecuador]] to [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire|title=Inca Empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}  Yet despite geographic variances, Inca architecture remained consistent in its ability to visually blend the built and natural environment.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In particular, Inca walls practiced mortarless [[masonry]] and used partially worked, irregularly shaped rocks to complement the organic qualities and diversity of the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Callachaca: Style and Status in an Inca Community|last=Niles|first=Susan A.|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=1987|isbn=9781587291685|location=University of Iowa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the dry fitted masonry techniques of caninacukpirca, the Incas shaped their stone to conceal natural outcrops, fit tight crevices, and ultimately incorporate the landscape into their infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The Inca also used natural [[bedrock]] as their structural foundations (to help keep the buildings stable).&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;  This pragmatically stabilized their structures built in the [[Andes]] mountain range of [[South America]], while aesthetically disguising the boundaries between mountain and edifice.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  In combination, the diversity of stone shape, materiality, and facture all furthered the naturalistic illusion of the Inca's built environment.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/chapter-pdf/497015/9780822393177-002.pdf|title=IntroductionComing to Terms with Inka Rocks {{!}} A Culture of StoneInka Perspectives on Rock {{!}} Books Gateway {{!}} Duke University Press|website=read.dukeupress.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics: Expansionist and Subservient Ideologies ===
Inca employment and integration of the natural environment into their architecture played an essential role in their program of civilizational expansion and cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;   Patronage of powerful elites and rulers of the [[Inca Empire|Inca empire]] was a major impetus behind the construction of Inca structures, and much of the remaining architecture we see today was most likely royal estates or mobile capitals for [[Sapa Inca]] to inhabit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The Sapa Inca naturalized and asserted their political rule through their palaces' aesthetic appeal to a reciprocal relationship between their imperialism and the earth itself.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  The blended, architectural aesthetic colored their political expansion in a sense of inseparable, timeless, and spiritual authority.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;For example, in the royal estate of [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]], the Incas adapted their large-scale earthwork and massive stone construction to the land's dramatically steep valley in order to create intense, visual drama.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Similarly to the architecture of other mountainous Inca citadels, such as [[Machu Picchu]], the Chinchero estate's dynamic construction into the severe landscape demonstrated the raw, physical power of the Incas, and projected an authoritative aura for those who approached.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The actual process of constructing the royal palaces served as an additional royal tactic of maintaining rule.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Inca architecture demonstrates a commitment to the culturally pervasive, yet more physically difficult, process of mortarless, [[polygonal masonry]] and conscious accommodation of a land's natural [[topography]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  The upholding of these non-[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] practices of construction can give insight into Inca values concerning the artistic integrity and cultural meaning embedded within the process of building estates,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; and how the building of royal palaces can be understood as a physical enactment of political loyalty and communal subservience to the Sapa Inca.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The '''International Ballet Festival of Havana''' ''(Festival de Ballet de La Habana)'', is a ballet festival held in the [[Great Theater of Havana]], [[Cuba]] and other locations like [[Karl Marx Theatre]] and Mella Theatre every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cubabusinessreport.com/businessdirectory/events/cuba/havana/havana/arts-culture/international-havana-ballet-festival-2018/|title=International Havana Ballet Festival|publisher=Cuba Business Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 1960 by a joint effort of the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]], the ''Instituto Nacional de la Industria Turística'' and the cultural organizations of the government, the International Ballet Festival of Havana was added to the plans of massive diffusion of arts started after the popular [[Cuban Revolution]] on January 1, 1959. The Festival, with its character, has allowed people to enjoy the performances and the works of prestigious figures of the world of the dance and has also shown to the visitors the high level reached by the Cuban ballet. Every two years, the Festival features over 20 performances and a few world premiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/cuba/international-havana-ballet-festival|title=International Havana Ballet Festival|publisher=rove.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the year 2000 it celebrated its 40th anniversary. This defines it as one of the oldest of all held in the world. Created in 1960 it quickly became one of the most transcendental events of the national [[Cuban culture]] and of the international Dance as well .

==Festivals==
===1st through 6th festivals===
The years that followed the first three festivals, 1960, 1966 and 1967, were a long and fruitful work period recorded as one of the most beautiful pages in the history of the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]] since its casting was enriched with the first graduates from the ''Escuela Nacional de Ballet'' (National Ballet School), its consolidation as one of the dance companies of greatest international prestige and the heroic battles fought against the unfair barrier that didn’t allow its worldwide recognition. The 4th Festival was held in 1974 and was dedicated to the 2nd Congress of the ''Federación de Mujeres Cubanas'' and from that year on the festival was celebrated every two years and has emphasized this peculiar aspect that has characterized its work. The 5th Festival was dedicated to the 30th Anniversary of the [[Granma (yacht)|Granma]] landing. The 6th festival was dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Foundation of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba and to the 35th anniversary of [[Alicia Alonso]]’s debut in the role of [[Giselle]]. This festival also made an emphasis on “the premiere of works created for the company by well-known international choreographers, Cuban and foreign”.

A transcendental event was the beginning, parallel to the festival, of the First International Practical Course of the Cuban School of Ballet, that was attended by dancers, advanced students and observers from eleven [[Americas|American]] and [[Europe]]an countries as well as a big Cuban representation that created a tradition that stands up to now.

===9th festival and 10th===
The 9t. Festival put an emphasis on ''The styles and the choreographers'', this made possible to see a panoramic of the principal choreographic landmarks that ballet has known throughout its history. The 10th celebration was a great opportunity for the festival to be a great party of art and friendship with the presence of hundreds of guests among them famous stars and dance companies coming from all over the world who, together with the members of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba and other groups, carried out a varied program.

===15th festival===
The  15th Festival emphasized on ''The composers or musical styles that had the greatest influence in dance''. There were galas dedicated to Cuban and [[France|French]] composers, to baroque composers, to [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Igor Stravinski]] and [[Manuel de Falla]]- to commemorate the 120th anniversary of his birthday and the 50th of his death-, and as well to the [[Russians|Russian]] composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], key figure in the classic ballet.

===16th festival===

==Beyond==
After more than four decades of work, the International Ballet Festival of Havana goes forward keeping its creative potentiality in the promisory future of the 21st century.

Throughout its more than four decades of productive existence, possible thanks to the agglutinative gift of [[Alicia Alonso]] and the unmovable support of the cultural organizations of the Cuban state, the International Ballet Festival of Havana has wished and known how to be a meeting of the best of art  endowed with a typical feature that at the same time that singles it out, contributes to strengthen its well earned prestige.

[[File:Kalamkari Painting.JPG|thumb|''Kalamkari'' textile depicting scenes from Lord Krishna's life displayed at [[National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, New Delhi]]]]

'''''Kalamkari''''' is a type of hand-painted or block-printed [[cotton]] [[textile]], produced in Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telengana]]. Only [[natural dye]]s are used in ''Kalamkari'' and it involves twenty three steps. 

There are two distinctive styles of kalamkari art in India - [[Srikalahasti Kalamkari|Srikalahasti style]] and the [[Pedana Kalamkari|Machilipatnam style]]. The Srikalahasti style of ''Kalamkari''(Kalankari), wherein the "''kalam''" or pen is used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colors, is entirely hand worked. This style flowered around temples and their patronage and so had an almost religious identity - scrolls, temple hangings, [[Temple car|chariot]] banners and the like, depicted deities and scenes taken from the Hindu epics - [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Puranas]] and the mythological classics. This style owes its present status to Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay who popularized the art as the first Chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board. 

==Entomology== 
Historically, Kalamkai use to be known as ''Pattachitra'', an art form still found in neighboring Odisha and other parts of India and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Niranjan (1973), The Patas and Patuas of Bengal. Indian Publications Calcutta, Page number 54-55 (Annexure C,V)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "''Pattachitra''" in ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]:पट्टचित्र) translates to "Patta" meaning "cloth" and "Chitra" means "picture".&lt;ref&gt;SenGupta, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings made on fabric and fabric scrolls finds mentioned in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Jain literature.&lt;ref&gt;Textiles in Indian Ocean Societies - Ruth Barnes, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Hermann Kulke, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under medieval [[Islam|Islamic]] rule, the term Kalamkari [[Persian language|Persian]],{{lang|fa|قلمکار}} which is derived from the words k''alam'' ([[pen]]) and ''kari'' ([[Handicraft|craftmanship]]), meaning drawing with a pen came to be in popular use under the patronage of Golconda sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOS- Indian Culture and Heritage|website=http://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/SecICHCour/English/CH.11.pdf|publisher=NIOS|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Kalamkari painting.jpg|thumb|left|A ''kalamkari'' artist at work.]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Wall Hanging (Kalamkari) - overall.jpg|thumb|''Kalamkari'' wall hanging, early 17th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
In ancient times, groups of singers, musicians and painters, called ''chitrakars'', moved from village to village to tell the village dwellers, the great stories of [[Hindu mythology]]. They illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants. In the same way, one found in the Hindu temples large panels of ''kalamkari'' depicting the episodes of Indian mythology, similar to Buddhist [[Thangka]] paintings.

As an art form it found its peak in the wealthy [[Golkonda|Golconda sultanate]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], in the Middle Ages. The Mughals who patronized this craft in the Coromandel and Golconda province called the practitioners of this craft "''qualamkars''", from which the term "''kalamkari''" evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bhatnagar| first=Parul| title=Kalamkari| url=https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/65619463?access_key=key-1i4e4emilphei76vaxgl| work=Traditional Indian Costumes and Textiles| accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pedana Kalamkari]] craft made at [[Pedana]] nearby [[Machilipatnam]] in [[Krishna district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], evolved with the patronage of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the [[Golkonda|Golconda sultanate]]. Owing to the said patronage, this school was influenced by Persian art under [[Islam|Islamic]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOS- Indian Culture and Heritage|website=http://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/SecICHCour/English/CH.11.pdf|publisher=NIOS|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kalamkari'' art has been practiced by many families in Andhra Pradesh, some villages in Tamilnadu (Sickinaickanpettai) by migrants from Telugu speaking families and over the generations has constituted their livelihood. ''Kalamkari'' had a certain decline, then it was revived in India and abroad for its craftsmanship. Since the 18th century the British have enjoyed the decorative element for clothing.

== Middle forms ==
In middle ages the term is also used to refer, incorrectly, to the making of any cotton fabric patterned through the medium of vegetable dyes by free-hand painting and block-printing, produced in many different regions of India. In places where the fabric is block printed the ''kalam'' (pen) is used to draw finer details and for application of some colours.First it was introduce 
in blue colour.

== In this Century (Digital era) ==
In modern times it's replaced by digital. The art took a turn-over and updated digitally to fit in the glove of time. In this era new types and new techniques are introduced and the ''digital files'' of kalamkari (pen work) is totally introduced widely all over the regions of India and Iran (Persia).'''

== Technique ==
Seeping it in [[astringent]]s and [[bubalus|buffalo]] milk and then drying it under the sun.&lt;ref name=MM1&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/intx/hd_intx.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the red, black, brown, and violet portions of the designs are outlined with a mordant and cloth is then placed in a bath of [[alizarin]].&lt;ref name=MM1 /&gt; The next step is to cover the cloth, except for the parts to be dyed blue, in wax, and immerse the cloth in indigo dye. The wax is then scraped off and remaining areas are painted by hand,&lt;ref name=MM1 /&gt; similar to Indonesian ''[[batik]]''.

To create design contours, artists use a [[bamboo]] or [[date palm]] [[Branch|stick]] pointed at one end with a bundle of fine hair attached to this pointed end to serve as the brush or pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Heritage - Painting - Kalamkari|url=http://www.indian-heritage.org/painting/kalamkri.html|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pen is soaked in a mixture of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] [[jaggery]] and water; one by one these are applied, then the vegetable dyes.

In Iran, the fabric is printed using patterned wooden stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Held, Colbert C. |title=Middle East patterns: places, peoples, and politics |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colo |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-8133-4170-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color fixing ==
Dyes for the cloth are obtained by extracting colors from various roots, leaves, and mineral salts of iron, tin, copper, and [[alum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indian-heritage.org/painting/kalamkri.html indian-heritage.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Various effects are obtained by using [[cow dung]], [[seeds]], plants and crushed flowers to obtain [[natural dye]]. Along with buffalo milk, [[myrobalan]] is used in ''kalamkari''. ''Myrobalan'' is also able to remove the odd smell of buffalo milk. The fixing agents available in the ''myrobolan'' can easily fix the dye or color of the textile while treating the fabric. Alum is used in making natural dyes and also while treating the fabric. Alum ensures the stability of the color in ''kalamkari'' fabric.

==Themes==
''Kalamkari'' specifically depicts epics such as the Ramayana or Mahabharata. However, there are recent applications of the ''kalamkari'' technique to depict Buddha and Buddhist art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Naidu|first=T. Appala|title=Techie's Twist to Kalamkari| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p-varun-kumar-comes-up-with-a-buddha-series-in-kalamkari/article7444368.ece| work=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Katanga Cross''', also called a '''''handa''''', is a cast copper ingot in the shape of a cross which was once used as a form of [[currency]] in parts of what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Katanga crosses were made in various sizes, typically about {{convert|20|cm}} across, and weighing about {{convert|1|kg}}. The name derives from [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], a rich copper mining region in the south-eastern portion of the DRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgs.com/News/The-Unusual-Katanga-Cross|title=The Unusual Katanga Cross|website=www.pcgs.com|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These X-shaped [[ingot]]s were cast by local coppersmiths by pouring molten copper into [[Sand casting|sand mold]]s.

==Original value==
During its period of currency, a Katanga cross would buy about {{convert|10|kg}} of flour, five or six fowls, or six axes. Ten would buy a gun.[Opitz-p.124] 

==Modern uses==
In 1960, Katanga unilaterally seceded from the newly-independent [[Republic of Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]] and declared its own independence as the [[State of Katanga]]. The Katanga state used the cross as a national symbol; three red katanga crosses appeared in the lower hoist of its flag. Coins issued by Katanga in 1961 also depicted the Katanga Cross. The State of Katanga was forcibly reunited with the Congo in 1963.

'''''Klaus''''' is a seven-issue [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] published in [[2015 in comics|2015]] and [[2016 in comics|2016]] by [[Boom! Studios]]. It was created by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Dan Mora]].

The comic is styled as an [[origin story]], based on the re-imagining of [[Santa Claus]] as a [[superhero]].

A one shot, ''Klaus and the Witch of Winter'' was released beginning in December 2016 followed by another one shot ''Klaus and the Crisis in X-Masville'' in December 2017.

==Plot==
=== Part One ===
In [[Medieval Period|medieval]] times, an independent [[trapping|trapper]] named [[Santa Claus|Klaus]] enters the walled town of '''Grimsvig''' to trade furs and hides, and is distressed to find it much changed since the last time he was there.  The town is ruled by the tyrannical Lord Magnus, who has conscripted nearly all of the town's men to labor in the nearby [[coal]] mine, and has instructed his guardsmen to systematically deprive the townspeople of joy, including canceling the annual [[Yuletide]] celebration and confiscating any toys or musical instruments to give to his spoiled young son, Jonas.  Magnus himself rarely leaves his castle, shut in with his unhappy wife, Dagmar, and Jonas.

Declaring that they do not trust strangers, the guardsmen confiscate Klaus's wares.  At first he does not protest, but is outraged when one of the guardsmen strikes a nearby child, and is badly beaten when he tries to stop it.  Marched outside the walls to be executed, he is saved by his pet white [[wolf]], Lilli.  Making camp in the forest, he falls asleep and is visited by the spirits of the forest.  When he wakes up, he is stunned to see he has carved a large bag of wooden toys [[sleepwalking|in his sleep]].

=== Part Two ===
Despite the walls and sealed gates, Klaus slips into Grimsvig at night and distributes the toys among the children of the poorest families, and [[graffiti|defacing]] a portrait of Magnus.  Seeing the children playing in the streets, an outraged Magnus has his guards confiscate the toys, claiming that Jonas is dangerously ill and needs them more than the other children.  When he demands to know who the mysterious intruder is, one child responds, ''"it was the ''[[Julernisse]]''... the Yuletime Spirit."''

Jonas is furious when the confiscated toys fail to give him any joy, and smashes them in a rage.  His mother, Dagmar, notes one's resemblance to a carved bird from her childhood, which she has kept hidden, and realizes who the mysterious man is.

When night falls again, Klaus tries to reach the gates, knocking out several guards (and building one into a [[snowman]] as a joke), before he is cornered by a pack of hunting dogs.

=== Part Three ===
The dogs are driven off by Lilli, allowing Klaus to escape the town.  The guardsmen begin to whisper that the intruder is a [[ghost]] or a [[shape-shifter]], while the children begin writing [[Letters to Santa|wishes on pieces of paper]].  Magnus orders his men to guard the doors of every house, so the children burn these wishes in their fireplaces, hoping they will reach "The Santa" through the [[chimney]]s.

Magnus takes a [[grimoire]] from his library and enters the deepest part of the coal mine, alone, saying he has followed "the voice"'s instructions and soon it will be free.

=== Part Four ===
In [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Klaus's story is told: as an infant, he was discovered in the forest, clutched in the arms of his mother, who had frozen to death, but miraculously alive himself.  He was adopted by Grimsvig's guard commander, Karl, who named him "[[Klaus]]", "Victory of the People."  As a boy, he befriended the lord's daughter, Dagmar, giving her a wooden toy bird to replace her deceased pet.  They grew up together as best friends, while the young Magnus looked on jealously.

Later, while the young Klaus was a captain of the town guard, Magnus poisoned the lord and put the blame on him, driving him outside the walls to die, but he was saved by Lilli, whose life he had spared while she was still a cub.

In the present, Klaus enters Dagmar's window and confronts her, asking her how she could have thought him guilty of poisoning her father, or how she could have chosen Magnus over him.  She has no answer, but he gives her a single toy for Jonas.  At first, Jonas wants to smash it, but she sits down and encourages him to tell a story with it, and soon the two of them are playing happily, before Magnus interrupts them.  He has a plan to trap "the Santa", using Jonas to write a wish letter.

=== Part Five ===
Jonas admits to Dagmar that Magnus frightened him into writing the letter by showing him the grimoire from the library.  Before she can find it for herself, Magnus walks in on her, half-crazed, believing he is [[paranoia|surrounded by enemies]], in spite of everything he has done to make himself powerful and thus make life better for her and Jonas.

Jonas's letter lures Klaus into a trap laid by Magnus's men, and he is barely able to escape the walls, wounded by a [[poisoned arrow]].

=== Part Six ===
A young boy from the town, with Lilli's help, drags Klaus to his cabin in the woods, where he treats his poisoned wound, but Magnus and his guards follow them there, burning down the cabin and leaving Klaus staked to the surface of a frozen lake, expecting him to die of [[hypothermia|exposure]].

In preparation for a visit from the King, Magnus has the children of the town rounded up and herded into a room in the castle, where they are offered sweets to stuff themselves with.  On the same night, a coal miner finally cracks the cell, releasing a [[Krampus|huge demon]].  The demon enters the main hall of the castle, demanding its promised "feast" - the captive children.

Outside Grimsvig, Klaus is visited again by the forest spirits and "changed," imbued with new strength and told to "make [things] better."

=== Part Seven ===
The boy who helped Klaus earlier leads the other captive children out of their cell and through the castle.  In the main hall, Magnus's joy at the demon's arrival turns to horror when it attacks Jonas.  He opens the grimoire to find the spell to command the demon, only for the demon to laugh and tell him that it used him to gain its freedom, and he has no power over it.  Dagmar distracts the demon with an arrow and tells Jonas to run.  Jonas meets the other fleeing children before they are all cornered by the demon.  Before it can devour any of them, Klaus appears on a flying sleigh pulled by eight white wolves, and wielding a [[greatsword]].

Klaus subdues the demon, but is stabbed from behind by Magnus, who demands that the demon fulfill its half of their bargain: giving him the kingship, and the love of his family and the people.  Dagmar, finally admitting to herself that Magnus murdered her father, tells him that all the evil and misery in Grimsvig is his doing alone, and walks away from him with Jonas.  Unhinged, Magnus screams at the demon to give him what he deserves - which it does by breathing fire and incinerating him.

The demon seizes Jonas and converts Klaus's sleigh into a dark chariot pulled by [[hell hound]]s, and flies into the sky, declaring that ''"all bad children belong to me!"''

Klaus arises, telling Dagmar that the forest spirits have made him immortal.  He leaps to a rooftop and jumps onto the chariot, declaring that ''"there are no bad children!"'' As the chariot flies into the upper atmosphere, the demon tries to burn Klaus, but its fiery breath doesn't ignite in the thin air, and with his trademark "Ho Ho Ho", Klaus beheads it.  The demon's body plummets back to earth, and Klaus returns, in his now-restored sleigh, with Jonas.  Dagmar promises the King that, with Klaus as her advisor, she will act as [[regent]] of the town, and undo her husband's wickedness.

The Yuletide festival is held every year from then on, and the town recovers its joy, even Jonas, who abandons his old selfishness and learns to play with other children.

As the years pass, Dagmar ages, but Klaus remains the same.  After her funeral, Jonas, now middle-aged and the new lord of the town, sees Klaus preparing to depart in his sleigh to bring joy to the rest of the world, but promising to return [[Christmas|once every year]], when things are at their darkest.

[[File:Slayers characters.jpg|thumb|Main characters from the TV series. Front row: Amelia, [[Lina Inverse|Lina]], and [[Gourry Gabriev|Gourry]]. Back row: [[Xellos]] and Zelgadis]]

This is a '''list of major characters''' from the Japanese [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[light novel]] series '''''[[Slayers]]'''''. The series of novels written by [[Hajime Kanzaka]] was serialized in ''[[Dragon Magazine (Fujimi Shobo)|Dragon Magazine]]'', adapted into several manga titles, five televised anime series, two three-episode [[original video animation]]s, and five anime films. ''Slayers'' follows the adventures of [[teenage]] sorceress [[Lina Inverse]] and her companions as they journey through their world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/The-Slayers-DVD-Collection/dp/1578004861|title=The Slayers DVD Collection |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explodedgoat.com/animereview.php?num=9 |title=Anime Review |accessdate=May 1, 2007|publisher=Exploded goat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using powerful magic and swordsmanship, they battle difficult overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, dark lords, and the occasional hapless gang of bandits.

==Major characters==

===Lina Inverse===
{{Main|Lina Inverse}}

{{Nihongo|Lina Inverse|リナ・インバース|Rina Inbāsu}} is the main [[protagonist]] and central figure of the ''Slayers'' franchise. Although still a teenager, she is a powerful sorceress with a great love of money, treasure, and food. In the anime and manga, she is known to comically overuse immensely destructive spells.

Her specialty is black magic, a destructive magic that calls upon the power of a demon or monster. Her signature spell, the Dragon Slave, comes from the power of the Demon King Shabranigdo, while the Ragna Blade and her most powerful spell the Giga Slave call upon the Lord of Nightmares. During the series, Lina and the Slayers face down and defeat many powerful demons, including a fragment of Shabranigdo, Hellmaster Phibrizzo, and Darkstar.

Gourry has been Lina's constant companion since the opening of the series, and never leaves her for very long. Lina once risks the destruction of the world by casting the unpredictable Giga Slave in order to save Gourry's life. Although the two appear to be in love with each other, and even share a forgotten kiss at the end of ''Slayers NEXT'', there is no romantic development between them.

:{{Voiced by| [[Megumi Hayashibara]]| [[Lisa Ortiz]] &lt;small&gt;(TV series)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; Cynthia Martinez &lt;small&gt;(OVAs and films)&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Gourry Gabriev===
{{main|Gourry Gabriev}}

{{Nihongo|Gourry Gabriev|ガウリイ・ガブリエフ|Gaurī Gaburiefu}} is a wandering swordsman who meets Lina at the beginning of the series, and accompanies her from then on as a self-appointed bodyguard. A characterization of Gourry from his manga profile is "as loyal as man's best friend, but not quite as smart".

Gourry is somewhat less than scholarly and appears to have memory deficiencies. However, his skills as a swordsman are unmatched throughout the franchise, especially when armed with his family's magic blade, the Sword of Light, also known as Gorun Nova. He has a high magic capacity and the potential to cast spells that rival Lina's power, but because of his faulty memory and disinterest, he cannot remember spells well enough to ever use them. His consideration for others and absolute loyalty to Lina are his most noted traits.

Gourry eventually falls in love with Lina, which he expresses through his promise that he will guard her for the rest of his life. He is not as shy about his feelings as Lina is, and unlike her he won't violently deny it when asked. He doesn't act on them, though, and he seems content with merely watching out for Lina's well-being. They do share a kiss in the final episode of ''Slayers NEXT'', the second series of the anime, though neither remembers it.

:{{Voiced by| [[Yasunori Matsumoto]]| [[Eric Stuart]] &lt;small&gt;(TV series)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; [[Chris Patton]] &lt;small&gt;(''Slayers Premium'')&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Zelgadis Graywords===
{{Nihongo|Zelgadis Graywords|ゼルガディス・グレイワーズ|Zerugadisu Gureiwāzu}} is a sorcerer who begins as a retainer for his ancestor Rezo, an enemy of Lina. He is a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] made of rock, [[golem]], "brau" (English "blow") demon, and human.

Zelgadis specializes in [[Shamanism|Shamanistic]] magic, which pulls its power from the [[Astral body|astral]], or spiritual, plane. His elemental spells, including Stone Spiker and the mighty Ra-Tilt, are formidable. Since he is part blow demon, he is unable to cast [[black magic]], as doing so would require him to call upon the power of another demonic being——which, in the ''Slayers'' universe, is akin to willing oneself out of existence. Though he is not as learned in the art as Lina, Zelgadis' even combination of physical force and magical finesse render him among the most fearsome warriors.

Zelgadis is an enigma to his comrades, due to his quiet and [[Asociality|asocial]] nature. Despite traveling with Lina and her friends, he considers himself separate from them and even a little bit evil, as "the heartless mystical swordsman" of the group.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When he was a teenager, Rezo transformed him into a three-part chimera. He travels with the Slayers to find a spell that can change him back into a human. Despite the incredible abilities bestowed upon him by the transformation, he dislikes his appearance; his skin is stone hard, tinged blue-grey with pebbles scattered across its surface, and his hair is as stiff as steel wire. During ''Slayers Evolution-R'', Rezo informs Zelgadis that he knows of no cure to return him to human. It is unclear whether this means that Zelgadis will forever remain a chimera, or if Rezo's knowledge was simply limited in that respect; but [[Hajime Kanzaka]], the author of the series, has stated in past interviews that Zelgadis would probably eventually find his cure.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Out of everyone in the group, Zelgadis seems closest to Amelia. This becomes more clear in ''Slayers NEXT'', as he becomes upset whenever she is hurt, and almost sacrifices his own life protecting her from Gaav. In later seasons, they become quite close and he opens up to her. When they part at the end of the last episode of ''Slayers TRY'', the third season of the anime, she apparently gives him "The Lady's Favour" in the form of one of the pink bracelets from her standard costume.

:{{Voiced by| [[Hikaru Midorikawa]]| Daniel Cronin &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 2–10)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; [[Crispin Freeman]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 18-104, ''Premium'')&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Amelia {{anchor|Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun}} ===
{{Nihongo|Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun|アメリア・ウィル・テスラ・セイルーン|Ameria Wiru Tesura Seirūn}} is a young priestess and the princess of Seyruun. She longs to be a "hero of justice" and quixotically pursues her quest for justice by following Lina and fighting those who appear to be villains. Amelia's naïve tendency to believe whatever she is told sometimes leads her to mistake friend and foe. In the novels, Amelia is the same age as Lina, but in the anime and manga franchise, Amelia is a year younger than Lina and smaller (though very busty, much to Lina's annoyance).

Her perspective on good and evil evolves significantly as the series progresses. Although Lina is often annoyed with Amelia for her naïveté, her desire to learn the Dragon Slave, and her larger bust size, eventually Lina comes to accept her as a friend and treats her like a little sister.

Most of Amelia's lessons in justice and heroism came from her father Prince Philionel of Seyruun, the "ultimate pacifist". After the murder of her mother, Amelia vowed never to use blades, though she once used the Sword of Light to channel the Ra-Tilt. Naga the Serpent is Amelia's long-lost older sister, the crown princess Gracia.&lt;ref&gt;This rumor was confirmed by Hajime Kanzaka during an interview.{{which|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is played to comedic effect in ''Slayers Evolution-R'', with the amnesiac character "Nama" ironically alluding to the relation.

Amelia becomes close friends with everyone in the group, but it is clear that early on she starts to develop feelings for Zelgadis. Their first meeting was not a very good one, but they become quite close as they tend to be paired during missions. Amelia teases him playing chess, or angrily beats him over his maltreatment of innocent forest animals, and gets away without so much as an angry glare.

:{{Voiced by| [[Masami Suzuki]]| [[Joan Baker]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 11-13)&lt;/small&gt;, [[Veronica Taylor]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 14-104)&lt;/small&gt;, &amp; [[Luci Christian]] &lt;small&gt;(''Slayers Premium'')&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Naga the Serpent===
{{Main|Naga the Serpent}}

{{nihongo|Naga the Serpent|白蛇のナーガ|Sāpento no Nāga}}, or Naga the White Serpent, is a powerful sorceress with an unstable but resilient personality. She is obsessed with Lina, and follows the younger sorceress around for some time, annoying Lina with her characteristic cackling laugh.

Naga's main spells, such as Freeze Arrow, are water- and ice-based, in direct opposition to Lina's fire-based skills. She has also shown the ability to use powerful shamanistic, white magic, and necromancy spells. Her true name is Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun; she is the daughter of Prince Philionel and Amelia's older sister. Naga left home after her mother was murdered.

Naga herself appears only in the OVAs and films, not in the main anime series. However, she does make a cameo appearance in ''Slayers Evolution-R'' as "Nama", a sentient suit of armor who remembers very little about her life before her soul was placed in the living armor. Her identity is never confirmed, but Nama's familiar laugh gives Lina chills.

:{{Voiced by| [[Maria Kawamura]]| Kelly Manison &lt;small&gt;(OVAs and films)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; Eva Kaminsky &lt;small&gt;(Evolution-R)&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Sylphiel {{anchor|Sylphiel Nels Lahda}}===
{{Nihongo|Sylphiel Nels Lahda|シルフィール・ネルス・ラーダ|Shirufīru Nerusu Rāda}} is a young [[Clergy|cleric]] who has known Gourry since childhood. She became infatuated with Gourry to the point where she refers to him as "Dear Gourry" or "Gourry Dear" (translated from "Gourry-Sama" in the original Japanese, a show of respect), but Gourry only remembers her for her good cooking.

She is weak in shamanism and black magic. However, as a cleric, her skills in white magic (healing and protection) are impressive. Her defensive magic is powerful enough to easily hold its own against both Copy Rezo and Zanaffar in the finale of ''Slayers Revolution''. With her healing magic she is able to bring Lina back from the brink of death using a high level [[resurrection]] spell, mainly due to her profession as a shrine maiden. Ironically, in ''Slayers NEXT'', she manages to use Lina's signature black magic spell, the Dragon Slave. Her only other offensive spell, Flare Arrow, is comically pathetic: slow, weak and shaped like a carrot or beet.

In the anime, Sylphiel joins the Slayers for the end of the first series, and again near the end of the second series ''NEXT''. She reappears in ''Slayers Revolution'' during the attack on Seiruun.

:{{Voiced by| [[Yumi Tōma]]| Stacia Crawford &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 18-26, 49-52)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; [[Stephanie Sheh]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 90-93, 104)&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Xellos===
{{Main|Xellos}}
{{Nihongo|Xellos|ゼロス|Zerosu}} is a high-level monster (translated from "[[Mazoku]]" in the original Japanese) who is more than 1,000 years old. He first appears in the second episode of ''Slayers NEXT''. Most often, Xellos goes by simply his first name. In the sixth ''Slayers'' novel ''Vezendi's Shadow'', Xellos says his real name is "Xellos the Mysterious Priest". In the anime, he is called the "trickster priest" by many, including himself, and "namagomi" ("raw garbage") by Filia. In the English version, he is also known as Beastmaster Xellos. Some have called him Xellos Metallium after his master Zelas.

According to Demon Dragon King Gaav, Xellos was created by Shabranigdo and given powers beyond any monster outside the five Demon Lords. He seems to serve various monster lords,&lt;ref&gt;Hajime, Kanzaka (2005). ''Slayers: The Silver Beast''. Tokyopop, LA. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; including Hellmaster Phibrizzo, but his true master is Zelas Metallium, another of the Demon Lords, for whom he acts as both priest and general. Dragons fear Xellos and see him as their mortal enemy after he killed half the population during the War of the Monster's Fall.

Xellos is sometimes a hindrance, sometimes a help to the Slayers. His actions appear frustratingly inconsistent because of his oft-changing loyalties at his master's request. His catchphrase response to any important question is "That is a secret!" (from "Sore wa himitsu desu!").

:{{Voiced by| [[Akira Ishida]]| [[David Moo]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 27-78)&lt;/small&gt;, [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 83-104)&lt;/small&gt;, &amp; Kurt Stoll &lt;small&gt;(''Slayers Premium'')&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Martina===
{{Nihongo|Martina|マルチナ| Maruchina}} is the princess of the kingdom of Zoana who appears exclusively in the ''Slayers Next'' television series as a main character. She has green hair styled in drills. She specializes in curses through the power of Lord Zoamelgustar, a fictional monster that she worships; surprisingly, her curses actually work, even though Zoamelgustar does not exist. At the beginning of the series, she and her father plot to capture Amelia, but Lina saves Amelia and then casts a Dragon Slave to destroy Martina's castle, She then runs off and learns magic so that she can take revenge. She later joins Lina and the gang on their adventures. The episode "Bitter Curve Balls! Gutsy Fast Balls!" reveals her full name to be {{Nihongo|Martina Xoana Mel Navratilova|マルチナ・ゾアナ・メル・ナブラチロワ|Maruchina Zoana Meru Naburachirowa}}, named after tennis superstar [[Martina Navratilova]]. When Hellmaster Phibrizzo kills her during the final battle, Martina uses her last moments to encourage Lina to keep fighting and save Gourry. Martina is fickle in her love affairs, obsessed with whatever man she happens to see first on any given day. At first she is hung up on Zelgadis, but her interests switch to Gourry and even Xellos as the series progresses, before settling on Zangulus. She eventually marries Zangulus. Lina and the gang remark that Martina is the comic relief character in their party.
:{{Voiced by| [[Tomoko Ishimura]]| [[Rachael Lillis]]}}

===Filia===
{{Nihongo|Filia Ul Copt|フィリア・ウル・コプト|Firia Uru Koputo}} is a priestess of the Fire Dragon King who appears exclusively in ''Slayers TRY''. As a Golden Dragon, she has a pronounced sense of honor and is dedicated to "fulfilling her duties to the temple".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Any monster that crosses her path annoys her, and she doesn't get along with Xellos at all. She carries a large mace (affectionately dubbed "Mace-sama") in her garter, and uses it to end most of her arguments.

Filia's Golden Dragon magic from the outer world is a raw, more intense form of white magic. Amelia states that the white magic used by clerics is only an "empty shell" of Filia's ancient holy magic. Filia's skills include [[clairvoyance]], healing, purification, transportation, and offensive spells effective against the most powerful monster. Her spell Chaotic Disintegrate is an astral offensive spell that outclasses the Ra-Tilt. Filia is able to switch back and forth with ease between her dragon and human forms. Her dragon's form comically wears a pink bow on the end of her tail. While in dragon form, Filia can fly, surpassing the speed of a normal Ray Wing levitation spell. Her Laser Breath, which fires an incredibly destructive beam from a dragon's mouth, can be used in both human and dragon forms.

Filia originally wanted Lina's big sister Luna to accompany her on her quest, but Luna refuses and suggests Lina as a replacement. At the end of ''Slayers TRY'', Filia accepts the egg of the reborn Valgaav in repentance for what her ancestors did to his kind, and raises him as his adoptive mother.

===Pokota===
{{Nihongo|Pokota|ポコタ|Pokota}}, full name {{Nihongo|Posel Korba Taforashia|ポセル＝コルバ＝タフォーラシア|Poseru Koruba Tafōrashia}}, is an original character created exclusively for ''Slayers Revolution'' and ''Slayers Evolution-R'', though he borrows certain elements from the character Luke seen in the ''Slayers'' novels. He resembles a small stuffed animal with large ears that double as a set of functional arms used for casting spells, wielding swords, or gliding through the air. Like Lina, he is a powerful sorcerer capable of casting various spells, including the Dragon Slave. He wields a replica of the Sword of Light, which he carries in a pocket in his chest.

Pokota was born a human, the prince of Taforashia. When he was a teenager, the Durum sickness swept through Taforashia, and the king became very ill. Rezo the Red Priest appeared and sealed the residents of Taforashia in sleeping chambers to isolate them until a cure was found. In this way he sealed Pokota's human body, but he used the magical Hellmaster's Jar to transfer Pokota's spirit into his current form. Years later, Pokota is searching for Rezo in order to find a way to revive his people.

==Villains==

===Rezo the Red Priest===
{{Nihongo|Rezo the Red Priest|赤法師レゾ|Aka Hōshi Rezo}} is one of the "Five Wisemen of the Age", a world-famous priest and healer. According to Zelgadis, Rezo is over a century old. However, he does not look his age. In the first novel, Lina describes him as looking "both young and old" at the same time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Rezo's only known relative is Zelgadis Graywords, who is either his grandson or great-grandson.&lt;ref&gt;''Choubaku Madouden Slayers #3'' (Legend of Darkness), July 1996, pg 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rezo was born with one of the seven pieces of Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo sealed within his eyes. As a result, he is gifted with superior magic ability, but cursed with blindness. He began studying white magic in an effort to cure his blindness, not realizing its origin. Once he mastered white magic, he traveled the land healing the sick and blind, performing miracles. However, he was never able to cure his own eyes, so he turned to shamanism and black magic, becoming increasingly obsessed with finding any possible cure while the fragment of Shabranigdo corrupted his soul. He comes to the conclusion that Demon Lord Shabranigdo is the only one with enough power to cure him.

When Rezo finds the philosopher's stone, he resurrects the fragment of Shabranigdo, only then learning that it lies within his own eyes. Lina is able to defeat the Demon King using the incomplete Giga Slave and the Sword of Light, with help from Rezo's soul, but she kills the priest in the process. It is later revealed that Rezo survived by transferring his soul, as well as the ghost of Shabranigdo, into the Hellmaster's Jar. When the Slayers find the Hellmaster's Jar, Pokota resurrects Rezo in order to revive the people of Taforashia from their suspended state. After reviving the people of Taforashia, Rezo wants to see again, if only for a moment, so he opens his eyes. As the power of Shabranigdo returns to him, he asks Lina to destroy him once more. With the help of the completed Giga Slave, Lina destroys Rezo, and the ghost of Shabranigdo with him.

===Eris===
Eris is the servant of Rezo the Red Priest and later Copy Rezo. From a young age, she serves as Rezo's assistant and apprentice, helping him perform his miracles. She also assists in his research to cure his blindness, and is brokenhearted over his repeated failures; she may have been in love with him. After the death of the original Rezo, she hires the swordsman Zangulus and the sorcerer Vrumugun to hunt down Lina and Gourry and bring them to Sairaag.

Eris is responsible for cloning Vrumugun. She is killed in cold blood by Copy Rezo after he merges with the ancient Demon Beast Zanaffar that was buried in the Holy Tree Flaggoon.

:{{Voiced by| Etsuko Ishikawa| Rachel Nanstad}}, Rossana Cicconi (Spanish)

===Copy Rezo===
{{Nihongo|Copy Rezo|コピー・レゾ|Kopī Rezo}}, sometimes referred to as "The Rezo Clone", is a [[Replica|copy]] of Rezo the Red Priest, created by the original Rezo as a [[Laboratory rat|lab rat]] for experiments to cure his blindness. Copy Rezo's eyes open while the original's do not, because the copy's eyes do not contain the fragment of Shabranigdo.

Copy Rezo's greatest and only wish is to surpass his original. At first, he intends to kill Rezo in a fair fight. When Rezo is killed by the Slayers, he decides that the only other way to surpass Rezo is to either kill the ones who defeated the original Rezo, or withstand the Giga Slave that delivered the killing blow. He orders Eris to lure the three of them to Sairaag, where he attempts to defeat them by resurrecting and absorbing the power of the demon beast Zanaffar. However, Lina, Gourry, and Zelgadis, accompanied by Amelia and Sylphiel, kill him using the Blessed Blade and the power of the tree Flaggoon.

When the Rezo clone wonders how he lost, the Slayers answer that it was because of his desire to surpass his original, and his inability to imagine a life for himself beyond that. He dies with a smile on his face, and asks to be buried beneath Flaggoon.

In the novel series, the original Rezo's fury when Copy Rezo's eyes open but his own will not leads him to conduct a number of experiments on Copy Rezo. When Rezo fuses the copy with a monster, Copy Rezo gains both pride and a will of his own, causing his desire to get revenge on and surpass Rezo. This, rather than Zanaffar, becomes the source of Copy Rezo's power.

:{{Voiced by| [[Takehito Koyasu]]| Peter Davis}}

===Gaav===
Gaav is a high-ranking monster, one of the five Demon Lords under Shabranigdo. He bears the title of Demon Dragon King, though he is unrelated to the dragon race. Gaav appears to be the main antagonist of ''Slayers NEXT'', but it is later revealed that he is simply a pawn in Hellmaster Phibrizzo's plan.

During the war of the extermination of the Ancient Dragon race, Gaav meets Valgaav, the last of the Ancient Dragons, and gains his servitude. Valgaav appears as one of Lina's enemies in ''Slayers TRY''.

Long ago, Gaav battled and defeated Aqualord Ragradia, one of the four Dragon Kings created by Ceiphied's power. However, before his death, Ragradia somehow sealed Gaav's monster soul into a human body, dramatically weakening him. Gaav still displays a considerable amount of strength, far outclassing even that of Xellos, who is unquestionably the strongest monster besides the five Demon Lords. Even sealed in a human body, Gaav is able to attack on the [[astral plane]]. He bests Xellos at his own game, and proves able to withstand a direct attack from Lina's Ragna Blade.

:Voiced by: [[Jouji Nakata]] (Japanese) |[[Dan Green (voice actor)|Jay Snyder]] (English)

===Seigram===
Seigram is a servant of Gaav the Demon Dragon King in ''Slayers NEXT''. He is a monster who is seemingly as powerful as his rival Xellos. He first appears as a mysterious figure that frames Damia and Tarimu by summoning ooze monsters out of their estates, and he makes an alliance with Halcyform. However, when confronted by Xellos, he retreats without a fight. He later attacks Lina in the temple of the Claire Bible manuscript, revealing that he was granted enough of Gaav's power to withstand a Dragon Slave. He is killed when Xellos holds him directly in the path of Lina's Ragna Blade.

:Voiced by: [[Robert O'Gorman]] (English)

===Hellmaster Phibrizzo===
The primary antagonist in ''NEXT'', {{Nihongo|Hellmaster Phibrizzo|冥王フィブリゾ|Herumasutā Fiburizo}} is the oldest and the most powerful of the five Demon Lords created by Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo. He is most likely the second-in-command of the monster race. Like all monsters, he seeks to destroy the world and return everything to the Sea of Chaos. He manifests as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] little boy in order to trick his victims into underestimating him.

Phibrizzo has complete control over death and the souls of the departed. He is able to raise thousands of people from the grave as living dead under his control with their memories and personality intact. He can also encase people in a life-absorbing green crystal, or kill anyone simply by breaking a golden marble that represents their lives. Intelligent and cunning; he knows how to manipulate people, and convincingly pretends to be an ordinary child. His eagerness to destroy the world goes far beyond any other monster's. Though cruel and sadistic, his personality fits his childish appearance, as he enjoys making fun of his victims and using people like toys to entertain himself.

It was Phibrizzo who ignited the War of the Monster's Fall, first as a conflict between humans, then as a worldwide war between monsters and dragons, in order to awaken the part of Shabranigdo sealed within the sorcerer Lei Magnus. He is probably the one who decided to create the Monster Barrier, which isolated the battlefields to the outer and inner worlds, weakening the dragons' forces.

In ''Slayers NEXT'', Phibrizzo plans to force Lina to draw upon the power of the Lord of Nightmares and use the Giga Slave, which can destroy the entire world. He uses Gaav and Xellos to lead Lina to the discovery of the Giga Slave spell, then joins Lina as a young pickpocket to watch what happens. When Lina, fearing the power of the Giga Slave, brings down Gaav with the weaker Ragna Blade spell instead, Phibrizzo destroys Gaav and kidnaps Gourry, forcing her to cast the Giga Slave. However, the Giga Slave summons the Lord of Nightmares herself in Lina's body, who obliterates him, giving him the destruction he craved.

:{{Voiced by| [[Kazue Ikura]]| [[Wayne Grayson]]}}

===Valgaav===
Valgaav is one of the main adversaries in the third series of the anime, ''Slayers TRY''. Once known as Prince Val of the Ancient Dragon clan, he is nearly killed by the Golden Dragons, who feared the dark powers of the Ancient Dragons and exterminated them. He is saved at the last moment by Gaav, who sees in him a powerful ally and a spirit of hatred towards the Golden Dragons for their betrayal. Gaav bestows upon him the powers of a monster and renames him "Valgaav".

Valgaav and Gaav are separated when the other four Demon Lords create the barrier separating the outer and inner worlds. The barrier remains in effect until Hellmaster Phibrizzo's death at the end of ''Slayers NEXT''. Valgaav is loyal only to his savior, Gaav, and gives no allegiance to any side, be it Slayers, dragons, gods, or monsters. With the combined power of a monster and Ancient Dragon, Valgaav is the strongest of Gaav's servants. However, he is notably weaker than Gaav. His Ancient Dragon power conflicts with the monster power given to him by Gaav, causing him pain. He is able to best Xellos in a one-on-one fight by using Ragud Mezagis, one of the five Darkstar weapons. He survives a magically amplified Dragon Slave fired directly into his body.

Despite his prowess as a warrior, Valgaav is radically unstable and reckless. He activates the gateway created to summon Darkstar with only two of the five weapons required. Although the gateway is closed by other gods from the Overworld, Darkstar fires a blast through it that destroys Valgaav. He reappears at the end of the season merged with the fusion of Darkstar and Volphied, and acts as an arbiter of the two. Possessing the powers of both dragon gods and monster lords, he is easily the most powerful being faced in the entire storyline of ''Slayers'', although his power is cut in half by the open gateway. Valgaav/Darkstar/Volphied is destroyed by the combination of dark and light powers of Xellos's and Filia's abilities, combined with the five Darkstar weapons and Lina's incantation of Chaos power. At the end of ''Slayers TRY'', he is reborn as an egg and falls under the care of Filia and two of his former demi-human subordinates, Jillas and Gravos.

:Voices: [[Wataru Takagi]] (Japanese), [[Scottie Ray]] (English)

===Zuuma===
Zuuma is an assassin hired to kill Lina Inverse in ''Slayers Revolution''. He became an assassin solely for the purpose of killing Lina. Gourry uses Pokota's Sword of Light to blast one of his arms off, while Lina blasts the other.

Zuuma returns in ''Slayers Evolution-R'' as the main antagonist alongside Shabranigdo. He orders Lina to come to the city of Vezendi or he will kill a merchant named Radok, who has the Hellmaster's Jar. It turns out that Zuuma actually is Radok, and it is all a ploy to draw Lina in. Although it is uncertain precisely why Zuuma wants to kill Lina, she once killed a group of bandits that were responsible for killing his wife, thus denying him vengeance. In the manga, he is killed by the Ragna Blade, but in the anime, he has his hands slashed off a second time before Xellos appears and kills him in order to steal the Hellmaster's Jar.

:{{Voiced by| [[Nobuo Tobita]]| [[Troy Baker]]}}

==Other characters==

===Noonsa===
{{Nihongo|Noonsa|ヌンサ|Nunsa}} is a fishman, with the body of a fish and the legs and arms of a human. He is one of Zelgadis's henchmen at the opening of the story. He comically tortures Lina with a kiss (sucking on her entire head) when she won't tell Zelgadis about the [[philosopher's stone]].

Later, when Zelgadis breaks Lina out of the castle, Noonsa attempts a sneak attack on Lina, but Zelgadis traps him in a bubble of air and fries him with a fireball. Later, some of Dilgear's followers find the fried fish and eat him.

In the manga version of the story, Noonsa has no romantic attraction to Lina. He is ordered by Zelgadis to steal the philosopher's stone, but Gourry slices him in two and eats him. In the novel, when Noonsa is ordered to kiss Lina, he asks where the eggs are, having no concept of kissing other than that it is related to mating.

:{{Voiced by| [[Kozo Shioya]]| Junior Ringenbach}}

===Dilgear===
{{Nihongo|Dilgear|ディルギア|Dirugia}} is a half-wolf, half-troll henchman of Zelgadis. Unlike Zolf, Rodimus, and Noonsa, his colleagues, Dilgear is actually quite violent during battles and will even kill his foes. He first appears in Episode 4 of the anime.

Although Dilgear was placed under Zelgadis' rule, his ultimate loyalty is to Rezo, so it comes as no surprise to Zelgadis when the half-breed turns against him. When Zolf and Rodimus arrive, Dilgear thinks that he has been saved, but Rodimus says that their loyalty is to Zelgadis, not Rezo. Dilgear is seriously wounded by Zolf, and his final words are: "Just wait until I come back to life!" Thanks to his half-troll regenerative abilities, he does revive, but instead of seeking revenge he ends up as [[Luna Inverse]]'s pet, and she calls him ''Spot''. The exact circumstances of this radical change in Dilgear's life are unknown.

In the manga, Dilgear is a [[bounty hunter]] sent by Eris, along with Rahanimu and Vrumugun, to eliminate Gourry and Lina. Strangely, Dilgear vanishes shortly after his introduction. It is possible that he either flees or is simply killed off-screen.

:{{Voiced by|Hirohiko Kakegawa| [[Jimmy Zoppi]]}}

===Zolf===
{{Nihongo|Zolf|ゾルフ|Zorufu}} is a sorcerer loyal to Zelgadis. While under the command of Zelgadis and the Red Priest Rezo, Zolf infiltrates the Dragon Fangs gang in order to steal the Orihalcon Statue and the philosopher's stone it contains. Unfortunately for him, he joins the gang just in time to be blown up by Lina robbing the gang. Following the attack, bandages cover his entire body, earning him the nickname "Mummy Man". After Zelgadis' break with Rezo, Zolf chooses to follow Zelgadis and remain under his command, also removing his bandages. He casts a Dragon Slave at Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo, but Shabranigdo reflects the spell, killing Zolf and Rodimus.

:{{Voiced by| [[Masato Hirano (voice actor)|Masato Hirano]]| [[Stan Hart (voice actor)|Stan Hart]]}}

===Rodimus===
{{Nihongo|Rodimus|ロディマス|Rodimasu}} is an elderly man loyal to Zelgadis. Despite his apparent age, Rodimus appears to be a skilled fighter and manages to hold his own, with the help of Dilgear, against much younger fighters like Gourry.

Rodimus chooses to remain under Zelgadis's command when Zelgadis turns from Rezo. His time with the Slayers is short-lived; when Zolf mistakenly casts a Dragon Slave on Shabranigdo, the Demon King reflects the spell, killing Rodimus and Zolf. In the manga series, after Zolf is killed by the reflected Dragon Slave, Rodimus sacrifices his life protecting Zelgadis from a dark magic attack launched by Shabranigdo.

:{{Voiced by| [[Katsuhisa Hōki]]| Junior Ringenbach}}

===Phil===
{{Nihongo|Philionel El Di Seyruun|フィリオネル＝エル＝ディ＝セイルーン|Firioneru Eru Di Seirūn}} is the crown prince of Seyruun. He has two daughters, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun and Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun. Gracia leaves after Phil's unnamed wife is killed by an assassin, and now calls herself "Naga the White Serpent".

Phil also has two brothers, Christopher Wil Brogg Seyruun and Randionel Seyruun, and a nephew, Alfred Seyruun. Both Randy and Alfred are killed in separate attempts to seize the throne for themselves. Though Phil's father Eldoran Seyruun is technically still the king, he is old, sickly, and bedridden, so Phil more or less runs the country. Possibly due to his wife's death and his eldest daughter's absence, he is very close with and protective of his youngest daughter Amelia.

Like Amelia, Phil has a strong belief in justice, and he is also a [[Pacifism|pacifist]]. However, if Phil sees something he believes to be unjust, he will not hesitate to use force. Unlike most of the Seyruun royal family, Phil has no magical powers, but his brute strength crushes injustice with attacks such as Pacifist Crush and Kindness to All Creatures Kick. This sheer strength is sufficient to destroy lesser demons.

===Beastmaster Zelas===
Zelas Metallium, also known as Lord Beastmaster, is one of the five Demon Lords who rules on Wolf-Pack Island. She appears in the novels periodically, but her only appearance in the anime is a shot of legs and a cigarette. Xellos serves as her right-hand man, and everything Xellos does in the end leads back to her. She is a popular character in the [[fandom]] world, and most of what is known about her personality is fan-based.

===Vrumugun===
{{Nihongo|Vrumugun|ヴルムグン|Vurumugun}} is the name given to a group of copy men created by Eris in the third novel and the first season of the anime.

In the novels, Eris uses the Vrumuguns to try and capture Lina, Gourry, and Zelgadis and bring them to Sairaag. She only sends one Vrumugun after them at a time, sending a new copy every time one is killed, which confuses Lina and the others at first: each time they think they've killed Vrumugun, he reappears to attack them again. The Vrumugun copies disappear once their controller dies.

In the anime, Vrumugun is partnered with Zangulus, and they try to capture Lina and Gourry. However, while Zangulus is short-tempered and arrogant, Vrumugun is quiet, collected, and takes everything seriously. In episode 18, after Zelgadis kills a group of clones, Vrumugun vanishes and is not seen again in season 1.

The original Vrumugun's identity is a mystery. In the novels, there is evidence to suggest that Eris is the original. She (and possibly the original Rezo) created them, and her last name is given as Vrumugun. In the anime, Eris' last name is never mentioned, nor is it ever hinted that she is the original. At the end of ''Slayers NEXT'', a person very much resembling Vrumugun is briefly seen at Zangulus and Martina's wedding, implying that this person is the original Vrumugun.

:{{Voiced by| [[Hiroshi Yanaka]]| [[Jimmy Zoppi]]}}

===Zangulus===
{{Nihongo|Zangulus|ザングルス|Zangurusu}} is a [[mercenary]] and a swordsman of considerable skill. Although he cannot use magic, he wields a weapon called the Howling Sword, a magical sword created by Rezo that can shoot great gusts of wind. Zangulus and the sorcerer Vrumugun were originally hired as bounty hunters by Eris and Copy Rezo to capture Lina, Gourry, and Zelgadis and bring them to Sairaag.

Zangulus becomes obsessed with fighting Gourry to see who is the better swordsman. They duel in Rezo's lab, but Gourry wins in the end, and Zangulus leaves. He reappears towards the end of ''Slayers NEXT'', looking for a rematch. However, Gourry is being held prisoner by Hellmaster Phibrizzo, so Zangulus does not get a chance to duel him a second time. He does help Lina and the others fight the Hellmaster. It is during this time that Zangulus meets and falls in love with Martina, who he marries after the battle.

Zangulus is yet another character created for the anime, and does not appear in the original novels or the manga. 

:{{Voiced by| [[Bin Shimada]]| Liam O'Malley &lt;small&gt;(Episode 13)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; [[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 14-21, 49-52)&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Jillas===
{{Nihongo|Jillas Jillos Jilles|ジラス＝ジロス＝ジレス|Jirasu Jirosu Jiresu}} is a red fox beastman and a servant of Valgaav.

Jillas' people were nearly hunted to extinction. After being injured by humans and losing his left eye, Jillas is saved by Valgaav. He is partnered with Gravos Maunttop, who he refers to as "Boss". He has no knowledge of magic or swordplay, but is skilled with guns, gunpowder and various explosives. He also has a knack for exploiting the friction between people to his advantage, and employs [[psychological warfare]] against the Slayers to great effect.

In ''TRY'', Valgaav orders Gravos and Jillas to locate and recover the five Darkstar weapons. When Gravos loses control of Ragudo Mezegis is blasted away by a Dragon Slave, Jillas swears vengeance on the Slayers, and succeeds in stealing Gorun Nova from Gourry.

After everyone is separated and Valgaav is presumed dead, Jillas is rescued by a fox named Elena and her son Palou, who call him "uncle". He abandons them to seek vengeance when he discovers that the Slayers are still alive. Filia saves him from the explosion of one of his own bombs, after which he calls her "Boss", a name that makes her uncomfortable. After Valgaav is reborn as a pure Ancient Dragon and is adopted by Filia, Jillas and Gravos (who was literally launched into orbit by the Dragon Slave) become her partners and help her sell maces and pottery in a shop.

:{{Voiced by| [[Takumi Yamazaki]]| [[Maddie Blaustein]]}}

===Gravos Maunttop===
{{Nihongo|Gravos Maunttop|グラボス＝マウントトップ|Gurabosu Mauntotoppu}}, a reptilian beastman, is a servant of Valgaav. His first appearance in the series is in Episode 54 of ''TRY''.

Gravos was almost killed by his own people, causing him to lose his right eye. Valgaav saves him and becomes his master. During ''TRY'', Gravos and Jillas attempt to steal Gorun Nova on Valgaav's orders. During a struggle to get the holy magic and the black magic vessels from Princess Sera and Prince Marco, Gravos loses control of Ragudo Mezegis when he is hit by the Dragon Slave and is knocked into the distance, presumed dead. However, he is alive and well in the epilogue of ''TRY'', once again partnered with Jillas and helping Filia run a store that sells maces and pottery.

:{{Voiced by| [[Hisao Egawa]]| [[Nathan Price]]}}

===Milgasia===
{{Nihongo|Milgasia|ミルガズィア|Mirugazia}} is the leader of the Golden Dragons remaining in the outer world, who were originally in the service of the Water Dragon King. Milgasia finds the Slayers when they enter the Valley of Dragons. He aids Lina by taking her to see the real Claire Bible so that Lina can learn the truth behind the Giga Slave. In the anime, Martina tags along as well. In the novels, Milgasia and his elven companion Mephis join Lina in her travels for a while.

Milgasia is probably over 1,000 years old, as he seems to have first-hand knowledge about Xellos and the War of the Monster's Fall. At first, he is worried about the Slayers's association with Xellos, until Gourry helps him realize that they are not intimidated or influenced by Xellos in any way. Milgasia's first appearance is in Episode 20 of ''Slayers NEXT'', which roughly equals the seventh novel and manga issue.

:{{Voiced by| Masaaki Ōkura| Zeke Zeigler}}

===Damia and Tarimu===
{{Nihongo|Damia|デイミア|Deimia}} and {{Nihongo|Tarimu|タリム|Tarimu}} are members of the Sorcerer's Association, competing for the position of Guild Master. Damia hires Lina and Gourry as bodyguards Tarimu, while Tarimu does the same with Amelia and Zelgadis, leading the two pairs to unknowingly compete. When monsters begin coming out of both Damia's and Tarimu's estates, they are imprisoned, leaving them unable to pay the Slayers for their services.

While in prison, Damia and Tarimu reveal that they are responsible for the empty guild position. Halcyform, the previous Guild Master, had been expelled after they found him conducting taboo research into immortality. He lost his position, and was certainly powerful enough to summon the monsters to frame each of them. Both Damia's and Tarimu's lower halves become imprisoned in stone when they try to repay Halcyform for his wrongs, and, to their dismay, they are left on their own to find a way of turning themselves back to normal.

===Luna Inverse===
{{Nihongo|Luna Inverse|ルナ＝インバース|Runa Inbāsu}}, Lina's older sister, was born in a small village in Zephilia, the first daughter of merchants. Her father is an ex-mercenary and her mother is an ex-sorceress.

Luna and Lina's relationship is not particularly affectionate. Apparently, when they were younger, Lina would misbehave and Luna would "punish" her by making her do grueling workouts. The most notorious incident between the two was when Lina, ever keen on an opportunity to make some extra cash, set up a device that projected an image of Luna while she was taking a bath. Luna's reaction "compelled" Lina to begin her quest. Lina is still terrified of Luna, and even the mere mention of her sister sends Lina into a panic attack, as seen in ''Slayers Revolution'' episode 8.

A fragment of Ceiphied's will is lodged within Luna. In ''Slayers TRY'', when the Slayers visit the Fire Dragon Temple, it is mentioned that she is known as the "Ceiphied Knight". As the Knight of Ceiphied, Luna wields an immense amount of holy power. Luna never appears in person during the novels or the anime, but Hajime Kanzaka has said that she is slightly more powerful than Xellos.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} She can cut a Dragon Slave in half with an ordinary, non-magical sword, and once defeated a plasma dragon with a kitchen knife.

In ''Slayers TRY'', Luna is Filia's first choice to save the world from the prophecy of destruction. Luna, being on the side of the gods, knows she is not the candidate in the prophecy; she turns down Filia's request and suggests Lina for the job instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya7i7UMmWLk|title=Slayers TRY - 2 - Doubtful?

==Deities==
===Shabranigdo===
{{Nihongo|Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo|赤眼の魔王（ルビーアイ）シャブラニグドゥ|Rubī Ai Shaburanigudu}}, also known as Shabranigdu, is a powerful being of evil, the ruler and strongest of the monsters, and the source of power for Lina's signature spell, the Dragon Slave. He is said to be the sole source of misery and negative emotions in the ''Slayers'' world.

Defeated long ago by the Dragon King Ceiphied, Shabranigdo was split into seven parts and buried in human souls. It was Ceiphied's plan to wear away at these fragments by the constant death and rebirth of human lives, until Shabranigdo ceased to be. A thousand years before the series begins, one of these parts awakened in the legendary sorcerer Lei Magnus, the Demon King of the North. Lei Magnus was a great sage who created devastating spells, such as the Dragon Slave and shamanism's powerful fire spell Blast Bomb. However, his power came at a price. When the piece of Shabranigdo within him awakened, he led the monsters against the Dragon Kings. He was defeated and sealed in ice by the Sea Dragon King, Aqualord Ragradia, and at the same time the Demon Dragon King Gaav, one of Shabranigdo's Demon Lords, was bound to a human body. It was a costly victory; Ragradia was destroyed, leaving only her memories and knowledge, which became the Claire Bible. The remaining four Demon Lords (Dynast Grausherra, Deep Sea Dolphin, Beastmaster Zelas Metallium, and Hellmaster Phibrizzo) erected a shield that sealed the divine powers in the outer world, separated from the inner world where the ''Slayers'' story begins.

A second portion of Shabranigdo awakens in the first ''Slayers'' arc. Rezo the Red Priest awakens the fragment sealed within his eyes when he uses the philosopher's stone in an attempt to cure his blindness. Lina confronts the unbound piece of Shabranigdo, invoking the Giga Slave to defeat him. It is possible that Shabranigdo could have survived this attack, but a fragment of Rezo's remaining will forces open its defenses. Shabranigdo claims that he is so impressed at Lina's improvised spell that he allows that fragment of himself to be bested.

In ''Slayers Evolution-R'', the Red Priest revives, bringing the fragment of Shabranigdo back to life with him. It possesses the true body of Pokota, and when Pokota returns to his body, it causes instability between the occupying souls, allowing Lina's perfected Giga Slave to destroy Shabranigdo.

In the final ''Slayers'' novel, a third fragment of Shabranigdo is buried in the soul of a character named Luke, who had previously appeared as a rival. Driven to despair by the events of the previous book, Luke is contacted by the fragment of Ruby-Eye within him and manages to strike a deal with it: he will fight Lina and Gourry one more time, and if he is victorious, the fragment will wholly revive and complete the monster race's goal of destroying the world. As Luke ultimately wishes to die in the battle, rather than destroy the world, his self-destructive impulse allows him and the fragment to be slain by the Dragon Slave. This battle is the only known exception to the monsters' immunity to black magic drawn from their own power (described by Lina as, "Hey, help me kill you"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}).

:{{Voiced by| [[Daisuke Gouri]]| Roger Kay &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 8-10)&lt;/small&gt; &amp; [[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]] &lt;small&gt;(Episodes 103-104)&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Lord of Nightmares===
{{Nihongo|The Lord of Nightmares|金色の魔王（ロード・オブ・ナイトメア）|Rōdo obu Naitomea/Konjiki no Maō}} is the [[demiurge]] of the ''Slayers'' universe, the creator of everything. Although she has no defined gender, she is generally considered female because she possessed Lina's body and took her form in her sole appearance in the series. Unlike most creator deities in fiction, the Lord of Nightmares is not considered benevolent and humans do not worship her. Even among those steeped in the magical arts, few are aware of her existence. Those of the monster race are, and refer to her as "the Mother of All Beings". Other names given to her include "Lord of Dreams that Terrify", "He Who Shines Like Gold upon the Sea of Chaos", "The Golden Lord", and "L-Sama".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The Lord of Nightmares created the entire ''Slayers'' [[multiverse]], including the futuristic galaxy portrayed in ''[[Lost Universe]]'', and two other known worlds, the realms of Chaotic Blue and Death Fog. Both Shabranigdo and his rival Ceiphied are her direct creations. The Lord of Nightmares may have done this simply because she wanted to watch gods, monsters, and mortals contend for her amusement, a hypothesis adopted by Valgaav in ''Slayers TRY'' in his attempt to remake the world. Another theory is that the Lord of Nightmares requires the chaos of battle for sustenance.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Lina is the only human known to directly use the power of the Lord of Nightmares in spells, and she is reluctant to do so. Spells that call upon the power of the Lord of Nightmares are notoriously unreliable, with failure frequently having devastating consequences. The Giga Slave, for instance, could theoretically destroy existence itself if miscast. Lina created the Giga Slave when she was much younger by combining parts of the Dragon Slave's incantation with chaos words of the Lord of Nightmares that she found in a Claire Bible manuscript. When she cast the spell for the first time, she turned a body of water into a sea of death, where no living thing can grow.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} To call upon the power of Chaos is to call upon the Lord of Nightmares herself, and she can withhold her power if she chooses; "My mind is my power, my power is my mind," she says in the ''Slayers NEXT'' finale.

The Lord of Nightmares's only direct appearance is in ''Slayers NEXT'', when Lina is goaded into casting the Giga Slave by Hellmaster Phibrizzo, who wants the power of Chaos to destroy the world. Before this point, the Lord of Nightmares had no physical form, having sacrificed her body to create the Sea of Chaos and the Four Worlds. Using Lina's body as a vessel, the power of Chaos obliterates Phibrizzo. She also makes good on Lina's final thoughts and wishes by reviving her companions and allowing them to see her. She declares that Lina is gone forever, consumed by her power, with Xellos explaining that when "existence calls forth oblivion, it must return to oblivion". The only thing that saves Lina's soul from the Sea of Chaos is Gourry's sacrifice of the Sword of Light.

The Lord of Nightmares does not intervene in the battle against Valgaav and Darkstar at the end of ''Slayers TRY'', since Lina doesn't cast the Giga Slave spell. Instead, the Slayers create a power very similar to that of Chaos by combining the powers of the monsters and the gods, Light and Dark, to destroy Valgaav and Darkstar.

===Ceiphied===
{{Nihongo|Ceiphied|スィーフィード|Suīfīdo}}, also known as {{Nihongo|Flare Dragon Ceiphied|赤の竜神（フレアドラゴン）スィーフィード|Furea Doragon Suīfīdo/Sekiryuushin Suified}}, is the dragonic counterpart to Shabranigdo in the ''Slayers'' universe.

In each world of this universe, a Dragon King and a Demon King struggle against each other to direct the fate of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the Red World, in which ''Slayers'' is set, Ceiphied is the Dragon King who battles the Demon King Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo. Ceiphied successfully weakens his demonic counterpart by cutting Shabranigdo into seven pieces. Ceiphied dies in the process, but leaves behind four beings to continue his struggle: Aqualord Ragradia, Flarelord Valbazard, Earthlord Rangort, and Airlord Valwyn. A fragment of his will is lodged in Luna Inverse, Lina's older sister, who is known as the "Ceiphied Knight".

===Darkstar Dugradigdo===
Darkstar Dugradigo is one of the four Demon Kings (or "Ma-oh") created by the Lord of Nightmares. He is the main antagonist of the [[Lost Universe|Black World]], and appears in ''Slayers TRY'' attempting to cross over into the Red World and cause further destruction. The gods of the Black World aim to destroy him using the five weapons he created: Gorun Nova (the Sword of Light), Ragudo Mezegis, Nezzard, Bodigar, and Galvayra.

In his own world, Darkstar is the equivalent of Shabranigdo in power, as Volphied is the equivalent of Ceiphied. Darkstar devours Volphied, but grows so powerful that he can't control his own power, and becomes a being seeking only the destruction of everything. However, Valgaav reveals that Darkstar "devoured" Volphied by mutual agreement between the two. They realized how meaningless the eternal fight between gods and monsters was, and fused to bring "purification" to the worlds by destroying and remaking them so that gods and monsters would not have to constantly fight.

Half monster and half god, the new Darkstar merges with Valgaav, who is the same combination. Darkstar's "astral body" is different from those of any other monster, making magic useless against him. Darkstar can only be defeated by the five weapons he created. When Filia and Xellos combine the powers of Light and Dark, of Ceiphied and Shabranigdo, and unleash it through the five weapons of Darkstar, the resulting Chaos force vanquishes him for good.

{{main article|Methaqualone}}
&lt;!-- The following list is of references to [[Methaqualone]] in popular culture. Entries should either refer to an article that includes sources for these references or include footnotes to reliable sources to demonstrate the notability and verify the reference to Methaqualone. --&gt;

'''Methaqualone''' is a [[sedative]]-[[hypnotic]] [[medication|drug]] similar in effect to [[barbiturate]]s, a general [[central nervous system|CNS]] [[depressant]]. Its use peaked in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[hypnotic]] for the treatment of [[insomnia]], and as a [[sedative]] and [[muscle relaxant]]. It has also been used illegally as a [[recreational drug]], commonly known as '''Quaaludes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ|lj|uː|d|z}} {{respell|KWAY|lewdz}}), particularly in the 1970s in North America, or as '''Mandrax''' (methaqualone 250&amp;nbsp;mg combined with [[diphenhydramine]] 25&amp;nbsp;mg).

==Books==
* In his memoir ''[[American Desperado]]'' (2011), [[Jon Roberts]] recalls how he provided Methaqualone to the women he wanted to have sex with.

* In [[Keith Richards]]' memoir, ''[[Life (book)|Life]]'' (2002), he tells of the speedboat he bought in 1971 while living on the [[French Riviera]] and recording ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' (1972). He named the boat ''Mandrax'', an anagram of its original name, saying: "It was irresistible to call it that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Richards, Keith &amp; Fox, James |title=Life|publisher= Little, Brown and Co. |date=2002|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The movie ''[[The Boost]]'' (1988) was based on [[Ben Stein]]'s novel ''[[Ben Stein#Bibliography|Ludes: A Ballad of the Drug &amp; the Dream]]'' (1982).
* Nick Talevski's ''Rock Obituaries - Knocking On Heaven's Door'' (2010) describes the toll that [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]]'s addiction to Quaaludes and his sister [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]]'s anorexia had on their health and careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Talevski, Nick|title=Rock Obituaries - Knocking on Heaven's Door|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=  2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=richard+carpenter+has+prescription+for+quaaludes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6yrWMHwrZT&amp;sig=oE_iljf_xrmuMFB2AapIwPz8UuI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ctECVJXOIo3NggTi_4GgAg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20carpenter%20has%20prescription%20for%20quaaludes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
* In the film '''''[[Jubilee (1977 film)|Jubilee]]'' (1977), [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]]'s''' character Amyl Nitrate, an "anti-historian", says it would be great if "all of history could be written on a Mandrax."
* In the film ''[[Studio 54]]'' (1984), owner [[Steve Rubell]] had 500 tablet bottles of Quaaludes stashed in his office and constantly eats them like candy. He also offers them to his young male employees to attempt to seduce them sexually. Quaalude were known on the streets as "the original [[date rape]] drug".
* In the [[Cheech and Chong]] movie ''[[Up In Smoke]]'' (1978), Quaaludes are mentioned in several places. While driving the "van made entirely out of marijuana", which the narcotic Sergeant Stadenko is pursuing, Cheech and Chong pick up two hitchhiking women. One of them, Jade East, offers Chong a 'lude. At [[The Roxy Theatre]], she gives Chong pills she believes are uppers, but which are actually Quaaludes, before he attempts to perform. Chong's stage persona during his band's performance is "Captain Quaalude"; he is dressed in tights, a shirt emblazoned with a huge Quaalude, and a cape. Chong's apparent overdose on Quaaludes causes him to fall all over the stage and his drums, until he is revived by marijuana smoke being drawn into the Roxy's ventilation system from the van burning in front of the club.
* In the film ''[[Modern Romance (film)|Modern Romance]]'' (1981), [[Albert Brooks]]' character uses Quaaludes to help cope with a break-up.
* In Cheech and Chong's ''[[Nice Dreams]]'' (1981), Cheech's ex-girlfriend Donna ([[Evelyn Guerrero]]) enters a Chinese restaurant to find Cheech and Chong seated together. Her speech is slurred from the Quaaludes that she acknowledges taking.
* In ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982), Jeff Spicoli ([[Sean Penn]]) states, "People on 'ludes should not drive", as he drives down the street in his friend's brother's car.
* In ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983), Tony accuses his wife of abusing Quaaludes, and at one point says: "Another Quaalude and she's gonna love me again".
* In ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983), a young girl named Alice asks Miriam ([[Catherine Deneuve]]) if she can give John ([[David Bowie]]) some Quaaludes to help him sleep.

* In the film [[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]] (1987), Joe Friday (played by Dan Aykroyd)'s badge number (714) was conspicuously the last shot in the opening credits. This was ostensibly a tribute to the original Joe Friday ([[Jack Webb]]) from the [[Dragnet (TV series)|eponymous 1951 TV series]]—who is the uncle of the film's Joe Friday—but actually is a reference to what had become an inside joke in popular culture, especially to users of "714's", the Methaqualone pill produced under the brand name of Quaalude." Friday's character inherited his namesake's badge number and the movie's main plot point is attempting to thwart the drug-dealing "P.A.G.A.N.S."

* The drug is referred to as 'ludes' in the [[Martin Scorsese]] picture, ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013). [[Jonah Hill]]'s character also finds some old stock of Lemmon and decides to use it with [[Jordan Belfort]] ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). Belfort takes too many pills in the mistaken belief they are no longer effective because they have expired, resulting in an extreme sedation that partially paralyzes him. He subsequently [[Drug-impaired driving|attempts to drive in this state]], resulting in him destroying his [[Lamborghini Countach]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5494">The Japanese word {{nihongo|'''mitama'''|御魂・御霊・神霊||honorable spirit}} refers to the spirit of a ''[[kami]]'' or the soul of a dead person.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of two characters, the first of which, {{nihongo|'''mi'''|御||honorable}}, is a simply an [[honorific]]. The second, {{nihongo|'''tama'''|魂・霊}}  means "spirit".  The character pair 神霊, also read ''mitama'', is used exclusively to refer to a ''kami's'' spirit.&lt;ref name="tama"&gt;{{EOS|Tama|1232|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, the term {{nihongo|''mitamashiro''|御魂代||mitama representative}} is a synonym of ''[[shintai]]'', the object which in a [[Shinto shrine]] houses the enshrined ''kami''.
Early Japanese definitions of the ''mitama'', developed later by many thinkers like [[Motoori Norinaga]], maintain it consists of several "souls", relatively independent one from the other.&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Smyers  | first = Karen Ann  | coauthors =   | title = The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship  | pages=118–119  | publisher = University of Hawaii Press  | year = 1999  | location = Honolulu  | isbn = 0-8248-2102-5  | oclc = 231775156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most developed is the {{nihongo|''ichirei shikon''|一霊四魂}}, a [[Shinto]] theory according to which the {{nihongo|spirit|霊魂|reikon}} of both ''kami'' and human beings consists of one spirit and four souls.&lt;ref name="ichirei"&gt;* {{EOS|Ichirei shikon|1181|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four souls are the {{nihongo|''ara-mitama''|荒御霊・荒御魂||rude soul}}, the {{nihongo|''nigi-mitama''|和御霊・和御魂||harmonious soul}}, the {{nihongo|''saki-mitama''|幸御魂||happy soul}} and the {{nihongo|''kushi-mitama''|奇御霊・奇御魂||wondrous soul}}. According to the theory, each of the souls making up the spirit has a character and a function of its own; they all exist at the same time, complementing each other.&lt;ref name="ichirei"/&gt; In the [[Nihon Shoki]], ''kami'' Ōnamuchi actually meets his ''kushi-mitama'' and ''shiki-mitama'', but does not even recognize them. The four seem moreover to have a different importance, and different thinkers have described their interaction differently.&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

==''Ara-mitama'' and ''nigi-mitama''==
[[File:Aramatsuri-no-miya 02.jpg|thumb|210 px|Ise Shrine's Aramatsuri-no-miya is said to enshrine [[Amaterasu]]'s ''ara-mitama'']]
The ''ara-mitama'' is the rough and violent side of a spirit.&lt;ref name=ara&gt;{{cite web|last=Yonei|first=Teruyoshi|title=Aramitama|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1180|work=Encyclopedia of  Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nigi&gt;{{cite web|last=Yonei|first=Teruyoshi|title=Nigimitama|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1470|work=Encyclopedia of  Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''kami's'' first appearance is as an ''ara-mitama'', which must be pacified with appropriate pacification rites and worship so that the ''nigi-mitama'' can appear.&lt;ref name="ara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nigi"/&gt; The ''nigi-mitama'' is the normal state of the ''kami'', its functional side, while the ''ara-mitama'' appears in times of war or natural disasters.
These two souls are usually considered opposites, and Motoori Norinaga believed the other two to be no more than aspects of the ''nigi-mitama''.&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt; ''Ara-mitama'' and ''nigi-mitama'' are in any case independent agents, so much so that they can sometimes be enshrined separately in different locations and different ''[[shintai]]''. For example, Sumiyoshi Shrine in [[Shimonoseki]] enshrines the ''ara-mitama'' of the Sumiyoshi ''kami'', while [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]] in Osaka enshrines its ''nigi-mitama''.&lt;ref name="ara"/&gt; Ise Shrine has a sub-shrine called Aramatsuri-no-miya enshrining [[Amaterasu]]'s ''ara-mitama''. [[Atsuta Shrine|Atsuta-jingū]] has a ''[[Setsumatsusha|sessha]]'' called Ichi-no-misaki Jinja for her ''ara-mitama''  and a ''[[Setsumatsusha|massha]]'' called Toosu-no-yashiro for her  ''nigi-mitama''. No separate enshrinement of the ''mitama'' of a ''kami'' has taken place since the rationalization and systematization of Shinto actuated by the [[Meiji restoration]].&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

==''Saki-mitama''==
This is the soul of blessing and prosperity. In a scene of the Nihon Shoki, ''kami'' Ōnamuchi is described in conversation with his own ''saki-mitama'' and ''kushi-mitama''. Within Shinto also exists the idea that this the soul which brings good harvests and catches. Motoori Norinaga and others however believe this to be no more than a function of the ''nigi-mitama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EOS|Sakimitama|1219|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Kushi-mitama''==
The "wondrous soul" which appears together with the ''saki-mitama'', the providing soul, which is the power behind the harvest. It is believed to have mysterious powers, to cause transformations and to be able to cure illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{EOS|Kushimitama|1207|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitama Festival==
{{Main|Mitama Matsuri}}
A widely celebrated [[Shinto]] festival to the dead in Japan, particularly at the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Typically in mid-July.

Q 205)]]

'''Nazi plunder''' refers to [[art theft]] and other items stolen as a result of the [[Art theft and looting during World War II|organized looting of European countries]] during the time of the [[Third Reich]] by agents acting on behalf of the ruling [[Nazi Party]] of [[Germany]]. Plundering occurred from 1933 until the end of [[World War II]], particularly by military units known as the [[Kunstschutz]], although most plunder was acquired during the war. In addition to [[gold]], [[silver]] and currency, cultural items of great significance were stolen, including paintings, ceramics, books, and religious treasures. Although most of these items were recovered by agents of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA, also known as the Monuments Men), on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] immediately following the war, many are still missing. There is an international effort underway to identify Nazi plunder that still remains unaccounted for, with the aim of ultimately returning the items to the rightful owners, their families or their respective countries.

==Background==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Le Canot, En Canot, Femme au Canot et a l'Ombrelle, Im Boot, approximate dimensions 150 x 116.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1913, ''[[En Canot|En Canot (Im Boot)]]'', oil on canvas, 146 x 114 cm (57.5 in × 44.9 in), exhibited at Moderni Umeni, [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|S.V.U. Mánes]], Prague, 1914, acquired in 1916 by [[Georg Muche]] at the Galerie [[Der Sturm]], confiscated by the Nazis circa 1936, displayed at the [[Degenerate Art]] show in Munich, and missing ever since]]
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Landschaft bei Paris, Paysage près de paris, Paysage de Courbevoie, oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover since 1937.jpg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1912, ''Landschaft bei Paris, Paysage près de Paris, Paysage de Courbevoie'', oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover since 1937]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] was an unsuccessful artist who was denied admission to the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]]. Nonetheless, he thought of himself as a connoisseur of the arts, and in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' he ferociously attacked modern art as degenerate, including [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], and [[Dadaism]], all of which he considered the product of a decadent twentieth century society. In 1933 when Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]], he enforced his aesthetic ideal on the nation. The types of art that were favored amongst the Nazi party were classical portraits and landscapes by [[Old Masters]], particularly those of Germanic origin. Modern art that did not match this was dubbed [[degenerate art]] by the Third Reich, and all that was found in Germany's state museums was to be sold or destroyed.&lt;ref name="BJParis"/&gt; With the sums raised, the Führer's objective was to establish the European Art Museum in [[Linz]]. Other Nazi dignitaries, like [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]] and Foreign Affairs minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|von Ribbentrop]], were also intent on taking advantage of German military conquests to increase their private art collections.&lt;ref name="BJParis"/&gt;

==Sale of art confiscated from German museums==
Art dealers [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Moeller and Bernhard Boehmer set up shop in Schloss Niederschonhausen, just outside Berlin, to sell a cache of near-16,000 paintings and sculptures which Hitler and Göring removed from the walls of German museums in 1937-38. They were first put on display in the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich on 19 July 1937, with the Nazi leaders inviting public mockery by two million visitors who came to view the condemned modern art in the ''[[Degenerate art]]'' exhibition. Propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] in a radio broadcast called Germany's degenerate artists "garbage". Hitler opened the Haus der Kunst exhibition with a speech. In it he described German art as suffering "a great and fatal illness".

==Public burning of art==
[[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] and his colleagues did not have much success with their sales, mainly because art labelled "rubbish" had small appeal. So on 20 March 1939 they set fire to 1,004 paintings and sculptures and 3,825 [[watercolours]], [[drawings]] and [[printmaking|prints]] in the courtyard of the Berlin Fire Department, an act of infamy similar to their earlier well-known [[book burning]]s. The propaganda act raised the attention they hoped. The Basel Museum in Switzerland arrived with 50,000 Swiss francs to spend.  Shocked art lovers came to buy. What is unknown after these sales is how many paintings were kept by Gurlitt, Buchholz, Moeller and Boehmer and sold by them to Switzerland and America - ships crossed the Atlantic from Lisbon - for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24812078|title=BBC News - The unfinished art business of World War Two|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Auctions and Private Sales in Switzerland ==
The most infamous auction of Nazi looted art was the "degenerate art' auction organized by [[Theodor Fischer (auctioneer)]] in Lucerne, Switzerland, 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National. The artworks on offer had been "de-accessioned" from German museums by the Nazis, yet many well known art dealers participated as well as proxies for major collectors and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2011/11/17/momas-problematic-provenances/|title=MoMA's Problematic Provenances|last=Cohan|first=William|date=November 17, 2011|website=Artnews|access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public auctions were only the visible tip of the iceberg, as many sales operated by art dealers were private.

==Nazi looting organizations==
[[File:Stempel einsatzstab rr.png|thumb|{{largethumb}}|Seal of the "[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]", used from 1941 to 1944 to mark seized documents by the German occupation troops]]

While the Nazis were in power, they plundered cultural property from every territory they occupied. This was conducted in a systematic manner with organizations specifically created to determine which public and private collections were most valuable to the Nazi Regime. Some of the objects were earmarked for Hitler's never realized [[Führermuseum]], some objects went to other high-ranking officials such as [[Hermann Göring]], while other objects were traded to fund Nazi activities.

In 1940, an organization known as the ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete]]'' (The [[Reichsleiter]] Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories), or ERR, was formed, headed for [[Alfred Rosenberg]] by [[:de:Gerhard Utikal|Gerhard Utikal]]. The first operating unit, the western branch for France, Belgium and the Netherlands, called the ''Dienststelle Westen'' (Western Agency), was located in Paris. The chief of this Dienststelle was [[:de:Kurt von Behr|Kurt von Behr]]. Its original purpose was to collect [[Jew]]ish and [[Freemasons|Freemasonic]] books and documents, either for destruction, or for removal to Germany for further "study". However, late in 1940, [[Hermann Göring]], who in fact controlled the ERR, issued an order that effectively changed the mission of the ERR, mandating it to seize "Jewish" art collections and other objects. The [[war loot]] had to be collected in a central place in Paris, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Museum Jeu de Paume]]. At this collection point worked [[art historian]]s and other personnel who inventoried the loot before sending it to Germany. Göring also commanded that the loot would first be divided between Hitler and himself. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] later ordered that all confiscated works of art were to be made directly available to him. From the end of 1940 to the end of 1942 Göring traveled twenty times to Paris. In the Museum Jeu de Paume, art dealer [[Bruno Lohse]] staged 20 expositions of the newly looted art objects, especially for Göring, from which Göring selected at least 594 pieces for his own collection.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"/&gt; Göring made Lohse his liaison-officer and installed him in the ERR in March 1941 as the deputy leader of this unit. Items which Hitler and Göring did not want were made available to other Nazi leaders. Under Rosenberg and Göring's leadership, the ERR seized 21,903 art objects from German-occupied countries.&lt;ref name="essentials"/&gt;

Other Nazi looting organizations included the [[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sonderauftrag Linz]], the organization run by the art historian [[Hans Posse]], which was particularly in charge of assembling the works for the [[Führermuseum]], the Dienststelle Mühlmann, operated by [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], which Göring also controlled{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and operated primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium, and a Sonderkommando Kuensberg connected to the minister of foreign affairs [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], which operated first in France, then in Russia and North Africa. In Western Europe, with the advancing German troops, were elements of the 'von Ribbentrop Battalion', named after [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. These men were responsible for entering private and institutional libraries in the occupied countries and removing any materials of interest to the Germans, especially items of scientific, technical or other informational value.&lt;ref name="dtic"/&gt;

Art collections from prominent Jewish families, including the [[Rothschilds]], the Rosenbergs, the Wildensteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/goering/dhm_goering.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=wildenstein&amp;suchen=Schnellsuche&amp;modus=rechts|title=DHM - Kunstsammlung Hermann Göring|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schloss Family were the targets of confiscations because of their significant value. Also Jewish art dealers sold art to German organizations - often under duress, e.g. the art dealerships of [[Jacques Goudstikker]], Benjamin and Nathan Katz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/summary_rc_190b.html|title=Summary RC 1.90B|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]]. Also non-Jewish art dealers sold art to the Germans, e.g. the art dealers De Boer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/ccp/dhm_ccp.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=de+boer&amp;suchen=Quick+search&amp;modus=folge|title=DHM: Datenbank zum Central Collecting Point München|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hoogendijk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/ccp/dhm_ccp.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=hoogendijk&amp;suchen=Schnellsuche&amp;modus=folge|title=DHM: Datenbank zum Central Collecting Point München|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Netherlands.

By the end of the war, the Third Reich amassed hundreds of thousands of cultural objects.

==Art Looting Investigation Unit==
On November 21, 1944, at the request of [[Owen Roberts]], [[William J. Donovan]] created the Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) within the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] to collect information on the looting, confiscation and transfer of cultural objects by [[Nazi Germany]], its allies and the various individuals and organizations involved; to prosecute war criminals and to restitute property.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DFS|title=The OSS and the Search for Looted Art|url=http://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumer/holocaust/history_art_looting_restitution/allies_oss.htm|website=New York State Department of Financial Services|publisher=New York State DFS|accessdate=10 May 2017|ref=http://www.dfs.ny.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALIU compiled information on individuals believed to have participated in art looting, identifying a group of key suspects for capture and interrogation about their roles in carrying out Nazi policy. Interviews were conducted in Bad Aussee, Austria.

Consolidated Interrogations Reports (CIRs), and a "Red Flag list" of people involved in Nazi spoilation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The ALIU Reports form one of the key records in the US Government Archives of Nazi Era Assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Series Descriptions|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/art/key-series-descriptions|website=www.archives.gov|publisher=US Government Office of Strategic Services|accessdate=20 May 2017|ref=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/art/key-series-descriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detailed Intelligence Reports (DIR)'''
The first group of reports detailing the networks and relations between  art dealers and other agents employed by Hitler, Göring and Rosenberg are organized by name: [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], [[Ernst Buchner (curator)|Ernst Buchner]], [[Gustav Rochlitz]], Gunter Schiedlausky, [[Bruno Lohse]], Gisela Limberger, [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]], Karl Kress, Walter Bornheim, Hermann Voss and [[Karl Haberstock]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Consolidated Interrogation Reports (CIR)'''
A second set of reports detail the art looting activities of Göring (The Goering Collection), the art looting activities of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), and Hitler's Linz Museum.

'''ALIU List of Red Flag Names'''

The Art Looting Intelligence Unit published a list of "Red Flag Names", organizing them by country: Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and Luxembourg. Each name is followed by a description of the person's activities, their relations with other people in the spoliation network and, in many cases, information concerning their arrest or imprisonment by Allied forces.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Soviet Union==
To investigate and estimate Nazi plunder in the [[USSR]] during 1941 through 1945, the [[Extraordinary State Commission|Soviet State Extraordinary Commission for Ascertaining and Investigating the Crimes Committed by the German-Fascist Invaders and Their Accomplices]] was formed on 2 November 1942. During the [[Great Patriotic War]] and afterwards, until 1991, the Commission collected materials on Nazi crimes in the USSR, including incidents of plunder. Immediately following the war, the Commission outlined damage in detail to sixty-four of the most valuable Soviet museums, out of 427 damaged ones. In the [[Russian SFSR]], 173 museums were found to have been plundered by the Nazis, with looted items numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]], the [[Government of the Russian Federation]] formed the State Commission for the Restitution of Cultural Valuables to replace the Soviet Commission. Experts from this Russian institution originally consulted the work of the Soviet Commission, yet continue to catalogue artworks lost during the war museum by museum. {{As of|2008}}, lost artworks of 14 museums and the libraries of [[Voronezh Oblast]], [[Kursk Oblast]], [[Pskov Oblast]], [[Rostov Oblast]], [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Northern Caucasus]], [[Gatchina]], [[Peterhof Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]] (Pushkin), [[Novgorod]] and [[Novgorod Oblast]], as well as the bodies of the Russian State Archives and [[CPSU]] Archives, were catalogued in 15 volumes, all of which were made available online. They contain detailed information on 1,148,908 items of lost artworks. The total number of lost items is unknown so far, because cataloguing work for other damaged Russian museums is ongoing.&lt;ref name="lostart"/&gt;

Alfred Rosenberg commanded the so-called Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg [ERR] für die Besetzten Gebiete, which was responsible for collecting art, books, and cultural objects from invaded countries, and also transferred their captured library collections back to Berlin during the retreat from Russia. "In their search for 'research materials' ERR teams and the Wehrmacht visited 375 archival institutions, 402 museums, 531 institutes, and 957 libraries in Eastern Europe alone".&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt; The ERR also operated in the early days of the blitzkrieg of the Low Countries. This caused some confusion about authority, priority, and the chain of command among the German Army, the von Rippentropp Battalion and the Gestapo, and as a result of personal looting among the Army officers and troops. These ERR teams were, however, very effective. One account estimates that from the Soviet Union alone: "one hundred thousand geographical maps were taken on ideological grounds, for academic research, as means for political, geographical and economic information on Soviet cities and regions, or as collector's items".&lt;ref name=Hadden/&gt;

==Poland==
{{main|Nazi plunder in Poland}}
[[File:Aleksander Gierymski, Żydówka z pomarańczami.jpg|thumb|[[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''[[Jewess with Oranges]]'' discovered on 26 November 2010 in an art auction in [[Buxtehude]], Germany]]

After the occupation of Poland by German forces in September 1939, the Nazi regime [[Polish culture during World War II|attempted to exterminate its upper classes as well as its culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; Thousands of art objects were looted, as the Nazis systematically carried out a plan of looting prepared even before the start of hostilities. 25 museums and many other facilities were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The total cost of German Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 20 billion dollars, or an estimated 43% of Polish [[cultural heritage]]; over 516,000 individual art pieces were looted, including 2,800 paintings by European painters; 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps; 90,000 books, including over 20,000 printed before 1800; and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value. Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II. For decades there have been mostly futile negotiations between Poland and Germany concerning the return of the looted property.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

==Führermuseum==
{{main|Führermuseum}}

After Hitler became Chancellor, he made plans to transform his home city of [[Linz, Austria]] into the Third Reich's capital city for the arts. Hitler hired architects to work from his own designs to build several galleries and museums, which would collectively be known as the [[Führermuseum]]. Hitler wanted to fill his museum with the greatest art treasures in the world, and believed that most of the world's finest art belonged to Germany after having been looted during the Napoleonic and First World wars.

==Hermann Göring collection==
The [[Hermann Göring]] collection, a personal collection of [[Reichsmarschall]] Hermann Göring, was another large collection including confiscated property, consisted of approximately 50 percent of works of art confiscated from the enemies of the Reich.&lt;ref name="rothfeldtheus"/&gt; Assembled in large measure by art dealer [[Bruno Lohse]], Göring's adviser and ERR representative in Paris, in 1945 the collection included over 2,000 individual pieces including more than 300 paintings. The [[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]'s Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 2 states that Göring never crudely looted, instead he always managed "to find a way of giving at least the appearance of honesty, by a token payment or promise thereof to the confiscation authorities. Although he and his agents never had an official connection with the German confiscation organizations, they nevertheless used them to the fullest extent possible."&lt;ref name=rothfeldtheus/&gt;

==Nazi storage of looted objects==

The Third Reich amassed hundreds of thousands of objects from occupied nations and stored them in several key locations, such as [[Musée Jeu de Paume]] in Paris and the Nazi headquarters in [[Munich]]. As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] gained advantage in the war and bombed Germany's cities and historic institutions, Germany "began storing the artworks in salt mines and caves for protection from Allied bombing raids. These mines and caves offered the appropriate humidity and temperature conditions for artworks."&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; Well known repositories of this kind were mines in [[Merkers]], [[Altaussee]] and [[Siegen]]. These mines were not only used for the storage of looted art but also of art that had been in Germany and Austria before the beginning of the Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durchblick-siegen.de/themes/ds/pdf/01_05/seite12.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Degenerate art]] was legally banned by the Nazis from entering Germany, and so ones designated were held in what was called the Martyr's Room at the Jeu de Paume. Much of Paul Rosenberg's professional dealership and personal collection were so subsequently designated by the Nazis. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] earlier private decree to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a series of ERR approved dealers to liquidate these assets and then pass the funds to swell his personal art collection, including [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. With the looted degenerate art sold onwards via [[Switzerland]], Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe. Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Picasso watercolor ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/|title=Bonjour Paris - The Lost Museum|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war recovery effort==

===Immediate aftermath===
The Allies created special commissions, such as the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to formerly [[Nazi-occupied territories]] to find Nazi art repositories. In 1944 and 1945 one of the greatest challenges for the "Monuments Men" was to keep Allied forces from plundering and "taking artworks and sending them home to friends and family"; When "off-limits" warning signs failed to protect the artworks the "Monuments Men" started to mark the storage places with white tape, which was used by Allied troops as a warning sign for unexploded mines.&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; They recovered thousands of objects, many of which were pillaged by the Nazis.

The Allies found these artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II. In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program#Restitutions|Wiesbaden Collection Point]] included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artefacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and Nazi-looted, Polish, [[liturgical]] collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects including paintings and sculptures, mainly to keep them away from the Soviet Army and wartime reparations.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt;

The Allies collected the artworks and stored them in collecting points, in particular the [[Central Collection Point in Munich]] until they could be returned. The identifiable works of art, that had been acquired by the Germans during the Nazi rule, were returned to the countries from which they were taken. It was up to the governments of each nation if and under which circumstances they would return the objects to the original owners.&lt;ref name="for the Netherlands Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/woordenboek.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211224449/http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/woordenboek.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Munich collection point was closed, the owners of many of the objects had not been found. Nations were also unable to find all of the owners or to verify that they were dead. There are many organizations put in place to help return the stolen items taken from the Jewish people. For example: Project Heart, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and The Claims Conference. Depending on the circumstances these organizations may receive the art works in lieu of the heirs.

===Later developments===
[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' was looted by the Germans from the [[Czartoryski Museum]] in 1939. Although Polish officials state that it has been known "for years" that the painting survived the war,&lt;ref name="Rafael"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/msz_w_mediach/msz__nie_mamy_informacji__gdzie_jest__portret_mlodzienca__rafaela__depesza_pap_01_08_2012 |title=MSZ: nie mamy informacji, gdzie jest "Portret młodzieńca" Rafaela, depesza PAP 01.08.2012 |publisher=[[Polish Press Agency]] |work=MSZ in the Media |accessdate=2 February 2014 |author=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland]] |language=Polish |trans-title=Communiqué of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: we have no new information about the painting |quote=[Rafael's "Portrait of a Young Man" was not destroyed, as has been known[…]for years]}}&lt;/ref&gt; its whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;ref name="Rafael" /&gt; ]]

Although most of the stolen artworks and antiques were documented, found or recovered "by the victorious Allied armies ... principally hidden away in salt mines, tunnels, and secluded castles",&lt;ref name="nuremberg"/&gt; many artworks have never been returned to their rightful owners. [[Art dealer]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[museum]]s worldwide have been compelled to research their collection's [[provenance]] in order to investigate claims that some of the work was acquired after it had been stolen from its original owners.&lt;ref name="looting"/&gt; Already in 1985, years before American museums recognized the issue and before the international conference on Nazi-looted assets of [[Holocaust]] victims, European countries released inventory lists of works of art, coins and medals "that were confiscated from Jews by the Nazis during World War II, and announced the details of a process for returning the works to their owners and rightful heirs."&lt;ref name="december"/&gt; In 1998 an [[Austria]]n advisory panel recommended the return of 6,292 [[objets d'art]] to their legal owners (most of whom are [[Jew]]s), under the terms of a 1998 restitution law.&lt;ref name="austria"/&gt;
[[Nazi concentration camp]] and [[death camp]] victims had to strip completely before their murder, and all their personal belongings were stolen. The very valuable items such as [[gold coin]]s, [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s, [[spectacles]], [[jewellry]] and other [[precious metal]] items were sent to the [[Reichsbank]] for conversion to [[bullion]]. The value was then credited to [[SS]] accounts.

Pieces of art looted by the Nazis can still be found in Russian/Soviet&lt;ref name="reported"/&gt; and American institutions: the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] revealed a list of 393 paintings that have gaps in their provenance during the Nazi Era, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] has posted a listing of more than 500 works "for which links in the chain of ownership for the years 1933–1945 are still unclear or not yet fully determined." The [[San Diego Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="sdmart"/&gt; and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="lacma"/&gt; provide lists on the internet to determine if art items within their collection were stolen by the Nazis.

[[Stuart Eizenstat]], the Under Secretary of State and head of the U.S. delegation sponsoring the 1998 international conference on Nazi-looted assets of Holocaust victims in Washington conference stated that "From now on, ... the sale, purchase, exchange and display of art from this period will be addressed with greater sensitivity and a higher international standard of responsibility."&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; The conference was attended by more than forty countries and thirteen different private entities, and the goal was to come to a federal consensus on how to handle Nazi-Era Looted Art. The conference was built on the foundation of the Nazi Gold Conference held in London in 1997. The U.S. Department of State hosted the conference with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum from November 30 to December 3, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM|title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets|website=fcit.usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Egon Schiele 069.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Portrait of Wally]]'' by [[Egon Schiele]] (1912)]]
After the conference the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]] developed guidelines which require museums to review the provenance or history of their collections, focusing especially on art looted by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="cnn2"/&gt; The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington identified more than 400 European paintings with gaps in their provenance during World War II era.&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt; One particular piece of art, "Still Life with Fruit and Game" by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Frans Snyders]], was sold by [[Karl Haberstock]], whom the [[World Jewish Congress]] describes as "one of the most notorious Nazi art dealers."&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt; In 2000 the New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] still told Congress that they were "not aware of a single Nazi-tainted work of art in our collection, of the more than 100,000" they held.&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;

In 1979 two paintings, a Renoir, Tête de jeune fille, and a Pissarro, Rue de village, appeared on Interpol's "12 Most Wanted List," but to date no one knows their whereabouts (ATA Newsletter, Nov. '79, vol. 1, no. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;1. '78, 326.1-2) The New Jersey owner has asked IFAR to republish information about the theft, with the hope that someone will recognize the paintings.  The owner wrote IFAR that when his parents emigrated from Berlin in 1938, two of their paintings "mysteriously disappeared."  All of their other possessions were shipped from Germany to the U.S. via the Netherlands, and everything except the box containing these two paintings arrived intact.  After World War II the owner's father made a considerable effort to locate the paintings, but was unsuccessful.  Over the years numerous efforts have been made to recover them, articles have been published, and an advertisement appeared in the German magazine, Die Weltkunst, May 15, 1959.  A considerable reward has been offered, subject to usual conditions, but there has been no response.  Anyone with information about these two paintings is asked to contact IFAR.

However, restitution efforts initiated by German politicians have not been free of controversy, either. As the German law for restitution ''applies to "cultural assets lost as a result of Nazi persecution, "which includes paintings that Jews who emigrated from Germany sold to support themselves'',&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; pretty much any trade involving Jews in that era is affected, and the benefit of the doubt is given to claimants. German leftist politicians [[Klaus Wowereit]] (SPD, mayor of [[Berlin]]) and [[Thomas Flierl]] ([[Linkspartei]]) were sued in 2006 for being overly willing to give away the 1913 painting ''[[:File:Kirchner Berlin Street Scene 1913.jpg|Berliner Straßenszene]]'' of expressionist [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], which was in Berlin's [[Brücke Museum]]. On display in Cologne in 1937, it had been sold for 3,000 [[Reichsmark]] by a Jewish family residing in Switzerland to a German collector. This sum is considered by experts to have been well over the market price.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt; The museum, which obtained the painting in 1980 after several ownership changes, could not prove that the family actually received the money. It was restituted&lt;ref name="spiegel2"/&gt; to the heiress of the former owners, and she had it auctioned off for $38.1 Million.&lt;ref name="spiegel3"/&gt;

In 2010, as work began to extend an [[Rapid transit|underground line]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] through the historic city centre to the [[Brandenburg Gate]], a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the "Rote Rathaus". These included, for example, the [[bronze]] [[cubist]] style statue of a female dancer by the artist [[Marg Moll]], and are now on display at the [[Neues Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickley |first=Catherine |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-08/-degenerate-sculptures-unearthed-from-bomb-rubble-put-on-show-in-berlin.html |title='Degenerate' Art Unearthed From Berlin Bomb Rubble |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1946-09-27 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/11/09/2010-11-09_rescued_prewwii_degenerate_art_on_display_in_the_neues_museum_in_berlin.html |title=Rescued pre-WWII 'degenerate art' on display in the Neues Museum in Berlin |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date= November 9, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10 |first=Rosemary |last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,727971,00.html| title=Nazi Degenerate Art Rediscovered in Berlin| date=2010-11-08| work=Der Spiegel | author=Charles Hawley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 up to 2015 a committee researched the collection of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal family]]. The committee focussed on all objects acquired by the family since 1933 and which were made prior to 1945. In total 1300 artworks were studied. Dutch musea had already researched their collection in order to find objects stolen by the Nazis. It appeared that one painting of the forest near [[Huis ten Bosch]] by the Dutch painter [[Joris van der Haagen]] came from a Jewish collector. He was forced to hand the painting over to the former Jewish bank [[Lippmann, Rosenthal &amp; Co.|Lippmann, Rosenthal &amp; Co]] in Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4022041/koninklijk-huis-bezit-nazis-geroofd-schilderij.html|title = Koninklijk huis bezit door nazi's geroofd schilderij|date = 31 March 2015|accessdate = 2 April 2015|website = |publisher = nu.nl|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which collected money and other possessions of the Jews in Amsterdam. The painting was bought by [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana]] in 1960. The family plans to return the painting to the heirs of the owner in 1942, a Jewish collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Koninklijke familie bezit roofkunstwerk|url = http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/03/31/koninklijke-familie-bezit-roofkunstwerk/|accessdate = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Nazi looting today==
Approximately 20% of the art in Europe was looted by the Nazis, and there are well over 100,000 items that have not been returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt; The majority of what is still missing includes everyday objects such as china, crystal or silver.

Some objects of great cultural significance remain missing, though how much has yet to be determined. This is a major issue for the [[art sale|art market]], since legitimate organizations do not want to deal in objects with unclear ownership titles. Since the mid-1990s, after several books, magazines, and newspapers began exposing the subject to the general public, many dealers, auction houses and museums have grown more careful about checking the provenance of objects that are available for purchase in case they are looted. Some museums in the United States and elsewhere have agreed to check the provenance of works in their collections with the implied promise that suspect works would be returned to rightful owners if the evidence so dictates. But the process is time-consuming and slow, and very few disputed works have been found in public collections.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In the 1990s and 2000s, information has become more accessible due to political and economic changes as well as advances in technology. Privacy laws in some countries have expired so records that were once difficult to obtain are now open to the public. Information from former Soviet countries that was previously unobtainable is now available, and many organisations have posted information online, making it widely accessible.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In addition to the role of courts in determining restitution or compensation, some states have created official bodies for the consideration and resolution of claims. In the United Kingdom, the [[Spoliation Advisory Panel]] advises the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] on such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/cultural_property/3296.aspx/|title=Maintaining world-leading national museums and galleries, and supporting the museum sector|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Foundation for Art Research]] (IFAR), a not-for-profit educational and research organization, has helped provide information leading to restitution.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2013 the Canadian government created the Holocaust-era Provenance Research and Best-Practice Guidelines Project, through which they are investigating the holdings of six art galleries in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rollason|first=Kevin|title=Art Sleuths on Nazi Trail|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/art-sleuths-on-nazi-trail-244172801.html|accessdate=February 23, 2014|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 International Archives for the Women's Movement discovery===
{{main|International Archives for the Women's Movement}}
On 14 January 1992, historian Marc Jansen reported in an article in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' that archival collections stolen from the Netherlands including the records of the International Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}), which had been looted in 1940, had been found in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everard|first1=Myriam|last2=Bosch|first2=Mineke|editor-last1=Bosch|editor-first1=Mineke|chapter=Feminisme als oorlogstrofee: De vooroorlogse IAV-archieven in Moskou|title=Feminisme en Verbeelding Jaarboek voor Vrouwengeschiedenis|url=https://www.academia.edu/30315885/Feminisme_als_oorlogstrofee._De_vooroorlogse_IAV-archieven_in_Moskou|date=1994|volume=14|trans-title=Feminism as a war trophy: The pre-war IAV archives in Moscow|publisher=Stichting beheer IISG|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|isbn=978-90-6861-096-3|pages=193–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin and later was moved to [[Sudetenland]] for security reasons. At the end of the war, the [[Red Army]] took the documents from [[Prague Offensive|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]] and in 1945-46, stored them in the [[KGB]]'s {{ill|Osobyi Archive|de|Sonderarchiv Moskau}} ({{lang-ru|Особый архив}}), meaning special archive, which was housed in [[Moscow]]. Though agreements were drafted almost immediately after the discovery, bureaucratic delays kept the archives from being returned for eleven years. In 2003, the partial recovery of the papers of some of the most noted feminists in the pre-war period, including [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Rosa Manus]], some 4,650 books and periodicals, records of the [[International Council of Women]] and [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], among many photographs were returned.

In January 2014, researcher Dominik Radlmaier of the city of Nuremberg announced that eight objects had been identified as lost art with a further eleven being under strong suspicion.

=== 2015 Walbrzych, Poland rumored armored train ===
In Walbrzych, Poland two amateur explorers — Piotr Koper and Andreas Richter — claim to have found a rumored armored train that is believed to be filled with gold, gems and weapons. The train was rumored to be sealed in a tunnel in the closing days of World War II before the collapse of The Third Reich. Only 10% of the tunnel has been explored because much of the tunnel has collapsed. Finding the train will be an expensive and complicated operation involving a lot of funding, digging, and drilling. However, to support their claims the explorers said experts have examined the site with ground-penetrating, thermal and magnetic sensors that picked up signs of a railway tunnel with metal tracks. The legitimacy of these claims has yet to be determined, yet the explorers are requesting 10% of the value of whatever is within the train if their findings are correct. Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said he was "99 percent convinced" that the train had finally been found but scientists claim that the explorers' findings are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hopes Dashed Again in Hunt for Fabled Nazi Gold Train in Poland|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/world/europe/hopes-dashed-again-in-hunt-for-fabled-nazi-gold-train-in-poland.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-12-15|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Joanna|last = Berendt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nazi gold train: 'No evidence' of discovery in Poland - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35104117|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-16|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Cinema''''' (also called '''''On Cinema at the Cinema''''' for the video series) is an [[United States|American]] comedic film review [[podcast]] and [[web series]] starring [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Gregg Turkington]]. The duo appear as a pair of hapless movie reviewers (using their own names). The show started as an independently released [[podcast]] from 2011 to 2013, before being picked up as a professionally produced web video series by [[Thing X]] in 2012–13 for its first two seasons, and then moving to [[Adult Swim.com]] in 2013. It has aired 10 seasons, plus one special
season titled "The Trial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/11/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-your-new-siskel-ebert/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Your New Siskel &amp; Ebert |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''On Cinema'' spawned a spinoff web series in its fifth season, ''[[Decker (series)|Decker]],'' a simultaneous spoof of political-thrillers and homebrew video intended for the web. It later became a [[TV series]], and as of 2018, it has aired 6 seasons of episodes total on Adultswim.com and [[Adult Swim]].

Heidecker and Turkington began making the podcast as a prank and a mockery of the "self-indulgence" of the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/01/25/faux-movie-review-web-series-cinema-cinema-develops-real-future/ |title=Faux movie-review web series 'On Cinema at the Cinema' develops a real future |publisher=Dailycal.org |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Heidecker and Turkington have created an immersive universe through ''On Cinema'' and ''Decker.'' A live [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] special is also done every year, streamed via [[YouTube]], with interactive elements for fans, such as polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2014/02/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-doing-a-live-oscars-special/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Doing a Live Oscars Special |publisher=Splitsider |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several seasons of ''On Cinema'' have discernible multi-episode plot arcs as Heidecker and Turkington explore the dynamic and characters they have created both in the series' episodes and, simultaneously, on social media, through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="mocktrial"&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker is putting himself on trial for murder right now as part of On Cinema's latest absurd twist"|url=https://www.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-is-putting-himself-on-trial-for-murder-ri-1820494473|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=15 November 2017|author=William Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who play along with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads". Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where they appear in character and interact with fans.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|title="'Decker,' 'On Cinema' and the various, intertwined universes of comedian Tim Heidecker"|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-tim-heidecker-20170609-story.html|publisher=''[[The L.A. Times]]''|date=9 June 2017|author=Robert Llyod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Summer of 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe and special content.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-taking-on-cinema-1826240596 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington are taking On Cinema At The Cinema to cinemas |last=Barsanti |first=Sam |website=''[[The A.V.

==Premise==
Early audio episodes of ''On Cinema'' were quite short, frequently no more than one or two minutes long. Heidecker and Turkington would "review" films on these podcasts without actually providing any meaningful information or critical insight. Nearly every film that has been discussed or mentioned on ''On Cinema'' since the podcast's inception has received a "5 bags of popcorn" rating on a scale of five from the two reviewers, regardless of its reception elsewhere in the press or with the viewing public.

With the series' growth into an online video series, episodes grew to an average length of eight to twelve minutes. Although reviewing films remains a central conceit, the focus of the series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on ''On Cinema'', frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and [[Conservatism in the United States|right-wing political views]], or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's character fancies himself a "film expert," his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on [[VHS]]. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight. Recent seasons as of 2018 have seen Tim lose interest in reviewing and start a band first named ''Dekkar'' then ''DKR'' .

Guest appearances  have included [[Jordan Hoffman]], [[Jimmy McNichol]], [[Joe Estevez]], [[Lawrence Turman]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Mark Proksch]], [[John Aprea]], [[Peyton Reed]], and [[Nicholas Meyer]], some of whom also appear in the ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]'' series.

==Series overview==

{{see also|List of Decker episodes}}
{{:List of On Cinema episodes}}

===Podcast===
The ''On Cinema'' podcast was produced independently by Tim and Gregg. The podcast consists of Tim, along with Gregg as a "special guest" for every episode, covering movies poorly and with little insight, and often engaging in arguments. Gregg later developed a more pretentious "film buff" persona, and Tim took a turn to being obnoxiously political, sometimes devoting entire episodes to conspiracy theories, much to the chagrin of Gregg.

Another running joke that was carried over to the video series is Gregg's refusal to believe that ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is really "Star Trek II," instead often believing stubbornly that ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' is the real Star Trek II.

===Season 1===
Starting this season, the show is now in video format via [[Thing X]].com, as well as having its name changed to ''On Cinema at the Cinema''. The series is similar to the podcast, but this time episodes always take place on a set meant to look like a movie theatre. Gregg is still never acknowledged as more than a guest each episode, and starts his weekly segments "Popcorn Classics" and "On Cinema On Location" where he brings in obscure, forgotten VHS movies to showcase and travels to filming locations of obscure movies, respectively. Tim begins using "60 second soap box" to talk about current political issues with a conservative narrative, much to the continued annoyance of Gregg. With the start of the web series, Tim uses a rating scale of "bags of popcorn" ranging from 0–5, and while Gregg uses five as a max, Tim often goes overboard giving scores of "6 bags" or even more, creating tension and confusion throughout the season. Most of the films reviewed get a score of at least "5 bags" from both reviewers.

===Season 2===
Tim reveals he has [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] in his brain but does not want to get surgery because of "side effects, the whole medical industry, and [[Obamacare]]" while Gregg pushes for him to get surgery. In episode 208, Tim introduces the first special guest, Ayaka, a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with Tim's family.

The first Live On Cinema Oscar Special airs, where Tim and Gregg live stream during the [[Oscars]] and drink alcohol. Tim gets very drunk and throws up on some of Gregg's VHS tapes which causes Gregg to walk off the set.

===Season 3===
Season 3 moved the series from [[Thing X]] to [[Adultswim.com]]. The season begins with Tim in a head bandage and clearly in physical pain as he went through with surgery for his blood clots. As a result of him going through the surgery, Tim's wife divorces him and this is the last time his family is referred to throughout the series. Gregg begins his goal of making the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' by becoming the first person in history to watch 500 movies in 500 days. Tim kicks Gregg off the show after Gregg drives all the way from [[Hollywood]] to [[San Francisco]] to make a video alleging the location of a ''[[Star Trek]]'' filming location, after he and Tim had disagreed on it before. [[John Aprea]] and Ayaka are guests on the next episode, where Tim reveals he is dating Ayaka and says he loves her for the first time. In the season finale, Gregg returns to the show as Ayaka was deported back to Japan.

===Season 4===
Tim begins season four with many health problems and introduces his personal doctor, Dr. San (played by [[Zac Holtzman]]), an alternative medical doctor treating Tim with [[acupuncture]], [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] and other "natural" medicines. Dr. San begins coming onto the set with Tim, despite Gregg's objections. However, Tim's face becomes infected from the acupuncture and he denounces Dr. San.

Ayaka sends a letter to Tim on the show saying she is pregnant with Tim's child.

The second Live Oscar Special, Tim and Gregg drink (with Tim getting much drunker than Gregg). We are introduced to [[Mark Proksch]] who does impersonations of [[W.C. Fields]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

===Season 5===
Tim moves to [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]] and buys a motorcycle to commute back and forth between there and Hollywood for the On Cinema taping.

Tim announces that Ayaka has had an [[abortion]], despite remaining [[pro-life]] on the topic, saying "when you are in that situation, choices have to be on the table." However, Gregg brings Ayaka onto On Cinema via [[Skype]] from Japan, revealing she did go through with the pregnancy and naming the boy Tom Cruise Heidecker Junior, after the actor [[Tom Cruise]]. Ayaka moves back to America with Tom Cruise Junior and into Gregg's apartment. This upsets Tim and he moves permanently to Jackson Hole. He makes Gregg host of the show and hands off all responsibilities to him in the season finale.

===Season 6===
Gregg begins his first season as host, but after he is unable to find a guest, he records himself having conversations with himself and plays VHS video of his conversation during the episode.

Tim returns as host in episode 602 after he realized his new friends in Jackson Hole were [[white supremacists]]. He rekindles his relationship with Ayaka and moves into Gregg's apartment with her and Tom Cruise Junior. In the season finale, Tim proposes to Ayaka and she accepts.

The third Live Oscar Special airs, while Tim and Gregg get drunk and Tim, once again, gets much drunker than Gregg and becomes belligerent. [[Peyton Reed]] comes on the Special to promote his new film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and announces that Gregg has been cast as a minor character in the movie, which upsets Tim. In the finale segment, Gregg introduces [[James Dean]], the former actor who was believed to be dead since 1955. After reading on a message board about how Dean faked his own death and wrote a memoir called "I'm Alive: How I Faked my own Death" he brings Dean on set as his return to the public. Tim does not believe this is the real James Dean, leading to him verbally and physically threatening Dean before trashing the set.

===Season 7===
Gregg moves to [[Victorville, California]] and opens the Victorville Film Archives in a storage locker, where he also lives.

Tim gives ''Ant-Man'' a rare one-bag of popcorn which upsets Gregg, leading to him accusing Tim of paying $15,000 to have a minor role in the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' movie, which Tim denies.

After meeting a man at [[Guitar Center]] named Axiom, Tim starts a rock band named "Dekkar" with him. Their debut single Empty Bottle is released on the show, which upsets Gregg as it is not movie related and was played instead of his Popcorn Classic segment.

Gregg tells Tim that Dr. San, who Tim has been looking for since he infected Tim's face with dirty needles in acupuncture in season four, is Ayaka's boss at her job. Tim walks off the set angry that he had not realized this. However, the next episode is "The Doctor San Forgiveness Special" where both Tim and Dr. San forgive each other. Dr. San takes over as Tom Cruise Junior's new [[Pediatrics|pediatric doctor]].

By the season seven finale, Tim announces that Tom Cruise Junior has died. He plays a musical tribute to his son with Axiom and Dr. San.

The fourth Live Oscar Special is the biggest one yet, with periodic musical performances by Dekkar (much to the annoyance of Gregg), the "Oscar Olympics" featuring three games, officiated by [[Joe Estevez]], and a DNA test by Dr. San of James Dean, which proves that he is in fact, James Dean. Tim hides the fact he has been drinking alcohol during the Special while no one else is, and he becomes angered by the DNA results. He proceeds to kick Dr. San off the set. An animated rendering of Tom Cruise Junior as a young adult comes on stage, in which Tim and the animated Tom Cruise Junior come out [[Anti-vaccination|against vaccination]].

===Season 8===
Season eight moves the show to Victorville, where Tim has now moved into the storage unit with Gregg. They both buy an abandoned [[movie theater]] and open it as the "Victorville Film Center" where instead of playing new releases, a nightly showing from Gregg's VHS collection of Popcorn Classics is played. Attendance is minimal because of the obscurity of the films. Mark Proksch is hired as a concessions cashier.

Dr. San prescribes Tim a "nutritional vape system" in which Tim replaces all meals and food with an [[electronic cigarette]] full of supposed nutrients. However, Tim's physical condition worsens as the season progresses, as he comes to the set sweating, bruised, hallucinating, and unfocused. Despite this, he continues to use his nutritional vape system. After he cannot take the physical pain and symptoms of the vape system, Tim goes to an actual doctor who informs him the vape and his blood is full of [[Lsd]], [[cocaine]], and multiple other drugs – both legal and illegal. Tim quits the vape system and swears off Dr. San once again. Tim announces that Ayaka is pregnant with their second child. After Tim tries to get Ayaka to get an abortion, she leaves him and moves back to Japan. Tim begins a romantic relationship with Axiom's sister, Juliana.

A fire is started in the storage unit after Tim's vape pen overheats one night, burning the entire facility down including the Victorville Film Archive. Tim suffers [[third degree burn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on all of his body, including his face and hands. After insurance will not cover the cost of the fire, he returns to the show in bandages so he can keep working to pay for the damages and lawsuits, which exceed $1,000,000 according to Gregg.

However, in Tim's return to On Cinema, he is surprised by an intervention by Gregg, Joe Estevez, John Aprea, Mark Proksch, Ayaka, Ayaka's father, and Axiom. They encourage Tim to live a healthier life, which upsets Tim. He yells and kicks everyone but Axiom out, and announces plans to start an [[electronic music]] version of Dekkar, now called "DKR".

The season finale ends with a remixed, electronic version of Empty Bottle and Tim announcing that Juliana is now pregnant with his child while Ayaka will go through with her pregnancy too.

===Season 9===
Season nine begins with Gregg informing the audience that the Victorville Film Center has burnt down while he speculates Tim may have done it to collect insurance money.

After Gregg and Tim move back to Hollywood, Tim opens up "Six Bag Cinemas", a new movie theater concept with recliner chairs and a waiter (who is Mark) that brings food to customers during the movie. Gregg constantly criticizes the theater and food.

After Tim stops using the facial cream for the burns on his face, his skin dies and he needs a [[skin transplant]]. After a selection process in which Tim volunteers most of the potential donors himself, Manuel from DKR is chosen and donates skin off of his lower back and buttocks to Tim.

Tim and Dr. San are arrested and jailed on [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] charges. At Tim's "Electric Sun Desert Music Festival" in [[Apple Valley, California]], Dr. San allegedly gave out free samples of his nutritional vape system, the same one Tim uses, resulting in 20 deaths.  Gregg takes over as host with Mark as his co-host, and the two spend an entire episode blaming Tim instead of reviewing movies.

Tim returns on [[bail]], and finishes the last three episodes of the season with Turkington. Together with his lawyer, Doug Lyman, Tim has decided to pin the 20 deaths on Dr. San and the Apple Valley authorities who did not respond in time. In the season finale, it is revealed that Dr. San has committed suicide in jail, and that the relatives of the 20 who died are now primarily blaming Tim for the deaths. At the end of the final episode, Tim reveals to Gregg that he will never forget what Gregg said about him on the show, no matter what happens to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-s-movie-review-serie-1798257567 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington's movie review series returns next month |website=[[The A.V. Club]]}} by ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trial===
A special event, titled "The Trial", began on November 15, 2017, streaming on Adult Swim's website with the trial of Tim Heidecker for the death of the "Electric Sun 20". Tim was found not guilty of the death of one of the 20, as that victim died of a heroin overdose. A [[mistrial]] was called for the remaining 19, due to a [[hung jury]] with 11 guilty and 1 not guilty verdicts. Gregg accused Tim of bribing the juror who voted not guilty.

Director and writer [[Nicholas Meyer]] appears as one of the testifiers in an ongoing joke alluding to a long-standing disagreement between Tim and Gregg as to whether or not San Francisco is the setting for the film "Star Trek II." &lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;

===Season X ===
During the Fifth Oscar Special, Mark got locked tight into a [[standard diving dress]] while doing an impression of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] character in the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] movie and had to be hospitalized for [[asphyxiation]].

Tim returns from the trial free from prison but facing a [[civil suit]] from one of the families of the Electric Sun 19. His assets, including On Cinema and Decker, are being seized and he claims he might soon be facing bankruptcy. After threatening to commit suicide and with help from his attorney (Mark Dwyer), Tim manages to convince the Delgado family to let him try to earn money for them with his various assets. The Delgado's and Tim's Attorney like the show after Episode 7, and hire Gregg as the managing editor of the newly incorporated Delgado Media Holding company, effectively giving him creative control on On Cinema.

The intro and production set have been upgraded, and the show now has a sponsor by name of Rio Jenesis,&lt;ref name="riojenesis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riojenesis.com/ |title=Rio Jenesis |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a protein shake company that creates a "germ shield", of which Tim is now consuming. Gregg begins writing letters to [[Tim Burton]], questioning why he didn't work with [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]''. He also announces that he has resurrected his film archives, which appears to be several bins full of VHS tapes (later revealed to be stocked in Mark Proksch hospital room) and is now collecting and wearing movie promotional hats to Tim's vocal displeasure. Episodes 4 through 6 were filmed in [[360-degree video]].

As of Episode 7, the show has returned to form with a stronger focus on movies than it had previously had in the last several seasons. However, this is in the context of Tim needing to turn the show around, with him openly discussing the possibility of suicide if it doesn't become more successful. The next three episodes, 8–10, saw Gregg's role on the show increasingly become that of the host, while Tim's role was diminished, allowing for more of Gregg's segments, including Popcorn Classics, to become larger segments in each episode. These changes coincided with Gregg's new role as the managing editor in On Cinema's parent company.  In episode 10, the season finale, Tim threw a fit of rage and insulted the Delgados while announcing his wish to campaign for the post of [[district attorney]] of the [[San Bernardino County]].

==Production==
Heidecker has stated that On Cinema was started out of a desire to mock the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"/&gt; The first episode was recorded on set of ''[[The Comedy]]'', where Heidecker and Turkington were working together, after Heidecker proposed the idea between takes.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;
In April 2017, On Cinema initiated a [[Patreon]] page for funding, most of it going to the Oscar specials, with some of the higher options including receiving producer credits, walk-on roles for the Oscar specials, or live custom [[Skype]] reviews from [[Gregg Turkington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.patreon.com/oncinema On Cinema Patreon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who interact with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads" in the frequent personal conflicts between the hosts which are often only tangentially, if at all, related to films or cinema.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; During the annual live Oscar special, Tim and Gregg both frequently provide interactive elements via online polls for fans to vote on. This cult following is especially found on [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], the latter through Gregg and Tim's respective profiles, of which Gregg has completely devoted to the persona of his alter-ego. Heidecker and Turkington have also appeared in character on the podcasts ''Kreative Kontrol'' and ''[[Best Show]]'' in 2015 and 2017.

Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where new episodes of ''Decker'' are shown to fans and the cast appears as their "On Cinema" characters to field questions.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;

In 2013 the ''On Cinema Film Guide'' app was released, featuring the voices of Turkington and Heidecker reviewing over 17,000 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild |first=Matt |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkingtons-emon-cinemaem--97166 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington’s On Cinema is now a very meta app|publisher=Avclub.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For "The Trial", Heidecker and Turkington upended the traditional review aspect of the series, and staged an elaborate mock event where Tim's character was "on trial for murder" that lasted over a week. It received acclaim from observers, some of whom called it "brilliant" and "ambitious."&lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker Is On Trial For Murder in Adult Swim's Latest Web Stunt"|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/tim-heidecker-is-on-trial-for-murder-in-adult-swim.html|publisher=''[[Paste Magazine]]''|date=8 November 2017|author=Jim Vorel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denofgeekoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim’s On Cinema Has Become A Murder Trial|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/on-cinema/269227/adult-swim-s-on-cinema-has-become-a-murder-trial|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|date=25 November 2017|author=Daniel Kurland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim Is Broadcasting a Multi-Day Fake Murder Trial for Tim Heidecker|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/11/on-cinema-tim-heidecker-murder-trial|publisher=[[Spin Magazine]]|date= November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Touring ==
In 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe such as [[Joe Estevez]], the band ''Dekkar'' and special content created only for the tour, such as a live reviewing of all mid-2018 major release films: [[Superfly (2018 film)|''Superfly'']], ''[[Mission Impossible: Fallout]]'', ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'', ''[[Sicario 2: Soldado]]'', ''[[Ant Man &amp; The Wasp]]''.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naftule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandmercury.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consequenceofsound.net"/&gt;

{{Culture of Pakistan}}

[[Pakistan]] has a wide variety of [[folklore]], mostly circulated regionally. However, certain tales have related variants in other regions of the country or in [[neighbouring]] [[countries]]. ''Pakistani [[mythology]]'' here means the myths and sacred narratives of the culturally and linguistically [[Indo-Iranians|related groups of ancient peoples]] who inhabited the region of Pakistan and its borderlands.

==Music==
{{Main article|Pakistani folk music}}

== Provincial folklore ==
The provinces of Pakistan are known by the love stories in their folklore that have been immortalized by singers, reciters and storytellers of the regions.

=== Sindhi folklore ===
{{Main article|Sindhi folklore}}
'''Sindhi folklore''' ({{lang-sd|'''  لوڪ ادب'''}}) is the [[folklore|folk]] tradition which has developed in Sindh over a number of centuries.Sindh abounds with folklore, in all forms, and colors from such obvious manifestations as the traditional [[Watayo Faqir]] tales, the legend of ''Moriro'', epic tale of [[Dodo Soomro|Dodo Chanesar]], to the heroic character of [[Marui]] which distinguishes it among the contemporary folklores of the region. The love story of [[Sassui Punhun|Sassui]], who pines for her lover Punhu, is known and sung in every Sindhi settlement.  Other examples of the folklore of Sindh include the stories of Umar Marui and Suhuni Mehar.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyan Adwani, ed. ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''. [[Jamshoro]]: Sindhi Adabi Board, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sindhi folk Singers and women play a vital role to transmit the Sindhi folklore. They sang the [[Sindhi folk tales|folktales of Sindh]] in songs with passion in every village of Sindh.

Sindhi folklore has been compiled in  a series of forty volumes under [[Sindhi Adabi Board]]'s project of '''Folklore and Literature'''.This valuable project was accomplished by noted sindhi scholar [[Nabi Bux Khan Baloch|Dr.Nabi Bux Baloch]].The material for the project has been collected both from the oral traditions village folks and the written record. This folklore series deals with diverse segments Sindhi folklore and literature i.e. Fables and Fairy-tales, pseudo-historical Romances, Folk-poetry, Folk songs, Proverbs, Riddles etc.

=== Balochi folklore ===
[[Balochi language|Balochi]] folklore is alive with the love stories of [[Hani and Sheh Mureed|Hani and Shah Murad Chakar]], [[Shahdad and Mahnaz]], [[Lallah and Granaz]], [[Bebarg and Granaz]], and [[Mast and Sammo]], among others. The war tales of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] are equally stirring. The ''[[chap (dance)|chap]]'', a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] style of dancing, has a curious rhythm distinguished by an inertial back sway with every forward step. Baloch music has a unique flavour of its own.

=== Kashmiri folklore ===
[[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] regions in the north are equally rich in folklore.

=== Pakhtun folklore ===
In the [[Pukhtun]] areas of the northwest, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] is the home of energetic warlike dancers, the most prominent being the Khattak dance, which bears the name of the tribe that dances it. The romantic tale of [[Adam Khan And Durkhanai|Adam Khan]] and Durkhanai features a lute player (''[[rabab]]'') whose music earns the love of a beautiful girl, although she hasn't seen him yet.

=== Punjabi folklore ===
{{Main article|Punjabi folklore}}
Many folk tales from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] have been disseminated worldwide by the [[Punjabi diaspora]], especially in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States. The tale of two lovers, [[Heer Ranjha|Heer]] and Ranjha, is based in the [[Pakistan]]i part of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], in a city called [[Jhang]]. Today it is celebrated in songs, movies, theatre, and quotations. One may call a romantic person a Ranjha, meaning he is a devoted lover. Similarly a girl in love may be called "Heer." Apart from the epic of Hir and Ranjha, the Punjab has a rich tradition of ballads, folk tales, folk music and dance. The folklore of the Potohar Plateau of the north shows a local variant, while the lush green irrigated agriculture of the central plains is home to more sophisticated forms of folklore. The oldest living urban centre of Multan in the south is home to gentler forms of music and dance.

=== Saraiki folklore ===
[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] areas in the south are equally rich in folklore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13699">{{Postmodernism}}

In [[sociology]], '''postmaterialism''' is the transformation of individual values from materialist, physical, and economic to new individual values of autonomy and self-expression.

The term was popularized by the political scientist [[Ronald Inglehart]] in his 1977 book ''The Silent Revolution'', in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement.

Postmaterialism is a tool in developing an understanding of modern culture. It can be considered in reference of three distinct concepts of [[materialism]]. The first kind of materialism, and the one in reference to which the word postmaterialism is used most often, refers to [[economic materialism|materialism]] as a value-system relating to the desire for fulfillment of material needs (such as security, sustenance and shelter) and an emphasis on material luxuries in a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. A second referent is the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] held by many [[socialists]], most notably [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their philosophic concept of [[dialectical materialism]]. The third definition of materialism concerns the philosophical argument that matter is the only existing reality. The first concept is sociological, the second is both philosophical and sociological, and the third is philosophical.

Depending on which of the three above notions of materialism are being discussed, postmaterialism can be an [[ontology|ontological]] postmaterialism, an existentialistic postmaterialism, an ethical postmaterialism, or a political-sociological postmaterialism, which is also the best known.

==History==
The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by [[Ronald Inglehart]]. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized [[autonomy]] and [[Self-expression Values|self-expression]].{{sfn|Inglehart|2008}} Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs.

Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this [[silent revolution]] was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of [[generational replacement]] causing intergenerational value change.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971}}

The theory of intergenerational change is based on two key hypotheses:
* The scarcity hypothesis
* The socialization hypothesis

===The scarcity hypothesis===

Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart's interpretation of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human goals]], while [[scarcity]] prevails, these ''materialistic'' goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these "non-material" goods.{{sfn|Inglehart|1977}}

===The socialization hypothesis===

The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter.{{sfn|Rokeach|1968}} Therefore, [[cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] which often experienced economic scarcity would ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as [[individual]] improvement, personal [[freedom (political)|freedom]], [[citizen]] input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on [[humanism]], and maintaining a clean and healthy [[environmentalism|environment]].

Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during [[socialization]] have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]-system in contrast to the more volatile political and [[social attitude]]s.

===Measuring postmaterialism===
There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents' patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities.

{{quote|"If you had to choose among the following things, which are the ''two'' that seem the most desirable to you?
* Maintaining order in the nation.
* Giving people more say in important political decisions.
* Fighting rising prices.
* Protecting [[freedom of speech]]."

... On the basis of the choices made among these four items, it is possible to classify our respondents into value priority groups, ranging from a "pure" acquisitive type to a "pure" post-[[bourgeois]] type, with several intermediate categories.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971|pp=994–995}}}}

The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the [[validity (statistics)|validity]], the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted.

The so-called "Inglehart-index" has been included in several [[statistical survey|surveys]] (e.g., [[General Social Survey]], [[World Values Survey]], [[Eurobarometer]], [[ALLBUS]], [[Turning Points of the Life-Course]]). The [[time series]] in ALLBUS ([[German General Social Survey]]) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of "pure post-materialists" increased from 13 to 31 per cent in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by [[German reunification]] in 1990 it dropped to 23 per cent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards.{{sfnm |1a1=Terwey |1y=2000 |1p=155 |2a1=ZA |2a2=ZUMA |2y=2005}} The ALLBUS [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15 per cent, 1992: 10 per cent, 1998: 12 per cent). International [[data]] from the 2000 [[World Values Survey]] show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in [[Australia]] (35 per cent) followed by [[Austria]] (30 per cent), [[Canada]] (29 per cent), [[Italy]] (28 per cent), [[Argentina]] (25 per cent), [[United States]] (25 per cent), [[Sweden]] (22 per cent), [[Netherlands]] (22 per cent), [[Puerto Rico]] (22 per cent) etc.{{sfn|Inglehart|Basáñez|Díez-Medrano|Halmann|2004|p=384}} In spite of some questions raised by these and other data, measurements of postmaterialism have ''prima facie'' proven to be statistically important variables in many analyses.{{sfn|Kislev|2017}}

As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with [[asceticism]] or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class.{{sfn|Pappi|Terwey|1982}}

Recently, the issue of a "second generation of postmaterialism" appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their "positive ideological embodiment", has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series ''Postmaterialismus'' (2001–2005).

According to [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) of the [[Council of Europe]], neither the [[Ombudsman for Minorities]] nor [[Advisory Board for Ethnic Relations]] have the financial and human resources to effectively perform according to their mandate. There is a [[National Non-Discrimination and Equality Tribunal]], but it cannot order compensation to victims of racial discrimination.{{sfn|Council of Europe|2013|p=7}} The legal provisions of the [[Aliens' Act]] are discriminatory and subject ethnic minorities to [[racial profiling]] by the [[Police of Finland|police]].{{sfn|Council of Europe|2013|p=8}}

The majority of people in Finland are ignorant about issues concerning the [[Sami people|Sami]] minority. Sami issues are not taught at school to a satisfactory level, according to ECRI.{{sfn|Council of Europe|2013|p=8}} ECRI has criticized Finland for not having ratified the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO-convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples]].{{sfn|Council of Europe|2013|p=7}}

The [[Somali community in Finland]] as well as the [[Finnish Kale|Finnish Roma]] face discrimination and racism. [[Russians in Finland]] are discriminated against in employment.{{sfn|Council of Europe|2013|p=8}}

And later, when the sister marries, the brother is seen as her main protector, for when her father has died to whom else can she turn if there is trouble in her conjugal household.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The parental home, and after the parents' death the brother's home, often offers the only possibility of temporary or longer-term support in case of divorce, desertion, and even widowhood, especially for a woman without adult sons.

On this day, sisters of all ages tie a talisman, or amulet, called the ''rakhi'',  around the wrists of their brothers, symbolically protecting them, receiving a gift in return, and traditionally investing the brothers with a share of the responsibility of their potential care.&lt;ref name="Agarwal1994a"&gt;{{citation|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|authorlink=Bina Agarwal|title=A Field of One's Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3pdP30OnEUC&amp;pg=PA264|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42926-9|page=264}} &lt;/ref&gt;    

Raksha Bandhan is observed on the last day of the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunar calendar]] month of [[Shraavana]], which typically falls in August.  The expression "Raksha Bandhan," [[Sanskrit]], literally, "the bond of protection, obligation, or care," is now principally applied to this ritual.  Until the mid-20th-century, the expression was more commonly applied to a similar ritual, also held on the same day, with precedence in ancient Hindu texts,  in which a domestic priest ties amulets, charms, or threads on the wrists of his patrons, or changes their [[upanayana|sacred thread]], and receives gifts of money; in some places, this is still the case.&lt;ref name="Berreman1963"&gt;{{citation|last=Berreman|first=Gerald Duane|title=Hindus of the Himalayas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0o91Qt_GAlEC&amp;pg=PA390|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|pages=390–|id=GGKEY:S0ZWW3DRS4S}} Quote: Rakri: On this date Brahmins go from house to house tying string bracelets (''rakrī'') on the wrists of household members.  In return the Brahmins receive from an anna to a rupee from each household.  ... This is supposed to be auspicious for the recipient. ... It has no connotation of brother-sister devotion as it does in some plains areas.  It is readily identified with ''Raksha Bandhan''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gnanambal1969-brahmans"&gt;{{citation|last=Gnanambal|first=K.|title=Festivals of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1969|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India|page=10}} Quote: In North India, the festival is popularly called Raksha Bandhan ... On this day, sisters tie an amulet round the right wrists of brothers wishing them long life and prosperity. Family priests (Brahmans) make it an occasion to visit their clientiele to get presents.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the sister-brother festival, with origins in folk culture, had names which varied with location, with some rendered as '''Saluno''',&lt;ref name="MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno"&gt;{{citation|last=Marriott|first=McKim|editor=McKim Marriott (editor)|title=Village India: Studies in the Little Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOLZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=198|year=1955|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=198–202|chapter=Little Communities in an Indigenous Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadley1994"&gt;{{citation|last=Wadley|first=Susan S.|title=Struggling with Destiny in Karimpur, 1925-1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMqw6JAmQQIC&amp;pg=PA84|date=27 July 1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91433-9|pages=84, 202}} Quote: (p 84) Potters: ... But because the festival of Saluno takes place during the monsoon when they can't make pots, they make pots in three batches ...&lt;/ref&gt; '''Silono''',&lt;ref name="Lewis1965"&gt;{{citation|last=Lewis|first=Oscar|title=Village Life in Northern India: Studies in a Delhi Village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpzZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1965|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Rakri'''.&lt;ref name="Berreman1963"/&gt;  A ritual associated with Saluno included the sisters placing shoots of barley behind the ears of their brothers.&lt;ref name="MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno"/&gt;  

Of special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]], in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017"&gt;{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT127|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=127}} Quote: Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the "traditional" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse—at a crisis, or during childbearing—to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.&lt;/ref&gt;  In rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home"&gt;{{citation|last=Goody|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack Goody|title=The Oriental, the Ancient and the Primitive: Systems of Marriage and the Family in the Pre-Industrial Societies of Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdgos7fWazIC&amp;pg=PA222|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36761-5|page=222}} Quote: "... the heavy emphasis placed on the continuing nature of brother-sister relations despite the fact that in the North marriage requires them to live in different villages.  That relation is celebrated and epitomised in the annual ceremony of ''Rakśābandhan'' in northern and western India. ... The ceremony itself involves the visit of women to their brothers (that is, to the homes of their own fathers, their natal homes)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hess2015"&gt;{{citation|last=Hess|first=Linda|title=Bodies of Song: Kabir Oral Traditions and Performative Worlds in North India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALoUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937416-8|page=61}} Quote: "In August comes Raksha Bandhan, the festival celebrating the bonds between brothers and sisters. Married sisters return, if they can, to their natal villages to be with their brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby,  sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Wadley2005"&gt;{{citation|last=Wadley|first=Susan Snow|title=Essays on North Indian Folk Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XuyTqD0Ybw4C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2005|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-8028-016-0|page=66}} Quote: In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil.  It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees.  Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy.  The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.&lt;/ref&gt;   The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married and parental homes,&lt;ref name="Gnanambal1969"&gt;{{citation|last=Gnanambal|first=K.|title=Festivals of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1969|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potential stewards of their security. 

In urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with this festival have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,&lt;ref name="Coleman2017-technology-migration"&gt;{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}} Quote: In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center—the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity&lt;/ref&gt; the movies,&lt;ref name="Pandit 2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=BUSINESS @ HOME|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}} Quote: "Quote: Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films.

Sociologist [[Yogendra Singh]] has noted the contribution of American anthropologist [[McKim Marriott]], to an understanding of the origins of the ''Raksha Bandhan'' festival.&lt;ref name="Singh2010"/&gt; In rural  society, according to Marriott, there is steady interplay between two cultural traditions, the elite or "great," tradition based in texts, such as the Vedas in Indian society, and the local or "little," based in folk art and literature.&lt;ref name="Singh2010"/&gt; According to Singh, (Marriott) has shown that ''Raksha Bandhan'' festival has its "origin in the 'little tradition'." &lt;ref name="Singh2010"&gt;{{citation|last=Singh|first=Yogendra|authorlink=Yogendra Singh|title=Social Sciences: Communication, Anthropology, and Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00fvNp8y7cgC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2010|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-81-317-1883-4|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Onkar Prasad has further suggested that Marriott was the first to consider the limitations within which each village tradition "operates to retain its essence."&lt;ref name=onkar-prasad2003&gt;{{citation|last=Prasad|first=Onkar|title=Folk and Classical Traditions of Indian Civilization: A Study of their Boundary Maintenance Mechanism with Special Reference to Music|journal=Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society|volume=38|year=2003|page=341}} Quote: "Undeniably both the folk and the classical traditions of India have continuities in structure and content but the limitation with which each system operates to retain its essence either of folkishness or of classicallty seems to have been first realized by Marriott (1955) in his studies on rituals of Kishan Garhi village of Uttar Pradesh."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his village study, Marriott described two concurrently observed traditions on the full moon day of Shravana: a "little tradition" festival called "Saluno," and a "great tradition" festival, ''Raksha Bandhan'', but which Marriott calls, "Charm Tying:" &lt;blockquote&gt;  On Saluno day, many husbands arrive at their wives' villages, ready to carry them off again to their villages of marriage. But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers.  (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held.  The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel "plums." Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation."&lt;ref name="MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norwegian anthropologist, Øyvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the "great tradition" festival was in retreat and the "little tradition" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.&lt;ref name="Jaer1995"&gt;{{citation|last=Jaer|first=Øyvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' ("''charm tying''").  This is another All-India related festival.  The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month  of Savan (July/August).  This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year.  This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91).  Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers.  In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon.  The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system.  The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest.  As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedence in Hindu texts==
Important in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',&lt;ref name="MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno" /&gt; in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).&lt;ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/&gt;  In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, &lt;blockquote&gt; "''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water.  He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased.  It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''.  That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In 
 the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony."&lt;ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137&gt;

==Relation to territorial exogamy==
Of special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial- or village [[exogamy]], in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017" /&gt; Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the "traditional" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse—at a crisis, or during childbearing—to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

In rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home" /&gt;  Scholar Linda Hess writes:&lt;ref name="Hess2015"/&gt; Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby,  sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Wadley2005" /&gt; Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil.  It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees.  Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy.  The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.&lt;ref name="Wadley2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,&lt;ref name="Gnanambal1969" /&gt; as well as potential stewards of their security.

In his village study (1955), anthropologist McKim Marriott noted transformations of ritual that had begun to take place: &lt;blockquote&gt;A further, secondary transformation of the festival of Charm Tying is also beginning to be evident in Kishan Garhi, for the thread charms of the priests are now factory-made in more attractive form ... A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists.  The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras."&lt;ref name="MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,&lt;ref name="Coleman2017-technology-migration"&gt;{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}} &lt;/ref&gt;  According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: &lt;blockquote&gt; In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center—the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017-technology-migration"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Hindi movies have played a salient role.&lt;ref name="Pandit 2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=BUSINESS @ HOME|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, &lt;blockquote&gt; Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films.  Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad."&lt;ref name="Pandit 2003"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  More social interaction among India's population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival.&lt;ref name="Khandekar2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Khandekar|first=Renuka N.|title=Faith: filling the God-sized hole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIgoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA180|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Renuka Khandekar: &lt;blockquote&gt; But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families.  For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds."&lt;ref name="Khandekar2003"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

The festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations.&lt;ref name="JoshySeethi2015"&gt;{{citation|last1=Joshy|first1=P. M.|last2=Seethi|first2=K. M.|title=State and Civil Society under Siege: Hindutva, Security and Militarism in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxuJCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT112|year=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-93-5150-383-5|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. &lt;blockquote&gt; The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ...  Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shakha|shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'—the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'—has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.&lt;ref name="JoshySeethi2015"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Similarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot1999"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot1999"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017-technology-migration" /&gt; as Leo Coleman states: &lt;blockquote&gt; ... as citizens become participants in the wider "new traditions" of the national state.  Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.&lt;ref name="Coleman2017-nation-building"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   

More recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.&lt;ref name="NairJohn2000-NIndia" /&gt; According to author Prem Chowdhry, &lt;blockquote&gt; Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.&lt;ref name="NairJohn2000-NIndia" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Voluntary kin relations==

Among women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,&lt;ref name="HeitzmanWorden1996" /&gt; and Hindu and Muslim divisions.&lt;ref name="MinesLamb2002" /&gt;  In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.&lt;ref name="Chowdhry1994" /&gt; According to author Prem Chowdhry, "The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation. The ritual thread is offered, though not tied and higher caste men customarily give some money in return."

==Regional variations in ritual==

While Raksha Bandhan is celebrated in various parts of South Asia, different regions mark the day in different ways.

In the state of [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]], this day is also called Jhulan Purnima. Prayers and puja of Lord Krishna and Radha are performed there. Sisters tie rakhi to brothers and wish immortality. Political parties, offices, friends, schools to colleges, street to palace celebrate this day with a new hope for a good relationship.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In [[Maharashtra]], the festival of Raksha Bandhan is celebrated along with ''Narali Poornima'' (coconut day festival). Kolis are the fishermen community of the coastal state. The fishermen offer prayers to Lord Varuna, the Hindu god of Sea, to invoke his blessings. As part of the rituals, coconuts were thrown into the sea as offerings to Lord Varuna. The girls and women tie ''rakhi'' on their brother's wrist, as elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J.

In the regions of [[North India]], mostly [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], it is a common practice to fly kites on the nearby occasions of Janamashtami and Raksha Bandhan. It's not unusual to see the sky filled with kites of all shapes and sizes, on and around these two dates. The locals buy kilometres of strong kite string, commonly called as "gattu door" in the local language, along with a multitude of kites.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In [[Haryana]], in addition to celebrating Raksha Bandhan, people observe the festival of Salono.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar Suresh Singh, Madan Lal Sharma, A. K. Bhatia, Anthropological Survey of India (1994) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qUZuAAAAMAAJ Haryana]&lt;/ref&gt; Salono is celebrated by priests solemnly tying amulets against evil on people's wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMbUAAAAMAAJ|title=Census of India, 1961|first=India Office of the Registrar|last=General|date=1 January 1965|publisher=Manager of Publications|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere, sisters tie threads on brothers with prayers for their well being, and the brothers give her gifts promising to safeguard her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQjgAAAAMAAJ|title=Festivals, Fairs, and Fasts of India|first=Shakti M.|last=Gupta|year= 1991|publisher=Clarion Books|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books|pages=16, 95–96|isbn= 978-8185120232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nepal, Raksha Bandhan is referred to as Janai Purnima or Rishitarpani, and involves a sacred thread ceremony. It is observed by both Hindus and Buddhists of Nepal.&lt;ref name=trilokcm78&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trilok Chandra Majupuria|author2=S. P.

The Raksha Bandhan-like brother sister festival is observed by other Hindus of Nepal during one of the days of the [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] (or [[Diwali]]) festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wilmore|title=Developing Alternative Media Traditions in Nepal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=khi8jQUJLDkC&amp;pg=PA196|year =2008|publisher= Lexington|isbn= 978-0-7391-2525-0|pages= 196–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is observed by the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] Hindus, and is popularly known in [[Newar people|Newar]] community as ''Gunhu Punhi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gorkhapost.com/raksha-bandhan-observed-today/ |title=Raksha Bandhan being observed today |date= 2017-07-28|publisher=Gorkha Post |access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in movies and popular history==

The religious myths claimed ''Raksha Bandhan''  are disputed, and the historical stories associated with it considered apocryphal by some historians.

===Jai Santoshi Maa (movie)===

[[Ganesha]] had two sons, Shubha and Labha. The two boys become frustrated that they have no sister to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with. They ask their father Ganesha for a sister, but to no avail. Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesha that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection). Thereafter, Shubha Labha (literally "Holy Profit") had a sister named Santoshi Maa (literally "Goddess of Satisfaction"), to tie Rakhi over Raksha Bandhan.&lt;ref name="Brown1991"&gt;{{citation|last=Brown|first=Robert L.|title=Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oF-Hqih3pBAC&amp;pg=PA150|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0656-4|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Robert Brown &lt;blockquote&gt;  ... in Varanasi the paired figures were usually called Rddhi and Siddhi, Ganeea's relationship to them was often vague. He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane§a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Rasa bandan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa'' — his "mind-born" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Sikandar'' (movie, 1939)===
Film historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1939 movie Sikandar:&lt;ref name="Pomeroy2017"&gt;{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25-0:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32-35). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE. When Rani Karnavati, the widowed queen of the king of Chittor, realised that she could not defend against the invasion by the Sultan of Gujarat, [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Bahadur Shah]], she sent a rakhi to Emperor [[Humayun]]. The Emperor, according to one version of the story, set off with his troops to defend Chittor. He arrived too late, and Bahadur Shah had already captured the Rani's fortress. Alternative accounts from the period, including those by historians in Humayun's Mughal court, do not mention the rakhi episode and some historians have expressed skepticism whether it ever happened.&lt;ref name="ref87lomuq"&gt;{{Citation | title=Medieval India: from Sultanat to the Mughals, Volume 2 | author=Satish Chandra | publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year= 2005 | isbn=978-81-241-1066-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC | accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Satish Chandra]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;  ... According to a mid-seventeenth century Rajasthani account, Rani Karnavati, the Rana's mother, sent a bracelet as rakhi to Humayun, who gallantly responded and helped. Since none of the contemporary sources mention this, little credit can be given to this story ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;     Humayun's own memoirs never mention this, and give different reasons for his war with [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Sultan Bahadur Shah]] of Gujarat in 1535.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Humayun|author2=Jauhar (Trans)|title=The Tezkereh Al Vakiat; Or, Private Memoirs of the Moghul Emperor Humayun: Written in the Persian Language, by Jouher, a Confidential Domestic of His Majesty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Omz-xAlUsZIC| year=2013| publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-05603-8|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20542">'''Religious Identity''' is a specific type of [[identity formation]]. Particularly, it is the sense of group membership to a religion and the importance of this group membership as it pertains to one's [[self-concept]]. Religious identity is not necessarily the same as religiousness or [[religiosity]]. Although these three terms share a commonality, religiousness and religiosity refer to both the value of religious group membership as well as participation in religious events (e.g. going to church).&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010"&gt;Arweck, E. &amp; Nesbitt, E. (2010). Young people's identity formation in mixed-faith families: continuity or discontinuity of religious traditions? Journal of Contemporary Religion, 25, 67-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KingWhitbeck1997"&gt;King, V. Elder, G.H., Whitbeck, L.B. (1997). Religious involvement among rural youth: An ecological and life-course perspective. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 7, 431-456.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious identity, on the other hand, refers specifically to religious group membership regardless of religious activity or participation. 

Similar to other forms of identity formation, such as ethnic and [[cultural identity]], the religious context can generally provide a perspective from which to view the world, opportunities to socialize with a spectrum of individuals from different generations, and a set of basic principles to live out.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004"&gt;King, P.E. &amp; Boyatzis, C.J. (2004). Exploring adolescent spiritual and religious development: current and future theoretical and empirical perspectives. Applied Developmental Science, 8, 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; These foundations can come to shape an individual's identity.

Despite the implications that religion has on identity development, the identity formation literature has mainly focused on ethnicity and gender and has largely discounted the role of religion. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have begun to include religion as a factor of interest.&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2002"&gt;Lee, J.J. (2002). Religion and college attendance: Change among students. The Review of Higher Education, 25, 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these studies use religious identity, religiosity, and religiousness interchangeably or solely focus on religious identity and solely religious participation as separate constructs.

Of these types of research studies, researchers have examined the various factors that affect the strength of one's religious identity over time.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000"&gt;Arnett, J.J. (2000).

'Identity' is one of the most used terms in the social sciences and has different senses in different research paradigms. In addition to psychological studies, sociologists and anthropologists also apply the term 'religious identity' and examine its related processes in given social contexts. For example, one important study conducted in the United States after the events of September 11 2001, explored the meaning-making among American Muslims&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peek|first=Lori|date=2005|title=Becoming Muslim: The Development of a Religious Identity|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/66/3/215/1665611|journal=Sociology of Religion|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=215|doi=10.2307/4153097|issn=1069-4404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how changes in identity ascription (what people think about another group of people) affected how Muslims sought to represent themselves. Other studies have applied concepts appropriated from race and gender identity theory such as disidentification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin-Stożek|first=Daniel|last2=Schirr|first2=Bertram J.|date=2017-09-03|title=Identification and disidentification in reported schooling experiences of adolescent Muslims in England|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=43|issue=5|pages=580–595|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|issn=0305-4985}}&lt;/ref&gt; which undermines essentialist accounts of religious identity - that an individual has a 'fixed' religious identity, independent of pre-existing systems of representation and individuals' positioning within them.  

== History ==
During the early 1800s in the field of psychology, research on the topic of religion was considered important and ubiquitous. For example, researchers like [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[William James]] conducted studies on such topics as religious conversion.&lt;ref name="Hall1904"&gt;Hall, G. S. (1904). Adolescence, Vol. II. New York: Appleton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youniss1999"&gt;Youniss, J., McLellan, J.A., &amp; Yates, M. (1999). Religion, community service, and identity in American youth. Journal Adolescence, 22, 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the public perspective on religion began to shift two decades later.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt; Instead of religion being seen as an integral part of an individual's life and development and thus a necessary topic to research, scientists and scholars alike viewed religion as a hindrance to the progression of science and as a topic no longer applicable to the current times.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SiegelWhite1982"&gt;Siegel, A.W., &amp; White, S.H. (1982). The child study movement. In Advances in Child Development and Behavior. Reese, H. W. (Ed.). New York: Academic press, pp. 233-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson1928"&gt;Watson, J.B. (1928). Psychological Care of Infant and Child. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to social scientists' prediction of the general decline of religion over time and increase of secularization leading to a complete abandonment of religious studies, religion did not diminish and was instead acknowledged by researchers as a topic worthwhile to research. Scientists and scholars, like British sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]], realized that despite the neglect of religion in studies, the presence and impact of religion on individuals' lives were undeniable and did not disappear with time.&lt;ref name="Thompson1995"&gt;Thompson, J.B. (1995). The Media and Modernity: a social theory of the media. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a body of research on religion began to take root. Particularly, a handful of researchers were interested in examining religious identity during adolescence.

== Factors that affect religious identity ==
Given that religious traditions can be intricately interlaced with various aspects of culture, the religious identity literature has consistently yielded ethnic, gender, and generational differences.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;Lopez, A.B., Huynh, V.W., &amp; Fuligni, A.J. (In press). A longitudinal study of religious identity and participation during adolescence.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic Differences ===
According to [[Social Identity Theory]], when individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds feel as if their identity is threatened, they may emphasize their other social identities as a means to maintain a positive self-concept.&lt;ref name="TajfelTurner2001"&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. (2001). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In M. A. Hogg &amp; D. Abrams (Eds.), Relations: Essential readings. Key readings in social psychology (pp. 94-109). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is supported by the various studies that have shown higher levels of religious identity among ethnic minorities, particularly those from Latino and African American backgrounds, compared to European Americans.&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

=== Gender Differences ===
Gender may also impact one's religious identity. Generally, females are more likely than males to attend religious services and express that religion is an important aspect of their lives.&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Studies have captured this gender difference through observations of females reporting greater religious attitudes.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; This was also shown in a four-year longitudinal study on religious involvement for adolescents living in rural settings. Females tended to be more involved in church-related activities than males and were more likely to view themselves as religious individuals.

=== Immigrant Generational Differences ===
There are three categories of generational status: First, Second, and Third. An individual who is considered to be first generation is one who was born outside of the United States and immigrated. Second generation refers to an individual who was born in the United States but whose parent(s) were foreign-born and immigrated. Lastly, third generation refers to an individual and the individual's parents were born in the United States. 

First and second generation individuals may tend to have particularly higher religious identity levels in comparison to third generation immigrants.&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; In efforts to adjust to the stressful changes associated with the immigration process, finding a community of emotional, social, and financial support, an environment typically provided by a place of worship, may be highly sought after by immigrants.&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; Studies have indeed revealed that adolescents from immigrant families (both first and second generation immigrants) reported higher levels of religious identity compared to adolescents whose parents are not immigrants (third generation).&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt;

'''Institutional factors'''

Studies suggest that institutional factors impact on religious identity. For example in a study of Christians, Jews and Muslims in English secondary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2014-08-08|title=Religious identity choices in English secondary schools|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/berj.3151|journal=British Educational Research Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=489–504|doi=10.1002/berj.3151|issn=0141-1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescents reported negative representations of their religious traditions in the curriculum and common stereotypes held by their peers. These negative ascriptions were perceived by participants to influence their strategies of representing themselves, including hiding their religious affiliations or attempting to pre-empt criticism or bullying by representing the traditions they identified with in an apologetic conciliatory manner.

== Religious identity trajectories ==
By and large, numerous studies have observed ethnic, gender, and generational differences in religious identity. However, there have not been as many longitudinal studies on the influence of ethnicity, gender, and generational status on individuals' development of religious identity over time. Nevertheless, of the handful of such studies, researchers have focused mainly on adolescence&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="King2003"&gt;King, P.E. (2003). Religion and identity: The role of ideological, social, and spiritual contexts. Applied Developmental Science, 7, 197-204.&lt;/ref&gt; and started to branch out to emerging adulthood.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J. (2005). The role of religion in the transition to adulthood for young emerging adults. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 4, 245-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J., Davarya, S., &amp; Urry, S. (2010). Religiosity and spirituality during the transition to adulthood. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 34, 311-324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007"&gt;Uecker, J.E., Regnerus, M., &amp; Vaaler, M.L. (2007). Losing my religion: The social sources of religious decline in early adulthood. Social Forces, 85, 1667-1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Researchers have been particularly interested in studying identity during adolescence because it is a developmental period crucial to identity development. During this period, adolescents have opportunities to explore their ethnic, cultural, and religious traditions.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt; However, the freedom and flexibility of their exploration is typically within the constraints of their parents or caregiver.

It was believed that religious identity and participation would both follow the same trajectory and decrease across time; hence, the studies that examined religiousness, which combines the two constructs.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Although religious affiliation, identity, and participation are closely related, longitudinal research on adolescents suggests that these constructs have different trajectories from one another. For example, researchers have found that religious affiliation and identity for adolescents remained fairly stable across the high school years, which contradicts the expected change in religious affiliation from affiliated to unaffiliated and decrease in religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

However, the stability of adolescent religious identity parallels that of other social identities such as ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Fuligni2008"&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., &amp; Baldelomar, O. (2008). Stability and change in ethnic labeling among adolescents from Asian and Latin American immigrant families. Child Development, 79(4), 944-956.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reasoned that due to adolescents' relatively stable social environment, there is not a strong need to further explore and renegotiate their religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Moreover, religious identity is mainly driven by parents during adolescence.&lt;ref name="Denham2004"&gt;Denham, S.A. et al. (2004) Paper presented at the biennial Conference on Human Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that adolescents tend to still live with their parents during high school, there may not be a need to engage in deeper exploration of their religion, which may help explain the observed stable religious identity. 

Whereas religious affiliation and identity remain stable, religious participation tends to decrease.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Adolescents may exercise their increased autonomy and choose not to attend religious events. Particularly, adolescents may find other activities (e.g. studying, clubs, and sports) vying for their time and resources and choose to prioritize those activities over religious events. The significant decline in religious participation at the end of high school may be a precursor to further decline during emerging adulthood.

=== Emerging Adulthood ===
Adolescence has been traditionally associated with a time of identity exploration. However, that exploration process is not complete by the end of adolescence. Rather, emerging adulthood, the years between late teens and late twenties, extends the identity formation process from adolescence.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valde1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitbourneTesch1985" /&gt; 

This transitional period is marked by constant changes in romantic love, work, and worldviews&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt; and is generally a time of "semiautonomy."&lt;ref name="Goldscheider1994"&gt;Goldscheider, F., &amp; Goldscheider, C. (1994). Leaving and returning home in 20th century America. Population Bulletin, 48(4), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldscheiderDaVanzo1986"&gt;Goldscheider, F., DaVanzo, J. (1986). Semiautonomy and leaving home in early adulthood. Social Forces, 65, 187-201.&lt;/ref&gt; With this increased sense of autonomy, emerging adults may choose to further exert their independence by moving away from home and/or by attending college. Through whichever ways that emerging adults choose to exercise their autonomy, they are likely to find themselves in new, diverse environments teeming with a spectrum of vast worldviews.

Despite the necessity for studies on religious identity, there has been limited work on the role of religion in identity formation in emerging adults. Compared to the research in adolescence, there is much less work on the development of religious identity and religious participation across the emerging adulthood years. The combination of immense and frequent changes, increased autonomy, and diverse environments during this period has major ramifications for the development of emerging adults' religious affiliation, religious identity, and religious participation. 

Religion was believed to have little impact on emerging adults' identity, particularly for those who attend college&lt;ref name="BrinkerhoffMarlene1993"&gt;Brinkerhoff, M.B., &amp; Marlene, M.M. (1993). Casting Off the Bonds of Organized Religion: A Religious-Careers Approach to the Study of Apostasy. Review of Religious Research 34:235-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HunsbergerBrown1984"&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; L.B., Brown. (1984). Religious socialization, apostasy, and the impact of family background. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 23, 239-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PewForum"&gt;Pew Forum, o. R. a. P. L. (2008). U.S. Religious Landscape Survey (Report).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillitsCrider1989"&gt;Willits, F.K. &amp; Crider, D.M. (1989). Church Attendance and Traditional Religious Beliefs in Adolescence and Young Adulthood: A Panel Study. Review of Religious Research, 31, 68-81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent research suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; According to a study, while 14 percent of college students reported a decrease in religious beliefs throughout college, 48 percent reported stable religious beliefs, and 38 percent reported an increase.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;

Moreover, another study found that contrary to the expectations of decreased religious identity and religious participation during emerging adulthood, religious identity did not decrease, but religious participation did decline as predicted.&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; Researchers explained that emerging adults are more likely to decrease their involvement in religious activities than they are to completely disaffiliate from their religion or express less importance of religion in their lives.

Additionally, in a study that examined the ways in which religion influenced emerging adults, researchers found that emerging adults' standards of adulthood were dependent upon the religious affiliation of the institution they attended.&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt; For example, compared to emerging adults who attended Catholic or public universities, emerging adults who attended Mormon universities rated interdependence, norm compliance, biological transitions, and family capacities as extremely important criteria for adulthood. 

In summary, although not all studies on this topic are in agreement, religious identity generally tends to remain stable during emerging adulthood whereas religious participation decreases over time.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Summer Wars'''''|サマーウォーズ|Samā Wōzu|lead=yes}} is a &lt;!-- Please do not link to 2009 in film per WP:EGG. Thanks. --&gt; 2009 Japanese [[anime|animated]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Mamoru Hosoda]], produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film's voice cast includes [[Ryunosuke Kamiki]], [[Nanami Sakuraba]], [[Mitsuki Tanimura]], [[Sumiko Fuji]] and [[Ayumu Saitō]]. The film tells the story of Kenji Koiso, a timid eleventh-grade math genius who is taken to [[Ueda, Nagano|Ueda]] by twelfth-grade student, Natsuki Shinohara to celebrate her great-grandmother's 90th birthday. However, he is falsely implicated in the hacking of a [[virtual world]] by a sadistic [[artificial intelligence]] named Love Machine. Kenji must repair the damage done, and find a way to stop the rogue computer program from causing any further chaos.

After producing ''[[The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006 film)|The Girl Who Leapt Through Time]]'', Madhouse was asked to produce something new. Hosoda and writer [[Satoko Okudera]], created a story about a social network and a stranger's connection with strange family. The real-life city of Ueda, was chosen as the setting for ''Summer Wars'', as part of the territory was once governed by the [[Sanada clan]] and was close to Hosoda's birthplace in Toyama. Hosoda used the clan as the basis for the Jinnouchi family after visiting his then-fiancé's home in Ueda.

Production of ''Summer Wars'' commenced in 2006. Art director Youji Takeshige incorporated Japanese houses into his background designs. Hosoda also insisted that 80 family members were to be included as main characters. The project was first announced at the 2008 [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]] and the first trailer of the film was released in April 2009. Audience interest was fueled primarily through word of mouth and Internet publicity.&lt;ref name="Locarno Summer Wars PDF" /&gt;  A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was written by Iqura Sugimoto and began its serialization in July 2009.

''Summer Wars'' premiered in Japan on August 1, 2009. It grossed over [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million in its opening weekend in 127 theaters and ranked No. 7 at the box office. The film was well received by critics and the general audience and was financially successful, earning $18 million worldwide. It won several awards such as the 2010 [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]],&lt;ref name="Anime News Network"&gt;{{cite web | title=Summer Wars Wins Japan Academy's Animation of the Year| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-03-05/summer-wars-wins-japan-academy-animation-of-the-year | publisher=Anime News Network | date=March 5, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival's Animation Division Grand Prize, the Anaheim International Film Festival's Audience Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the 2009 Golden Leopard award at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="LIFF Nomination"&gt;{{cite news | title = L'animation japonaise à l'honneur du festival du film de Locarno | url = http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/2009-08-06/l-animation-japonaise-a-l-honneur-du-festival-du-film-de-locarno/249/0/367098 | publisher = [[Le Point]] | agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] | date = August 5, 2009 | language = French | accessdate = August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Please refrain from adding unnecessary detail. --&gt;
Kenji Koiso is a young student at Kuonji High School with a gift for [[mathematics]] and a part-time [[Gamemaster#Gamemasters in online games|moderator]] in the massive computer-simulated [[virtual reality]] world OZ along with his friend Takashi Sakuma.

One day, Kenji is invited by fellow Kuonji student Natsuki Shinohara to participate in her great-grandmother Sakae Jinnouchi's 90th birthday. After traveling to Sakae's estate in [[Ueda, Nagano|Ueda]], Natsuki introduces Kenji as her [[fiancé]] to Sakae, surprising them both. Kenji meets several of Natsuki's relatives and discovers that the Jinnouchis are descendants of a samurai (vassal of the [[Takeda clan]]) who challenged the [[Tokugawa clan]] in 1615. He also meets Wabisuke Jinnouchi, Natsuki's half-great-uncle and a computer expert who has been living in the United States since stealing the family fortune 10 years ago.

Kenji receives an e-mail with a mathematical code and cracks it. Love Machine, an [[artificial intelligence]] written by Wabisuke, uses Kenji's account and [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] the infrastructure, causing widespread damage. Kenji, Sakuma, and Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa confront Love Machine. Love Machine defeats Kazuma's avatar King Kazma and continues to consume accounts in the OZ mainframe, creating catastrophic [[traffic congestion]] and disabling electrical devices. Two of Sakae's relatives, Rika  and Shota Jinnouchi, discover Kenji's involvement. Shota arrests Kenji, but the congestion causes Natsuki to return them to the estate.

Sakae calls associates in important positions in Japanese society and relatives who work in emergency services, encouraging them to work their hardest to reduce chaos and damage, comparing the situation to war. Kenji is able to return control of the mainframe to the moderators and engineers. Wabisuke explains that he sold the program to the [[United States Armed Forces]] for a test run. After an argument with Sakae, Wabisuke leaves the estate. Sakae later encourages Kenji to take care of Natsuki during a [[Koi-Koi]] match.

The next morning, Sakae is discovered dead by Kenji and the Jinnouchis. Her youngest son Mansaku explains that she had [[Angina pectoris|angina]], and that Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor. Kenji, Sakuma, and most of the Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine with a [[supercomputer]] using ice blocks as a coolant, while Natsuki and the others prepare a [[funeral]] for Sakae.

Kenji, along with Sakuma and the others, capture Love Machine, but Shota carries the ice blocks to Sakae's body, causing the supercomputer to overheat. Love Machine consumes King Kazma and redirects the ''Arawashi'' Asteroid Probe onto a collision course with a [[nuclear power plant]]. Meanwhile, Natsuki discovers a [[Will (law)|will]] left by Sakae and reunites with Kenji and the rest of the group. Natsuki has Wabisuke return home before the family reads Sakae's will, asking them to bring Wabisuke back to their lives. Realizing that Love Machine sees everything as a game, Kenji has the Jinnouchis confront Love Machine to play Koi-Koi in OZ's casino world, wagering their accounts in a desperate attempt to stop Love Machine. Natsuki wins several rounds, but gets distracted and nearly loses her "winnings".

However, OZ users worldwide enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki's side, which also prompts the guardian programs of OZ—the blue and red whales known as John and Yoko—to upgrade Natsuki's account. Natsuki wagers the 150 million avatars given to her in a single hand and critically damages Love Machine, prompting the artificial intelligence to redirect the ''Arawashi'' towards Sakae's estate. Kenji attempts to break into the probe's GPS, while Wabisuke disables Love Machine's defenses. After being revived and assisted by several of the Jinnouchi family's avatars, King Kazma destroys Love Machine. Kenji activates the GPS code to redirect the ''Arawashi'' away from the estate, destroying the estate's entrance and causing a [[geyser]] to erupt. In the aftermath, the Jinnouchi family, celebrating their victory as well as Sakae's birthday, has Natsuki kiss Kenji after they confess their love to each other.

==Production==

===Development===
After the critical and commercial success of ''The Girl Who Leapt Through Time'', [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was offered to produce another film. Whereas Madhouse based the previous film on a novel, the studio was given the chance to create the next film.&lt;ref name="Clements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mangauk.com/?p=christmas-in-august|title=Christmas in August|publisher=[[Manga Entertainment]]|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|date=March 26, 2011|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Mamoru Hosoda selected a story for both people with family and those without having a family.&lt;ref name="Locarno Summer Wars PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt; Production of ''Summer Wars'' commenced in 2006.

[[File:Ueda-M8093.jpg|thumb|The city of Ueda viewed from the west turret of [[Ueda Castle]]. Ueda was used as the setting for the most of the film.]]
Most of the film is set in the real-life city of [[Ueda, Nagano|Ueda]]. Ueda was chosen as the primary setting of the film because it is located in a territory formerly governed by the prominent [[Sanada clan]], upon which the Jinnouchi family is based. Ueda is also close to Hosoda's birthplace in [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]].&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt; Hosoda's inspiration for the name of the social network OZ came from a large [[supermarket]] that he once visited while still working for [[Toei Animation]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt; Although noting similarities between OZ and ''[[Second Life]]'', Hosoda also cited the Japanese [[social network service|social networking]] website [[mixi]] as a primary influence because of his experiences. For the color and design of OZ, he cited [[Nintendo]] games as inspiration.&lt;ref name="AWN"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Desowitz|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/winning-summer-wars/page/1%2C1|title=Winning the Summer Wars|work=[[Animation World Network]]|date=December 23, 2010|accessdate=June 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017012929/http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/winning-summer-wars/page/1,1|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design aesthetic was compared by some reviewers to the appearance of OZ.&lt;ref name="Otaku2" /&gt; Hosoda said that he admires the artwork of [[Takashi Murakami]], but designed the social network as a "clean, uncluttered look." During production, Hosoda visited his then-fiancé's house in Ueda, and experienced the history of her family's life. Hosoda cited his influence of using a family as the basis of the film from his marriage and from attending several [[film festival]]s.&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AWN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sevakis | first = Justin | title = Interview: Mamoru Hosoda | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2009-12-22/interview-mamoru-hosoda | work = Anime News Network | date = December 22, 2009 | accessdate = December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hosoda, the team included writer [[Satoko Okudera]] and character designer [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]], who previously worked with Hosoda on ''The Girl Who Leapt Through Time''.&lt;ref name="ANN Summer Wars Announcement"&gt;{{cite news | title = Leapt Through Time's Hosoda to Direct Summer Wars Film | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-06/leapt-through-time-hosoda-to-direct-summer-wars-film | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = December 6, 2008 | accessdate = August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiroyuki Aoyama served as an animation director, while action animation direction was handled by Tatsuzo Nishida.&lt;ref name="Locarno Summer Wars PDF"&gt;{{cite web | title = Summer Wars | url = http://webfiles.pardo.ch/perm/3106/OC322552_P3106_130141.pdf | publisher = 62nd [[Locarno International Film Festival]] | format = PDF | accessdate = August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWN" /&gt; During production, Sadamoto based Wabisuke's design on those of actor [[Yūsaku Matsuda]].&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt; Aoyama was responsible for supervising the animation of the real world scenes, while Nishida supervised the animation for the digital world, using both [[traditional animation]] and [[computer animation]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Clements" /&gt; Digital animation studio [[Digital Frontier]] was responsible for creating the visuals of OZ and its avatars.&lt;ref name="AWN" /&gt; Youji Takeshige oversaw the art direction for ''Summer Wars''.&lt;ref name="ANN Summer Wars Announcement"/&gt; While visiting Ueda, Hosoda thought that Takeshige, who has previously worked with [[Studio Ghibli]], should draw traditional Japanese houses for the film.&lt;ref name="AWN" /&gt; The film also features the Japanese spacecraft [[Hayabusa]], whose control center is located in the nearby city of [[Saku, Nagano|Saku]]. Hosoda included the spacecraft to support Japan's contribution towards space exploration.&lt;ref name="Locarno Summer Wars PDF" /&gt;

The film was announced at the 2008 [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TokiKake's Hosoda, ×××HOLiC's Mizushima Plan Films | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-28/tokikake-hosoda-xxxholic-mizushima-plan-films | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = March 28, 2008 | accessdate = August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[Otakon]] convention Madhouse president [[Masao Maruyama (film producer)|Masao Maruyama]] said that Hosoda insisted on including 80 family members as its main characters. Maruyama then quipped that he asked Hosoda to promise only two main characters and two years of production for his next film. ''Summer Wars'' was one film in Madhouse's larger theatrical film release strategy, to release one new film each season for the next year. The release of ''Summer Wars'' was followed by ''[[Mai Mai Miracle]]'' and ''[[Yona Yona Penguin]]'' in 2009 with ''[[Redline (2010 film)|Redline]]'' released during the first half of 2010.&lt;ref name="ANN Otakon 2009"&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Evan | title = Madhouse&amp;nbsp;– Otakon 2009 | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2009/otakon/madhouse | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = July 17, 2009 | accessdate = August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Schilling of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' rated the film 5 out of 5 stars and observed that ''Summer Wars'' "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He also said that the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an "analog world" and a "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]'s shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull".&lt;ref name="Japan Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Schilling | first = Mark | title = The future king of Japanese animation may be with us | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20090807a1.html | work = [[The Japan Times]] | date = August 7, 2009 | accessdate = August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following ''The Girl Who Leapt Through Time'' "cries went out immediately hailing him [Hosoda] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with ''Summer Wars'', "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and&amp;nbsp;– quite possibly&amp;nbsp;– the world." Rosset praised the film itself as "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." and "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." He concluded by saying "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller."&lt;ref name="Twitch Film Rosset"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Todd | title = Sitges 09: SUMMER WARS Review&amp;nbsp;– Todd Brown | url = http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2009/10/sitges-09-summer-wars-review-1.php | work = Twitch Film | date = October 12, 2009 | accessdate = October 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film "a top class audiovisual show." He concluded by writing "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place as one of the top contemporary Japanese animators. And it's good to know that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too soon I hope!) there's people capable of following his steps."&lt;ref name="Twitch Film Rosset"/&gt; The Korean newspaper ''[[Herald Media|Herald Business]]'' saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.&lt;ref name="HeraldBiz" /&gt;

Patrick W. Galbraith of Otaku2.com compared the design of OZ to [[Takashi Murakami]]'s artwork, specifically "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." and compared the movie to "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by "hoardes of fans who on the spot decided to move to Nagano" In conclusion, Galbraith wrote "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [him] of Miyazaki Hayao and [[Studio Ghibli]] back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke [[Makoto Shinkai|Shinkai Makoto]]."&lt;ref name="Otaku2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Galbraith | first = Patrick | title = Otaku2 ''Summer Wars'' Review | url = http://www.otaku2.com/articleView.php?item=455 | work = Otaku2 | date = August 14, 2009 | accessdate = October 17, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090819013834/http://www.otaku2.com/articleView.php?item=455 | archivedate = August 19, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Sevakis of [[Anime News Network]] gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that "decades from now, ''Summer Wars'' will be seen as the official arrival of [director] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." He called the film "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." and noted that the film is "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a way we have not seen from anime in years." Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called ''Summer Wars'' "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Summer Wars'' Review&amp;nbsp;– Anime News Network | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/summer-wars | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = November 27, 2009 | accessdate = November 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, ''[[Digimon Adventure: Our War Game]]''.

Rachel Saltz of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also gave a positive review of the film. Saltz praised Mamoru Hosoda's direction, and says it "matches the clean, classically composed images of his [Hosoda's] outer story." She further praised the visuals and themes, comparing it to those of director [[Yasujirō Ozu]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Rachel | title = Movie Review&amp;nbsp;– Summer Wars | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/movies/29summer.html?ref=movies | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 28, 2010 | accessdate = January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' critic Peter Debruge stated that Hosoda's direction "appeals to the hard-to-please teen crowd by taking mind-bending ideas and planting them within a relatable contempo context."

He also likened Hosoda's style to that of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Nintendo]]. Hartlaub complained that Kenji's character is "a bit too over-caffeinated in the first part" and concluded that the film is "the kind of fun and quirky film that you don't see very often in art houses this time of year."&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last = Hartlaub | first = Peter | title = Summer Wars review&amp;nbsp;– fun and quirky | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/12/24/DDJP1GSU98.DTL|work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date = December 24, 2010 | accessdate = January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He stated that "Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments" and also praised Satoko Okudera's writing, stating that it "stakes a claim for the non-virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan’s medieval era." He also praised the OZ animation sequences as "visually ravishing explorations of white-on-white cyberspace, but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé."

Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film's visuals, stating that "Summer Wars is awesome in its detailed depiction of Oz, which floats in space with an array of satellites, and earthly cityscapes visited by calamities." Thomas also said the film is "also a superb example of Japanese anime, balancing science fiction fantasy with a paean to the timeless value of family life." and called it "a sophisticated yet poignant family entertainment with an appeal beyond Japanese animation buffs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thomas | first=Kevin | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-summer-wars-review-story,0,3609588.story|work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune|title=Film review: 'Summer Wars'|date = January 6, 2011 | accessdate = January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film 2 out of 4 stars.

The '''surik''' is a traditional sword of the island of [[Timor]]. The first [[coat of arms of East Timor]] depicts crossed suriks.

==Description==
The surik has a single edge blade. The width of the blade narrows from the base down to the tip. Most of the handle is made from horn, and is decorated with tassels to look tough. Goat's hair or horse's hair is attached to the handle. Carving an eye at the center of the handle is meant to strengthen its supernatural power. The sheath of this sword is made of wood.

A surik sword used along with a long curved shield is called ''surik samara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Therik|title=Wehali: The Female Land: Traditions of a Timorese Ritual Centre|year=2004|publisher=Pandanus Books|isbn=17-407-6146-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural==
For the Belu people of [[Nusa Tenggara]], the surik is considered as a sacred sword. Its supposed supernatural abilities depend on the person who wield the sword; it is believed by the people that no commoner can touch the surik, or the else the sword would turn against that person. Because of that, the community will take counsel to determine who should wield the surik before going to war.

The surik is also used in traditional dance in [[Timor]] called, ''Tari Surik Laleok'', which is meant to portray the local warrior's customs. suriks were also worn by the Meos, the foremost fighters, and usually also the most successful head-hunters of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert G Van Zonneveld|title=Traditional Weapons of the Indonesian Archipelago|url=https://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Weapons-Indonesian-Archipelago-Zonneveld/dp/9054500042/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394869874&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Traditional+Weapons+of+the+Indonesian+Archipelago|year=2002|publisher=Koninklyk Instituut Voor Taal Land|isbn=90-5450-004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where a dispute is to be settled between two parties in places like [[Maubara]] and [[Ermera]], [[East Timor]] are known as ''nahe no lulun biti'' (to open and close the mat) or ''tula mesa leten'' (to put on the table). Once it is decided which party are at fault, a form of compensation is made by a payment of money or valuable objects; and the surik in this case is also accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara Niner|title=Women and the Politics of Gender in Post-Conflict Timor-Leste: Between Heaven and Earth|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=13-173-2789-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surik also refers to another sword used by the [[Batak people]] of [[North Sumatra]], as well in other provinces such as [[West Sumatra]] and [[Jambi]] in [[Indonesia]].

'''''The Amazing Bud Powell''''', also called '''''The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1''''', is an album by [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] [[Bud Powell]], first released on Blue Note in April 1952, as a 10" vinyl. It is part of a loosely connected series with the 1954 companion ''[[The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2]]'' and the 1957 ''[[Bud! The Amazing Bud Powell (Vol. 3)]]'', all released on [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]]. The album details two recording sessions. In the first, recorded on August 9, 1949, Powell performed in quintet with [[Fats Navarro]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Tommy Potter]] and [[Roy Haynes]], and in trio with Potter and Haynes. In the second, on May 1, 1951, Powell performed in trio with [[Curley Russell]] and [[Max Roach]], and solo.

The album is critically prized among Powell's releases. Among the more discussed of the album's tracks is the pianist's composition "[[Un Poco Loco]]" ("A Little Crazy"), which has been singled out by critics and cultural historians for its musical and cultural significance.

The album was remastered and re-issued on CD in 1989 in chronological order with additional, alternate takes. This version is also available along with Powell's 1947 [[Roost Records|Roost]] session on the first disc of ''[[The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings]]'', a 4 disc box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r210470|label=The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was remastered again in 2001 by [[Rudy Van Gelder]] and re-issued as part of Blue Note's The RVG Edition series, with further expansion and reorganization.

The album is rated highly within Powell's musical library, described by ''All About Jazz'' as "among the pianist's most important recordings"&lt;ref&gt;Firehammer, John. (October 1, 2001) [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=8786 The Amazing Bud Powell Vols. 1 and 2] ''All About Jazz''. Retrieved on 2008-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...|The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz]]'' (in conjunction with volume two) as "a great introduction to this awesome pianist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Axelrod | first = Alan |author2=Alpha Development Group   | title =  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jazz | publisher = Alpha Books  | year = 1999 | page = 167   | isbn = 0-02-862731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz critic [[Scott Yanow]] characterized it in his book ''Jazz on Record'' as "full of essential music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Yanow  | first = Scott  | title = Jazz on Record: The First Sixty Years  | publisher = Backbeat Books  | year = 2003  | page = 359  | isbn = 0-87930-755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bebop: The Best Musicians and Recordings'', Yanow identifies among the highlights of the album "Bouncing with Bud", "52nd Street Theme" and "Dance of the Infidels," performed by the "very exciting quintet" of 1949, and also the 1951 trio's "three stunning versions of 'Un Poco Loco'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yanow  | first = Scott  | title = Bebop: The Best Musicians and Recordings  | publisher = Backbeat Books  | year = 2000  | pages = 62–63  | isbn = 0-87930-608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Kernfeld in ''The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz'' notes with regards to "Un Poco Loco" that "the three takes [of the song]...enable us to hear the evolution of a masterpiece",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kernfeld  | first = Barry Dean  | title = The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz  | publisher = Blackwell Publishing  | year = 1995  | page = 232  | isbn = 0-631-19552-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a label with which a critic at ''[[The New York Times]]'' concurred.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piazza |first1=Tom |title=How Two Pianists Remade (And Upheld) a Tradition |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/arts/jazz-view-how-two-pianists-remade-and-upheld-a-tradition.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 August 2018 |language=en |date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;


While the song "Un Poco Loco" has been identified as musically outstanding, it has also been discussed as culturally significant. According to ''Race Music: Black Cultures from Bebop to Hip-Hop'', although [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] had been introduced in the 1940s by such artists as [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Machito]], "Un Poco Loco" is a significant marker in the establishment of this musical genre, as it revealed "the Afro-Cuban turn settling into bebop's acceptable field of rhetorical conventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ramsey, Jr. | first = Guthrie P. |author2=Guthrie P.

== Releases ==
The album was first released in April 1952 as a 10" LP in Blue Note's 5000 series (BLP 5003). This collected together eight tracks (four from each session) that had previously been released as 78 rpm singles in 1949 and 1951: "You Go To My Head c/w Ornithology" (BN 1566), "Bouncing With Bud c/w Wail" (BN 1567), "Over The Rainbow c/w A Night In Tunisia" (BN 1576), and "Un Poco Loco c/w It Could Happen To You" (BN 1577).

In March 1956, the album was re-issued as a 12" LP (BLP 1503), with seven additional tracks (including alternate takes, then a rarity) from both sessions, while "You Go to My Head" from the first session, and "Over the Rainbow" and "It Could Happen To You" (master take) from the second were moved to ''[[The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2]]'', initiating the spread of the two sessions between the two volumes. This track listing was kept for the first digital remastering in 1985, when the album was re-issued on vinyl and cassette.

In 1989, the album was digitally remastered and released on CD. This time the tracks were listed in session chronological order, which involved "A Night in Tunisia" (both takes), "It Could Happen to You" (alternate take) and "Parisian Thoroughfare" moving to ''The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2'' and "You Go to My Head", "Ornithology" (alternate take) and "Over the Rainbow" moving back. Three further alternate takes from the 1949 session were added, completing the session on this volume. The 1951 session still straddled the two volumes.

In 2001, [[Rudy Van Gelder]] remastered the album from scratch (he'd previously been credited with disc transfers on the 1989 remaster), and the album was re-issued as part of Blue Note's The RVG Edition series. This release finally united the two complete sessions on one disc, with all second session material on ''Vol. 2'' being transferred. The track listing was also altered so that alternate takes were grouped after the master takes of each session, avoiding the somewhat relentless take repetition of the 1989 release.

'''''The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today''''' is a novel by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Charles Dudley Warner]] first published in 1873. It satirizes greed and [[political corruption]] in post–[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America. Although not one of Twain's best-known works, it has appeared in more than one hundred editions since its original publication.  Twain and Warner originally had planned to issue the novel with illustrations by [[Thomas Nast]].  The book is remarkable for two reasons–-it is the only novel Twain wrote with a collaborator, and its title very quickly became synonymous with graft, materialism, and corruption in public life. The novel gave the era its name: the period of US history from the 1870s to about 1900 is now referred to as the [[Gilded Age]].

==History of the collaboration==

[[Charles Dudley Warner]], a writer and editor, was a neighbor and good friend of [[Mark Twain]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  According to Twain's biographer, [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], their wives challenged Twain and Warner at dinner to write a better novel than what they were used to reading. Twain wrote the first eleven chapters, followed by twelve chapters written by Warner.  Most of the remaining chapters were also written by only one of them, but the concluding chapters were attributed to joint authorship.  The entire novel was completed between February and April 1873.

Contemporary critics, while praising its humor and satire, did not consider the collaboration a success because the independent stories written by each author did not mesh well.  A review published in 1874 compared the novel to a badly-mixed salad dressing, in which "the ingredients are capital, the use of them faulty."&lt;ref&gt;Budd, Louis J. ''Mark Twain: The Contemporary Reviews.'' Cambridge UP, 2011 p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The term [[gilded age]], commonly given to the era, comes from the title of this book. Twain and Warner got the name from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' (1595): "To gild refined gold, to paint the lily... is wasteful and ridiculous excess." (Act IV, scene 2) [[Gilding]] gold, which would be to put gold on top of gold, is excessive and wasteful, characteristics of the age Twain and Warner wrote about in their novel.  Another interpretation of the title, of course, is the contrast between an ideal "Golden Age" and a less worthy "Gilded Age," as gilding is only a thin layer of gold over baser metal, so the title now takes on a pejorative meaning as to the novel's time, events and people.

The novel concerns the efforts of a poor rural [[Tennessee]] family to become affluent by selling in a timely manner the {{convert|75000|acre|km2}} of [[Land improvement|unimproved]] land acquired by their patriarch, Silas "Si" Hawkins. After several adventures in Tennessee, the family fails to sell the land and Si Hawkins dies. The rest of the Hawkins story line focuses on their beautiful adopted daughter, Laura. In the early 1870s, she travels to [[Washington, D.C.]] to become a [[lobbyist]]. With a senator's help, she enters Society and attempts to persuade Congressmen to require the federal government to purchase the land.

A parallel story written by Warner concerns two young upperclass men, Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly, who seek their fortunes in land in a novel way. They make a journey with a group intent on [[surveying]] land in Tennessee in order to acquire it for [[speculation]]. Philip is good-natured but plodding. He is in love with Ruth Bolton, an aspiring physician and [[First-wave feminism|feminist]]. Henry is a born salesman, charming but superficial.

The theme of the novel is that the lust for getting rich through land speculation pervades society, illustrated by the Hawkinses as well as Ruth's well-educated father, who nevertheless cannot resist becoming enmeshed in self-evidently dubious money-making schemes.

The Hawkins sections were written by Twain; these include several humorous [[Sketch story|sketches]]. Examples are the steamboat race that leads to a wreck (Chapter IV) and Laura's toying with a clerk in a Washington bookstore (Chapter XXXVI). Notable too is the comic presence throughout the book of the eternally optimistic and eternally broke [[Wilkins Micawber|Micawber]]-like character, Colonel Beriah Sellers. The character was named Escol Sellers in the first edition and changed to Beriah when an actual [[George Escol Sellers]] of Philadelphia objected. A real Beriah Sellers then also turned up, causing Twain to use the name Mulberry Sellers in ''[[The American Claimant]]''. The Sellers character was modeled after Twain's maternal cousin, James Lampton, and the land-purchase plot parallels Twain's father's purchase of a Tennessee parcel whose prospective sale, Twain wrote in his autobiography, "kept us hoping and hoping, during 40 years, and forsook us at last."&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrison Keillor|Keillor, Garrison]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/books/review/Keillor-t.html?pagewanted=3&amp;hpw "Mark Twain’s Riverboat Ramblings"], review in ''''[[The New York Times]]'''',  December 16, 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main action of the story takes place in Washington, D.C., and satirizes the greed and corruption of the governing class. Twain also satirizes the social pretensions of the [[Nouveau riche|newly rich]]. Laura's Washington visitors include "Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay)," the wife of "a wealthy Frenchman from [[County Cork|Cork]]," indicating the O'Reilly family has altered their last name to hide their Irish origins.

The book does not touch upon other themes now associated with the "Gilded Age," such as industrialization, monopolies, and the corruption of urban [[political machine]]s. This may be because this book was written at the very beginning of the period.

In the end, Laura fails to convince Congress to purchase the Hawkins land. She kills her married lover but is found not guilty of the crime, with the help of a sympathetic jury and a clever lawyer.  However, after a failed attempt to pursue a career on the lecture circuit, her spirit is broken, and she dies regretting her fall from innocence. Washington Hawkins, the eldest son, who has drifted through life on his father's early promise that he would be "one of the richest men in the world," finally gives up the family's ownership of the still-unimproved land parcel when he cannot afford to pay its $180 of taxes. He also appears ready to overcome his passivity: "The spell is broken, the life-long curse is ended!" Philip, drawing upon his engineering skills, discovers coal on Mr. Bolton's land, wins Ruth Bolton's heart and appears destined to enjoy a prosperous and conventionally happy marriage. Henry and Sellers, presumably, will continue to live gaily by their wits while others pay their bills.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Although more than a century has passed since its publication, the novel's satirical observations of political and social life in Washington, D.C. are still pertinent.

Playwright and screenwriter [[David Mamet]], speaking of his book ''Bambi Meets Godzilla: On the Nature, Purpose and Practice of the Movie Business'', used ''The Gilded Age'' as a metaphor for Hollywood.  On an [[National Public Radio|NPR]] call-in show, Mamet drew comparisons between the Hawkins family's 40-year quest to win funding for a dam in their hometown and the plight of a young filmmaker trying to sell a script in the unforgiving studio system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=7367351 Transcript], ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' discussion with [[Neal Conan]], host, and "Keith ... from Buffalo, NY", February 12, 2007.

'''The Great Courses''' ('''TGC''') is a series of college-level audio and video courses produced and distributed by '''The Teaching Company''', an American company based in [[Chantilly, Virginia]].

== History ==
The company was founded in 1990 by Thomas M. Rollins, former Chief Counsel of the United States Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.&lt;ref name=CJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Courses, Great Profits|date=2011-06-21|work=City Journal (New York)|author=Heather Mac Donald|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/great-courses-great-profits-13393.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="katebales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kate |last=Bales |title=Ivy League Courses for Price of a Video |date=February 16, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/news/16iht-videduc.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714005930/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/news/16iht-videduc.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins had been inspired by a 10-hour videotaped lecture series he watched while at [[Harvard Law School]], and began recruiting professors and experts to record lectures.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; Rollins invested all his money in the company, at one point using up all his credit cards, selling almost all his suits from his Washington days, and living in an attic.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; Because his company was for-profit, Rollins adapted course offerings to please customers; he threw out one course because the professor constantly insulted the viewers during lectures and he asked some other professors to re-record segments that had unsupported political commentary.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; By 2000 the company was well established, with about $20M in annual revenue.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; In October 2006, the company was acquired by [[Brentwood Associates]], a private equity investment firm.&lt;ref name="NYT2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=If Its Customers Love a Business, This Equity Firm Does, Too|date=2013-07-29|work=The New York Times|author=Sarah Max|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/if-its-customers-love-a-business-this-equity-firm-does-too/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the firm had 200 employees.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; In 2016, the company offered a streaming service, charging $20 per month, and getting access via computer to about 280 courses in their catalog.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt;

The company has created over 700 courses and sold over a total of 14 million copies since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/before-youtube-and-online-classes-there-were-the-great-courses/2015/08/31/30947f08-353d-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html|title=Before YouTube and online classes, there were the Great Courses|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course categories==
Subjects include business, economics, fine arts, music, ancient and medieval history, modern history, literature and English language, philosophy and intellectual history, religion, science, mathematics, social sciences, professional development and better living.

Chief executive Paul Suijk described ''The Great Courses'' as the "[[Netflix]] of learning."&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; Courses are offered on disks which are either DVDs or CD-audio, and the courses are geared to "lifelong learners."&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; Customers tend to be older professionals and retirees who have had successful careers.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; Courses cost from $35 to over $500.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; As of 2018, there are over 600 different courses in their catalog.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; A benefit of the courses is that the person can learn without having to worry about finishing assignments or slogging through a final exam.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"&gt;{{cite web

The firm earns $150 million annually in terms of revenue, in 2016.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; In 2018, the firm has competitors in terms of [[MOOC]]s such as [[Coursera]] and [[Khan Academy]].&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt; The production quality of the courses is "a cut above" free courses offered on YouTube, according to a report in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="twsNYT11"/&gt;

The firm sometimes sends recruiters to sit in on the lectures of college professors identified as being good teachers, to assess whether they might be suitable for course development; the best prospects would do a lecture for the Teaching Company, and if enough customers liked what they saw, the company would develop the course.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; Professors submit detailed outlines for each course, and company personnel would work with them to make sure that each 30 minute lecture was coherent and logical.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt;

==Reactions==
Analyst [[Heather Mac Donald]], writing in the conservative publication ''[[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]]'', described the courses offered by ''The Teaching Company'' as more mainstream than what is offered at traditional American [[liberal arts college]]s.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; She described the course selection as being driven by market forces, with the firm's founder, Tom Rollins, querying customers as to what subjects they wanted to learn about, and using market research techniques to figure out what courses to offer, and even what lectures to include, to satisfy an intensely loyal customer base.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; As a result, there is less emphasis in the catalog on issues such as [[sexism]] and [[racism]] and more of a focus on "everything the civilization has figured out so far and to discover new things", according to Rollins.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; She writes that the survey format predominates, with few in-depth courses on specific thinkers or philosophical schools, and more emphasis on covering the fundamentals of a subject, as if it was an introductory college course.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt;
