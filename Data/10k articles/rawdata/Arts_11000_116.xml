'''American Writers Against the Vietnam War''' was an umbrella organization created in 1965 by American poets [[Robert Bly]] and [[David Ray (poet)|David Ray]]. The group organized readings, meetings and joined in rallies, teach-ins, and demonstrations against the [[Vietnam War]], allowing writers to protest under a collective identity of their own. Well-known American writers who participated in A.W.A.V.W. functions included [[Galway Kinnell]], [[W.S. Merwin]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Douglas Kent Hall]], and [[Robert Lowell]].

Bly, a charismatic performer, was a frequently seen figure on American college campuses throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s; his readings often became de facto anti-war rallies. In 1967, Bly won the [[National Book Award]] for his book of poems ''[[The Light Around the Body]]''; he used the prize money and proceeds from the book to fund the War Resistance efforts.

'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P. (2009). Axiology. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 70-74). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bamberg Horseman''' ({{lang-de|Der Bamberger Reiter}}) is a stone [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian statue]] by an anonymous [[Middle Ages|medieval]] sculptor in the [[Bamberg Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]].

== Description ==

Dating probably from the time before the consecration of the [[cathedral]]'s new building in 1237, but after 1225, it is located on a console at the north pillar of the St. George choir, it is not known whether this is the intended position of the statue although the base appears to be original and the structure of the base would seem to dissuade moving.&lt;ref&gt;P. Williamson, Gothic Sculpture, 1140-1300, 1995: pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==

Being located in a church and showing a crowned yet unarmed man, it is believed that it represents a specific king, perhaps one who was a saint.  A candidate is [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] (973-1024) who is buried in the cathedral along with [[Pope Clement II]], but he would likely have been depicted with [[Imperial Regalia]]. Another possibility is his brother-in-law, king [[Stephen I of Hungary]] (975-1038) who stops his horse and looks towards the tomb of Henry.  Another theory favours [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the time, who financed much of the rebuilding of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Valentiner, ''The Bamberg Rider: Studies of Mediaeval German Sculpture'', Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, 1956 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=5833510 online excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another theory, supported by Hannes Möhring of the [[University of Bayreuth]], holds that the figure represents the [[Messiah]] according to the [[Book of Revelation]] (19:11–16).

It is considered the first monumental equestrian statue since [[classical antiquity]], and also one of the first to depict a [[horse shoe]]. Beneath the horse's front hooves is one of the many sculptural representations of the [[Green Man]]. [[Kathleen Basford]], in her study of these figures, calls this Green Man the "dark counterpart" of the horseman.

'''Caran d'Ache''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manufacturer of school, office, art and luxury [[writing instrument]]s.

== History ==
The ''Fabrique genevoise de crayons'' was founded in [[Geneva]] in 1915 when Arnold Schweitzer purchased the Ecridor Pencil Factory. In 1924, Arnold Schweitzer named his new company after [[Caran d'Ache]], the nickname of the French satiric political cartoonist Emmanuel Poiré (who in turn took his name from [[:wikt:карандаш#Russian|карандаш]] (''karandash''), the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for [[pencil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carandache.ch/m/la-maison/l-histoire/index.lbl |title=CARAN d'ACHE &gt; La Maison &gt; La Maison &gt; Histoire |publisher=Carandache.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029175803/http://www.carandache.ch/m/la-maison/l-histoire/index.lbl |archivedate=2011-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Carl Schmid invented the ''Fixpencil'', one of the first [[mechanical pencil]]s which has been trademarked by Caran d'Ache. Caran d'Ache launched its watercolour pencil ''Prismalo'' in 1931 and its wax pastel ''Neocolor'' in 1952. In 1969, it created its emblematic office metal ballpoint pen ''849''.

In 2012, Caran d'Ache changed distributors from Letts [[Filofax]] Group Ltd to [[Victorinox]] AG.

[[File:Dijon - Chartreuse de Champmol, crucifixion.jpg|thumb|Each of the choir monks had one of these paintings in his hermitage, probably as the only decoration. [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].]] 
The '''Chartreuse de Champmol''', formally the ''Chartreuse de la Sainte-Trinité de Champmol'', was a [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]] on the outskirts of [[Dijon]], which is now in France, but in the 15th century was the capital of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. The monastery was founded in 1383 by Duke [[Philip the Bold]] to provide a dynastic burial place for the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Dukes of Burgundy#House of Valois .281361-1482.29|Dukes of Burgundy]],&lt;ref name="Vaughan, 202"&gt;Vaughan, 202&lt;/ref&gt; and operated until it was dissolved in 1791, during the [[French Revolution]].  Called "the grandest project in a reign renowned for extravagance",&lt;ref&gt;Sherry C. M. Lindquist, "Accounting for the Status of Artists at the Chartreuse de Champmol" ''Gesta'' '''41'''.1, "Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages" (2002:15-28 p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; it was lavishly enriched with works of art, and the dispersed remnants of its collection remain key to the understanding of the art of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Some works formerly at Champmol and documentation, were assembled for the exhibition "Chartreuse de Champmol", Dijon, 1960, with a catalogue containing essays by scholars of the calibre of Millard Meiss and [[Colin Eisler]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Purchase of the land and quarrying of materials began in 1377, but construction did not begin until 1383,&lt;ref name="Vaughan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UodeaJtXQoMC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=Champmol&amp;as_brr=3 Vaughan, 202]. The complex and unwieldy bureaucratic structure, providing "a rare view into artistic production at a major centre" (p 15), was analyzed from copious surviving accounts by Sherry C. M. Lindquist, "Accounting for the Status of Artists at the Chartreuse de Champmol" ''Gesta'' '''41'''.1, "Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages" (2002), pp. 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; under the architect [[Druet de Dammartin]] from Paris, who had previously designed the Duke's chateau at [[Sluis]], and been an assistant in work at the [[Louvre]]. According to [[James C. Snyder|James Snyder]] his work at Champmol was "a somewhat conservative modification of the Late Gothic buildings of Paris".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  A committee of councillors from Dijon supervised the construction for the Duke, who was often elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Vaughan" /&gt; By 1388 the church was consecrated, and most construction probably completed.  The monastery was built for twenty-four [[choir monk]]s, instead of the usual twelve in a Carthusian house,&lt;ref name="Vaughan, 202" /&gt; and two more were endowed to celebrate the birth in 1433 of [[Charles the Bold]].&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  These lived semi-hermitic lives in their individual small houses when not in the chapel.  There would also have been non-ordained monks, servants, novices, and other workers.

When founded, Champmol was "two arrow shots" outside the city gates,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lindquist (2002), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; but is now inside the modern city boundaries. At this time the city had about 10,000 inhabitants and was the largest in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] proper, though smaller than the cities of the territories in the Netherlands recently inherited by the Duke through his wife.  But Burgundy was held more securely than the often turbulent cities in the north, and represented the senior title of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Gelfand (2005), 571&lt;/ref&gt;  Over sixty members of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] [[House of Burgundy]], whom the Valois had succeeded in 1361, only two decades earlier, had been buried at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] to the south of Dijon. Champmol was intended to rival Cîteaux, [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where the Kings of France were buried, and other dynastic burial places.

Somewhat in contradiction to the Carthusian mission of tranquil contemplation, visitors and pilgrims were encouraged, the expenses of hospitality recompensed by the Dukes.  In 1418 Papal [[indulgence]]s were granted to those visiting the [[Well of Moses]], further encouraging pilgrims.  The ducal family had a private [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] overlooking the church (now destroyed), though their visits were in fact rare.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The ducal accounts, which have fortunately survived, show major commissions for paintings and other works to complete the monastery continuing until about 1415, and further works were added after that at a slower rate by the Dukes and other donors.

The  accounts for Champmol have survived in sufficient detail that Martin Warnke&lt;ref&gt;Warnke, ''The Court Artist: On the Ancestry of the Modern Artist'' (Cambridge University Press), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; synthesized from them a view of the emerging status of [[Court painter|court artist]]s, and "the autonomous consciousness of art and artists"&lt;ref&gt;Warnke 1993:xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; that would distinguish the world of art in the [[Early modern period]].

==Tombs of the Dukes==
The Valois dynasty of Burgundy had less than a century to run when the monastery was founded, and the number of tombs never approached that of their Capetian predecessors at Cîteaux - indeed there would hardly have been room in the choir of the church, where the monuments were.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 13 has an 18th-century print of them in their original setting&lt;/ref&gt; Only two monuments were ever erected,&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, 17&lt;/ref&gt; both in the same style with painted [[alabaster]] effigies with lions at their feet and angels with spread wings at their heads. Underneath the slab the effigies rested on, unpainted small (about 40&amp;nbsp;cm high) [[Mourners of Dijon|"pleurants"]] or mourners ("weepers" is the traditional English term) were set among Gothic [[tracery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claus Sluter and Claus de Werve, Mourners, from the Tomb of Philip the Bold|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/claus-sluter-and-claus-de-werve-mourners-from-the-tomb-of-philip-the-bold.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=13 January 2013|author=Beth Harris|author2=Steven Zucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were described by [[Johan Huizinga]] in ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' as "the most profound expression of mourning known in art, a funeral march in stone".&lt;ref&gt;Page 235 in this [https://archive.org/stream/waningofthemiddl007061mbp/waningofthemiddl007061mbp_djvu.txt online edition].  Snyder 67-69 has a full description.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Dijon - Tombeau des ducs de Bourgogne 2.jpg|thumb|The tombs of the Dukes, now moved to the "Salle de Garde" of their palace in Dijon.]]

Philip the Bold died in 1404, and his wife [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders]] the following year.  She had decided to rest her remains with those of her parents in [[Lille]], and Philip had been planning a single monument for himself for over twenty years, having commissioned [[Jean de Marville]] in 1381. Work did not begin until 1384, and proceeded slowly, with [[Claus Sluter]] being put in charge in 1389.  At the Duke's death in 1404, only two mourners and the framework were complete; John the Fearless gave Sluter four years to finish the job, but he died after two. His nephew and assistant, [[Claus de Werve]] took over and finished the sculptures in 1410.  The effigies were painted by Malouel.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

John expressed a wish for his own tomb, this time a double one with his Duchess [[Margaret of Bavaria]], to resemble that of his father, but nothing was done, even after his death in 1419, until 1435, and in 1439 de Werve died without having managed to find suitable [[alabaster]].  In 1443 a Spaniard, Jean de La Huerta, was contracted, and sent drawings for the effigies. He completed most elements, but not the effigies, before leaving Dijon in 1456. Yet another master was brought in, and the monument finally installed in 1470, by which time Philip the Good was himself dead.  He seems to have made no provision for a monument for himself, and had initially been buried in [[Bruges]], where he died.  His son Charles the Bold had the remains brought back to Champmol after some years, but no monument was ever planned. Charles himself was relocated from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] to Bruges by his great-grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The second tomb repeats the design of the first, but with their execution spanning almost a century, stylistic differences can be seen, although some of the "pleurants" of the second tomb copy those of the first exactly.&lt;ref name="Dossier, p. 17"&gt;Dossier, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recorded that Philip the Good had a portrait of himself placed in the choir, where there were already those of the previous two Dukes.  None of these are believed to have survived in the original, but surviving portraits may be copies of them.

After the Revolution, and the sale of the monastery, the tombs were carefully moved to [[Dijon Cathedral]] in 1792, as their historic importance was recognised.  But in the following year the cathedral was converted into a [[Temple of Reason]] and the effigies were vandalised, so that what are now seen are reconstructions. Many elements, including ten "pleurants", were removed by genteel looters.&lt;ref name="Dossier, p. 17" /&gt;

==Works of art from Champmol==
[[File:Melchior Broederlam 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Melchior Broederlam]], ''Annunciation and Visitation'' (1393–1399), left panel of a pair; ([[Dijon]], Musée des Beaux-Arts)]]

[[File:Henri Bellechose 001.jpg|thumb|right|''The Last Communion and Martyrdom of Saint Denis'', by [[Henri Bellechose]], 1416. [[Louvre]]]]
Champmol was designed as a showpiece, and the artistic contents, now dispersed, represent much of the finest monumental work, as opposed to [[illuminated manuscript]]s, of French and Burgundian art of the period.  Without the works that remained at Champmol until the 18th century, [[Claus Sluter]], [[Jacques de Baerze]], [[Melchior Broederlam]], [[Henri Bellechose]], [[Jean Malouel]], and [[Jean de Beaumetz]] would remain only names known from documentary records.

===Still at Champmol===
There are very important sculptures by [[Claus Sluter]] and his workshop on the church portal, including kneeling figures of Philip and his Duchess.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 65-66 has a full description&lt;/ref&gt;    The lower parts of the [[Well of Moses]] (''Puits de Moise'') survive, including six life-size figures of the [[Old Testament]] prophets who foretold the [[Messiah]], most of the rest having been destroyed, apparently more by weathering than the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Dijon museums===
Most items are in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, including its site in the former palace of the Dukes. The fragments from the Well of Moses and other similar pieces are in the Archaeological Museum. The following are only the main works in Dijon:

*Two painted and gilded carved wood [[retable]]s, that are almost the only remaining works by the Flemish sculptor [[Jacques de Baerze]], and also the only complete Netherlandish carved altarpieces before the late 15th century.  The outer panels of the larger are the only surviving paintings by [[Melchior Broederlam]], and highly important works for tracing the development of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].  Broederlam also painted and gilded the carvings by de Baerze.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, pp. 72-3 and 292-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*The tombs (in fact always [[cenotaph]]s) of the Dukes of Burgundy; the museum has the tombs of Philip the Bold and his son [[John the Fearless]] with his wife [[Margaret of Bavaria]].  The effigies are 19th-century reconstructions, from old drawings and prints, of the originals which were destroyed in the Revolution. About ten of the "pleurants" are also copies of originals liberated or lost.
*The funerary crown of Philip the Bold, in [[brass]] and glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.clevelandart.org/node/280268 funerary crown]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The head and torso of the crucified Christ from the Well of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Chartreuse de Champmol Calvaire tête du christ en croix.JPG|Photo of carved Christ]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''Retable of Saint George'', an early-15th-century painted altarpiece, probably donated by one of the monks, whose [[donor portrait]] appears at the foot of the crucified Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
*One of the crucifixions from the two hermitages added in 1433.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two altarpieces by [[Charles-André van Loo]], which replaced older works (one the ''Retable of Saint George'') in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Madonna is described in detail in: Gelfand (1994), pp. 41-47. The work was originally published, attributed and proposed as half a diptych in: Meiss, Millard, and Colin Eisler. "A New French Primitive." The Burlington Magazine 102 (1960): 234 ff. (not seen).  Gelfand (p.44) prefers the theory that a portrait of Philip the Bold sighted there in 1791 was the companion to the Berlin Madonna.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the only other one of the 24 paintings by Jean de Beaumetz to survive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1964.454 Cleveland Beaumetz]&lt;/ref&gt; and four "pleurant" figures from Philip's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/magazine/cleveland-art-2012-highlights/medieval-masterpieces Cleveland pleurants]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Dijon - Chartreuse de Champmol 14.jpg|thumb|left|The monastery today, with the truncated church.]]
After the death in 1477 of Charles the Bold, Burgundy proper was recovered by force by France; the Kings, still descended from the Dukes via the Habsburgs and other routes, continued to support and occasionally visit the monastery.  There was slight damage in the siege of Dijon in 1513 and in the [[French Wars of Religion]], but essentially the monastery remained in its 15th-century state until it was decided to update it in the 1770s.  The altarpieces of Saints Denis  and George had been replaced by new paintings by [[Charles-André van Loo]] in 1741; both the new paintings are now in the Dijon museum.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, pp. 19-20 and 22, with pictures.&lt;/ref&gt;  Remodelling in the 1770s involved the destruction of some medieval parts, but greater destruction followed the French Revolution.  The monastery was suppressed in 1791, and on May 4, five days after the monks departed, the buildings and land were bought by [[Emmanuel Crétet]] (1747–1808), later to be Minister of the Interior under Napoleon with the title Comte de Champmol.  He destroyed large parts of the buildings and the church.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1833 the estate was bought by the local [[département]] as a mental asylum, and many new buildings erected.&lt;ref&gt;Dossier, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the buildings house a psychiatric hospital, and "aller à la chartreuse" is a local phrase for developing a mental disorder.  The Sluter sculptures can be seen by visitors, and many of the contents are in the Dijon museum, with the tombs and carved retables housed in the former Palace of the Dukes.

'''Collezione Farnesina Experimenta''' is a bilingual book ([[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]]) that assembles and catalogues the eighty works (reproduced in colour) of the [[Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection]], housed in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]].

Along with exhibitions of the collection that are promoted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the aim of the volume is to valorize and make known contemporary Italian art, by supporting those generations of artists who made names for themselves from the nineties to the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Collezione Farnesina - Experimenta Ministero degli Affari Esteri Roma|url = http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/73598|website = 1995-2015.undo.net|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The volume==
In addition to being a catalogue of the works, the volume contains biographical entries of the artists and four critical essays:
*''What is its Function? '' by Maurizio Calvesi,
*''Experiments For The Future'' by Lorenzo Canova,
*''The Perception Of Young Italian Art'' by Marco Meneguzzo,
*''Contemporary Paradigms'' by Marisa Vescovo,
which reveal how Italian contemporary art still shows a capacity to be reborn, to find a new meaning and new energies for facing the complexity of its own historical moment, by combining elements of the country’s prolific artistic history with the most evolved inclinations of contemporaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 File card] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072050/http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 |date=2011-07-11 }} on Gangemi Editore website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">The '''Comédie de Port-au-Prince''', also called ''Salle Mesplés'', was a theater in [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Saint-Domingue]], active from 1778 to 1791. 

The city of Port-au-Prince had been founded as the official capital of the colony in 1750.  At this point, theater and music was immensely popular in the colony and frequented by most free people of all races and classes, and public theaters existed in not only [[Cap-Francais]] but also in smaller towns such as the theaters of [[Mlle Marthe]] and Mlle Francheville in Saint-Marc (1769-1802), Monsieur Passete in Leogane (1760s) and Monsieur Charpentier in Les Cayes (1765-88), and it was considered necessary to have one in the new capital city. 

In 1762, a first theater was managed by the three joint-directors Rouzier, Claude Clement and Charpentier, but it did not last.  A permanent theater was finnally established by the theater director Francois Mesplete (d. 1784), who founded the Comédie de Port-au-Prince in 1778. It was a playhouse with room for 750 people.  The theater offerred regular performances of drama, opera and music concerts until the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791, and became an important cultural center.  

The theater employed a stock company of eight actors, eight actresses, eleven musicians, a prompter, a stage manager, a decorator, a tailor, a hairdresser, four porters and a clerk. Francois Mesplete was succeeded in 1784 by Monsieur Acquaire, whose wife the singer-actress [[Madame Acquaire]] (previously Mlle Babet) had been a director of the local amateur theater in Gonaive, are known as the mentor of the famous [[Minette et Lise]]. Another star attraction of the theater was the violinist Monsieur Petit. 

After the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]], Acquaire resigned his position as director to Monsieur Blainville and joined his wife in France. Blainville attempted to use the theater as a venue to reconcile the tensions of the colony during the revolution, an attempt which was well received as the activity of the theater was reportedly in full operation right up until the night of the 22 November 1791, when Port-au-Prince was attacked and burnt, during which the theater was among the buildings destroyed.

{{wiktionary|connoisseur}}
A '''connoisseur''' ([[French language|French]] [[Reforms of French orthography|traditional]] (pre-1835) spelling of ''connaisseur'', from Middle-French ''connoistre'', then ''connaître'' meaning "to be acquainted with" or "to know somebody/something.") is a person who has a great deal of [[knowledge]] about the [[fine arts]], [[cuisine]]s, or an expert judge in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]].  In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly [[irony|ironic]] sense, but in the [[art trade]] connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique, where documentary evidence of [[provenance]] is lacking.  The situation in the [[wine trade]] is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through [[wine tasting]].

==Connoisseurship in art==
"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorynews.com/articles/1101_On_connoisseurship |title=On Connoisseurship| first=Bendor| last=Grosvenor |website=Arthistorynews.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connoisseurs evaluate works of [[art]] on the basis of their experience of the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique of artists. Judgment informed by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of [[empirical evidence]], refinement of [[perception]] about [[wikt:technique|technique]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to [[:wikt:attribute|attribute]] [[authorship]], validate [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the [[art valuation|valuation of works]], and can be collected and organized into a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of the work of a single [[artist]] or a [[art school|school]].

In his ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (1955), [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains the difference between a connoisseur and an [[art historian]]: "The connoisseur might be defined as a [[laconic]] art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur."

The English dealer and art historian, [[Philip Mould]] says, "it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/moversshakers/qa-bbcs-art-sleuth-philip-mould/1469.article |title=Interview by Gabriella Griffith |publisher=Londonlovesbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|date=2009|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, [[Bendor Grosvenor]] takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment.&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"/&gt; [[Svetlana Alpers]] confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alpers|Alpers, Svetlana]], "Style is What You Make It", p. 139, in ''The Concept of Style'', ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgiUuMCOmOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Concept+of+Style,+ed.+Berel+Lang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXY8Ue2pAcSS7Ab5q4HgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Concept%20of%20Style%2C%20ed.%20Berel%20Lang&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, [[Christie's]] Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.edu/ny_ma_modconnhist.html |title=Christie's MA course components |publisher=Christies.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers "the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums."

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend [[critic]].

In 1760, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] said, "[[Painting]] is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour."

In 1890, [[Giovanni Morelli]] wrote, "art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art."

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of [[gastronomy]], i.e. in connection with fine [[food]], [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]] and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Connaisseur|"Connaisseur" in its original French]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/Connaisseur |title='Connaisseur' in the '&amp;#39;Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'&amp;#39;, 3rd meaning |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">The '''Cresson Traveling Scholarship''', also known as the '''William Emlen Cresson Memorial Traveling Scholarship''', is a two-year scholarship for foreign travel and/or study awarded annually to art students at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Awarded for excellence, the prize was funded by Emlen and Priscilla Cresson in memory of their son William Emlen Cresson, an Academy alumnus who died in 1868 at the age of 23.

The first Cresson Traveling Scholarships were awarded in 1902. Initially, they were $1,000 one-year scholarships, renewable for a second year, and sometimes beyond. Multiple awards were given in painting, along with one in sculpture and one in architecture. Awards in illustration were added later.

Cresson European Scholarships of $5000 for summer travel, were also awarded annually. These were not as prestigious as the two-year scholarships, with which they are often confused. 

[[Laura Wheeler Waring]], the first African-American woman to win a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, was studying in Paris in 1914 when [[World War I]] broke out. Subsequent winners were allowed to postpone their travel until the conflict was over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rd0T303qF90C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=winners+%22Cresson+Traveling+Scholarship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kOV98S13_a&amp;sig=5D1uMx0no6CYXqaOMCoiVQApHyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gc9oUfDBHea-2AXchIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=winners%20%22Cresson%20Traveling%20Scholarship%22&amp;f=false Pennsylvania impressionism - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Case of Molaise's Gospels.png|thumb|Main face of the cumdach for Molaise's Gospels, 11th century]]

A '''cumdach''' ({{IPA-sga|ˈkuṽdax}}) or '''book shrine''' is an elaborate ornamented box or case used as a [[reliquary]] to enshrine books regarded as [[relic]]s of the saints who had used them in [[Early Medieval Ireland]]. They are normally later than the book they contain, often by several centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, xliv&lt;/ref&gt; typically the book comes from the heroic age of [[Christian monasticism#Ireland|Irish monasticism]] before 800, and the surviving cumdachs date from after 1000, although it is clear the form dates from considerably earlier. Several were then considerably reworked in the Gothic period. The usual form is a design based on a cross on the main face, with use of large gems of [[rock crystal]] or other [[semi-precious]] stones, leaving the spaces between the arms of the cross for more varied decoration. Several were carried on a chain or cord, often suspended round the neck, which by placing them next to the heart was believed to bring spiritual and perhaps medical benefits (the same was done with the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] in a leather bag in medieval [[Durham, England|Durham]]). They were also used to witness contracts. Many had hereditary lay keepers from among the chiefly families who had formed links with monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 262&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving examples are now in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] ("NMI").
[[File:"Book of Dimma" Shrine MET tem08233s1.jpg|thumb|Cumdach of the [[Book of Dimma]], 20th-century reproduction of front]]

Only five early examples survive, including those of the [[Book of Dimma]] and [[Book of Mulling]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and the [[Cathach of St. Columba]] and [[Stowe Missal]] at the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (the former's cumdach is in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]). Only the cumdach for the Gospels of St Molaise survives, while the book is lost, but more often the reverse is the case. Other books such as the [[Book of Kells]], [[Book of Armagh]] and Book of Durrow are known to have once had either cumdachs or [[treasure binding]]s, or both, but with their valuable precious metals they were a natural target for looters and thieves. The church in Ireland emphasised relics that were, or were thought to be, objects frequently used by monastic saints, rather than the body parts preferred by most of the church, although these were also kept in local versions of the house-shaped [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]] form, such as the Scottish [[Monymusk Reliquary]].&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 129–130, 134–140&lt;/ref&gt; Another Irish speciality was the [[bell-shrine]], encasing the hand bells used to summon the community to services or meals, and one of the earliest reliquaries enshrined the belt of an unknown saint, and was probably worn as a test of truthfulness and to cure illness. It probably dates to the 8th century and was found in a [[peat bog]] near [[Moylough]], [[County Sligo]].&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 183; Youngs, 58–59, 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumdachs are to be distinguished from the metalwork [[treasure binding]]s that probably covered most grand liturgical books of the period—the theft and loss of that covering the [[Book of Kells]] (if it was not a cumdach alone) is recorded.  However the designs may well have been very similar; the best surviving Insular example, the lower cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]] in the [[Morgan Library]] in New York, is also centred on a large cross, surrounded by interlace panels.  Treasure bindings were metalwork assemblies tacked onto the wooden boards of a conventional [[bookbinding]], so essentially the same technically as the faces of many cumdachs, which are also attached with tacks to a core wooden box.

==The surviving examples==
Several of the earliest documented examples have now been lost: the Book of Durrow's is mentioned below, and the Book of Kells lost its cumdach when it was stolen in 1006.  The [[Book of Armagh]] was covered in 937, and perhaps lost its cover when it was captured in battle and ransomed by the Norman [[John de Courcy]] in 1177.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, 76&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the surviving examples have high-quality early 20th century reproductions in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, which are not on display there, but have good illustrations available online, unlike the original pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Bought with the [[Jacob S. Rogers|Rogers Fund]] in 1908; see individual links below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented example was made to house and protect the [[Book of Durrow]] at the behest of [[King of Ireland]] [[Flann Sinna]] ([[877 in Ireland|879]]–[[916 in Ireland|916]]), by which point it was at Durrow, and believed to be a relic of [[Colum Cille]].  The shrine was lost in the 17th century, but its appearance, including an inscription recording the king's patronage, is recorded in a note from 1677, now bound into the book as folio IIv, although other inscriptions are not transcribed. Once in the shrine it was probably rarely if ever removed for use as a book.&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine known as the ''[[Domhnach Airgid]]'' ("silver church") was originally 8th century, but little is visible from before a major reworking around 1350 by the abbot of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]].  A fully three-dimensional figure of Christ crucified is at the centre of the main face, with [[relief]] plaques of saints and the Virgin and Child, and other scenes on the sides which combine principal figures in relief and others in [[engraving]].  The style is rather more sophisticated than in some 14th century reworkings, with elegant running animals on small mounts at the corners, and the goldsmith who signed it, John O Bardan, is recorded living at [[Drogheda]]; by now goldsmiths in Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe, were usually laymen (NMI, R2834, 16.7&amp;nbsp;cm high).&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 261–262, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest cumdach surviving largely in its original form is that made in the early 11th century for the gospels of Saint [[Molaise]] (NMI, R4006, 14.75&amp;nbsp;cm high, 11.70 wide) with the typical construction of a wooden core to which metal plaques are nailed.  The top face is mainly silvered bronze and [[silver-gilt]] and has the four [[symbols of the Evangelists]] in the spaces between a cross, with gold [[filigree]] [[knotwork]] panels.&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 233&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reproduction in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003003 MMA reproduction], with good pictures&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the best-known is the cumdach for the [[Cathach of St. Columba]], an important [[psalter]] which in fact seems to date from just after the death of [[Columba]] or Colum Cille in 597, but is still probably the earliest Irish book to survive and a very prestigious relic.  It belonged to the [[O'Donnell dynasty]] and was famously carried by them as a battle standard (''Cathach'' means "Battler") in its cumdach (NMI, R2835, 25.1&amp;nbsp;cm wide), hung round the neck.  The initial work on the case was done between 1072 and 1098 at [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], but a new main face was added in the 14th century with a large seated [[Christ in Majesty]] flanked by scenes of the Crucifixion and saints in gilt [[repoussé]] (NMI R2835, 25.1&amp;nbsp;cm wide).&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 233, 269; Stokes, 79; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003009 Reproduction in New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cumdach used in battle was that of the ''Moisach'', from [[Clonmany]], [[County Donegal]], whose metal cord survives for carrying it, probably round the neck.  Originally late 11th century, it was recovered in 1534 with repoussé silver decoration with many figures round a cross (NMI 2001:84, 25&amp;nbsp;cm wide).  The manuscript inside was originally associated with St Cairneach of [[Dulane]], [[County Meath]], but by the Gothic period had been "absorbed into the cult of St Columba".&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

The cumdach of the [[Book of Dimma]] is from the 12th century, again with a reproduction in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170002986 New York reproduction]&lt;/ref&gt; On one face it has panels of [[openwork]] decoration in Viking [[Viking art#Ringerike Style|Ringerike]] style. Like the manuscript, it is in [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] Library, Dublin.

===Stowe Missal===
[[File:Book or Shrine, Cumdach of the Stowe Missal MET tem12412s1 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Modern replica of the older face of the [[Stowe Missal]] cumdach.]]
The [[Stowe Missal]] of about 750 retains its cumdach, with metalwork plaques attached with nails to a wooden core of [[oak]] (NMI 1883:614a, 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm high, 15.8 wide).  The metalwork is elaborately decorated, with some animal and human figures, and one face and the sides probably date to between 1027 and 1033, on the basis of inscriptions recording its donation and making, while the other face is later, and can be dated to about 1375, again from its inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Floinn, "Description"; Warner, xliv – lvii, Plates I – VI; Stokes, 78; [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3532/3247595327_34c830d099.jpg older face from Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;

The older "lower" face, which is currently detached from the case, is in [[silver-gilt]] copper alloy, with a large cross inside a border that carries the inscription in Irish, which also runs along the arms of the cross.  The centre of the cross was later replaced ("severely embellished" as the National Museum put it),&lt;ref&gt;Wallace 234&lt;/ref&gt; probably at the same time as the later face, by a setting for a large stone (now missing) with four lobed sections, similar to the centre of the lower face. The inscription has missing sections because of this, but can mostly be reconstructed: "It asks for a prayer for the abbot of Lorrha, Mathgamain Ua Cathail (+1037) and for [[Find Ua Dúngalaigh]], king of [[Múscraige Tíre]] (+1033). It also mentions [[Donnchadh mac Briain]], styled 'king of Ireland' and [[Mac Raith Ua Donnchada]], king of the [[Eoganacht]] of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] (+1052) as well as the name of the maker, Donnchadh Ua Taccáin [a monk] 'of the community of Cluain ([[Clonmacnoise]])'."&lt;ref&gt;Ó Floinn&lt;/ref&gt; The four spaces between cross and border have panels of geometric [[openwork]] decoration, and there are small panels with [[knotwork]] decoration at the corners of the border and inside the curved ends of the cross members.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 219, 234, 253; Stokes, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The sides have unsilvered copper alloy plaques with figures of angels, animals, clergy and warriors, set in decorative backgrounds. The newer "upper" face, of [[silver-gilt]], is again centred on a cross with a large oval [[rock crystal]] stone at the centre and lobed surrounds, and other gems. The inscription, engraved on plain silver plaques, runs round the border and the spaces between cross and border have four engraved figures of the crucified Christ, Virgin and Child, a bishop making a blessing gesture, and a cleric holding a book (possibly St John).  The inscription "invokes a prayer for Pilib Ó Ceinnéidigh, 'king of Ormond' and his wife Áine, both of whom died in 1381. It also refers to Giolla Ruadhán Ó Macáin, abbot of the Augustinian priory of Lorrha and the maker, Domhnall Ó Tolairi".&lt;ref&gt;Ó Floinn; Wallace, 271, 294&lt;/ref&gt; Black [[niello]] is used to bring out the engraved lines of the inscription and figures, and the technique is very similar to that of the later work on the [[Shrine of Saint Patrick's Tooth]] (also in the NMI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003005 and with a reproduction in New York]&lt;/ref&gt; which was also given a makeover in the 1370s, for a patron some 50&amp;nbsp;km from Lorrha.  They were probably added to by the same artist, something that can only rarely be seen in the few survivals of medieval [[goldsmith]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 262–263&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Franklin''' is an art historian with expertise in Italian Renaissance art, a [[curator]], and a former art museum director.

==Thomson Collection==
David Franklin is employed by the Thomson Collection in Toronto, Ontario. On April 8, 2015, he gave his first public lecture under this affiliation at the National Gallery of Canada's Wednesday Morning Lecture Series, focusing his remarks on Piero de Cosimo's painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beaux-arts.ca/documents/content/Wednesday_Lectures_2014-15.pdf; see his related essay, "Piero di Cosimo and the Painting of his Time," in ''Piero di Cosimo: the Poetry of Painting in Renaissance Florence'', Washington, National Gallery, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin helped plan the Canadian Photography Institute, which has promised gifts from David Thomson and major funding from Bank of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/national-gallery-creates-new-photography-institute-with-aid-from-scotiabank-david-thomson/article27506410/|title=Thomson, Scotiabank team up for new photo institute at National Gallery|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/cpi/|title=Canadian Photography Institute|author=|date=|website=www.Gallery.ca|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an editor of ''The Canadians'' (2016), a selection of photographs from ''The Globe and Mail'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/photography-book-the-canadians-a-kind-of-reimagining-of-the-americans/article31468672/|title=Photography book The Canadians a kind of reimagining of The Americans|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}}

==Cleveland Museum of Art==
Franklin was named director of the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in 2010. While Franklin was Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, a donation of $1,000,000 was made by Leigh Carter in 2013 to the museum's endowment to fund a permanent fellowship to help the museum's director conduct research on special art historical projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/09/former_bf_goodrich_president_l.html|title=Former B.F. Goodrich president Leigh Carter donates $1 million to the Cleveland Museum of Art for research|author=|date=September 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-year tenure, Franklin abruptly resigned on October 21, 2013, citing personal reasons and a need "to do more research and writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_direct_1.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin resigns for personal reasons, effective immediately|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the Cleveland Scene revealed that Franklin (married with two children) had been in a romantic relationship with an employee of the museum. The board of directors at the museum had been made aware of the affair when the employee was found to have apparently committed suicide in her Cleveland Heights apartment, shortly after she and Franklin were supposed to have travelled to Spain together, and one week before they were supposed to travel to Italy. According to police reports, David Franklin called the 911 himself and was the only person present at the scene. When police came to investigate the suspicious death, Franklin lied to the officers, pretending having received a text message from the woman, which, according to the Police, never happened. He claimed to have run to the apartment after receiving this text message and to have discovered the body by entering the apartment through an open door. In the course of the investigation, it became apparent that the employee's digital camera and cell phone were missing. Police have also discovered that a major transfer of data had been done from the woman's phone shortly after she was found dead. As the family could not believe many details of the reported story, a detective was assigned to further investigate the death and Franklin's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/31/david-franklin-lied-to-cleveland-heights-police-the-night-he-found-christina-gastons-body|title=David Franklin Lied to Cleveland Heights Police the Night He Found Christina Gaston's Body|first=Sam|last=Allard|date=October 31, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this revelation came to the attention of the board, Franklin was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_confir.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art confirms that an extramarital affair led to David Franklin's resignation as director|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/23/former-cleveland-museum-of-art-director-david-franklin-resigns-after-affair-suicide-cell-phone-of-victim-missing|title=Former Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin Resigns After Affair, Suicide; Cell Phone of Victim Missing|first=Vince|last=Grzegorek|date=October 23, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Gallery of Canada==
Previously, Franklin served as deputy director of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Litt&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html "David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art"], Steven Litt, August 27, 2010, ''Plain Dealer''.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at the National Gallery of Canada for twelve years, beginning as the curator of prints and eventually rising to the post of deputy director and chief curator. In 2009, the National Gallery of Canada Foundation received a donation from the philanthropists Donald and Beth Sobey for The Donald and Beth Sobey Chief Curator’s Research Endowment. While at the National Gallery, Franklin became involved in a controversy involving the firing of a subordinate. His action of completely removing emails, by deleting emails from his system's trash, was seen as a move to remove evidence of wrongful termination. Franklin denied this. He was removed from his post, and after suing the institution, was restored to his position, before being fired a second time, a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/arts/design/29gall.html|title=Controversy and Court Filings at the National Gallery of Canada|first=Ian|last=Austen|date=December 28, 2008|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=www.NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html|title=David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art|author=|date=August 2010|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Exposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Narrative exposition''' is the insertion of important background information within a [[narrative|story]]; for example, information about the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]], characters' [[backstory|backstories]], prior plot events, historical context, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= |year=2009|title=Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Literature 2009–2010 Edition|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|page=60|isbn=1-4195-5261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a specifically literary context, exposition appears in the form of [[expository writing]] embedded within the narrative. Exposition is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[description]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narrative mode|narration]], as elucidated by [[Alexander Bain]] and John Genung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carlota S.|title=Modes of Discourse: The Local Structure of Texts|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78169-5|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okPPSq1G1OQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Bain+and+genung#v=onepage&amp;q=Bain%20and%20genung&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.

&lt;!-- THIS SECTION ACTUALLY IS ABOUT "INCLUING"—NOT "INCLUDING."  PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE EDITING. --&gt;
'''Indirect exposition''', sometimes called '''incluing''', is a technique of [[worldbuilding]] in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to ''clue'' the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through [[Dialogue in writing|dialogues]], [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], characters' thoughts,&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51" /&gt; background details, [[in-universe]] media,&lt;ref name="Morrell 2006 64"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing|first=Jessica Page|last=Morrell |publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=64|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58297-393-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the narrator telling a [[backstory]].&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plot|first=Ansen|last=Dibell|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, OH|year= 1988|isbn=0-89879-303-3|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|title=Building Better Plots|first=Robert|last=Kernen|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, Ohio|page=51|year=1999|isbn=0-89879-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of saying "I am a woman", a first person narrator can say "I kept the papers inside my purse." The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsimon.com/wwg_exposition_v2.php The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the "Dean of Science Fiction", [[Robert A. Heinlein#Writing style|Robert Heinlein]], who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. 

The word ''incluing'' is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author [[Jo Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Bottorff|url=http://www.lshelby.com/rasfcFAQ.html|title=rec.arts.sf.composition Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Lshelby.com|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defined it as "the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|title=papersky: Thud: Half a Crown &amp; Incluing|publisher=Papersky.livejournal.com|date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information dump" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=James Scott|title=Write Great Fiction – Plot &amp; Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1MCUXmqdcC&amp;pg=PT78|date=22 September 2004|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-684-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;=http://www.screenplayology.com/content-sections/screenplay-form-content/3-3/&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''idiot lecture'', characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ashmead|author2=Darrell Schweitzer|author3=George H.

'''Full Radius Dance''' is a professional [[modern dance]] company in the field of [[physically integrated dance]] based in [[Atlanta]]. The company features dancers with and without [[physical disability|physical disabilities]].

==Founding==
In 1990, founder [[Douglas Scott (choreographer)|Douglas Scott]] established Dance Force, a traditional modern dance company.  He began teaching classes for people with disabilities in 1993 through a partnership with VSA Arts of Georgia, and in 1995 formed a sister company for dancers with disabilities called E=Motion.  The companies formally merged to create Full Radius Dance in 1998. Douglas Scott continues to serve as Artistic and Executive Director.

==Work==

==The Modern Atlanta Dance Festival==
Full Radius Dance is the host company of the Modern Atlanta Dance (MAD) Festival.  A juried festival, MAD was created in 1995 to present and celebrate the best of Georgia's diverse modern and contemporary dance scene. The MAD Festival is currently presented as two nights of performances. Also under the umbrella of the festival are events such as the 24-hour dance festival and the Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award.

The 24-hour dance festival is a project in which choreographers and dancers are locked in studios for 24 hours to create work. At the end of the 24-hour period, all of these works are presented and then the top two pieces perform their newly created works to open the core show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The MAD Festival|url = https://fullradiusdance.org/experience/mad/about|website = fullradiusdance.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20|date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award commemorates an individual who has contributed to the regional dance community. Choreographer and modern dance pioneer Ruth Mitchell, former dancer for Jose Limon and Ruth Page and director of Ruth Mitchell Dance Company, was the inaugural recipient in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preview: As it reaches its 21st year, Modern Atlanta Dance Festival offers a weekend of firsts|url = http://www.artsatl.com/2015/05/preview-reaches-21st-year-modern-atlanta-dance-festival-offers-weekend-firsts/|website = ArtsATL|date = 2015-05-20|accessdate = 2015-11-20|last = Shaw|first = Rachael|publication-date = 2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the award was presented to Mozell Spriggs, founder of the Spelman College Dance Program. In 2017, it honored Bobby and Virginia Barnett. Lee Harper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leeharperanddancers.com/Lee_Harper_____.html|title=Lee Harper|website=leeharperanddancers.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the recipient of the 2018 award.   

Over the past two decades, Full Radius Dance has presented more than 65 companies and independent choreographers, and paid over $30,000 in honorariums to MAD participants. Entering its 24th year, the upcoming festival will be held May 2018 at the Balzer Theatre at Herren's in downtown Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://fullradiusdance.org/experience/mad/about|title = The MAD Festival|date = 30 March 2015|accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The idle servant.jpg|thumb|''The Idle Servant''; housemaid troubles were the subject of several of [[Nicolaes Maes]]' works]]

'''Genre art''' is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=genre&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300139140 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. "genre"]. Accessed 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.

Rather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]].  Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]—the great periods of genre works—may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]] and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.

The following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]] and textiles.

==Genre painting==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

===To 1800===
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]
The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen' |date=|website=DBNL|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In [[Italy]], a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating [[The Book of Good Love]] of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871)]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|Hunter's home, by Henry Voordecker, 1826]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978-185149-826-0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=12–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Pavel Fedotov]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]]. [[Harry Roseland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4may/art0512.html|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|first=John F.|last=Canu|date=|website=www.safran-arts.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schatzki |first=Stefan C. |date=May 1992 |title=Visit from the Doctor-A Serious Case |url=https://www.ajronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2214/ajr.158.5.1566698 |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=158 |issue=5 |page=970 |doi=10.2214/ajr.158.5.1566698}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rogers (sculptor)|John Rogers]] (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America.  The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

==Genre photography==

While genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.

Although the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as [[anthropology]] and the [[behavioural sciences]].

The development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as [[street photography]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bystander: A History of Street Photography'' by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] and [[Colin Westerbeck]], Boston: [[Bulfinch Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-82121-755-0}}.

'''Jazz bass''' is the use of the [[double bass]] or [[bass guitar]] to [[Jazz improvisation|improvise]] [[accompaniment]] ("comping") [[bassline]]s and solos in a [[jazz]] or [[jazz fusion]] style. Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low-pitched [[walking bass]]lines that outlined the [[chord progression]]s of the [[song]]s. From the 1920s and 1930s [[Swing music|Swing]] and [[big band]] era, through 1940s [[Bebop]] and 1950s [[Hard Bop]], to the 1960s-era "[[free jazz]]" movement, the resonant, woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz [[big band]]s.

Beginning in the early 1950s,&lt;ref name="musicradar.com"&gt;http://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/the-history-of-the-electric-bass-part-1-early-days-507234&lt;/ref&gt; some [[jazz]] bass players began to use the [[bass guitar|electric bass guitar]] in place of the double bass. The electric bass, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage, gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified [[Music technology (electric)|electric instruments]] of [[rock music]], creating [[jazz fusion]].

Most jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the electric bass, although the ability to "double" (play both instruments) is common. A small number of players, such as [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[John Patitucci]], have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments. Whether a jazz bassist is "[[comping]]" ([[accompaniment|accompanying]]) with a [[walking bass]]line or soloing, or playing on a double bass or an electric bass, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and "timefeel" that creates a sense of ''[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]'' and ''[[groove (music)|groove]]''. 

== Double bass ==
Beginning around 1890, the [[African-American]] communities in early [[New Orleans]] used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches, [[ragtime]], and [[dixieland]] music. This ensemble was initially a [[marching band]] with [[sousaphone]] (or occasionally [[bass saxophone]]) supplying the bass line. As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and [[brothel]]s, the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments. Many early bassists doubled on both the "brass bass" and "string bass," as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played "walking" basslines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes.

Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the ''slap style'', [[Slapping (music)|slapping]] and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic "slap" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well.&lt;ref name="fotos"&gt;[http://www.peterunbehauen.de/jazz/jazzfotos.html Historic Jazz Fotos]&lt;/ref&gt; For more about the slap style, see "Playing styles," below.

Double bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player [[Jimmy Blanton]], who played with [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Oscar Pettiford]], who pioneered the instrument's soloistic use in [[Bebop]].  The "cool" style of jazz was influenced by players such as [[Scott LaFaro]] and [[Percy Heath]], whose solos were very melodic.

[[Paul Chambers]] (who worked with [[Miles Davis]] on the famous ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' album) achieved renown for being one of the early jazz bassists to play Bebop solos in arco (bowed) style. The first player known to do that was [[Slam Stewart]], who would scat in octaves with his bowed bass in his solos, good examples of which can be found on the trio recordings he made with [[Art Tatum]] and [[Tiny Grimes]]. [[Ron Carter]] (another bassist who worked with [[Miles Davis]] in his second great quintet), is credited as a key figure of the modern school of jazz bass playing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}He is one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz.

[[Free jazz]] was influenced by the composer/bassist [[Charles Mingus]] (who also contributed to [[hard bop]]) and [[Charlie Haden]], best known for his work with [[Ornette Coleman]]. In the 1950s, some [[big band]] [[bandleader]]s began to ask their upright players to use the then-newly available [[Fender bass]], the first widely available [[electric bass]]. In the 1970s, as jazz and [[rock music]] were blended by performers to create the "[[jazz fusion|fusion]]" genre, players such as [[Jaco Pastorius]] began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass.

Apart from jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz, the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s. The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted [[bass guitar]]. The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass, because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal [[fret]]s. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that the sound is produced by [[Bass amp|electronic amplification]] of the vibration of the strings. The solid body upright, also known as a "stick" bass or "EUB" variation is still widely used by bass players in [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[timba]] bands, because its sound is so well suited to those styles. The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass, making touring and travelling easier, and its solid (or mostly solid) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a [[bass amp]] without [[Audio feedback|feedback]].

=== Playing techniques ===
In jazz, since the 1950s, the double bass is usually played with [[bass instrument amplifier|amplification]] and it is mostly played with the fingers, ''[[pizzicato]]'' style, except during some solos, where players may use the bow. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for [[walking bass]]lines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.
[[File:Jazzbass.jpg|thumb|left|150 px |An example of pizzicato jazz bass technique.]]
Using amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise). While jazz double bass players use amplification, they typically use much smaller, lower-powered bass amplifiers and smaller [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]s than those used by an [[electric bass]] player playing in a [[jazz fusion]] show. An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12" combo amp to the gig. When a small jazz combo is playing in a small [[jazz club]], the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification, so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound. Of course, if that same band plays on a huge [[jazz festival]] mainstage, all of the bass tone reaching the audience's ears will be from the [[sound reinforcement system]].

An unamplified acoustic bass' tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and [[Graphic equalizer|equalization]] devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during [[ballad]]s and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a [[preamplifier]], impedance-matching device, and/or a [[DI unit|Direct Injection]] (DI box) box before it is routed to the [[PA system]], electronic effects, or the [[bass instrument amplifier]].

In traditional [[jazz]] and [[Swing (genre)|swing]] it is sometimes played in the ''[[Slapping (music)|slap style]]''. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are "slapped" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a [[snare drum]]-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch.  Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolate two, or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line.

=== Variants ===
[[File:Aria swb02 5.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A five-string Electric Upright Bass ("EUB")]]

In both jazz and jazz fusion bands, some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the [[electric upright bass]] (abbreviated '''EUB''' and sometimes also called '''stick bass'''). The stick bass is also widely used in [[salsa music|salsa]], because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music, even in studio recording. It is an electronically amplified version of the [[double bass]] that has a minimal or 'skeleton' body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the [[double bass]] so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. As well, an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent. The [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of EUBs varies: some scales are 42", similar to most [[double bass]]es, whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30" like a short scale [[bass guitar]]. The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB.

Solid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without [[bass instrument amplification|electronic amplification]]. Hollow-bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice. However, since hollow-bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a [[double bass]], they cannot reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier. To amplify the EUB, the [[Strings (music)|string]] [[oscillation|vibrations]] are sensed with a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].  Early EUBs used [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|magnetic pickups]] similar to those in electric guitars, or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups (e.g., the [[Ampeg]] "Baby Bass").  Many modern EUBs use [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoelectric pickups]] located in the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] or a combination of pickup types. The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]] with a [[preamplifier]] and then sent to a [[bass instrument amplification|bass amplifier]] or a [[PA system]]. For silent practice in a hotel room or apartment, an EUB can also be connected to [[headphone]]s.

Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to "[[roll-off|roll off]]" the treble frequencies or "notch out" the "scratchy-sounding" frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to [[audio feedback]] than the double bass when amplified.  To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be [[radius]]sed (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.

== Electric bass ==

The [[electric bass]] is a relative newcomer to the world of [[jazz]]. Until the 1950s, the double bass was used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge [[big band]]s. The electric bass was introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson (and later [[Monk Montgomery]]) first used the instrument in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s [[big band]].&lt;ref name="musicradar.com"/&gt; When the electric bass is used in [[jazz]], it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the bass is used to accompany, it may be used to perform [[walking bass]]lines for traditional tunes and ''[[jazz standards]]'', in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass. 

The electric bass player can play all of the same types of [[bass line]]s played by her upright bass cousin. However, due to the design of the electric bass as a [[guitar]]-family instrument, it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass. For example, an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid, [[syncopation|syncopated]] sixteenth notes.  For [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] or [[salsa music|salsa]] tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play challenging, fast-moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove. 

In a fusion band, electric bass players have to provide a solid, heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer, [[electric guitar]]ist (amplified through a [[guitar amp]]) and [[synthesizer]] or [[electric piano]] player performing (amplified through a [[keyboard amp]]) are all playing. As well, fusion bands are more likely to play a rock-size venue, such as a large club or theatre, than a small jazz club. To provide a good bass sound, a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful [[bass amplifier]] and a larger [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]] than an upright player would use, such as a 4X10" cabinet, or even two 4X10" cabinets.
 
In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have much a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short [[bass break]]s or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called "blowing" in jazz parlance. Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Victor Wooten]], and [[Marcus Miller]].

[[File:JackBruce &amp; fretless bass.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Jack Bruce playing a fretless [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]] Thumb bass at the Jazzfestival Frankfurt, Germany  28 October 2006]]

One of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with [[fret]]s on the fingerboard or not. On a fretted bass, metal frets divide the fingerboard into [[semitone]] divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. [[Fretless bass]]es have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the [[double bass]]. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger.  The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of [[glissando]], [[vibrato]] and microtonal intonations such as [[quarter tone]]s and [[just intonation]]. 

In a small combo, the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes. In a band with a [[bandleader]], the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass. Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing. While fretless basses are often associated with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist [[Steve DiGiorgio]].

[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|175px|left|Fretless basses are often used by [[jazz fusion]] bass guitar players; this fretless bass has flatwound strings; note the markers inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]

[[Bill Wyman]] takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' or Jon Sievert interview with [[Bill Wyman]]., guitar player magazine December (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This fretless bass can be heard on [[The Rolling Stones]] songs such as "Paint it Black".&lt;/ref&gt; The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] created his own fretless bass by removing the frets&lt;ref&gt;In interviews, Pastorius gave various versions of how he accomplished this; the versions mention the use of [[pliers]], a [[putty knife]], and, in at least one interview (''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, 1984) he states that he bought the instrument with the frets already removed, badly, with the slots where the frets once were not yet filled in.&lt;/ref&gt; from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.

Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have "fret line" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the [[fingerboard]]. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance [[sustain]], and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as "boutique" or custom-made instruments.

== Alternative instruments ==
While the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass (or a related instrument such as an [[electric upright bass]]) or the electric bass to supply the "low end", there are some exceptions. In jazz [[organ trio]]s, a [[Hammond organ]] player performs the basslines using the [[bass pedalboard]] or their lower manual, along with a drummer and a saxophonist. In some jazz fusion groups, the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a [[bass synthesizer]] or other keyboard. As well, in some duos and other small groups, the basslines may be provided by a piano player; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer, the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer's voice. Similarly, in some duos or trios, a jazz guitarist may play basslines, a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven-string guitar with a low "B" string. In traditional [[Dixieland]] or New Orleans-style jazz groups, the basslines may be played by a [[tuba]] or other low brass instrument.

The '''[[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[sundial]]''' at [[St Gregory's Minster, Kirkdale]] in [[North Yorkshire]], near [[Kirkbymoorside]], is an ancient [[canonical sundial]] which dates to the mid 11th century. 

The panel containing the actual sundial above the church doors is flanked by two panels, bearing a rare inscription in [[Old English language|Old English]], the language of the Anglo-Saxons. The sundial, discovered during a renovation in 1771, commemorates the rebuilding of the ruined church, about the year 1055, by Orm, son of Gamal, whose Scandinavian names suggest that he may have been a descendant of Vikings who overran and settled this region in the late 9th century.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=John |date=October 2015 |title=Parish Church Treasures: The Nation's Greatest Art Collection |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3pdlCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=kirkdale+sundial+inscription+brand+priests&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmkvnmlYbcAhXYqYMKHa8HAR8Q6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=kirkdale%20sundial%20inscription%20brand%20priests&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Bloomsbury Continuum |page=27 |isbn=9781472917645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription on the sundial reads as follows:
:+ ORM GAMAL / SVNA BOHTE SCS / GREGORIVS MIN / STER ÐONNE HI / T ǷFS ÆL TOBRO //  CAN 7 TOFALAN 7 HE / HIT LET MACAN NEǷAN FROM / GRVNDE ΧΡE 7 SCS GREGORI / VS IN EADǷARD DAGVM CNG / 7 [I]N TOSTI DAGVM EORL +
:''Orm Gamal suna bohte Sanctus Gregorius Minster ðonne hit wæs æl tobrocan and tofalan and he hit let macan newan from grunde Christe and Sanctus Gregorius in Eadward dagum cyning and in Tosti dagum eorl.''

(ǷFS may be an error for ǷES, though if the letters were originally painted, as seems quite possible,the E may have appeared intact. The Anglo-Saxon character represented in this transcription by '7' stands for the conjunction 'and'. Several characters in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet but no longer used in English appear in the inscriptions. Ð/ð (called 'eth')is equivalent to modern 'th', as also is þ (called 'thorn'). Ƿ (called 'wynn') is equivalent to modern 'w'; and Æ/æ (called 'ash') is here equivalent to modern 'a').

:"Orm son of Gamal bought [[St Gregory]]'s Minster when it was all ruined and collapsed and he caused it to be made new from the ground for Christ and St. Gregory in the days of Edward the king and in the days of Tosti the eorl."&lt;ref name=blair140&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Blair|editor-first1=Alaric|editor-last1=Hall|editor-first2=Olga|editor-last2=Timofeeva|editor-first3=Bethany|editor-last3=Fox|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=2010|encyclopedia=Interfaces Between Language and Culture in Medieval England: A Festschrift for Matti Kilpio|page=140|title=The Kirkdale dedication inscription and it's Latin models: ROMANITAS in late Anglo-Saxon Yorkshire|isbn=90-04-18011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:St Gregory's Minster.jpg|thumb|right|St Gregory's Minster]]
The sundial itself is inscribed
:+ ÞIS IS DÆGES SOLMERCA + / ÆT ILCVM TIDE
:''þis is dæges solmerca, æt ilcum tide.''
:"This is the day's sun-marker, at every tide."
And at the bottom of the central panel is the line
:+7 HAǷARÐ ME ǷROHTE 7 BRAND / PRS
:''and Hawarð me wrohte and Brand presbyter(i) ''[or ''preostas'']'' .''
:"And Haward wrought me and Brand priest(s)."&lt;ref name=blair140 /&gt;

The reference is to  [[Edward the Confessor]] and Earl [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]], Edward's brother-in-law, who was the son of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]] and the brother of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]]. Tostig held the Earldom of [[Northumbria]] from 1055 to 1065, fixing the date of the church's reconstruction to that decade. He is also known for the murder of Gamal, Orm's father.  The language of the inscription is late Old English, with a failing case and gender system. The compound ''solmerca'' is otherwise unattested in English, and has been ascribed to [[Norsemen|Scandinavian]] influence ([[Old Norse]] ''solmerki'' 'sign of the [[zodiac]]').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poppy.nsms.ox.ac.uk/woruldhord/items/show/355 |title=St Gregory's Minster, Kirkdale, North Yorkshire |last=Kilpatrick |first=Kelly A. |date=16 September 2010 |website=Project Woruldhord |publisher=University of Oxford |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William Sidney |date=1846–1847 |title=The history of the monastery founded at Tynemouth, in the diocese of Durham, to the honour of God, under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and S.

The [[Historic England]] Web site, which lists St Gregory's as Grade I, provides the following translation of the full, three part inscription: "Orm Gamal's son bought St. Gregory's Minster when it was all broken down and fallen and he let it be made anew from the ground to Christ and St. Gregory, in Edward's days, the king, and in Tosti's days, the Earl.

The Journal of the [[Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society]]. (Volume 69), published in 1997, offers more persuasive interpretations of the final sentence: "First, it makes two statements: that Hawarth made the sundial (that is, he was the craftsman), and that Brand was the priest. The second interpretation is that both Hawarth (who was probably a craftsman and could have been a priest) and Brand the priest (acting as his assistant or 
instructor), together made the sundial. Higgitt has suggested that 'Brand was 
perhaps responsible for the drafting and laying out of the text, and perhaps too 
for the design of the sundial'.27"&lt;ref&gt; https://archive.org/stream/YAJ0691997/YAJ0691997_djvu.txt, p=103&lt;/ref&gt; (The Higgitt referred to is John Higgitt who was a medieval scholar who specialized in analyses of Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. He contributed to a 1997 Medieval Archaeology journal report, ''Kirkdale - The inscriptions'', 41. Vol 41, pp. 51-99.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/john-higgitt-1-680793|title=John Higgitt|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/library/browse/details.xhtml?recordId=3189035&amp;recordType=Journal|title=Library|website=archaeologydataservice.ac.uk|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol41/41_051_099.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the sundial's historical significance is its testimony that, a century and a half after the Viking colonisation of the region, the settlers' descendants such as Orm Gamalson were now using English, not Danish or Norwegian, as the appropriate language for monumental inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Story of English episode 2 - The Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;— Part 4 / 7'', PBS Documentary.

'''Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild''' ({{lang-de|Ludwig Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschild}}&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Austrian [[baron]] from the famous [[Rothschild family]]. He was born in [[Vienna]] on 5 March 1882 and died of heart failure while swimming in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]] on 15 January 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baron Louis de Rothschild Dies; Freed by Nazis for $21. Million; Former Vienna Banker Held Prisoner in '38- 39 During Ransom Negotiations |work=New York Times |date=16 January 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/01/16/archives/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dies-freed-by-nazis-for-21-million-former.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild]]. He owned a spectacular palace in Vienna, the [[Palais Rothschild]], that housed an exquisite art collection and [[antique]]s.

After the [[Anschluß]] of Austria to [[Nazi Germany]] in March 1938, he was arrested at the airport at [[Aspern]]&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G. ''1938: Hitler's Gamble''. New York: Basic Books, 2009. p 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and taken into custody by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] because he was a distinguished member of the [[Jews|Jewish]] oligarchy. He was released only after lengthy negotiations between the family and the Nazis and upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest ransom payment in history for any individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1955/01/17/archive/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dead-paid-21000000-ransom-to-nazis|title=Baron Louis De Rothschild Dead: Paid $21,000,000 Ransom to Nazis {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned he was visited by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Rothschild apparently impressed the [[SS]] leader, who subsequently ordered that Rothschild's prison conditions be improved with better furniture and sanitation facilities.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=61}} Despite appeals from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] of the United Kingdom and possibly the [[Duke of Windsor]], Rothschild was held in Vienna's [[Hotel Metropole, Vienna|Hotel Metropole]] while the German government attempted to expropriate his business concerns.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=69,71}} He was imprisoned at least through July 1938, and his property placed under control of a German "commissioner".{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=137}} [[Felix Somary]], in his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;F. Somary, Erinnerungen, Manesses Verlag, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; recalls that, soon before the Anschluss, he phoned to the baron repeatedly, in a desperate attempt to convince him to leave Austria. The day before the Anschluss, Louis's brother Alphons and his wife were visiting him in Switzerland, wanting to go back into Austria; he persuaded them to remain there, and to get his children Francesca de Rothschild and Heidi de Rothschild away from Austria to [[Netherlands]].

Finally allowed to leave Austria, Louis survived the [[Holocaust]] and [[Second World War]].

All of the Rothschild possessions were plundered and subsequently "[[Aryan]]ised". The city-palace of the family was destroyed after the war. The baron never received most of his former belongings back, since most of the paintings were taken over by the Austrian state, which did not allow the paintings to leave the country. In 1998, over 200 art works were returned to the Rothschild heirs by the Austrian Government, and were placed at Christie's in London for auction in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At $90 Million, Rothschild Sale Exceeds Goals |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/world/at-90-million-rothschild-sale-exceeds-goals.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he married the countess Hildegard Johanna von Auersperg (1895–1981) and lived in East Barnard, Vermont (United States) and England. He died childless in 1955.

'''Lowave''' is a curatorial platform based in [[Paris]] and [[Singapore]].

== History ==
Founded in 2002 by Marc Horchlerp and Silke Schmickl, as a publishing house in the field of experimental cinema and video art. Lowave is directed since 2007 by Silke Schmickl and evolved into a platform for curatorial research principally around contemporary art and moving images.

Lowave's main activities revolve around the conception and production of exhibitions, as was the case for Singapour mon amour (Point Éphémère, Cinémathèque française, musée du Quai Branly, Centre Pompidou, Eglise Saint-Merry),  Body Politics (Beirut Art Fair, 2014), Theo.do.lites (ICA Singapour, 2013), Rising Images (Centre Pompidou Paris, 2012), Human Frames (KIT Düsseldorf, 2011), Reframing Reality (Museet for Samtidskunst Roskilde, 2010) ou Middle East Video Channel (Guangzhou Triennial, 2008) and the programmes and performances in multiple international institutions such as the Collège des Bernardins in Paris, [[The Substation]] in Singapore, the Cineteca in Madrid our the Pera Museum in Istanbul.

The singularity of Lowave's work lies in its international scope, with a strong interest in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, the valuation of emerging artists and the implementation of interdisciplinary and intercultural crossings. Since its inception, Lowave has collaborated with institutions such as the Centre Georges Pompidou, La Cinémathèque Française, The British Film Institute, Centre Nationale de la Cinématographie and UNESCO.

Lowave's DVD catalogue features video artists, experimental filmmakers, visual artists, photographers, musicians and performance artists. With monographies and documentaries on art or video portraits of artists, the catalogue also includes a significant amount of compilations that focuses on the discovery of emerging scenes (Résistance[s]) 1-3, In/Flux 1-3, Conditioned, Re:Frame) and thematics (Different Cinema co-produced with the Collectif Jeune Cinéma or Hors Pistes with Centre Georges Pompidou)

== Main Projects ==

=== Singapour mon amour ===

''Singapour mon amour'' is a Singaporean art showcase in Paris from 4 June to 12 July 2015 featuring 42 intellectuals and artists from Singapore and France.

=== Human Frames ===

The exhibition ''Human Frames: ten psychological states - 77 video artists and filmmakers from Asia and Europe'' is dedicated to the human being, the condition humaine and the various states of mind that accompany man on his journey through life. In the form of ten thematically compiled film programmes with works by contemporary artists and filmmakers from Europe and Asia that concentrate upon themes such as happiness, desire, madness, fanaticism, fear, anger, isolation, melancholy, the exhibition will re-examine and illuminate human existence at the start of the twenty-first century, including the eastern concepts mono no aware (‘the pathos of things’) and impermanence. Human Frames is curated by [[Silke Schmickl]], [[Masayo Kajimura]], [[Victric Thng]], [[François Michaud]] and Stéphane Gérard.

''Human Frames'' had its exhibition premiere at the Kunst-Im-Tunnel, Düsseldorf from 11/6 to 24/7/11, featuring 77 film and video art works from the collection. The opening night, participated by the curators and artists, included an exclusive showpiece by live musicians Black To Comm performing improvisational musical accompaniment to Earth (a film by [[Ho Tzu Nyen]]). The 10 programmes were beautifully installed in the underground museum, both quiet and grand, making use of large projector screens, multiple television sets and blank walls as canvasses. Each programme had its own unique spatial set up in a minimally constructed space where one could wander and encounter the works without limitations.

From 2011 until 2012, the project has been presented in various exhibition venues, cultural institutions and book stores in Asia and Europe.

'''Maya Deren''' (April 29, 1917 – October 13, 1961), born '''Eleonora Derenkowska''' ({{lang-ua|Елеоно́ра Деренко́вська|links=no}}), was a Ukrainian-born American filmmaker and one of the most important American experimental filmmakers and entrepreneurial promoters of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.

The function of film, Deren believed, like most art forms, was to create an experience; each one of her films would evoke new conclusions, rendering her oeuvre dynamic and always-evolving.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt; She combined her interests in dance, Haitian Vodou and subjective psychology in a series of surreal, perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her fullest advantage, Deren created continued motion through discontinued space, while abandoning the established notions of physical space and time, with the ability to turn her vision into a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

One of the most influential experimental films in American cinema was ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), her collaboration with [[Alexander Hammid]]. She went on to make several films of her own, including ''[[At Land]]'' (1944), ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' (1945), and ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.

==Early life==
Deren was born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] (then [[Russian Republic]]&lt;!--in April 1917 Kiev was part of the Russian Republic--&gt;), into a Jewish family, to psychologist Solomon Derenkowsky and Marie Fiedler, who supposedly named her after Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]].

In 1922, the family fled the [[USSR]] because of anti-Semitic [[Kiev pogroms (1919)|pogroms]] perpetrated by the [[White movement|White Volunteer Army]]  and moved to [[Syracuse, New York]]. Her father shortened the family name to "Deren" shortly after they arrived in New York.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{Cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde: Includes the complete text of An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film |editor-first=Bill |editor-last=Nichols |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2001 |pages=3–10, 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the staff psychiatrist at the [[Syracuse State School|State Institute for the Feeble-Minded]] in Syracuse.

In 1928, she became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Her mother moved to [[Paris, France]] to be with her daughter while she attended the [[League of Nations]] [[International School of Geneva]] in Switzerland from 1930 to 1933.

Deren began college at [[Syracuse University]], where she studied journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |title=Maya Deren |website=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504210211/http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |archivedate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political science, and also became a highly active socialist leader during the Trotskyist movement.&lt;ref name=Legend&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Legend of Maya Deren: a documentary biography and collected works.

She finished school at New York University with a bachelor's degree in literature in June 1936 then returned to Syracuse in the Fall. She and her husband became active in various [[socialist]] causes in New York City. She graduated from [[New York University]] with a bachelor's degree in literature&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; and separated from Bardacke. The divorce was finalized in 1939. She attended the [[New School for Social Research]] and received a master's degree in English literature at [[Smith College]]. Her [[thesis|master's thesis]] was titled ''The Influence of the French Symbolist School on Anglo-American Poetry'' (1939).

==Early career==
After graduation from Smith, Deren returned to New York's [[Greenwich Village]], where she joined the European [[émigré]] art scene. The following years from 1937–1939 were very formative of career as Deren supported herself by free-lance writing for radio shows and foreign language newspapers. During that time she also worked as an editorial assistant to famous American writers, [[Eda Lou Walton]], [[Max Eastman]], and then [[William Seabrook]].&lt;ref name="Legend" /&gt; She became known for her European-style handmade clothes, wild, curly hair, and fierce convictions.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In 1940, Deren moved to Los Angeles to focus on her poetry and free-lance photography. In 1941, Deren wrote and suggested a children's book on dance to African American dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist of Caribbean culture and dance [[Katherine Dunham]] and later became her assistant and publicist. Dunham's fieldwork influenced Deren's studies of Haitian culture and Voudoun mythology.&lt;ref name="Modern Women"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Berger |title=Maya Deren's Legacy |editor1-last=Butler |editor1-first=Connie |journal=Modern Women |date=2010 |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of touring a new musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (musical)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', the [[Katherine Dunham Company|Dunham dance company]] stopped in Los Angeles for several months to work in [[Hollywood]]. It was there that Deren met [[Alexandr Hackenschmied]] (later Hammid), a celebrated Czech-born photographer and cameraman who would become her second husband in 1942. Hackenschmied had fled from Czechoslovakia in 1938 after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s advance. They lived together in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] where he helped her with her still photography which focused on local fruit pickers in Los Angeles.,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt;

==Cinema==

===''Meshes of the Afternoon''===
In 1943, Deren purchased a used [[16 mm]] [[Bolex]] camera with some of the inheritance money after her father's death from a heart attack. This camera captured her first and best-known film, ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), made in their Los Angeles home on a budget of $250&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Athology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with Hammid. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is recognized as a seminal American avant-garde film. It is the first example of a narrative work in avant-garde American film; critics have seen autobiographical elements in the film, as well as thoughts about women and the individual. Originally a silent film with no dialogue, music for the film was composed by Deren's third husband [[Teiji Itō]] in 1952. The film can be described as an expressionistic "trance film," full of dramatic angles and innovative editing. It seems to investigate the ephemeral ways in which the protagonist's unconscious mind works and makes connections between objects and situations. A woman, played by Maya Deren, walks to her friend's house in Los Angeles, falls asleep and has a dream. The sequence of walking up to the gate on the partially shaded road restarts numerous times, resisting conventional narrative expectations, and ends in various situations inside the house. Movement from the wind, shadows and the music sustain the heartbeat of the dream. Certain symbols recur on the screen, including a cloaked, mirror-faced figure, and a key, which becomes twinned with a knife.

The loose repetition and rhythm cut short any expectation of a conventional narrative, heightening the dream-like qualities. The camera initially avoids her face, which precludes identification with a particular woman. Multiple selves appear, shifting between the first and third person, suggesting that the [[Id, ego and super-ego|super-ego]] is at play, which is in line with the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] staircase and flower motifs. This kind of Freudian interpretation, which she disagreed with, led Deren to add sound to the film composed by Teji Ito. Another interpretation is that each film is an example of a "personal film". Her first piece explores a woman's subjectivity and her relation to the external world. [[Georges Sadoul]] said Deren may have been "the most important figure in the post-war development of the personal, independent film in the U.S.A."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology |editor-first1=Karyn |editor-last1=Kay |editor-first2=Gerald |editor-last2=Peary |chapter=A Letter to James Card by Maya Deren |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-52547-459-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In featuring the filmmaker as the woman whose subjectivity in the domestic space is explored, the feminist dictum "the personal is political" is foregrounded. As with her other films on self-representation, Deren navigates conflicting tendencies of the self and the "other," through doubling, multiplication and merging of the woman in the film. Following a dreamlike quest with allegorical complexity, ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' has an enigmatic structure and a loose affinity with both film noir and domestic melodrama.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; The film is famous for how it resonated with Deren's own life and anxieties. According to a review in ''The Moving Image, "'' this film emerges from a set of concerns and passionate commitments that are native to Deren's life and her trajectory. The first of these trajectories is Deren's interest in socialism during her youth and university years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadassik|first=Alla|date=2012-07-11|title=Meshes of the Afternoon (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480559|journal=The Moving Image|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=139–142|doi=10.1353/mov.2012.0015|issn=1542-4235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Director's Notes ====
There is no concrete information about the conception of ''Meshes of the Afternoon, ''just that Deren offered the poetic ideas and Hammid was able to turn them into visuals. Deren's initial concept began on the terms of a subjective camera, one that would show the point of view of herself without the aid of mirrors and would move as her eyes through spaces. According to the earliest program note, she describes ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' as'':''

&lt;blockquote&gt;This film is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret, and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Influences ====
===== Jean Cocteau =====
''Meshes of the Afternoon'' resembles a French film called ''Blood of a Poet'' (1930) by Jean Cocteau. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances, however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing Blood of a Poet for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

In the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had seen the film multiple times now and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Dali and Buñuel =====
The surrealist background of Dali and Bunuel is a question of influence because of the surreal nature of ''Meshes of the Afternoon''. Bunuel's ''Un Chien Andalou'' (1928) is on the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

Deren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. The form of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' does not compare to Un Chien Andalou either.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

=====Freud and Jung =====
Psychoanalysis of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' from a Freudian viewer or Jungian viewer attempted to decode the symbolism in the film to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism because for Deren, the objects in the film were just that, objects "whose value and meaning ids defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Alexander Hamid =====
Alexander Hamid's role in the creation of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are fully attributable to Deren. Hamid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of Meshes of the Afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Anthology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''At Land''===
Deren filmed ''[[At Land]]'' in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]] and [[Amagansett, New York]] in the summer of 1944. Taking on more of an environmental psychologist's perspective, Deren "externalizes the hidden dynamic of the external world...as if I had moved from a concern with the life of the fish, to a concern with the sea which accounts for the character of the fish and its life."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Maya Deren washes up on the shore of the beach, and climbs up a piece of driftwood that leads to a room lit by chandeliers, and one long table filled with men and women smoking. She seems to be invisible to the people as she crawls across the table, uninhibited; her body continues seamlessly again onto a new frame, crawling through foliage; following the flowing pattern of water on rocks; following a man across a farm, to a sick man in bed, through a series of doors, and finally popping up outside on a cliff. She shrinks in the wide frame as she walks farther away from the camera, up and down sand dunes, then frantically collecting rocks back on the shore. Her expression seems confused when she sees two women playing chess in the sand. She runs back through the entire sequence, and because of the jump-cuts, it seems as though she is a double or "doppelganger," where her earlier self sees her other self running through the scene. Some of her movements are controlled, suggesting a theatrical, dancer-like quality, while some have an almost animalistic sensibility as she crawls through the seemingly foreign environments. This is one of Deren's films in which the focus is on the character's exploration of her own subjectivity in her physical environment, inside as well as outside her subconscious, although it has a similar amorphous quality compared to her other films.

===''A Study in Choreography for Camera''===
In the spring of 1945 she made ''[[A Study in Choreography for Camera]],'' which Deren said was "an effort to isolate and celebrate the principle of the power of movement."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; The compositions and varying speeds of movement within the frame inform and interact with Deren's meticulous edits and varying film speeds and motions to create a dance that Deren said could only exist on film. Excited by the way the dynamic of movement is greater than anything else within the film, Maya established a completely new sense of the word "geography" as the movement of the dancer transcends and manipulates the ideas of both time and space.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Running at just under 3 minutes long, ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' is a fragment but also a carefully constructed exploration of a man who dances in a forest, and then seems to teleport to the inside of a house because of how continuous his movements are from one place to the next. The choreography is perfectly synched as he seamlessly appears in an outdoor courtyard and then returns to an open, natural space. It shows a progression from nature to the confines of society, and back to nature. The figure belongs to dancer and choreographer [[Talley Beatty]], whose last movement is a leap across the screen back to the natural world. The edit its broken, choppy, showing different angles and compositions, and even with parts in slow-motion, Deren is able to keep the quality of the leap smooth and seemingly uninterrupted.

===''Ritual in Transfigured Time''===
By her fourth film, Deren discussed in ''An Anagram'' that she felt special attention should be given to unique possibilities of time and that the form should be ritualistic as a whole. ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' began in August and was completed in 1946. It explored the fear of rejection and the freedom of expression in abandoning ritual, looking at the details as well as the bigger ideas of the nature and process of change. The main roles were played by Deren and the dancers [[Rita Christiani]] and Frank Westbrook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NA8a2jbCUTcC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;lpg=PP12&amp;dq=Rita+Christiani+%2B+Nichols&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cO22FS6JPH&amp;sig=pcRGbPlP9kb3AEfKu5cSd2Q4P7Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4eam_K7WAhUHqFQKHb5UBeEQ6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rita%20Christiani%20%2B%20Nichols&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-52022-732-3 |page=141 |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Meditation on Violence''===
Deren's ''Meditation on Violence'' was made in 1948. [[Chao-Li Chi]]'s performance obscures the distinction between violence and beauty. It was an attempt to "abstract the principle of ongoing metamorphosis," found in ''Ritual in Transfigured Time,'' though Deren felt it was not as successful in the clarity of that idea, brought down by its philosophical weight.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Halfway through the film, the sequence is rewound, producing a film loop.

==Film career==
Deren defined cinema as an art, provided an intellectual context for film viewing, and filled a theoretical gap for the kinds of independent films societies were featuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Points of Resistance: Women, Power &amp; Politics in the New York Avant-garde Cinema, 1934-1971|last=Rabinowitz|first=Lauren|publisher=Urbana: University of Illinois Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Urbana|pages=49–91|chapter=Maya Deren and an American Avant-garde Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her entrepreneurial spirit became evident as she began to screen and distribute her films in the United States, Canada, and Cuba, lecturing and writing on avant-garde film theory, and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodoun]] as well. In February 1946 she booked the Village's Provincetown Playhouse for a major public exhibition, titled ''Three Abandoned Films'', in which she showed ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]],'' ''[[At Land]],'' and ''A Study in Choreography for the Camera.'' The event was completely sold out, inspiring [[Amos Vogel]]'s formation of [[Cinema 16]], the most successful film society of the 1950s.

In 1946, she was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for "Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures," and won the Grand Prix Internationale for 16mm [[experimental film]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]].'' She then created a scholarship for experimental filmmakers, the Creative Film Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158493/Maya-Deren |title=Maya Deren &amp;#124; biography - American director and actress |website=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Deren collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Ballet School and [[Antony Tudor]] to create ''The Very Eye of Night''.

Deren was a muse and inspiration to such up-and-coming avant-garde filmmakers as [[Curtis Harrington]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Kenneth Anger]], who emulated her independent, entrepreneurial spirit. Her influence can also be seen in films by [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Barbara Hammer]], and [[Su Friedrich]].&lt;ref name="Modern Women"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1943, she moved to a bungalow on Kings Road in Hollywood&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; and adopted the name Maya, a pet name her husband Hammid coined. Maya is the name of the mother of the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as well as the [[dharmic]] concept of the illusory nature of reality. In Greek myth, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] is the mother of [[Hermes]] and a goddess of mountains and fields.

In 1944, back in New York City, her social circle included [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Breton]], [[John Cage]], and [[Anaïs Nin]]. In 1944, Deren filmed ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'' in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]] with Duchamp featured in the film, and possibly assisting her in the direction of the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Many friends described her look as that of an exotic Russian Jew,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} contributing a part of her attractiveness to her [[bohemian]], Greenwich Village lifestyle. In the December 1946 issue of ''Esquire'' magazine, a caption for her photograph teased that she "experiments with motion pictures of the subconscious, but here is finite evidence that the lady herself is infinitely photogenic."&lt;ref name=persona&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performance and Persona in the U.S. Avant-Garde: The Case of Maya Deren |first=Maria |last=Pramaggiore |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=17–40 |publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her third husband, [[Teiji Ito]] said "Maya was always a Russian. In [[Haiti]] she was a Russian. She was always dressed up, talking, speaking many languages and being a Russian."&lt;ref name=persona /&gt;

==Criticism of Hollywood==
Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Deren attacked Hollywood for its artistic, political and economic monopoly over American cinema. She stated, "I make my pictures for what Hollywood spends on lipstick," and observed that Hollywood "has been a major obstacle to the definition and development of motion pictures as a creative fine-art form." She set herself in opposition to the Hollywood film industry's standards and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline at 2010 MoMA exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deren talks about the freedoms of independent cinema:

{{Quote|text=Artistic freedom means that the amateur filmmaker is never forced to sacrifice visual drama and beauty to a stream of words...to the relentless activity and explanations of a plot...nor is the amateur production expected to return profit on a huge investment by holding the attention of a massive and motley audience for 90 minutes...Instead of trying to invent a plot that moves, use the movement of wind, or water, children, people, elevators, balls, etc. as a poem might celebrate these. And use your freedom to experiment with visual ideas; your mistakes will not get you fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Maya |last=Deren |title=Amateur Versus Professional |journal=Film Culture |number=39 |year=1965 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Haiti and Vodou==
When Maya Deren decided to make an ethnographic film in [[Haiti]], she was criticized for abandoning avant-garde film where she had made her name, but she was ready to expand to a new level as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PHliJESxjYC&amp;dq=maya+deren+and+the+american+avantgarde&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Panq5wgSrf&amp;sig=-_doFxuxSE8d4f8nGLp3ICAVQLM&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=gbHhSpiSDoGL-QbxrJjZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moira%20sullivan&amp;f=false |chapter=Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti |first=Moira |last=Sullivan |pages=207–229 |title=Maya Deren and the American Avantgarde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |year=2001 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2001), page 18. According to Nichols, "Taking up another neglected dimension of Maya Deren's work, Moira Sullivan's "Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti" relies on primary source material in the Maya Deren Archive in Boston and Anthology Film Archives in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; She had studied ethnographic footage by [[Gregory Bateson]] in [[Bali]] in 1947, and was interested in including it in her next film.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; In September she divorced Hammid and left for a nine-month stay in Haiti. The [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] grant in 1947 enabled Deren to finance her travel and complete her film ''Meditation on Violence.'' She went on three additional trips through 1954 to document and record the rituals of [[Haitian Vodou]].

A source of inspiration for ritual dance was [[Katherine Dunham]] who wrote her master's thesis on Haitian dances in 1939, which Deren edited. Afterwards Deren wrote several articles on religious possession in dancing before her first trip to Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;A list of these articles are found in : Sullivan, 1997, pp.199-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Deren not only filmed, recorded and photographed many hours of Vodou [[ritual]], but also participated in the ceremonies. She documented her knowledge and experience of Vodou in ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti'' (New York: Vanguard Press, 1953), edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], which is considered a definitive source on the subject. She described her attraction to Vodou possession ceremonies, transformation, dance, play, games and especially ritual came from her strong feeling on the need to decenter our thoughts of self, ego and personality.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In her book ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film'' she wrote:

{{Quote|text=The ritualistic form treats the human being not as the source of the dramatic action, but as a somewhat depersonalized element in a dramatic whole. The intent of such depersonalization is not the deconstruction of the individual; on the contrary, it enlarges him beyond the personal dimension and frees him from the specializations and confines of personality. He becomes part of a dynamic whole which, like all such creative relationships, in turn, endow its parts with a measure of its larger meaning.&lt;ref name=anagram&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film |first=Maya |last=Deren |publisher=The Alicat Bookshop Press |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deren filmed 18,000 feet of Vodou rituals and people she met in Haiti. The footage was incorporated into a posthumous documentary film ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti (film)|Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]'', edited and produced in 1977 (with funding from Deren's friend [[James Merrill]]) by Teiji Itō (1935-1982) and his wife Cherel Winett Itō (1947–1999).&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan in Nichols (2001), pp.207-229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Program notes" from screening at [[Pacific Film Archive]] at UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paganopoulos |first=M. |chapter=The Archetype of Transformation in Maya Deren's Film Rituals |title=Jung and Film II |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Hauke |editor2-first=Luke |editor2-last=Hockley |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |pages=253–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original wire recordings, photographs and notes are held in the Maya Deren Collection at the [[Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center]] at [[Boston University]]. The film footage is housed at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City.

An [[LP record|LP]] of some of Deren's wire recordings was published by the newly formed [[Elektra Records]] in 1953 entitled ''Voices of Haiti''. The cover art for the album was by Teiji Ito.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atsf.co.uk/elektra/discography.php?from=10&amp;to=340 |title=Master Discography |website=Elektra Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists Melville Herkovitz and Harold Courlander acknowledged the importance of ''Divine Horsemen,'' and in contemporary studies it is often cited as an authoritative voice, where Deren's methodology has been especially praised because "Vodou has resisted all orthodoxies, never mistaking surface representations for inner realities." &lt;ref&gt;Cosentino, ed., ''Sacred Arts of Vodou'', p.xii. Cited by Sullivan in Nichols (2001), p.225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Deren |first=M. |title=The Voodoo Gods |year=1975 |publisher=Paladin |pages=26 &amp; 305}} (A reprint of ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Deren uses the spelling,'Voudoun,' explaining: "Voudoun terminology, titles and ceremonies still make use of the original African words and in this book they have been spelled out according to usual English phonetics and so as to render, as closely as possible, the Haitian pronunciation. Most of the songs, sayings and even some of the religious terms, however, are in [[Haitian Creole|Creole]], which is primarily French in derivation (although it also contains African, Spanish and Indian words). Where the Creole word retains its French meaning, it has been written out so as to indicate both the original French word and the distinctive Creole pronunciation." In her Glossary of Creole Words, Deren includes 'Voudoun' while the ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1973}} See also: [[Haitian Vodou]].&lt;/ref&gt; draws attention to the similar French word, ''Vaudoux.''

==Death==
Deren died in 1961, at the age of 44, from a [[brain hemorrhage]] brought on by extreme malnutrition. Her condition may have also been weakened by her long-term dependence on [[amphetamines]] and sleeping pills prescribed by Dr. [[Max Jacobson]], an arts scene doctor notorious for his liberal prescription of drugs,&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; who later became famous as one of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s physicians. Her father suffered from [[hypertension]], which she may also have had.

Her ashes were scattered in Japan at [[Mount Fuji]].

==Legacy==
&lt;!--Maya Deren had a passionate sense of social commitment and moral purpose that distinguished her from the less favorable values of the entertainment industry; from the indifferent, ironic attitudes of her surrealist and dada predecessors; from the cool, hip attitudes of her Beat successors; from the passive aesthetic of stylized filmmakers; and from the pretentious attitudes of contemporary film theorists.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; Early political Socialist activism served as the base for Deren's organizational and creative endeavors; her pursuit of art was grounded in her strong ethical, moral and social convictions.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt;

Deren was a key figure in the creation of a New American Cinema, highlighting personal, experimental, underground film. In 1986, the [[American Film Institute]] created the [[Maya Deren Award]] to honor independent filmmakers.

''The Legend of Maya Deren, Vol. 1 Part 2'' consists of hundreds of documents, interviews, oral histories, letters, and autobiographical memoirs.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt;

Works about Deren and her works have been produced in various media:
* In 1987, Jo Ann Kaplan directed a biographical documentary about Deren, titled ''Invocation: Maya Deren'' (65 min)
* In 1994, the UK-based [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]] created and toured ''Dance of White Darkness'' throughout Europe—the story of Deren's visits to Haiti.
* In 2002, Martina Kudlacek directed a feature-length documentary about Deren, titled ''[[In the Mirror of Maya Deren]]'' (''Im Spiegel der Maya Deren''), which featured music by [[John Zorn]].

Deren's films have also been shown with newly written alternative soundtracks:
* In 2004, the British rock group [[Subterraneans (band)|Subterraneans]] produced new soundtracks for six of Deren's short films as part of a commission from [[Queens University Belfast|Queen's University Belfast]]'s annual [[Belfast Film Festival|film festival]]. ''At Land'' won the festival prize for sound design.
* In 2008, the Portuguese rock group [[Mão Morta]] produced new soundtracks for four of Deren's short films as part of a commission from Curtas Vila do Conde's annual film festival.

== Written works ==
Deren was also an important film theorist. 
* Her most widely read essay on film theory is probably ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film'', Deren's seminal treatise that laid the groundwork for many of her ideas on film as an art form (Yonkers, NY: Alicat Book Shop Press, 1946).
* Her collected essays were published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcphersonco.com/cs.php?f[0]=shh&amp;sl[br][NR]=9&amp;sl[br][SR]=2&amp;sl[br][cgID]=5&amp;pdID=142 |title=Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film |publisher=McPherson &amp; Co |year=2005 |isbn=0-929701-65-8 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and arranged in three sections:
# ''Film Poetics'', including: Amateur versus Professional, Cinema as an Art Form, An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film, Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality
# ''Film Production'', including: Creating Movies with a New Dimension: Time, Creative Cutting, Planning by Eye, Adventures in Creative Film-Making
# ''Film in Medias Res'', including: A Letter, Magic is New, New Directions in Film Art, Choreography for the Camera, Ritual in Transfigured Time, Meditation on Violence, The Very Eye of Night.
* ''Divine Horsemen: Living Gods of Haiti'' was published in 1953 by Vanguard Press (New York City) and Thames &amp; Hudson (London), republished under the title of ''The Voodoo Gods'' by Paladin in 1975, and again under its original title by McPherson &amp; Company in 1998.

'''Pink Mammoth'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hena|first=Derek|title=Pink Mammoth|url=http://www.pinkmammoth.org/|website=Pink Mammoth|publisher=Pink Mammoth|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[San Francisco]]-based [[non-profit]] [[artist collective]], founded by Ryel K and Derek Hena in August, 2003. It is based partially on the philosophy of [[Burning Man]], a radically expressive temporary city held annually in the [[Black Rock Desert]] of [[Nevada]], and dedicated to unconditional self-support and free expression. It also is influenced by the [[Buddhist]] concept of the [[Boddhisattva]], a being dedicated to enabling, supporting, and encouraging others to reach their ultimate state of enlightenment.

The organization has maintained active residencies throughout San Francisco and has performed at significant San Francisco dance music venues including Mighty, Monarch, Public Works, Monroe, Supperclub, Mezzanine, Halcyon, Public Works, The Midway, The Great Northern, and Audio. These highlight the organization's heavy emphasis on community and expressive celebration by showcasing and promoting its own artist-participants, including DJs, percussionists, vocalists, live event artists, fabric designers, and graphic artists.

Pink Mammoth also participates in Burning Man, the [[Love Parade]], and many regional burns such as [[Apogaea]]. Its participants have represented the collective in [[Mexico]], [[London]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and throughout the [[United States]].

[[File:Rick Santorum official photo.jpg|thumb|upright|Rick Santorum]]

Former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|2012]] and [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. Presidential candidate]] [[Rick Santorum]] is opposed to [[homosexual behavior]], seeing it as antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family. Santorum does not believe the [[right to privacy]] under the [[United States Constitution]] covers sexual acts, and criticized the [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in the case of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that ruled to the contrary.&lt;ref name="under fire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Loughlin|first=Sean|title=Santorum under fire for comments on homosexuality|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/22/santorum.gays/|publisher=CNN|date=April 22, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defends comments"&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum defends comments on homosexuality|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/23/santorum.gays/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum has stated that the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]]'s "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy, which ended in 2011, should be reinstated and has voiced his opposition to [[same-sex parenting]]. Santorum's views provoked criticism from Democratic politicians and other groups, but have been supported by some conservative Christians.

==2003 interview==
In the interview by Associated Press reporter Lara Jakes Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Joseph|title=Santorum is right|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=32268|work=World Net Daily|date=April 28, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked for his position on the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]], Santorum said that the scandal involved priests and post-pubescent men in "a basic homosexual relationship" (rather than [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|child sexual abuse]]), which led the interviewer to ask if homosexuality should be outlawed.&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpt from Santorum interview|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press |date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum then brought up the then-pending [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which challenged a Texas [[sodomy law]], and said that "he did not have a problem with homosexuals, but a problem with homosexual acts", "the right to privacy doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution", and "sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts which undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family."&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;&lt;ref name="national review"&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=Robert P.|title=Rick Santorum Is Right|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-george052703.asp|work=[[The National Review]]|date=May 27, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323095514/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-george052703.asp|archivedate=March 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jordan asked "Okay, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?" Santorum stated:&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;
{{quote|In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.}}

The AP also quoted Santorum as saying, "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to [[polygamy]], you have the right to [[incest]], you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything." and "Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, whether it's sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family."&lt;ref name="under fire"/&gt;

When allegations of bias were leveled against Jordan because she is married to a Democratic strategist,&lt;ref&gt;WorldNetDaily: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619135610/http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=32268 Joseph Farah, "Santorum is Right," April 28, 2003], accessed March 4, 2012. Her husband is Jim Jordan, who was managing [[John Kerry]]'s presidential campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; she made a recording of the interview available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News From The Right 2003–2004|url=http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9664|publisher=[[People for the American Way]]|year=2004|accessdate=October 2, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210746/http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9664 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP released a transcript it described as "an unedited section" of the interview on April 23.&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'': [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm "Excerpt from Santorum interview," April 23, 2003], accessed March 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
Santorum's comments evoked responses ranging from [[George W. Bush]]'s remark, relayed through spokesperson [[Ari Fleischer]], that "the President believes that the senator is an inclusive man",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santorum and gays|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=April 26, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225221/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sharp criticism from former [[Governor of Vermont]] [[Howard Dean]] that "[[gay-bashing]] is not a legitimate public policy discussion; it is immoral", to conservative groups such as the [[Family Research Council]] and [[Concerned Women for America]] who came to Santorum's defense.&lt;ref name="defends comments"/&gt;

Santorum defended his remarks, declaring that his comments were not intended to equate homosexuality with incest and adultery, but rather to challenge the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults, a position he disputes, because he does not believe that there is a general constitutional right to privacy.&lt;ref name="defends comments"/&gt;

===Campaign for a "santorum" neologism ===
{{main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"}}
[[Dan Savage]], a widely syndicated columnist who was offended by Santorum's remarks, hosted a contest in his ''[[Savage Love]]'' column for readers to create a definition for "santorum". He created a website, ''spreadingsantorum.com'', for the winning definition, "The frothy mix of [[personal lubricant|lube]] and [[fecal matter]] that is sometimes the byproduct of [[anal sex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=Rick Santorum still haunted by Google problem despite strong showing in Iowa |agency=Reuters |publisher=National Post |date=2012-01-04 |url= http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/04/rick-santorum-still-haunted-by-google-problemdespite-strong-showing-in-iowa/ |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a top internet search result for ''santorum'' in 2003, displacing the Senator's official website on many [[Web search engines|search engines]], including Google, Yahoo!

==2012 presidential campaign==
While campaigning in New Hampshire, Santorum engaged college students who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and suggested that allowing it would lead to the legalization of polygamy and other forms of marriage. The exchange resulted in him being booed at the conclusion of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-06/santorum-draws-boos-opposing-gay-marriage-before-college-crowd.html|title=Santorum Draws Boos From College Crowd for Opposing Gay Marriage |first=Julianna |last=Goldman |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another event, Santorum said that children would be better off having a father in prison than being raised by lesbian parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9000510/US-election-2012-Rick-Santorum-under-pressure-in-New-Hampshire-over-social-stances.html |title=US election 2012: Rick Santorum under pressure in New Hampshire over social stances |first=Jon |last=Swaine |date=January 8, 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2011, during a Republican primary debate in Orlando, Florida, Santorum replied to a question posed by a [[Stephen Snyder-Hill|gay soldier]] deployed in Iraq who asked the candidates whether, as president, they would take measures to "circumvent" the repeal of "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]". He said:&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20110698-503544.html| title=Republican Gay rights group demands apology from Santorum| author=Lucy Madison| publisher=CBS News| date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would say any type of sexual activity has absolutely no place in the military," Santorum responded. "And the fact that they're making a point to include it as a provision within the military that we are going to recognize a group of people and give them a special privilege to – and removing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' I think tries to inject social policy into the military. And the military's job is to do one thing, and that is to defend our country .... What we're doing is playing social experimentation with our military right now. And that's tragic.}}

'''''Santa Cecilia''''' is an early painting by the baroque painter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], a painter described as "a grand exception in the history of art - a successful woman painter in an era in which art was dominated by men." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Language of Painting|last=Locker|first=Jesse M.|date=2015|isbn=9780300185119|ref=none|pages=1|place=New Haven, Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canvas was painted around 1620. It shows the saint playing a lute, with an organ, a customary attribute for her, in the background. It currently now in the [[Galleria Spada]] in [[Rome]]; it has been part of the Spada collection since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Orazio_and_Artemisia_Gentileschi|title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi|last=Christiansen|first=Keith|last2=Mann|first2=Judith Walker|last5=Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Rome|first5=Italy)|last6=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|first6=N.Y.)|last7=St. Louis Art Museum|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art ; Yale University Press|pages=350|isbn=1588390063|location=New York; New Haven|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sask Arts Board logo -green web.jpg|framed|Saskatchewan Arts Board logo]]

The '''Saskatchewan Arts Board''' is an arms-length funding agency that provides support to the arts in Saskatchewan: to artists, arts organizations and communities on behalf of the people of [[Saskatchewan]]. It was established in 1948, and is the first agency of its kind in Canada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saskatchewan-arts-board-emc/&lt;/ref&gt;, predating the Canada Council for the Arts by nine years. The Arts Board has offices located in Regina and Saskatoon, and professional staff is available to consult with artists, arts organizations and community members regarding programs and application process.

The Arts Board is governed by ''The Arts Board Act, 1997'', and funded by the Government of Saskatchewan through the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport, with additional support from the Saskatchewan Lotteries Trust Fund for Sport, Culture and Recreation as a result of the Arts Board's partnership with SaskCulture Inc.

The importance of the input and feedback of the community it serves is a priority throughout the Arts Board's operations and is formalized within ''The Arts Board Act, 1997''. Although officially appointed by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, one-third of the members of the Arts Board’s board of directors is chosen from a list of nominees provided by the arts community. This process assists in ensuring the Arts Board is representative of the thoughts, ideas and directions of the community itself. The board reports to the province’s minister responsible for the Saskatchewan Arts Board.

== Funding and Programs ==

The Arts Board offers several funding opportunities and programs for individuals and organizations, including:
* Artists in Communities (formerly Creative Partnerships)
* Artists in Schools (formerly ArtsSmarts)
* Arts Entrepreneurship and Business Development Course
* Independent Artists Program
* Indigenous/Métis Art and Artists
* Micro-Grant Program
* Prince Edward Arts Scholarship
* Professional Arts Organizations Program
* SaskFestivals

The Arts Board also administers grant and award programs in partnership with other agencies, such as the Access Copyright Foundation and the Saskatchewan Foundation for the Arts.

== Permanent Collection ==

The Arts Board's Permanent Collection is a collection of art by Saskatchewan artists. It includes approximately 3,000 works of art in all media by 750 artists and is the largest body of work by Saskatchewan artists in the world.

The Arts Board makes the Permanent Collection accessible by bringing it to the people of the province in their workplaces, schools and communities. Works form the collection are loaned to galleries and other venues around the province and country for exhibitions, film production, broadcast and publication opportunities. The Arts Board's Art Rental program brings artwork into the office. Art Rental clients are Saskatchewan government departments, agencies, crown corporations, boards, commissions and the corporate sector. Non-profit organizations and institutions may also rent art from the Saskatchewan Arts Board's Permanent Collection.

Anyone is able to suggest work to become part of Permanent Collection either through purchase or donation/bequest. In order to have a fair and transparent policy, the Arts Board receives submissions at two deadlines annually.

== Saskatchewan Arts Awards ==

On the occasion of its 40th anniversary in 1988, the Arts Board established the Lifetime Award for Excellence in the Arts. The award honours Saskatchewan individuals whose accomplishments have had a major impact on the arts provincially, nationally and internationally. A listing of recipients from 1988-1999 is on the Saskatchewan Arts Board website.&lt;ref&gt;http://saskartsboard.ca/menu/awards/saskatchewan-arts-awards/previous-recipients/155-1989-1999-lifetime-award-for-excellence-in-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the awards program expanded and the Arts Board established the Lieutenant Governor’s Arts Awards to recognize the achievements made by individuals, groups and organizations in the arts.

In 2016, it was renamed the Saskatchewan Arts Awards. In addition to the award, all recipients receive a cash prize. Award categories include Lieutenant Governor's Lifetime Achievement, Emerging Artist, Leadership - Individual, Leadership - Organization, Arts and Learning, and Artistic Excellence.

Past recipients of the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards and the Saskatchewan Arts Awards are available on the Saskatchewan Arts Board website.&lt;ref&gt;http://saskartsboard.ca/menu/awards/saskatchewan-arts-awards/previous-recipients.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

* '''Legislative Building 100th Anniversary Artist Residency'''

The Legislative Building Artist in Residence Program was part of the province's year-long celebration in 2012 of the 100th anniversary of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building and was developed in partnership with the Saskatchewan Arts Board. Under the guidance of artist-in-residence coordinator Laura Hale, who also served as a resident artist, the eight participants explored the history and significance of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building through their own artistic disciplines.

Each artist hosted a community engaged project to encourage cultural exchange at the Legislative Building and created a work of art that is displayed in one of the alcoves in the Rotunda of the Legislative Building. The artwork was unveiled in December 2012.

* '''Artists in the Community'''

The Artists in the Community project ran from October 2006 to September 2007.  It was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board in collaboration with the City of Saskatoon, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program.

Eight community-based residencies were selected from a broad variety of sectors within Saskatoon. Organizational staff, volunteers, community members, managers, and organization clientele had the unique opportunity to work with an artist for six to nine months.

The Artists in the Community project was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board in collaboration with the City of Saskatoon, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program, a program of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

* '''Art at Work'''

In 2004 the Art At Work project was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board, in collaboration with the City of Regina, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program, a program of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

==100 Years of Heart: Celebrating Saskatchewan's Centennial==

The Saskatchewan Arts Board was involved in celebrating Saskatchewan's Centennial in 2005 with two important projects:

* Centennial Commissions Project: To celebrate the Saskatchewan Centennial, the Saskatchewan Arts Board commissioned the design, creation, and installation of four large-scale, permanent, outdoor artworks in four Saskatchewan gateway communities: Estevan (''Spinning Prairie'' by Jefferson Little); Lloydminster (''Sky Dance'' by Douglas Bentham); Yorkton (''Doorways to Opportunity'' by Lionel Peyachew) and LaRonge (''Portage'' by Chris St. Amand).
* Saskatchewan Centennial Mural Project: The Province of Saskatchewan designated funding for the creation of a large mural in the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. The painting was installed in the rotunda of the Legislative building. Roger Jerome, a Métis artist who lives in Air Ronge, designed and painted the mural, ''Northern Tradition and Transition''.

'''Sexism in video gaming''' is prejudiced behavior or [[discrimination]] based on [[sex]] or [[gender]] as experienced by people who play and create [[video game]]s, primarily women. This may manifest as [[sexual harassment]] or in the way [[Gender representation in video games|genders are represented in games]], such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.

The demographics of [[video game culture]] have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|date=April 2014|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]|page=3|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the [[Gamergate controversy]] in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.

==Harassment==

=== Form ===
Harassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests.&lt;ref name= BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=James|title=Sexual harassment in the world of video gaming|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, female players are also [[stalking|stalked]], whether online or offline.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Women are sometimes marginalized as "intruders", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as [[the Sims]], [[music video game]]s or [[casual games]]. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing "girl games" or disliking violent games.&lt;ref name="pricec"&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Matthew|title=Sexism in Video Games: There Is Sexism in Gaming|url=http://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/09/emilyami-sexism-in-video-games-study.html|publisher=Price Charting|date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or [[video game developer|game developers]], even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game.&lt;ref name="szfrauen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/frauenrollen-in-computerspielen-sexspielzeug-1.1554509|title=Frauenrollen in Computerspielen – Sexspielzeug – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/sexismus-in-videospielen-wo-feminismus-als-terrorismus-gilt-1.1389210|title=Sexismus in Videospielen – Wo Feminismus als "Terrorismus" gilt – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/03/19/actualite/le-milieu-geek-bien-trop-sexiste-11375418/|title=Les Inrocks – Le milieu geek, bien trop sexiste ?|work=Les Inrocks|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of the [[NES]], video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men.&lt;ref name="no girls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/medias/jeux-video-et-machisme-c-est-loin-d-etre-fini-554125|title=Playstation 4 (PS4) et Xbox One: la surenchère sexiste – L'Humanité|work=L'Humanité|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads.&lt;ref name="no girls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|title=No girls allowed – Polygon|work=Polygon|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="guard twit"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1reasonwhy: the hashtag that exposed games industry sexism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter|author=Mary Hamilton|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry|date=November 27, 2012|publisher=[[Time Magazine|Time]] Newsfeed|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Kate|last2=Weststar|first2=Johanna|last3=Meloni|first3=Wanda|last4=Pearce|first4=Celia|last5=Legault|first5=Marie-Josée|title=Developer Satisfaction Survey 2014 Summer Report|url=http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|website=gameqol.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211032252/http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|archivedate=December 11, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women remain outsiders in video game industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrows|first1=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to "meetings" that were actually romantic dates.

Sexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Digitized Lives, T.V. Reed&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as '[[Promotional model|booth babes]]', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/forum/thread/242422 |title=Booth Babes and the Expo |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverstein |first=Jonathan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1558683 |title=Sexy 'Booth Babes' Under Siege – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX Code of Conduct|url=http://east.paxsite.com/safety-and-security|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime |first=Arielle |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294440/why-cant-ces-quit-booth-babes |title=Why can't CES quit booth babes? |publisher=The Verge |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelion |first=Leo |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21373094 |title=BBC News – CES 'booth babe' guidelines revised but ban rejected |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency ===
Insults are frequent in [[Online game|online gaming]]. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service [[Xbox Live]]), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Leary|first=Amy|title=In Virtual Play, Sex Harassment Is All Too Real|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from [[Riot Games]] lists racism and homophobia at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using science to reform toxic player behavior in League of Legends|author=Dennis Scimeca|date=May 16, 2013|work=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/using-science-to-reform-toxic-player-behavior-in-league-of-legends/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/13/homophobia-and-harassment-in-the-online-gaming-age|author=Nathan Meunier|date=January 13, 2010|title=Homophobia and harassment in the online gaming age|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing [[Halo 3]] online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/74637/jeux-video-etude-sexisme-joueurs|title=Jeux vidéo: une étude confirme le sexisme des joueurs – Slate.fr|work=Slate.fr|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/halo-3-gamers-are-often-sexist-too-61564|title=Study: Female Gamers Receive Verbal Abuse From Male Gamers – Pacific Standard: The Science of Society|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=Men who harass women online are quite literally losers, new study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds/|work=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males "attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Ponti|first3=Giovanni|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|date=15 July 2015|volume=10|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pages=e0131613|pmid=26176699|pmc=4503401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words "gay" or "queer" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as "somewhat hostile" while 14% perceived it as "very hostile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Gay-rights-group-plans-talk-on-silencing-slurs-by-3224946.php|title=Gay rights group plans talk on silencing slurs by online gamers|date=July 16, 2009|author=Kim, Ryan|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterlow|first1=Lucy|title='Rape and death threats are common': Women gamers reveal the vile online abuse they receive EVERY DAY from men who say they should 'get back in the kitchen'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3454588/Women-gamers-reveal-vile-online-abuse-receive-DAY-men-say-kitchen.html|publisher=DailyMail|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of computer and video gamers in the United States from 2006 to 2017, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/232383/gender-split-of-us-computer-and-video-gamers/|website=Statista|publisher=Electronic Software Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsanz.org.nz/journal/docs/WSJNZ291Todd64-67.pdf|last1=Todd|first1=Cherie|website=WSJNA291Todd|publisher=WSANZ|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Halloran|first1=Kate|title=‘Hey dude, do this’: the last resort for female gamers escaping online abuse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/24/hey-dude-do-this-the-last-resort-for-female-gamers-escaping-online-abuse|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Events in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; United Kingdom and Germany:&lt;ref name="szfrauen"/&gt;

* In 2007, Kathy Sierra, a technology blogger, was forced to move her household after receiving repeated rape threats and death threats and then having her home address published online and packages sent to her home in attempt to spook her. She feared for her safety so much that she canceled her speaking engagements and stopped writing and blogging. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mantilla|first=Karla|date=2013|title=Gendertroling: Misogyny Adapts to New Media|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23719068?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=39|pages=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In February 2012, the behavior of a [[Tekken]] team coach against a female player of his team during a [[Capcom]] competition named Cross Assault provoked an outrage.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He interrogated her about her bra size, asked her to remove her shirt, took a webcam to film her breasts and her legs, smelled her and discussed her appearance during the live broadcast of the tournament on the internet.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He then stated that sexual harassment and the fighting game community are "one and the same thing" and that it would be "ethically wrong" to remove sexual harassment from the community.&lt;ref name="penny arcade"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Sexual harassment as ethical imperative: how Capcom’s fighting game reality show turned ugly|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/sexual-harassment-as-ethical-imperative-the-ugly-side-of-fighting-games|work=The Penny Arcade Report|accessdate=20 April 2012|date=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days without any reaction from the sponsoring company, the female player eventually gave up the competition.&lt;ref name="venturebeat cross"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/29/cross-assault-sexual-harassment-controversy-overshadows-on-screen-combat/|title=Cross Assault sexual harassment controversy overshadows on-screen combat – GamesBeat – Games – by Marcos Valdez (Community Writer)|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom later issued an apology and stated that "any inappropriate or disrespectful comments will not be tolerated during filming".&lt;ref name="giant bomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/when-passions-flare-lines-are-crossed-updated/1100-4006/|title=When Passions Flare, Lines Are Crossed [UPDATED] – Giant Bomb|work=Giant Bomb|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team coach also apologized afterwards.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;
*In May 2012, the [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding of videos on female representation in video games received wide coverage due to the [[cyber-bullying]] of its founder, the feminist video-blogger [[Anita Sarkeesian]]. Her [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]] and email accounts were subsequently flooded with hateful and sexist comments, death and rape threats, and photoshopped pictures of her getting raped by video game characters. A game was created, inviting players to beat her up.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="süddeutsche" /&gt;&lt;ref name="freitag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/emanzipation-der-trolle|title=Digitaler Sexismus ǀ Emanzipation der Trolle  — der Freitag|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually collected $160,000 out of the requested $6,000.&lt;ref name="le monde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2012/08/23/lara-croft-une-icone-malmenee_1749046_651865.html|title=Lara Croft et le sexisme des gamers|work=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent threat against Anita Sarkeesian was in Logan, Utah on October 15, 2014. She was scheduled to deliver a speech on a Wednesday evening until an anonymous email message arrived a day before, stating that there would be a mass shooting if the event was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita Sarkeesian Cancels Speech Over Utah State University Allowing Firearms To Her Event|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/15/anita-sarkeesian-utah-state-university-firearms_n_5989310.html?1413387758|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In France, the female blogger Mar_Lard brought attention to the sexism in the video gaming community in May 2013 by publishing a blog post named ''Sexisme chez les geeks: Pourquoi notre communauté est malade, et comment y remédier'', a compilation of sexism problems in the geek community.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref name=inrocks /&gt;&lt;ref name="France Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/high-tech/nouveau-monde-jeux-video/le-jeu-video-est-il-sexiste-966287-2013-04-26|title=Le jeu vidéo est-il sexiste ? – France info|work=France info|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parts of the writing of the 2016 video game ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]'' attracted controversy and resulted in hateful and sexist harassment to the developers, with ''[[Eurogamer]]'''s Robert Purchese reporting that criticism focused on two scenes perceived as pushing a political agenda. The first is the character Minsc's quip, "Really, it's about ethics in heroic adventuring", a reference to the [[Gamergate controversy]]. The second is an optional dialogue tree in which the cleric Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a [[trans woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-05-new-baldurs-gate-expansion-siege-of-dragonspear-off-to-a-rough-start|title=New Baldur's Gate expansion Siege of Dragonspear off to a rough start | last=Purchese|first=Robert |website=[[Eurogamer]] | date=April 5, 2016 | accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Campbell of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' reported that writer Amber Scott faced online harassment and insults, and that the game's Steam and GOG pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted "political correctness," "[[LGBT]] tokenism" and "[[SJW]] pandering."&lt;ref name=polygon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/5/11371428/baldurs-gate-dragonspear-trans-statement | title=Vitriol and harassment hit developers of new Baldur's Gate expansion | last=Campbell | first=Colin | website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=April 5, 2016 | accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott said she wanted to address elements in the original ''Baldur's Gate'' that she considered sexist, including its depictions of Safana as a "sex object" and Jaheira as a "nagging wife" played for comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/04/the-struggle-to-bring-back-baldurs-gate-after-17-years/ | title= The Struggle To Bring Back Baldur's Gate After 17 Years | last=Grayson | first=Nathan | website=[[Eurogamer]] | date=April 1, 2016 | accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously commented: "I get to make decisions about who I write about and why.

*One of the White, female players answer in a forum post that she had experiences of sexism during online game. When she said in voice chat during the game, "the sniper is in the bottom corner in the bushes under the Tower," one of the male players in the game called her names that look down on women.

*Another Latina, female player answered  the interview. She said that during online games, men would send her pictures of things she didn't want to see, or they would harass her. Moreover, one of her experiences is that the other players would say she was a guy playing under a girl's name just because she played well in the game. She was hesitant to jump into multiplayer and practiced by herself before going online. And once she was online, she would generally have a good time and dominate the public leaderboards, but the gamer is almost universally assumed to be a 'he,' People would complement her like, 'hey well done bro, hey dude, do this.' she said that they are just using male language to address her. She has never bothered to correct it because when she did, it would spark a whole unwanted conversation. She also stopped talking on her mic because the other players would sexually harass her such as to ask her phone number. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabriela T. Richard|last2=Kishonna L.

*Kuznekoff and Rose were studying about sexism in online video.

*Leena van Deventer was playing "Team Fortress 2," an online multiplayer shooter game, which was one of her favorites. She had changed her headphone and mic setting with an exciting feature that made her sound like a robot or a giant. Once she began speaking in-game, however, there was what she calls "the reaction" that happened when the other players realize women play online game. One man continued to "stalk" her avatar in the game. Then came the question such as "what are you wearing?""have you got any pics?" "hove you got any NODE pics?" "Do you fuck guys who like games?" Other teammate found it hilarious. She said she wished she could focus other objective in the game, but she knew she had to leave this server. Then her computer mouse was hovering over the exit button when she heard him climax, moaning her username into his microphone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Hetherington, (Hector) Alastair, (31 Oct. 1919–3 Oct. 1999), journalist; Research Professor in Media Studies, Stirling University, 1982–87, then Emeritus; Editor, Manchester Guardian, later The Guardian, 1956–75|date=2007-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u179181|work=Who Was Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

A study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the [[Proteus effect]], manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a [[virtual reality]] game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher [[rape myth]] acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that [[blame the victim]], and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experiences of self-objectification via avatars.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|pages=930–938|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f2e07096-3845-4e7d-9513-0e443ffe3778@sdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=S074756321200369X&amp;db=edselp|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experie...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In another study, 181 students from a private [[liberal arts]] college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to [[control group]]), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref name="DillBrown2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|last2=Brown|first2=Brian P.|last3=Collins|first3=Michael A.|title=Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1402–1408|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bègue|first=Laurent|last2=Sarda|first2=Elisa|last3=Gentile|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Bry|first4=Clementine|last5=Roché|first5=Sebastian|date=2017-03-31|title=Video Games Exposure and Sexism in a Representative Sample of Adolescents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374198/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00466|issn=1664-1078|pmc=5374198|pmid=28408891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely.  Theories such as the [[cultivation theory]], [[social cognitive theory]], ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuer|first=Johannes|last2=Kowert|first2=Rachel|last3=Festl|first3=Ruth|last4=Quandt|first4=Thorsten|date=April 2015|title=Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers?

They write that "Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles:  Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player.  On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as "hi everybody" or "alright team let's do this" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznekoff|first1=Jeffrey H.|title=Communication in multiplayer gaming: Examining player responses to gender cues|journal=New Media &amp; Society|date=2012|volume=15|issue=|pages=541–556|doi=10.1177/1461444812458271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres. The [[longitudinal study]] was based on [[cultivation theory]], and the results broadly showed that playing video games did not lead to gamers becoming sexist.&lt;ref name="BreuerKowert2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breuer|first1=Johannes|last2=Kowert|first2=Rachel|last3=Festl|first3=Ruth|last4=Quandt|first4=Thorsten|title=Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers?

There are many content analyses of popular games that show that female characters are underrepresented or presented in an overly sexualized manner and there is also ample evidence that many players, particularly female, have experienced sexism in their interactions with other players."&lt;ref name=TotiloKotaku&gt;{{cite web|last1=Totilo|first1=Stephen|title=What To Make Of A Study About Gaming And Sexism|url=http://kotaku.com/what-to-make-of-a-study-about-gaming-and-sexism-1698543308|website=Kotaku|accessdate=20 August 2015|ref=What To Make Of A Study About Gaming And Sexism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in May 2016 investigated the common perception of a gender performance gap.&lt;ref name="ShenRatanCaiLeavitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|last3=Dora Cai|first3=Y.|last4=Leavitt|first4=Alex|title=Do Men Advance Faster Than Women?

The study contends that "perceived gender-based performance disparities seem to result from factors that are confounded with gender (i.e., amount of play), not player gender itself".&lt;ref name="ShenRatanCaiLeavitt"/&gt; Lead author Cuihai Shen stated that if there was a gender disparity favoring men then "they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time" however their analysis indicated "women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games".&lt;ref name="ShenRatanConversation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shen|first1=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|title=Gender has no role in ability, girls just spend less time playing, says study|url=https://theconversation.com/debunking-one-of-the-biggest-stereotypes-about-women-in-the-gaming-community-60033|website=theconversation.com/|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shen outlined that there was a difference in play style between the genders, and stated "women did spend less time playing overall than men, they chose characters that are more assistive, and were more drawn to social interaction and helping others.&lt;ref name="ShenRatanConversation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shen|first1=Cuihua|title=Gender has no role in ability, girls just spend less time playing, says study|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3680741/Are-men-really-better-video-games-Study-says-gender-no-role-performance-women-just-spend-time-playing.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was ''Grand Theft Auto''. Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was ''Half Life 1'' and ''Half Life 2''. Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was ''Dream Pinball 3D'' and ''Q.U.B.E. 2'', which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, ''not at all'' to 7, ''very much''. The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, ''Grand Theft Auto'', showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. "The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls. Exposure to sex-typed media characters can have real world consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabbiadini|first=Alessandro |last2=Riva | first2=Paolo | first3=Luca | last3=Andrighetto | first4=Chiara | last4=Volpato | first5=Brad J. | last5=Bushman|date=13 April 2016|title=Acting like a Tough Guy: Violent-Sexist Video Games, Identification with Game Characters, Masculine Beliefs, &amp; Empathy for Female Violence Victims|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121 | pmid=27074057 | pmc=4830454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], for example, has – through her organization [[Feminist Frequency]] – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/how-anita-sarkeesian-wants-video-games-to-change-1688231729|title=How Anita Sarkeesian Wants Video Games To Change|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of [[The Independent Game Developers' Association|TIGA]], "typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/15/video-game-industry-diversity-problem-women-non-white-people|title=The video game industry has a diversity problem – but it can be fixed|last=Ramanan|first=Chella|date=2017-03-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2013/01/18/women-and-video-gamings-dirty-little-secrets/#4ec6cbe42e8c|title=Women And Video Gaming's Dirty Little Secrets|last=Files|first=The ForbesWoman|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games.

'''Sidney Prescott''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the primary [[protagonist]] of the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' franchise]]. The character was created by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and is portrayed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] actress [[Neve Campbell]]. She first appeared in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) followed by three sequels: ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997), ''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name="RV2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1LmH8ld1yoC ''Reel Views 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video''] by [[James Berardinelli]], [[Roger Ebert]]; Published by [[Justin, Charles &amp; Co.]], 2005;
{{ISBN|1-932112-40-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-932112-40-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011). The character appears in the ''Scream'' films as the target of a series of killers who adopt the [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] persona, a ghost mask and black cloak, to pursue her. In each film, the Ghostface killers often murder people close to Sidney and taunt her by phone with threats and intimate knowledge of her life or the murder of her mother, leading to a final confrontation where the true killer is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5rPJvyMXlcC ''The Movies That Make You Scream!''] by R. David Fulcher; Published by [[AuthorHouse]], 2007; {{ISBN|1-4259-9427-X}}, 9781425994273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killers that target Sidney have varying motivations ranging from revenge in ''Scream'' to the fame that will come from killing her in ''Scream 2'', due to the fame she herself has obtained as a survivor of the murder spree in the original film. She first becomes the focus of her boyfriend [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] ([[Skeet Ulrich]]) and his friend [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] ([[Matthew Lillard]]), Billy seeking revenge for his mother's abandonment following his father's affair with Sidney's mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]]. ''Scream 3'' later reveals that Billy learned of this affair through [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]] ([[Scott Foley]]), Sidney's half-brother, himself seeking revenge for his abandonment and rejection by Maureen, sparking the chain of events that permeate each film.

[[Drew Barrymore]] was originally cast as Sidney Prescott but scheduling conflicts led to her taking a smaller role, with the lead being offered instead to Campbell, who at the time was starring in the TV show ''[[Party of Five]]''. She was hesitant to take another horror role after finishing work on ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' (1996) but took the opportunity as it would be her first leading role in a [[feature film]]. Campbell reprised the role in ''Scream 2'' and ''Scream 3'' though her own scheduling conflicts meant she could only film for a short period of time while the third film was in production. This resulted in her character's role being reduced significantly from prior installments and focus was shifted onto the series' other lead characters, [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]] and [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]]. Campbell initially refused requests to return for ''Scream 4'', with scripts written with her character's absence in mind, but ultimately agreed to return.

The character is depicted as an intelligent, resourceful young woman who slowly becomes stronger over the course of the series as she attempts to overcome the threats and deaths around her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5u-i03aazJwC ''Wes Craven: The Art of Horror''] by [[John Kenneth Muir]]; Published by McFarland, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7864-1923-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1923-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Neve Campbell's role as Sidney Prescott has received significant critical praise throughout the series, earning her the title of [[Scream Queen]] in the 1990s and won her the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]] in 1997 for ''Scream''&lt;ref name="saturnaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#filmactress|title=Past Saturn Awards|publisher=saturnawards.org|accessdate=14 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209012608/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#filmactress|archivedate=9 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[MTV Movie Award for Best Performance#1998|MTV Award for Best Female Performance]] in 1998 for her role in ''Scream 2''.&lt;ref name="mtvmovieaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/1998/|title=1998 MTV Movie Awards|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Sidney Prescott first appeared in the 1996 film ''Scream'' as a teenager attending the fictional Woodsboro High School. After a series of brutal murders occur on the anniversary of her mother's death, the killer begins targeting Sidney herself with attacks and taunting phone calls. Her character has appeared in each successive film in the series, her role initially that of the victim but growing into [[heroine]] where she personally confronts each killer and defeats them.

===Films===
Sidney Prescott's first cinematic appearance was in the film ''Scream'' (1996) as a 17-year-old in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. During a spree of grisly murders, she begins to receive taunting and threatening phone calls from Ghostface, who claims to have knowledge of the brutal rape and murder of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, which occurred one year prior to the events of the film, a murder that is blamed on [[List of Scream characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]]. Suspicion falls on several characters before both her boyfriend Billy Loomis and his friend Stu Macher are revealed to both be the killer. Billy states his motivation as revenge following his mother abandoning him over his father's affair with Maureen. With help from [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]] ([[Courteney Cox]]), Sidney is able to kill Stu and Billy and survive the events of the film.&lt;ref name="Scream1"/&gt;

Sidney's second appearance was in ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997) as a student at the fictional Windsor College in the age of 18 where a new series of Ghostface murders occur. The killers again taunt Sidney and murder her friends including [[List of Scream characters#Randy Meeks|Randy Meeks]] before her friend [[List of Scream characters#Mickey|Mickey]] ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) reveals himself as the killer and murders her new boyfriend, Derek, in front of her. Mickey states his motivation as the fame that will come from his exploits including the murder of Sidney and reveals his accomplice, Mrs. Loomis ([[Laurie Metcalf]]), seeking revenge against Sidney for the death of her son Billy. Mrs. Loomis betrays and kills Mickey, intending to disappear without trace after killing Sidney, but before she can enact her plan, Cotton intervenes and shoots her, saving Sidney, who then shoots Mrs. Loomis in the head, killing her.&lt;ref name="Scream2"/&gt;

The third appearance of Sidney occurred in ''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000) where another murder spree begins in Hollywood, with the killer leaving photos of a young  Maureen Prescott at the scenes. Sidney, at the age of 21 now a [[Crisis intervention|crisis counselor]] for women, has been in hiding following the events of ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2'' but is drawn to the set of "Stab 3", the [[film within a film]] based on Sidney and her experiences, after the new Ghostface discovers her location. Ghostface claims responsibility for the murder of Maureen Prescott and is unmasked as the director of "Stab 3", [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]], Sidney's previously unknown half-brother. Roman reveals that their mother was [[gang rape]]d and impregnated with him during a two-year period where she moved to Hollywood to become an actress, before she met Sidney's father. After being given up for adoption, an adult Roman sought her out only for her to reject him. Roman began stalking Maureen, filming her adulterous liaisons with other men, including the father of Billy Loomis, and used this footage to convince Billy to murder Maureen, unknowingly setting in motion the events of ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''. Sidney manages to defeat Roman, with [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]]'s ([[David Arquette]]) help and finally move on with her life.&lt;ref name="Scream3"/&gt;

Sidney's fourth appearance was in ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dimension goes back to its roots|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009176.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|accessdate=October 5, 2010|work=Variety|date=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; set ten years after the events of ''Scream 3''. After returning to the town of Woodsboro to publicize her new book, "Out of Darkness" - a [[self-help book]] about overcoming the events of her life - a new Ghostface begins attacking the town and leaves evidence in Sidney's car. Becoming a suspect in the murders, Sidney, now the age of 30, stays in town with her cousin [[List of Scream characters#Jill Roberts|Jill Roberts]] ([[Emma Roberts]]) and aunt [[List of Scream characters#Kate Roberts|Kate]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) but the family becomes embroiled in the Ghostface murder spree. Sidney tries to save Jill from being attacked only to discover that Jill is the killer with her accomplice [[List of Scream characters#Charlie Walker|Charlie Walker]] ([[Rory Culkin]]), Jill hoping to recreate the events of Billy and Stu's murder spree to make herself the Sidney of a "new generation" with all the associated fame. Jill stabs Sidney and Charlie, before brutalizing herself to appear the "sole survivor", but after arriving at hospital she discovers Sidney has survived. When Jill attempts to finally kill her cousin, Sidney manages to shoot Jill in the chest.&lt;ref name="Scream4"/&gt;

==Casting==
The role of Sidney Prescott was initially given to actress [[Drew Barrymore]] after Barrymore herself approached the production, having read the script, to request the role and was signed to the film before a director had even been found.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"&gt;{{Cite AV media| people = Diana Rico| title = E! A True Hollywood Story: Scream| medium = Television Production| publisher = E! Entertainment Television| location = United States| date = October 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wes Craven, after being hired as director, commented that he was able to have bigger actors in the film than his budget allowed because of Barrymore's desire to be involved, which he believed helped attract other big names to the production.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people= Wes Craven| title = Behind the 'Scream' documentary from Ultimate Scream Collection| medium = DVD| publisher = Dimension Home Video| location = United States| date = September 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early development on the film took place, however, Barrymore's schedule commitments meant she was no longer able to remain in the demanding leading role, but still wishing to take part she volunteered to play the smaller role of [[List of Scream characters#Casey Becker|Casey Becker]], who dies early in the film,&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; with her scene being filmed in five days.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=15 April 2011|journal=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1150|pages=30–37|publisher=[[Time Warner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Barrymore's abdication of the role, actresses [[Alicia Witt]] and [[Brittany Murphy]] auditioned for the part.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"&gt;{{Cite AV media| people = Daniel Farrands (Director) Thommy Hutson (Writer)| title = Scream: The Inside Story| medium = TV| publisher = [[The Biography Channel]] Video| location = United States| date = April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production also offered the role to [[Reese Witherspoon]] although she ultimately never auditioned.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; It was Canadian actress Neve Campbell who was given the lead of Sidney Prescott after Craven saw her in the [[television series]] ''[[Party of Five]]'', believing she could best embody a character who was "innocent" but also able to handle herself while dealing with the demanding physicality and emotions of the role.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wes Craven (Director)|date=December 20, 1996|title=Scream - Commentary by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/|medium=DVD|publisher=Dimension Films|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell herself was reluctant to undertake a role in another horror film so soon after taking part in ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' (1996),&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt; but agreed to ''Scream'' as it would be her first leading role and she "adored" the character saying "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie."&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt; Campbell and her on-screen boyfriend [[Skeet Ulrich]] had previously starred together in ''The Craft'' which they believed helped make their performance of the relationship between Sidney and Ulrich's character, Billy Loomis, more natural.&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt;

On how she approached the leading role in the series, Campbell stated:

{{Pull quote|I remember feeling insecure on the first film, everybody around me was being goofy and funny and had all these great one-liners, and I seemed so stoic in some ways. But I came to realize that if the audience couldn't see the movie through my eyes, then they wouldn't see me at all. They weren't going to feel it and weren't going to care. So it was very important for me to remain reality-based within the film, because there had to be some source of reality for it to be good. It was the same thing on the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Marc|last2=Spelling|first2=Ian|date=March 1998|title=The Silence of the Cast|journal=Fangoria|issue=170|page=38|publisher=Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kevin Williamson had submitted treatments for two possible sequels to ''Scream'' before the film was even released and so Campbell had been contracted for ''Scream 2'' when she signed on to the original film as she played the only character guaranteed to survive the film.&lt;ref name="fangoria162"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|date=May 1997|title=Scream and Scream Again|journal=Fangoria|issue=162|pages=66–68|publisher=Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scheduling became an issue for Campbell and the production as, at the time, she was still starring in ''Party of Five''.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt;

For ''Scream 3'', Craven insisted that convincing Campbell and the other principal cast to return was not a problem, but scheduling Campbell's availability with the film's production again became an issue, with Campbell starring not only in ''Party of Five'' but three other [[feature film]]s.&lt;ref name="fangoria189"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=January 2000|title=Scream Goodbye|journal=Fangoria|issue=189|pages=26–29, 67|publisher=Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her availability was limited enough that she was only available for 20 days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a shift in focus to Cox and Arquette's characters of [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]] and [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] respectively.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wes Craven (Director)|date=February 4, 2000|title=Scream 3 - Commentary by Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier &amp; Marianne Maddalena|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084/|medium=DVD|publisher=Dimension Films|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When production of ''Scream 4'' was announced, nearly ten years after the last installment of the series, Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney, forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence while again shifting focus on to Cox and Arquette's roles.&lt;ref name="shocktillyoudrop"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Williamson on Making Scream 4 Work...|publisher=ScoreTrack.net|date=April 1, 2010|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14724|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by September 2009, Campbell was confirmed as reprising her role in the film.&lt;ref name="EWScream4Return"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/04/28/scream-4-poster-wes-craven/|title=Exclusive: New 'Scream 4' poster, plus an interview with director Wes Craven|last=Young|first=John|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pskgzxzC?url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/04/28/scream-4-poster-wes-craven/|dead-url=no|archivedate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of Williamson's ''Scream 4'' script involved Campbell's character being attacked and killed in the opening, a key point of contention for Bob Weinstein, head of ''Scream'' developer [[Dimension Films]], who had it removed.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt;

==Reception==
On her character of Sidney Prescott, Neve Campbell spoke positively, saying she "adored" the character and "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie."&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt; In 1997, the ''Scream'' role won Campbell the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]]&lt;ref name="saturnaward"/&gt; and an [[MTV Movie Award for Best Performance|MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance]] nomination.&lt;ref name="ScreamMTV1997"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000453/1997 | title=1997 MTV Movie Awards | publisher=Internet Movie Database|date=June 7, 1997|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she went on to win the 1998 Best Female Performance for ''Scream 2''&lt;ref name="mtvmovieaward"/&gt; and received a second Best Actress nomination from the Saturn Awards, losing to [[Jodie Foster]] for ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Scream2Saturn1998"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000004/1998 | title=1998 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films | publisher=Internet Movie Database|date=June 10, 1998 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a third and final Best Female Performance nomination from MTV in 2000 for the character in ''Scream 3'' but lost to fellow ''Scream'' series alum [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] for ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Scream3MTV2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a608/mtv-movie-award-nominations.html | title=MTV Movie Award Nominations | publisher=Digital Spy|date=April 18, 2000 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scream3MTV20002"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2000/ | title=2000 Movie Awards Summary | publisher=MTV|date=June 3, 2000 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Muir, author of ''Wes Craven: The Art of Horror'', praised the development of Sidney Prescott in ''Scream 2'' labeling her character, amongst others, "beloved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|title=[[Wes Craven: The Art of Horror]]|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|date=24 February 2004|isbn=0-7864-1923-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert, heavily critical of the cast and film of ''Scream 3'', singled out Campbell's role for praise saying "The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000204/REVIEWS/2040303|title=Scream 3|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|date=February 4, 2000 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Knowles]] of [[Ain't It Cool News]] was considerably less complimentary of Campbell, saying "She adds ZERO coolness. Zero talent. And Zero charisma to [''Scream 3'']."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles|first=Harry|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/5166|title=SCREAM 3|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|date=February 5, 2000|accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan Enk and Adam Swiderski of [[UGO Networks|UGO]] ranked Neve Campbell as the 8th greatest [[Scream Queen]] for her role as Sidney Prescott, saying "in the 1990s, Neve was pretty much the number-one scream queen around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Bryan|last1=Enk|first2=Adam|last2=Swiderski|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/fridaythe13th/8.asp|title=The Top 11 Scream Queens - Neve Campbell|publisher=UGO|accessdate=2011-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603161107/http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/fridaythe13th/8.asp|archivedate=2006-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Hari Prasad ([[Sarvadaman Banerjee]]), a blind [[flutist]] lives along with his younger sister in a village near [[Jaipur]], which was also a tourist attraction. Though he lacks knowledge of classical music, he plays flute beautifully and makes a living by playing it to tourists. One day, guide Jyothirmai ([[Moon Moon Sen]]) comes there along with a bunch of tourists and listens to his flute. She understands his talent and helps him understand nature and to become a famous flutist. Years pass and Hari Prasad becomes Pandit Hari Prasad. Unknown to her, Hari Prasad admires her very much and dedicates all his albums to her. Meanwhile, a mute painter Subhashini ([[Suhasini]]) who meets him in his village, falls for him.

Subhashini expresses her feelings through her paintings and gradually her brother understands her feelings regarding Hari Prasad. He approaches Hari Prasad's uncle with a marriage proposal. But at the same time Hari Prasad reveals his admiration for Jyothirmai. This shocks Jyothirmai as she previously worked as an escort to rich tourists. She tries to hint Hari Prasad about her not so decent past, but is overwhelmed by his pure love and disregard for her external characters. Though she herself admires him, she feels that she would taint him with her impure past. She tells Hari Prasad that she couldn't marry him as she already engaged to a doctor. Hari Prasad takes it well as he always wanted Jyothirmai to be happy.

On the wedding day, Jyothirmai commits suicide and requests in her last note that her eyes should be donated to Hari Prasad. She also requests that her funeral procession should appear like a marriage procession and her death should be hidden from Hari Prasad. Everyone tries to act normal and sends her as they are sending a bride to her in-laws. Hari Prasad keeps calm all the time and at last goes to the graveyard to say his final goodbyes to Jyothirmai. He tells shocked Subhashini that it's impossible to hide the death of his angel from him. The film ends with Hari Prasad and Subhashini mourning silently in the graveyard.

==Music==
''Sirivennela'' abounds in classical music composed by [[K. V. Mahadevan]] with flute renditions by the renowned [[flautist]] [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;listing-index.ebay.com/movies/Sirivennela.html&lt;/ref&gt; The movie saw the debut of [[Sirivennela Sitaramasastri]] as a [[lyricist]], who wrote all of the songs. Because of "the wonderful songs," rich in meaning, he penned for the movie, Sitarama Sastry has taken the name Sirivennela. Each of the songs is remembered to this day.

The song "Vidhata Thalapuna", sung by [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]] and [[P. Susheela]], is about [[Om|Aum]], the most sacred syllable in Hinduism, from which the [[Vedas|Veda]] traditions originated. Other notable songs include "Adibhikshuvu Vadinedi Koredhi" and "Ee gali Ee Nela."

[[Image:SpiceChess.jpg|thumb|right|360px|''Spice Chess'', 1965 This example is in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, Detroit, Michigan]]
'''''Spice Chess''''' is an [[artist's multiple]] by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Takako Saito]], while she was resident in the [[United States]]. Originally manufactured winter 1964-65, and offered for sale March 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Offered in Vacuum TrapEzoid Fluxus Newspaper #5, March 1965&lt;/ref&gt; the work is one of a famous series of disrupted chess sets referred to as ''Fluxchess'' or ''Flux Chess'', made for [[George Maciunas|George Maciunas']] [[Fluxus|Fluxshop]] at his [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] loft, [[SoHo]], [[New York City]] and later through his Fluxus Mail-Order Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm Tate Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110140636/http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm |date=2005-11-10 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Takako Saito engaged with Duchamp's practice but also with masculinist cold war metaphors by taking up chess as a subject of [her] art. Saito's fluxchess works... question the primacy of vision to chess, along with notions of perception and in aesthetic experience more generally.... Her "Smell Chess," "Sound Chess" and "Weight Chess" reworked the game of chess so that players would be forced to hone non-visual perception, such as the olfactory sense, tactility, and aurality, in order to follow chess rules." Claudia Mesch&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Reconstruction, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=2012-07-13 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The set follows the normal rules of [[chess]], but replaces the traditional pieces with identically-shaped transparent plastic [[vial]]s filled with different spices for each of the different pieces. The set includes white [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] made of [[Cinnamon]], white [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] of [[Nutmeg]], the white [[Knight (chess)|knights]] are [[Ginger]], black [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]], [[Cumin]] and the Black [[King (chess)|King]] made of [[Asafoetida]]. The white [[Queen (chess)|Queen]] is [[Anise]], the black [[Cayenne pepper]].&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt; The board is also made of transparent plastic. To start the game, both players have to familiarise themselves with each of the 12 smells involved, instead of the more normal reliance on sight.

==Ay-O and George Maciunas==
As a 'basically untrained' &lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; artist in [[Tokyo]], Saito's opportunities to exhibit work were severely limited.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; After taking English lessons, Saito arrived in New York in 1963 on a work visa as an assistant textile wholesaler, 'vaguely [dreaming] of engaging herself in the unknown New York avant-garde'.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p119&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of Fluxus, she concentrated on her own work for a few months before meeting George Maciunas through a mutual friend, [[Ay-O]]. An admirer of Japanese art, Maciunas asked Saito if she could make boxes similar to the [[Paulownia]] boxes he owned, which had been made to protect expensive ceramics.&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005/p122&lt;/ref&gt; Her skill exceeded expectations, leading him to write that 'her craftmanship springs from Japanese tradition for perfection and is unmatched among contemporary artists working in wood and paper.' &lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, quoted in Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GrinderChess.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''Grinder Chess'', 1965 This example Reflux  Edition, 1990]]

===''Fluxchess''===
Maciunas revered [[Marcel Duchamp]], and 'found it amusing that both Duchamp and he were chess fanatics.'&lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p123&lt;/ref&gt; As a homage to Duchamp's assertion that 'all chess players are artists',&lt;ref&gt;'I have come to the conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists' Marcel Duchamp. quoted [http://www.uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 US Chess Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017002910/http://uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 |date=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas asked Saito to create a series of artworks based on chess in late 1964. The series she created relegated or removed the dominant visual aspect of the game, replacing it with sets that relied upon the honing of other senses to play. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'In Saito's chess, strategy is undermined by the physical need to utilize the five senses...by involving senses that were normally unrelated to the traditional game, Saito transformed the ultimate conceptual game into a play of sensuous interactions.' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p126&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As well as ''Spice Chess'', the series includes ''Sound Chess'' (different objects hidden in identical sealed boxes), ''Grinder Chess'' (a series of tactile drill bit polishers), ''Weight Chess'' (different weights hidden in sealed boxes), ''Nut &amp; Bolt Chess'' (the only known example having been lost &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;), ''Jewel Chess'', (made from different fake jewels) and ''Smell Chess'' (different liquids in vials). All of these sets were advertised for sale in Maciunas' Fluxus shop in SoHo, March 1965.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All of these sets were mentioned in Vacuum Trapezoid #5, March 1965, but it is possible that some were never actually manufactured.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I gave all the chess sets to George, I said, 'he can use them as fluxus chess without mentioning my name." Takako Saito &lt;ref&gt;Takako Saito, quoted in Fluxus Codex, p456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Maciunas was said to be so delighted by ''Spice Chess'' that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.' &lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p461&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later ''Fluxchess'' sets and Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set''===
Other ''Fluxchess'' sets were made by Maciunas (''Color Balls in Bottle Board Chess'', March 1966 and ''Time Chess'' made of sand timers, May 1966) and by [[Yoko Ono]], (''Pieces Hidden In Look-a-Like Containers'' intended for the Fluxfest April 1970 &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Munroe, p136, this work 'appears not to have been realized'&lt;/ref&gt; Saito added ''Chess Board Door'' to the series in 1973, in which a chess board was to be attached to a toilet door allowing for a game to continue whilst one of the players was on the loo, and ''Liquor Chess'', 1975 (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20110528054212/http://cms.ifa.de/en/exhibitions/exhibitions-abroad/bk/fluxus/ausgewaehlte-werke/takako-saito]) in which players have to taste various different drinks to ascertain each piece's value. ''Wine Chess'' and ''Book Chess'' have been added to the series since Maciunas' death.

The most famous of these disrupted sets, Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'' (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204062531/http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage Yoko Ono's Myspace] ), in which all the pieces are white on a totally white board (with a brass plaque underneath reading 'Chess Set for playing as long as you can remember where all your pieces are' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p128&lt;/ref&gt;) was originally made for Ono's exhibition at [[Indica Gallery]], London, 1966, and was never produced as a Fluxus edition.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'', in which the opponents' pieces, all white, sit on each side of an all-white board, [make] the warring factions indistinguishable from one another. This elegantly placed anti-war statement, particularly taken in the context of the Vietnam War...[draws] attention to the deeply militaristic metaphors embedded in... games by conscientiously objecting to their implicit narratives of combat and enmity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3982/is_200601/ai_n17183604/pg_10?tag=artBody;col1 Visible Language by Celia Pearce, 2006 on BNet Online], retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piece has been reconfigured a number of times, including an edition of 20 produced by Bag Productions, UK, 1970, and as ''Play It By Trust'', a white table with ten sets and twenty white chairs laid out at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery, New York, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SmellChess-Tate.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''Smell Chess'' being played at Tate Modern, May 2008]]

===Editions===
The sets were originally sold through Maciunas' newly opened Fluxshop in unsigned, unattributed and unnumbered editions. At least one set, ''Grinder Chess'', was remade in an edition of 19 signed and numbered in 1990 as part of the ''Reflux'' editions series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20&amp;%20happening.html Oto housebooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502045432/http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20%26%20happening.html |date=2008-05-02 }} retrieved 03-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hendrick's seminal ''Fluxus Codex'' was published in 1989, there was a general confusion concerning dates and authorship of the key Fluxus pieces, since few were ever sold, and even fewer were signed or dated. Saito's place within the group has gradually become more established, and the playing of ''Fluxchess'' has become an integral part of a number of recent Fluxus exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ Tate Modern, Long Weekend 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006204930/http://tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ |date=2008-10-06 }} retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; An original example of ''Spice Chess'' is one of a number of ''Fluxchess'' sets held in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, [[Detroit]], Michigan.

{{linguistics}}
'''Stylistics''', a branch of [[applied linguistics]], is the study and interpretation of texts of all types and/or spoken language in regard to their linguistic and tonal [[style (sociolinguistics)|style]], where style is the particular [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of language used by different individuals and/or in different situations or settings. For example, the [[vernacular]], or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to [[grammar]], [[accent (sociolinguistics)|pronunciation or accent]], and [[lexicon]] or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and resumé and while speaking during a job interview. 

As a discipline, stylistics link [[literary criticism]] to [[linguistics]]. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of [[literature]] and [[journalism]] as well as [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H.G. 1975. Stylistics and the teaching of literature. Longman: London.  {{ISBN|0-582-55076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul. 2004. Stylistics : A resource book for students. Routledge p. 2: "Stylistics is a method of textual interpretation in which primacy of place is assigned to language".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/7604758/Rape_is_rape_except_when_it_s_not_the_media_recontextualisation_and_violence_against_women Attenborough, F. (2014) 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women', Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict, 2(2): 183-203.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from [[advertising]] copy to [[news]],&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M. (2007) The attraction of opposites: the ideological function of conventional and created oppositions in the construction of in-groups and out-groups in news texts, in L. Jeffries, D. McIntyre, D. Bousfield (eds.) Stylistics and Social Cognition. Amsterdam: Rodopi.&lt;/ref&gt; non-fiction, and [[pop culture|popular culture]], as well as to [[politics|political]] and [[religion|religious]] [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul. 2004. Stylistics: A resource book for students. Routledge p. 3: "The preferred object of study in stylistics is literature, whether that be institutionally sanctioned 'literature' as high art or more popular 'non-canonical' forms of writing.".&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2010) Critical Stylistics. Basingstoke: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; multimodal stylistics&lt;ref&gt;Montoro, R. (2006) Analysting literature through films, in G. Watson, S. Zyngier (eds.) Literature and Stylistics for Language Learners: Theory and Practice. Basingstoke: Palgrave, pp. 48-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mediated stylistics]]&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, F. (2014) Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: recontextualising sexism in the British print press, Journal of Gender Studies, 23(2): 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt; has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as 'a point on a cline rather than as an absolute'.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L., McIntyre, D. (2010) Stylistics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R., Nash, W. (1990) Seeing through Language: a guide to styles of English writing. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of [[genre]], the study of [[folk art]], in the study of spoken [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], and can be applied to areas such as [[discourse analysis]] as well as [[literary criticism]].

Common features of style include the use of [[dialogue]], including regional [[accent (dialect)|accents]] and individual [[dialects]] (or [[ideolects]]), the distribution of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] lengths, the use of particular language registers, and so on. In addition, stylistics is a distinctive term that may be used to determine the connections between the form and effects within a particular variety of language. Therefore, stylistics looks at what is 'going on' within the language; what the linguistic associations are that the style of language reveals.

==Early twentieth century==
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of [[rhetoric|classical rhetoric]], though modern stylistics has its roots in [[Russian Formalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Jeffries, Daniel McIntyre, ''Stylistics'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p 1. {{ISBN|0-521-72869-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague School]] of the early twentieth century.

In 1909, [[Charles Bally]]'s ''Traité de stylistique française'' had proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics. For Bally, Saussure's linguistics by itself couldn't fully describe the language of personal expression.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot J. Taylor, ''Mutual Misunderstanding: Scepticism and the Theorizing of Language and Interpretation'', Duke University Press, 1992, p 91. {{ISBN|0-8223-1249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bally's programme fitted well with the aims of the Prague School.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p 518. {{ISBN|0-89925-356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of ''[[foregrounding]]'', where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of ''deviation'' (from the norms of everyday language) or ''[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Wales, ''A Dictionary of Stylistics'', Pearson Education, 2001, p 315. {{ISBN|0-582-31737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn't constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Pope, ''The English Studies Book: an Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture'', Routledge, 2002, p 88. {{ISBN|0-415-25710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late twentieth century==
[[Roman Jakobson]] had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American [[New Criticism]] in his ''Closing Statement'' at a conference on stylistics at [[Indiana University]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', Routledge, 1993, p 8. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published as ''Linguistics and Poetics'' in 1960, Jakobson's lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 10. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''poetic function'' was one of six general [[Jakobson's functions of language|functions of language]] he described in the lecture.

[[Michael Halliday]] is an important figure in the development of British stylistics.&lt;ref&gt;Raman Selden, ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: From Formalism to Poststructuralism'', Cambridge University Press, 1989, p83. {{ISBN|0-521-30013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1971 study ''Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's '''The Inheritors''''' is a key essay.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Simpson, ''Stylistics: a Resource Book for Students'', Routledge, 2004, p75. {{ISBN|0-415-28104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Halliday's contributions has been the use of the term [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] to explain the connections between language and its context.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday register is distinct from [[dialect]]. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user,&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 12. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; choices which depend on three variables: ''field'' ("what the participants... are actually engaged in doing", for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Butler, ''Structure and Function: a Guide to Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, p 373. {{ISBN|1-58811-361-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[tenor (linguistics)|tenor]]'' (who is taking part in the exchange) and ''mode'' (the use to which the language is being put).

Fowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of [[vocabulary]] (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist [[David Crystal]] points out that Halliday's 'tenor' stands as a roughly equivalent term for 'style', which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday's third category, ''mode'', is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the [[genre]] of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist [[William Downes (linguist)|William Downes]] makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).

==Literary stylistics==
In ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'', Crystal observes that, in practice, most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and 'valued' language within literature, i.e. 'literary stylistics'. He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of [[literary language]], for instance, its 'deviant' and abnormal features, rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses. For example, the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the [[stylistician]] than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal. 1987, 71).

===Poetry===
As well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional – the most obvious of which is [[poetry]]. In ''Practical Stylistics'', [[Henry Widdowson|HG Widdowson]] examines the traditional form of the [[epitaph]], as found on headstones in a cemetery. For example:&lt;br&gt;
:His memory is dear today
:As in the hour he passed away.
:(Ernest C. Draper 'Ern'. Died 4.1.38)
:(Widdowson. 1992, 6)

Widdowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as 'crude verbal carvings' and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson, 3). Nevertheless, Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member. However, what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic [[phraseology]] but in where it appears. The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed. Widdowson suggests that, unlike words set in stone in a graveyard, poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with inter-textual implications (Widdowson. 1992, 4).

Two problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by [[PM Wetherill]] in ''Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods''. The first is that there may be an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).

===Implicature===
In '[[Poetic Effects]]' from ''Literary Pragmatics'', the [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Adrian Pilkington]] analyses the idea of '[[implicature]]', as instigated in the previous work of [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]]. Implicature may be divided into two categories: 'strong' and 'weak' implicature, yet between the two extremes there are a variety of other alternatives. The strongest implicature is what is emphatically implied by the speaker or writer, while weaker implicatures are the wider possibilities of meaning that the hearer or reader may conclude.

Pilkington's '[[poetic effects]]', as he terms the concept, are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply 'read in' by the hearer or reader. Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or reader's conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective. As Pilkington says: 'there is no clear cut-off point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearer's responsibility.' (Pilkington. 1991, 53) In addition, the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkington's poetic effects in understanding a poem's meaning.

===Tense===
Widdowson points out that in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]" (1798), the mystery of the Mariner's abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense. (Widdowson. 1992, 40) For instance, the Mariner 'holds' the wedding-guest with his 'skinny hand' in the [[present tense]], but releases it in the [[past tense]] ('...his hands dropt he.'); only to hold him again, this time with his 'glittering eye', in the present (Widdowson. 1992, 41).

===The point of poetry===
Widdowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised, it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations, such as 'nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes', and so on (Widdowson. 1992, 9). But to say:&lt;br&gt;
:Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
:So do our minutes hasten to their end ...
:William Shakespeare, '60'.
Or, indeed:&lt;br&gt;
:Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
:Nor hours, days months, which are the rags of time ...
:[[John Donne]], '[[The Sun Rising]]', ''Poems'' (1633)
This language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson. 1992, 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like 'love', 'heart' and 'soul' to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (Widdowson. 1992, 76).

'''Subliterature''' or '''trivialliteratur''' is popular writing and texts that are sometimes called [[literature]] but not so classified by [[literary critics]]. Subliterature is intrinsically considered inferior to literature in terms of writing skill, depth and legacy. Subliterature is considered to have little influence on future literature despite any popular or commercial success. Characteristics of subliterature share some aspects of [[pop music]]:
* Appeal to a general audience
* Tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments.

==Examples of books considered subliterature==
*''[[Harry Potter]]''
*''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''
*''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]''
*''[[Hush, Hush (series)|Hush, Hush]]''
*''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''

"'''The Natural Ontological Attitude'''" (1984) is the name of a paper published by philosopher [[Arthur Fine]] in which he coins the term "natural ontological attitude" (NOA). It deals with the [[philosophy of science]]. He published a sequel, "And Not Antirealism Either"&lt;ref&gt;''Noûs'' 18, pp. 51-65, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year, and both papers were later anthologized in the book ''The Shaky Game'' (1986).

==Overview==
Fine published "The Natural Ontological Attitude"&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Realism'', pp. 83-107, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984 and a sequel, "And Not Antirealism Either"&lt;ref&gt;''Nous'' 18, pp. 51-65, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. His subject is the nature and validity of scientific knowledge and his goal is to get the reader to abandon either realism or antirealism as he understands them. In their place he advocates a "natural ontological attitude" (NOA). Both articles were republished as chapters in Fine's book ''The Shaky Game,''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shaky Game'', pp. 112-50, University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; which takes its title from a comment by Einstein that physicists who undermine causality in physics are playing a shaky/risky game.

Fine argues that both realists and anti-realists share a basic "core" position about both everyday things and scientific statements. Realists and antirealists both trust the evidence of their senses that tables, chairs and other people are present before us and in some sense exist. They also trust the substantiated pronouncements of science that protons and electrons exist and have the size, mass and charge science assigns them. To quote Fine about such common ("core") positions: "…it is possible to accept the evidence of one's senses and accept, ''in the same way'' [his italics], the confirmed results of science….".&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'', p. 127,&lt;/ref&gt; Stated another way: "…both realist and antirealist accept the results of scientific investigations as 'true,' on par with more homely [commonplace, everyday] truths."

Fine asks, if everybody, realist and antirealist included, shares a core position about entities that exist and propositions that are true (e.g., F = ma) where do the differences lie? They lie, according to Fine, in the additions that partisans make to the core. Antirealists may add "the pragmatic…[or] instrumentalist…[or] conventionalist conceptions of truth…[or maybe add an overlay of] idealism, constructivism, phenomenalism [or] empiricism."&lt;ref&gt;''Shakey Game'', pp. 128-29,&lt;/ref&gt; Spelling out what realists add to the core position takes Fine a long paragraph that boils down to simply one charge: "correspondence with the world … claims about reality."&lt;ref&gt;''Shakey Game'', p. 129,&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine then goes on. "It seems to me that when we contrast the realist and the antirealist in terms of what they each want to add to the core position, a third alternative emerges—and an attractive one at that. It is the core position itself, ''and all by itself'' [his italics]."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 129,&lt;/ref&gt;  Fine continues, "…at heart, the grip of realism only extends to the homely connection of everyday truths with scientific truths, and that good sense dictates our acceptance of the one on the same basis as our acceptance of the other, then the homely line makes the core position, all by itself, a compelling one...."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' pp. 129-30,&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism itself is unpalatable to Fine because of the realist's desire to connect truths about an entity (say the mass or charge of an electron) to an actual, existing entity (electron). It is permissible to believe in the properties of an electron but not in the electron itself as the bearer of those properties. That is the mistake realists make. Yet Fine admits that the working scientist believes "…in the existence of those entities to which his theories refer."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 130,&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fine concedes that practitioners of science are in no need of the goals, interpretations or justifications of science that theorists can provide.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'', top of p. 148,&lt;/ref&gt; And although scientists may discover more and more properties of, or facts about, an entity, Fine insists that we should not confuse successive advances in our knowledge of an entity with closer approximations as to what that entity actually is.

Antirealists also come under criticism. Theorists who define truth in terms of "acceptance" (rational agreement), or behaviorism or empiricism are all "truthmongers" who are seeking some foundation, some rationale, for what they believe. They make the same basic mistake as the realists since they "rely on metaphysical or epistemological hearing aids"&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; to hear the voice of science. Only NOA is immune from these delusions and distractions. Fine concludes ''And Not Antirealism Either'' by arguing that truth is a semantical concept and not an ontological or metaphysical concept. He argues that those who wish to ground "truth" in correspondence, empiricism, pragmatism, acceptance, etc. are all making the same fundamental mistake. Embrace NOA he argues and be non-judgmental and heuristic in your pursuit of knowledge. Reject the concept of "truth" as a gold standard to which all knowledge must be compared or evaluated.

==Criticism==
Since Fine criticizes both realists and antirealists he has come in for criticism from both sides. Many critics could not resist some word play with NOA/NOAH, ark, and "Fine."&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Schlagel, "Critical Notice: Fine's 'Shaky Game' (and Why NOA is no Ark for Science)", ''Philosophy of Science,'' Vol. 58, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 307-323. Also the Musgrave article below.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Musgrave]] argues that Fine distorts the varied positions of antirealists especially with regard to their support of the "core."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Musgrave, "NOA'S Ark -- Fine for Realism," ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 39 No. 157, pp. 383-98.&lt;/ref&gt; He and others object to the way Fine equates his "core" position with their definition (or anti-definition) of "true."

Robert Klee writes: "NOA seems like obvious inconsistent fence-sitting."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Klee, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Science: Cutting Nature at Its Seams'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Schlagel writes "I find it utterly implausible that Fine could be serious when he argues that explanatory success could have nothing at all to do with truth."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Cutting Nature at Its Seams'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stathis Psillos]] writes "When is the question of theory-acceptance scientifically relevant, and when is it not? Fine refrains from saying, perhaps, because, in the final analysis, it always is relevant."&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Slave Market''''' is a painting of about 1882 by the 19th century French artist [[Gustave Boulanger]], who specialized in classical and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] genre scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Masler, 39&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts an [[Ancient Roman]] slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The youngest boy is completely naked, while the young man next to him is wearing a loincloth. The young woman sitting next to them is topless, wearing only a skirt, but she is covering her breasts with her legs. The standing African woman is also topless, wearing a white loincloth, and she is covering her breasts with her hands. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and [[pubic hair]]—she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The adolescent girl next to her is also topless and barefoot, wearing a skirt. The young woman sitting next to them is wearing a loose garment which leaves both her breasts and her genitals exposed.

From a common type of [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] [[academic art]] of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a [[history painting]], as was customary at the time in [[Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4524">'''Transrealism''' is a literary mode that mixes the techniques of incorporating fantastic elements used in [[science fiction]] with the techniques of describing immediate perceptions from naturalistic [[realism (arts)|realism]]. While combining the strengths of the two approaches, it is largely a reaction to their perceived weaknesses. Transrealism addresses the [[escapism]] and disconnect with reality of science fiction by providing for superior characterization through autobiographical features and simulation of the author's acquaintances. It addresses the tiredness and boundaries of realism by using fantastic elements to create new metaphors for psychological change and to incorporate the author's perception of a higher reality in which life is embedded. One possible source for this higher reality is the increasingly strange models of the universe put forward in [[theoretical astrophysics]].

Its main proponent and prominent figure is science fiction author [[Rudy Rucker]]. Rucker coined the term "transrealism" after reading [[Philip K Dick]]'s ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' described as "transcendental autobiography," and expounded the principles of transrealism in a short essay titled "A Transrealist Manifesto" in 1983. Rucker applied many of these principles in his short stories and novels, notably ''[[White Light (novel)|White Light]]'' and ''[[Saucer Wisdom]]''. [[Damien Broderick]] has identified some other authors that have at some time utilized transrealist tropes to include [[Martin Amis]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Iain Banks]], [[John Barth]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[John Calvin Batchelor]], [[Jonathan Carroll]], [[Philip K. Dick]] especially, [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Lisa Goldstein]], [[James Morrow]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[James Tiptree Jr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Broderick| first1 = Damien| authorlink = Damien Broderick| title = Transrealist Fiction: Writing in the Slipstream of Science| publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]| location = Westport, CT| date = 2000| page = | doi = | isbn = 0-313-31121-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damien Broderick argues that a state of perception (termed ''transreality'') that is playfully contrary to [[consensus reality]] is a prerequisite for writing effective transrealist fiction. The necessary viewpoint is playful in the sense that the author does not need to literally believe the fantastic interpretation of the perception and may support and undermine it through reference to speculative science. An example of this can be seen in Rucker's blog, where he discusses an experience in an airport terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rudy |last=Rucker |authorlink=Rudy Rucker |url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2005/01/28/transrealism-in-action-mirror-aliens/ |title=Transrealism in Action: Mirror-Aliens |website=Rudy's Blog |date=January 28, 2005 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 essay, Damien Walter argued that science fiction and other literature were increasingly converging, and that the refusal of plot and "archetypal" characters in transrealism is "meant to be uncomfortable, by telling us that our reality is at best constructed, at worst non-existent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Damien |last=Walter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/oct/24/transrealism-first-major-literary-movement-21st-century |title=Transrealism: the first major literary movement of the 21st century? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transrealism's stance against consensus reality identifies it as a [[postmodern literature]] akin to [[surrealism]] and covering much the same ground as [[Slipstream (genre)|slipstream]] literature. Transrealism may be considered a subset of slipstream, depending on how the latter term is defined, or as Broderick posits, slipstream may be very nearly the same thing as transrealism. Broderick also argues that the approach to literature offered by science fiction as a whole, including both transrealism and slipstream, becomes more crucial as society possibly approaches a [[technological singularity]].

{{Greek myth (sea)}}
'''Triton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|t|ə|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Τρίτων#Ancient Greek|Τρίτων]]}} ''Tritōn'') is a mythological [[Greek mythology|Greek god]], the messenger of the sea. He is the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]], god and goddess of the sea respectively, and is [[herald]] for his father. He is usually represented as a [[merman]] which has the upper body of a human and the tail, soft dorsal fin, spiny dorsal fin, anal fin, pelvic fins and caudal fin of a fish, "sea-hued", according to [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' I.332 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; "his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells".

Like his father, [[Poseidon]], he carried a [[trident]]. However, Triton's special attribute was a twisted [[conch]] shell, on which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves. Its sound was such a cacophony, that when loudly blown, it put the giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Pseudo-Hyginus]], ''Poetical astronomy'' ii. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'' 930.&lt;/ref&gt; Triton dwelt with his parents in a golden [[palace]] in the depths of the sea; [[Homer]] places his seat in the waters off Aegae (presumably [[Aegae (Achaea)|Aegae, Achaea]], where Poseidon had his palace).&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' xiii. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' v.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the [[Argonauts]] places his home on the coast of [[Libya]]. When the [[Argo]] was driven ashore in the [[Gulf of Gabès|Gulf of Syrtes Minor]], the crew carried the vessel to the "Tritonian Lake", [[Lake Tritonis]], whence Triton, the local deity [[euhemerism|euhemeristically]] rationalized by [[Diodorus Siculus]] as "then ruler over [[Libya]]",&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus iv.56.6.&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed them with a guest-gift of a clod of earth and guided them through the lake's marshy outlet back to the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', iv. 1552ff&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Argonauts]] were lost in the desert, he guided them to find the passage from the river back to the sea.

Triton was the father of [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] and foster parent to the goddess [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'' 3. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Pallas was killed by Athena accidentally during a sparring fight between the two goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', 3.12.3&lt;/ref&gt; Triton can sometimes be multiplied into a host of '''Tritones''', ''[[daimon]]es'' of the sea.

In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', book 6, it is told that Triton killed [[Misenus]], son of [[Aeolus]], by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.164 6.164 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tritons==
[[File:Alexander-Justice-Samuel-Pepys-Josiah-Burchett-A-general-treatise-of-the-dominion-of-the-sea MG 1104.tif|thumb|A Triton blowing on a conch on this title page of Alexander Justice, Samuel Pepys and Josiah Burchett: ''A general treatise of the dominion of the sea'', 1710]]

Over time, Triton's class and image came to be associated with a class of mermaid-like creatures, the Tritons (Τρίτωνες), which could be male or female, and usually formed the escort of marine divinities.  Tritons were a race of sea gods and goddesses born from Triton. Triton lived with his parents, [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]], who was also known as [[Celaeno]], in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea.  According to [[Homer]] it was called [[Aegae (Achaea)|Aegae]].  Unlike their ancestor Poseidon who is always fully anthropomorphic in ancient art (this has only changed in modern popular culture), Triton's lower half is that of a fish, while the top half is presented in a human figure. This is debated often because their appearance is described differently throughout history.  Ordinary Tritons were described in detail by the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (ix. 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin////ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.21.1 |title=Pausanias, '&amp;#39;Description of Greece'&amp;#39; 9.21.2 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&lt;/ref&gt;

: "The Tritons have the following appearance. On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs not only in color, but also in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under their ears they have gills and a man's nose; but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue, and they have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the breast and belly is a tail like a dolphin's instead of feet."
[[File:Tritonbrunnen rom.JPG|thumb|[[Fontana del Tritone|The Triton Fountain]], by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Rome]]]]
[[File:Viktor Tilgner-Triton und Nymphe-Volksgarten.jpg|thumb|''Triton and Nymphe'' fountain by [[Viktor Tilgner]] in the [[Volksgarten (Vienna)]]]]

They are often compared to other [[Mermaid|Merman/Mermaid]] like beings, such as [[Merrow]]s, [[Selkies]], and [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s. They are also thought of as the aquatic versions of [[Satyrs]]. Another description of Tritons is that of the Centaur-Tritons, also known as [[Ichthyocentaurs]] who are depicted with two horse's feet in place of arms.

When Pausanias visited the city of Triteia in the second century CE, he was told that the name of the city was derived from an [[eponym]]ous '''Triteia''', a daughter of Triton, and that it claimed to have been founded by her son (with [[Ares]]), one among several mythic heroes named [[Melanippus]] ("Black Horse").&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' vii.22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tritons were the trumpeters of the sea, using trumpets made out of a great shell, mostly known as a conch. They would blow this shell throughout the sea to calm the waves, or stir them up, all at the command of Poseidon.

== University, college, and high school mascot ==
There are numerous universities, colleges, and [[High school (North America)|high school]]s that use Triton as their mascot. These include the following:
* [[University of California, San Diego]], [[La Jolla, California]]
* [[Eckerd College]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]
* [[Edmonds Community College]], [[Lynnwood, Washington]]
* [[Iowa Central Community College]], [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]]
* [[Mariner High School (Cape Coral, Florida)|Mariner High School]], [[Cape Coral, Florida]]
* [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Notre Dame Academy]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]
* [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)]]
* [[University of Guam]], [[Mangilao, Guam]]
* [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]]
* [[University of Rennes 1, Brittany France]]
Many club sports teams, such as junior football leagues and numerous swimming leagues, also use the symbol of Triton.

An example of other uses include Wilfrid Laurier University's orientation week in 2014 that had a colour team named the Green Tritons as part of the weeks events.

==Triton since the Renaissance==
The largest moon of the planet [[Neptune]] has been given the name [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], as Neptune is the Roman equivalent of Poseidon.

In [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s sonnet "[[The World Is Too Much with Us]]" (ca 1802, published 1807), the poet regrets the prosaic humdrum modern world, yearning for

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.&lt;/poem&gt;

In [[Jacob Jordaens]]' '[[The Family of the Artist]]', now in the [[Prado]], Madrid, a Triton is depicted gripping, perhaps crushing, a child with its snake-like tail, a scene watched over by an exotic parrot. The significance of this motif in the context of a painting of domestic happiness is unclear, but it may involve a transfer of functions in that the child appears to be blowing on the conch shell (referred to above) in order to frighten away those forces that threaten family peace.

A family of large sea snails, the shells of some of which have been used as trumpets since antiquity, are commonly known as "tritons", see [[Triton (gastropod)]].

The name Triton is associated in modern industry with tough hard-wearing machines such as the [[Ford Triton engine]] and [[Mitsubishi Triton]] pickup truck.

[[King Triton]] is a character depicted in the Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', inspired by Triton, as an undersea king, the father of the title character.  In ''The Little Mermaid'', Triton has seven daughters for the [[Seven Seas]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the youngest named [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]], of whom he is very overprotective. Though, [[King Triton|this character]] (and all the other ones in the Disney movie) are actually based in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale.

[[Image:Afghancarpet1.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Teke tribe|Teke]] design Turkmen carpet. This pattern is often referred to as the "Bukhara" print design.]]
A '''Turkmen rug''' ({{lang-tk|Türkmen haly}}; or '''Turkmen carpet''' or '''Turkoman carpet''') is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in [[Central Asia]]. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export mainly in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] today. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes who are the main ethnic group in [[Turkmenistan]] and are also found in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]]. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.

== History ==
[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|left|Two Turkmen men standing on a carpet in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]
[[File:Five Tree Yomut Asmalyk, Turkmenistan, 18-19th century, 75 x 124 cm.jpg|thumbnail|Five Tree Yomut [[Asmalyk]], Turkmenistan, 18-19th century.]]
[[File:Tolkuchka Bazaar4.jpg|thumbnail|Carpets in [[Altyn Asyr Bazaar]]]]
A few centuries back, almost all Turkmen rugs were produced by nomadic tribes almost entirely with locally obtained materials, wool from the herds and vegetable dyes, or other [[natural dye]]s from the land. They used geometrical designs that varied from tribe to tribe; most famous are the [[Yomut carpet|Yomut]], [[Ersari]], [[Saryk]], [[Salor]], and [[Teke tribe|Tekke]]. Irregularities &amp;mdash; considered part of the charm by many rug collectors &amp;mdash; were fairly common since natural materials varied from batch to batch and woolen warp or weft may stretch, especially on a loom that is regularly folded up for transport and set up a new at another camp.

More recently, large rug workshops in the cities have appeared, there are fewer irregularities, and the technology has changed some. Since about 1910, synthetic dyes have been used along with natural ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Between the Black Desert and the Red: Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection'', San Francisco, Fine Arts Museum, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The size of nomadic rugs is limited to what can be done on a nomad's portable loom; larger rugs have always been produced in the villages, but they are now more common. Using cotton for warp and weft threads has also become common.

The rugs produced in large numbers for export in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] and sold under the name of Turkmen rugs are mostly made of synthetic colors, with cotton warps and wefts and wool pile. They have little in common with the original Turkmen tribal rugs. In these export rugs, various patterns and colors are used, but the most typical is that of the [[Bukhara]] design, which derives from the Tekke main carpet, often with a red or tan background (picture). Another favorite is derived from the Ersari main carpet, with the [[octagon]]al ''elephant's foot'' design. The [[Turkmen Carpet Museum]], which preserves examples of the original Turkmen tribal rugs, is located in [[Ashgabat]].

Many [[Afghan rug]]s bear a strong resemblance to Turkmen rugs. [[Afghanistan]] produces a lot of relatively cheap and coarse rugs, mainly for export, and many of those are in a "Bokhara" design. However, there are also some very fine Afghans including many using Turkmen designs.

At the end of the 20th century, carpet weaving in Turkmenistan had become one of the most important sectors of the economy. In 1992, Turkmen Carpet Day officially became a public national holiday, celebrated annually on the last Sunday in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/?page_id=3&amp;lang_id=en&amp;elem_id=8165&amp;type=event&amp;sort=date_desc Turkmen carpet day marked as national holiday]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the modern Turkmen carpets stands the world's largest handmade carpet total area of 301 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was woven in 2001, and in 2003 entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2011/11/largest-architectural-star-record-set-in-turkmenistan/ LARGEST ARCHITECTURAL STAR RECORD SET IN TURKMENISTAN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.trend.az/news/politics/1532003.html Turkmen biggest carpet included in Guinness World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heraldry ===
The vertical strip of the [[Flag of Turkmenistan]] placed five main patterns of Turkmen carpets. These figures are arranged. Secondary figures are disposed along the edges. Patterns reflect national unity of Turkmenistan. The five traditional carpet motifs in [[Emblem of Turkmenistan]] on the red disc represent the five major [[tribe]]s or houses, and stand for the [[tradition]]al and religious values of the country. These Turkmen tribes in traditional order are [[Teke tribe|Teke]], [[Yomut carpet|Yomut]], [[Arsary]], [[Chowdur]] and [[Saryk]] ([[Saryq]]).

=== Ministry of Carpets ===

State Association [[Turkmenhaly]] is a major supplier to the world market of pure wool pile hand-made Turkmen carpets from Turkmenistan. The principal activities of the corporation are the production and sale of Turkmen carpets and rugs, preserving the traditions of carpet weaving hand, the restoration of old carpet ornaments and articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5541 French Bouygues to build office building for Turkmenhaly state corporation and Museum of Turkmen carpet in Ashgabat]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkmen Carpet Museum ===
The Turkmenistan Presidential Decree of 20 March 1993 in Ashgabat created the [[Turkmen Carpet Museum]]. The Carpet Museum is one of the cultural centers of Turkmenistan, which has about 2,000 carpet exhibits, including rare ones, on display. For example, the museum has the smallest carpet product, designed to be worn with keys. The museum conducts restoration of antique carpets as well. It's a challenging process - some artfully woven old specimens contain up to 1,350,000 knots. The museum is constantly updated, and its employees conduct searches and compiles collections of old carpets. The new building of the National Museum of Turkmen Carpets has an overall space of 5089 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The museum also hosts international scientific forums and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/articles/17224.html Day of Turkmen Carpet celebrated in Turkmenistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major towns producing rugs ===
[[Bereket]] has a Turkmen carpet [[weaving]] factory, in usage since 1923.

:'''Casey Newton''': "There are two [[wolves]]" … You told me this story my entire life, and now I'm telling you: There are two [[wolves]] and they are always [[fighting]]. One is [[darkness]] and [[despair]], the other is [[light]] and [[hope]]. Which wolf wins?
:'''Eddie Newton''': C'mon, Casey.
:'''Casey Newton''': Okay, fine, don’t answer.
:'''Eddie Newton''': Whichever one you feed.
