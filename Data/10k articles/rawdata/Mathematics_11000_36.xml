'''124''' ('''one hundred [and] twenty-four''') is the [[natural number]] following [[123 (number)|123]] and preceding [[125 (number)|125]].

==In mathematics==
'''124''' is the sum of eight consecutive primes (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29). It is a [[nontotient]] since there is no integer with 124 coprimes below it. It is an [[untouchable number]] since there is no integer whose proper [[divisor]]s add up to 124.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005114|title=Sloane's A005114 : Untouchable numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In base 5 it is a [[repdigit]] (444&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''Accidental Adversaries''' is one of the ten [[system archetype]]s used in [[system dynamics]] modelling, or [[systems thinking]]. This archetype describes the degenerative pattern that develops when two subjects cooperating for a common goal, accidentally take actions that undermine each other's success. It is similar to the [[System archetype#Escalation|escalation system archetype]] in terms of pattern behaviour that develops over time.&lt;ref name="fieldbook"&gt;Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archetype description==

The archetype describes a pattern where two subjects have decided to work together because they will benefit from the alliance.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;Braun B. (2002) [http://www.albany.edu/faculty/gpr/PAD724/724WebArticles/sys_archetypes.pdf The System Archetypes]&lt;/ref&gt; Each take actions believing that it will bring benefit to the other and if the cooperation works, they will both benefit from it. Problems start arising when one or both of the subjects need to fix a local gap in performance, maybe due to external pressure. They initiate action to fix the gap and accidentally undermine each other's success. The result of these activities may produce a sense of resentment or frustration between the subjects or it may even turn the subjects into adversaries (hence the archetype name), thereby destroying the alliance.

===History===

The original set of system archetypes were published in [[The Fifth Discipline]] by [[Peter Senge]].  The exact source of these generic structures is not known.  However "Accidental Adversaries"  has a clear origin.  It is derived from observations made by Jennifer Kemeny, a colleague of Senge's and a contributor to the original archetype descriptions. In her consulting work in the late 1980s she was intrigued at how often potential strategic alliances were unsuccessful, or devolved into outright hostility. Such a recurring phenomenon suggested a structural cause.  The essential elements of the archetype were first described during a session Kemeny facilitated.  It was the first meeting of the first ever alliance between Walmart and Procter and Gamble.  Employees diagrammed how their protective business policies caused unintentional damage to the other company – which responded with similarly defensive actions.  The net effect of these "back and forth" behaviors was lower profit and less goodwill –  which for a long period of time had overshadowed the possibility of mutual benefit between the organizations. An early description of "Accidental Adversaries" is in The Fifth Discipline: Fieldbook, by Senge, ''et al.''

===Description of the model===
Let's consider two parties A and B. They have realised that by uniting forces, they can increase their success, whatever that may be. At a certain point in time, say B, takes corrective actions in order to counteract a decrease in performance due to external pressure. Although B's actions are important for B, their impact on A are not understood or not considered. The result is that now A feels that he is being betrayed and reacts to diminish the negative effects of B's actions. Ironically, A's new actions now obstruct B's success. If this situation persists and the results worsen, the alliance breaks down. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Vicious circle|vicious circle]] is created and each partner has now even forgotten the original purpose of the alliance. A and B's actions now only focus on counteracting the hostile actions taken by the other. A and B thus 'accidentally' become adversaries.&lt;ref name="systemswiki"&gt;Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype at SystemsWiki.org. {{cite web|url=http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title%3DAccidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920154719/http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Accidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causal Loop diagram==
The [[causal loop diagram]] in Figure 1 shows the pattern dynamics of the system.&lt;ref name="systemsthinking"&gt;Accidental Adversaries at Systems-Thinking.org. http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/saa/aa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop original.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Causal loop diagram|Figure 1. Causal loop diagram]]
The pattern of behaviour begins with the outer [[Positive feedback|reinforcing loop]] R1 where A and B have formed a synergistic alliance that benefits both. An action taken by A in favour of B increases B's success and vice versa. At some point in time, though, say B, initiates a series of corrective actions in order to adjust its performance. The actions taken increase performance, whose effects balance the number of corrective actions required. This results in the creation of a [[Negative feedback|balancing loop]], B2. These actions also unintentionally obstruct the other party's success, and result in the formation of the negative reinforcing loop R2 that undermines the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Virtuous circle|virtuous]] reinforcing loop R1. Now each corrective action taken by B causes A to start taking corrective measures as well, thus activating its own balancing loop B1. The formation of R2 is the critical point at which the dynamics of the system go out of control, resembling the [[System archetype#Escalation|Escalation]] archetype.

==Stock and flow diagram==
Figure 2 shows the [[stock and flow|stock and flow diagram]] for this archetype.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Stock and flow.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Stock&amp;Flow diagram|Figure 2. Stock and Flow diagram]]

==Alternative model==
An alternative form of the model is shown in Figure 3. The differences are in the two reinforcing loops R3 and R4. Here, A and B specifically take actions to improve their growth, not, as before, to adjust their performance to a pre-determined target. By seeking improvement through R3 and R4, A and B suppress the effects of R1 and establish the negative-effect reinforcing loop R2, that in turn, completely takes over B5 and B6. The two balancing loops B5 and B6 are formed by, respectively,&lt;br/&gt;
:''B's success-&gt;B's actions in A's favour-&gt;A's success-&gt;A's actions to improve A's success-&gt;A's unintended obstruction of B's success'' and
:''A's success-&gt;A's actions in B's favour-&gt;B's success-&gt;B's actions to improve B's success-&gt;B's unintended obstruction of A's success''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop Alternative model.svg|thumb|350px|center|Figure 3. Alternative Causal Loop diagram]].

==Model behaviour==

The archetype behaviour over time is shown in Figure 4.[[File:Accidental Adversaries TimeBehaviour.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 4. Behaviour over time]]&lt;br/&gt;Both parties show a similar trend in direction and rate of change of success, with one trailing behind the other one due to system delays. Even though the pattern shows stable periods, the overall trend follows a downward direction.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The above simulation can be run from [[InsightMaker]].&lt;ref name="Insight Maker"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clone of Accidental Adversaries | website=Insight Maker | url=http://insightmaker.com/insight/678 | access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible leverage points==

It is possible to achieve leverage by introducing or re-emphasising a link between each party's success,&lt;ref name="wolstenholme"&gt;Wolstenholme E. F. (2003)
[http://www.symmetricsd.co.uk/files/Towards_definition_of_a_core_set_of_archetypal_structures.pdf Towards the definition and use of a core set of archetypal structures in system dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; thus re-establishing the outer virtuous reinforcing loop shown in Figure 3. Kemeny proposes a list of seven action steps to deal with the unintended consequences of each party's actions, given their [[mental model]]s:&lt;ref name="kemeny"&gt;Kemeny J (1994) "Accidental Adversaries": When Friends Become Foes, ''The Systems Thinker'', Vol. 5, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

* Reconstruct the conditions that were the catalyst for collaboration.
* Review the original understandings and expected mutual benefits.
* Identify conflicting incentives that may be driving adversarial behaviour.
* Map the unintended side effects of each party’s actions.
* Develop overarching goals that align the efforts of the parties.
* Establish metrics to monitor collaborative behaviour.
* Establish routine communication

==Example==

A classic example of the Accidental Adversaries system archetype is that of [[Procter &amp; Gamble|Procter and Gamble]] supplying [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. When Procter and Gamble's profits decline, they introduce promotions. This results in extra costs and decreasing profitability for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's responds by stocking-up – buying large quantities of products during the discount period – and then selling them at regular prices when promotions end, thereby increasing its margins. Procter and Gamble's production now faces great swings in volume because Wal-Mart does not need to order products for months, which adds to P and G's costs. To improve their situation, Procter and Gamble pushes even more on promotions, blaming at the same time Wal-Mart for their problems. Wal-Mart reacts by stocking-up even more. Eventually, Procter and Gamble finds itself putting a lot of effort into promotions, at the expense of new product development, while Wal-Mart concentrates solely on buying and storing promoted products rather than improving their operations. The situation is described by the causal loop diagram in Figure 5.
In the Procter and Gamble/Wal-Mart case, leverage was achieved by bringing both parties together to understand the structure they had unintentionally created, even though each party 's action was completely rational and understandable from their local perspective.&lt;ref name="kemeny" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">In mathematics, '''admissible representations''' are a well-behaved class of [[Group representation|representations]] used in the [[representation theory]] of [[reductive group|reductive]] [[Lie group]]s and [[locally compact group|locally compact]] [[totally disconnected group]]s. They were introduced by [[Harish-Chandra]].

==Real or complex reductive Lie groups==
Let ''G'' be a connected reductive (real or complex) Lie group. Let ''K'' be a maximal compact subgroup. A continuous representation (π,&amp;nbsp;''V'') of ''G'' on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''V''&lt;ref&gt;I.e. a homomorphism {{nowrap|π : ''G'' → GL(''V'')}} (where GL(''V'') is the group of [[bounded linear operator]]s on ''V'' whose inverse is also bounded and linear) such that the associated map {{nowrap|''G'' × ''V'' → ''V''}} is continuous.&lt;/ref&gt; is called '''admissible''' if π restricted to ''K'' is [[unitary representation|unitary]] and each [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] unitary representation of ''K'' occurs in it with finite multiplicity. The prototypical example is that of an irreducible unitary representation of ''G''.

An admissible representation π induces a [[(g,K)-module|&lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{g},K)&lt;/math&gt;-module]] which is easier to deal with as it is an algebraic object. Two admissible representations are said to be '''infinitesimally equivalent''' if their associated &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{g},K)&lt;/math&gt;-modules are isomorphic. Though for general admissible representations, this notion is different than the usual equivalence, it is an important result that the two notions of equivalence agree for unitary (admissible) representations. Additionally, there is a notion of unitarity of &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{g},K)&lt;/math&gt;-modules. This reduces the study of the equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of ''G'' to the study of infinitesimal equivalence classes of admissible representations and the determination of which of these classes are infinitesimally unitary. The problem of parameterizing the infinitesimal equivalence classes of admissible representations was fully solved by [[Robert Langlands]] and is called the [[Langlands classification]].

== Totally disconnected groups ==

Let ''G'' be a [[locally profinite group|locally compact totally disconnected group]] (such as a reductive algebraic group over a nonarchimedean [[local field]] or over the finite [[adele ring|adeles]] of a [[global field]]). A representation (π,&amp;nbsp;''V'') of ''G'' on a complex vector space ''V'' is called '''smooth''' if the subgroup of ''G'' fixing any vector of ''V'' is [[open set|open]]. If, in addition, the space of vectors fixed by any [[compact space|compact]] open subgroup is finite dimensional then π is called '''admissible'''. Admissible representations of ''p''-adic groups admit more algebraic description through the action of the [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke algebra]] of locally constant functions on ''G''.

Deep studies of admissible representations of ''p''-adic reductive groups were undertaken by [[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Casselman]] and by [[Joseph Bernstein|Bernstein]] and [[Andrey Zelevinsky|Zelevinsky]] in the 1970s. Much progress has been made more recently by [[Roger Evans Howe|Howe]] and Moy and Bushnell and Kutzko, who developed a ''theory of types'' and classified the admissible dual (i.e. the set of equivalence classes of irreducible admissible representations) in many cases.

In [[game theory]], '''Aumann's agreement theorem''' is a [[theorem]] which demonstrates that [[rational agent]]s with [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] of each other's beliefs cannot [[agree to disagree]]. It was first formulated in the 1976 paper titled "Agreeing to Disagree" by [[Robert Aumann]], after whom the theorem is [[Eponym|named]].

==Explanation==
Aumann's agreement theorem says that two people acting [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] (in a certain precise sense) and with [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] of each other's beliefs cannot [[agree to disagree]]. More specifically, if two people are genuine [[Bayesian theory|Bayesian rationalists]] with common [[prior probability|priors]], and if they each have [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] of their individual [[posterior probability|posterior probabilities]], then their posteriors must be equal.&lt;ref name="aumann1976"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1214/aos/1176343654|issn=0090-5364|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1236–1239|last=Aumann|first=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert Aumann|title=Agreeing to Disagree|journal=The Annals of Statistics|year=1976|jstor=2958591|url=http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~raumann/pdf/Agreeing%20to%20Disagree.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem holds even if the people's individual posteriors are based on different observed information about the world. Simply knowing that another agent observed some information and came to their respective conclusion will force each to revise their beliefs, resulting eventually in total agreement on the correct posterior. Thus, two rational Bayesian agents with the same priors and who know each other's posteriors will have to agree.

A question arises whether such an agreement can be reached in a reasonable time and, from a mathematical perspective, whether this can be done efficiently. [[Scott Aaronson]] has shown that this is indeed the case.&lt;ref name="aaronson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|year=2005|journal=Proceedings of ACM STOC|title=The complexity of agreement|pages=634–643|doi=10.1145/1060590.1060686|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/agree-econ.pdf|accessdate=2010-08-09|isbn=1-58113-960-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the assumption of common priors is a rather strong one and may not hold in practice. However, [[Robin Hanson]] has presented an argument that Bayesians who agree about the processes that gave rise to their priors (e.g., genetic and environmental influences) should, if they adhere to a certain ''pre-rationality condition'', have common priors.&lt;ref name="hanson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11238-006-9004-4|volume=61|issue=4|pages=319–328|last=Hanson|first=Robin|title=Uncommon Priors Require Origin Disputes|journal=Theory and Decision|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying the same issue from a different perspective, a research paper by [[Ziv Hellman]] considers what happens if priors are not common. The paper presents a way to measure how distant priors are from being common. If this distance is ε then, under common knowledge, disagreement on events is always bounded from above by ε. When ε goes to zero, [[Robert Aumann|Aumann]]'s original agreement theorem is recapitulated.&lt;ref name="hellman2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00182-012-0347-5|volume=42|issue=2|pages=399–410|last=Hellman|first=Ziv|title=Almost Common Priors|journal=International Journal of Game Theory|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 paper, [[Joseph Halpern]] and [[Willemien Kets]] argued that "players can agree to disagree in the presence of ambiguity, even if there is a common prior, but that allowing for ambiguity is more restrictive than assuming heterogeneous priors."&lt;ref name="halpern2013"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Halpern|first=Joseph|author2= Willemien Kets|title=Ambiguous Language and Consensus|date=2013-10-28|url=http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~willemien.kets/ambiguity_2013-1027.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the [[chain rule]] repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.

Automatic differentiation is not:
[[Image:AutomaticDifferentiationNutshell.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 1: How automatic differentiation relates to symbolic differentiation]]
* [[Symbolic differentiation]], nor
* [[Numerical differentiation]] (the method of finite differences).

These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical differentiation can introduce [[round-off error]]s in the [[discretization]] process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase. Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial derivatives of a function with respect to ''many'' inputs, as is needed for [[gradient descent|gradient]]-based [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more [[Software dependency|software dependencies]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

== The chain rule, forward and reverse accumulation ==

Fundamental to AD is the decomposition of differentials provided by the [[chain rule]]. For the simple composition &lt;math&gt;y = f(g(h(x))) = f(g(h(w_0))) = f(g(w_1)) = f(w_2) = w_3&lt;/math&gt; the chain rule gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dw_2} \frac{dw_2}{dw_1} \frac{dw_1}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, two distinct modes of AD are presented, '''forward accumulation''' (or '''forward mode''') and '''reverse accumulation''' (or '''reverse mode'''). Forward accumulation specifies that one traverses the chain rule from inside to outside (that is, first compute &lt;math&gt;dw_1/dx&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;dw_2/dw_1&lt;/math&gt; and at last &lt;math&gt;dy/dw_2&lt;/math&gt;), while reverse accumulation has the traversal from outside to inside (first compute &lt;math&gt;dy/dw_2&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;dw_2/dw_1&lt;/math&gt; and at last &lt;math&gt;dw_1/dx&lt;/math&gt;). More succinctly,
# '''forward accumulation''' computes the recursive relation''': &lt;math&gt;\frac{dw_i}{dx} = \frac{dw_i}{dw_{i-1}} \frac{dw_{i-1}}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;''' with &lt;math&gt;w_3 = y&lt;/math&gt;, and,
# '''reverse accumulation''' computes the recursive relation''': &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dw_i} = \frac{dy}{dw_{i+1}} \frac{dw_{i+1}}{dw_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;''' with '''&lt;math&gt;w_0 = x&lt;/math&gt;'''.
Generally, both forward and reverse accumulation are specific manifestations of applying the [[Automatic differentiation#Operator of program composition|operator of program composition]], with the appropriate one of the two mappings &lt;math&gt;(w,y)&lt;/math&gt; being fixed.

=== Forward accumulation ===

[[Image:ForwardAccumulationAutomaticDifferentiation.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 2: Example of forward accumulation with computational graph]]

In forward accumulation AD, one first fixes the ''independent variable'' to which differentiation is performed and computes the derivative of each sub-[[expression (mathematics)|expression]] recursively.  In a pen-and-paper calculation, one can do so by repeatedly substituting the derivative of the ''inner'' functions in the chain rule:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
= \frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{n-1}} \frac{\partial w_{n-1}}{\partial x}
= \frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{n-1}} \left(\frac{\partial w_{n-1}}{\partial w_{n-2}} \frac{\partial w_{n-2}}{\partial x}\right)
= \frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{n-1}} \left(\frac{\partial w_{n-1}}{\partial w_{n-2}} \left(\frac{\partial w_{n-2}}{\partial w_{n-3}} \frac{\partial w_{n-3}}{\partial x}\right)\right)
= \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to multiple variables as a matrix product of [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]s.

Compared to reverse accumulation, forward accumulation is very natural and easy to implement as the flow of derivative information coincides with the order of evaluation.  One simply augments each variable {{math|''w''}} with its derivative {{math|''ẇ''}} (stored as a numerical value, not a symbolic expression),

:&lt;math&gt;\dot w = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

as denoted by the dot.  The derivatives are then computed in sync with the evaluation steps and combined with other derivatives via the chain rule.

As an example, consider the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
z
&amp;= f(x_1, x_2) \\
&amp;= x_1 x_2 + \sin x_1 \\
&amp;= w_1 w_2 + \sin w_1 \\
&amp;= w_3 + w_4 \\
&amp;= w_5
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For clarity, the individual sub-expressions have been labeled with the variables {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The choice of the independent variable to which differentiation is performed affects the ''seed'' values {{math|''ẇ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''ẇ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Suppose one is interested in the derivative of this function with respect to {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  In this case, the seed values should be set to:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot w_1 = \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial x_1} = 1 \\
\dot w_2 = \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial x_1} = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the seed values set, one may then propagate the values using the chain rule as shown in the table below.  Figure 2 shows a pictorial depiction of this process as a computational graph.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{Operations to compute value} &amp;
\text{Operations to compute derivative}
\\
\hline
w_1 = x_1 &amp;
\dot w_1 = 1 \text{ (seed)}
\\
w_2 = x_2 &amp;
\dot w_2 = 0 \text{ (seed)}
\\
w_3 = w_1 \cdot w_2 &amp;
\dot w_3 = w_2 \cdot \dot w_1 + w_1 \cdot \dot w_2
\\
w_4 = \sin w_1 &amp;
\dot w_4 = \cos w_1 \cdot \dot w_1
\\
w_5 = w_3 + w_4 &amp;
\dot w_5 = \dot w_3 + \dot w_4
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

To compute the [[gradient]] of this example function, which requires the derivatives of {{math|''f''}} with respect to not only {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} but also {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, one must perform an ''additional'' sweep over the computational graph using the seed values &lt;math&gt;\dot w_1 = 0; \dot w_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of one sweep of forward accumulation is proportional to the complexity of the original code.

Forward accumulation is more efficient than reverse accumulation for functions {{math|''f'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''m'' ≫ ''n''}} as only {{math|''n''}} sweeps are necessary, compared to {{math|''m''}} sweeps for reverse accumulation.

=== Reverse accumulation ===

[[Image:ReverseaccumulationAD.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Example of reverse accumulation with computational graph]]

In reverse accumulation AD, one first fixes the ''dependent variable'' to be differentiated and computes the derivative ''with respect to'' each sub-[[expression (mathematics)|expression]] recursively.  In a pen-and-paper calculation, one can perform the equivalent by repeatedly substituting the derivative of the ''outer'' functions in the chain rule:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
= \frac{\partial y}{\partial w_1} \frac{\partial w_1}{\partial x}
= \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial w_2} \frac{\partial w_2}{\partial w_1}\right) \frac{\partial w_1}{\partial x}
= \left(\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial w_3} \frac{\partial w_3}{\partial w_2}\right) \frac{\partial w_2}{\partial w_1}\right) \frac{\partial w_1}{\partial x}
= \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

In reverse accumulation, the quantity of interest is the ''adjoint'', denoted with a bar ({{math|''w̄''}}); it is a derivative of a chosen dependent variable with respect to a subexpression {{math|''w''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar w = \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}&lt;/math&gt;

Reverse accumulation traverses the chain rule from outside to inside, or in the case of the computational graph in Figure 3, from top to bottom.  The example function is scalar-valued, and thus there is only one seed for the derivative computation, and only one sweep of the computational graph is needed in order to calculate the (two-component) gradient.  This is only [[space–time tradeoff|half the work]] when compared to forward accumulation, but reverse accumulation requires the storage of the intermediate variables {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} as well as the instructions that produced them in a data structure known as a [[Wengert list]] (or "tape"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may represent a significant memory issue if the computational graph is large.  This can be mitigated to some extent by storing only a subset of the intermediate variables and then reconstructing the necessary work variables by repeating the evaluations, a technique known as [[rematerialization]]. [[checkpointing scheme|Checkpointing]] is also used to save intermediary states.

The operations to compute the derivative using reverse accumulation are shown in the table below (note the reversed order):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
\text{Operations to compute derivative}
\\ \hline
\bar w_5 = 1 \text{ (seed)}
\\
\bar w_4 = \bar w_5
\\
\bar w_3 = \bar w_5
\\
\bar w_2 = \bar w_3 \cdot w_1
\\
\bar w_1 = \bar w_3 \cdot w_2 + \bar w_4 \cdot \cos w_1
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The data flow graph of a computation can be manipulated to calculate the gradient of its original calculation. This is done by adding an adjoint node for each primal node, connected by adjoint edges which parallel the primal edges but flow in the opposite direction. The nodes in the adjoint graph represent multiplication by the derivatives of the functions calculated by the nodes in the primal. For instance, addition in the primal causes fanout in the adjoint; fanout in the primal causes addition in the adjoint; a [[unary operation|unary]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} in the primal causes {{math|''x̄'' {{=}} ''ȳ'' ''f′''(''x'')}} in the adjoint; etc.

Reverse accumulation is more efficient than forward accumulation for functions {{math|''f'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''m'' ≪ ''n''}} as only {{math|''m''}} sweeps are necessary, compared to {{math|''n''}} sweeps for forward accumulation.

Reverse mode AD was first published in 1970 by [[Seppo Linnainmaa]] in his master thesis.&lt;ref name="lin1970"&gt;Linnainmaa, Seppo (1970). The representation of the cumulative rounding error of an algorithm as a Taylor expansion of the local rounding errors. Master's Thesis (in Finnish), Univ. Helsinki, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lin1976"&gt;Linnainmaa, Seppo (1976). Taylor expansion of the accumulated rounding error. BIT Numerical Mathematics, 16(2), 146-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grie2012"&gt;Griewank, Andreas (2012). Who Invented the Reverse Mode of Differentiation?. Optimization Stories, Documenta Matematica, Extra Volume ISMP (2012), 389-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Backpropagation]] of errors in multilayer perceptrons, a technique used in [[machine learning]], is a special case of reverse mode AD.&lt;ref name="baydin2018automatic" /&gt;

=== Beyond forward and reverse accumulation ===

Forward and reverse accumulation are just two (extreme) ways of traversing the chain rule. The problem of computing a full Jacobian of {{math|''f'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a minimum number of arithmetic operations is known as the ''optimal Jacobian accumulation'' (OJA) problem, which is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Uwe|last=Naumann|journal=Mathematical Programming|volume=112|issue=2|pages=427–441|date=April 2008|doi=10.1007/s10107-006-0042-z|title=Optimal Jacobian accumulation is NP-complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Central to this proof is the idea that there may exist algebraic dependencies between the local partials that label the edges of the graph.  In particular, two or more edge labels may be recognized as equal.  The complexity of the problem is still open if it is assumed that all edge labels are unique and algebraically independent.

== Automatic differentiation using dual numbers ==

Forward mode automatic differentiation is accomplished by augmenting the [[algebra]] of [[real numbers]] and obtaining a new [[arithmetic]]. An additional component is added to every number which will represent the derivative of a function at the number, and all arithmetic operators are extended for the augmented algebra. The augmented algebra is the algebra of [[dual numbers]]. This approach was generalized by the theory of [[Automatic differentiation#Operational calculus on programming spaces|operational calculus on programming spaces]] (see [[Automatic differentiation#Analytic programming space|Analytic programming space]]), through [[tensor algebra]] of the [[dual space]].

Replace every number &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; with the number &lt;math&gt;x + x'\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, but &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abstract number]] with the property &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2=0&lt;/math&gt; (an [[infinitesimal]]; see ''[[Smooth infinitesimal analysis]]''). Using only this, we get for the regular arithmetic
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      (x + x'\varepsilon) + (y + y'\varepsilon) &amp;= x + y + (x' + y')\varepsilon \\
  (x + x'\varepsilon) \cdot (y + y'\varepsilon) &amp;= xy + xy'\varepsilon + yx'\varepsilon + x'y'\varepsilon^2 = xy + (x y' + yx')\varepsilon
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and likewise for subtraction and division.

Now, we may calculate [[polynomials]] in this augmented arithmetic. If &lt;math&gt;P(x) = p_0 + p_1 x + p_2x^2 + \cdots + p_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P(x + x'\varepsilon) &amp;= p_0 + p_1(x + x'\varepsilon) + \cdots + p_n (x + x'\varepsilon)^n \\
                       &amp;= p_0 + p_1 x + \cdots + p_n x^n + p_1x'\varepsilon + 2p_2xx'\varepsilon + \cdots + np_n x^{n-1} x'\varepsilon \\
                       &amp;= P(x) + P^{(1)}(x)x'\varepsilon
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the derivative of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; with respect to its first argument, and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''seed'', can be chosen arbitrarily.

The new arithmetic consists of [[ordered pair]]s, elements written &lt;math&gt;\langle x, x' \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with ordinary arithmetics on the first component, and first order differentiation arithmetic on the second component, as described above. Extending the above results on polynomials to [[analytic functions]] we obtain a list of the basic arithmetic and some standard functions for the new arithmetic:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle + \left\langle v,v'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle u + v, u' + v' \right\rangle \\
  \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle - \left\langle v,v'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle u - v, u' - v' \right\rangle \\
  \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle * \left\langle v,v'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle u v, u'v + uv' \right\rangle \\
  \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle / \left\langle v,v'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \frac{u}{v}, \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} \right\rangle \quad ( v\ne 0) \\
                               \sin\left\langle u,u'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \sin(u) , u' \cos(u) \right\rangle \\
                               \cos\left\langle u,u'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \cos(u) , -u' \sin(u) \right\rangle \\
                               \exp\left\langle u,u'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \exp u , u' \exp u \right\rangle \\
                               \log\left\langle u,u'\right\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \log(u) , u'/u \right\rangle \quad (u&gt;0) \\
                                 \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle^k &amp;= \left\langle u^k , k u^{k - 1} u' \right\rangle \quad (u \ne 0) \\
                    \left| \left\langle u,u'\right\rangle \right| &amp;= \left\langle \left| u \right| , u' \mbox{sign} u \right\rangle \quad (u \ne 0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and in general for the primitive function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;g(\langle u,u' \rangle , \langle v,v' \rangle ) = \langle g(u,v) , g_u(u,v) u' + g_v(u,v) v' \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_v&lt;/math&gt; are the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with respect to its first and second arguments, respectively.

When a binary basic arithmetic operation is applied to mixed arguments—the pair &lt;math&gt;\langle u, u' \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;—the real number is first lifted to &lt;math&gt;\langle c, 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative of a function &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is now found by calculating &lt;math&gt;f(\langle x_0, 1 \rangle)&lt;/math&gt; using the above arithmetic, which gives &lt;math&gt;\langle f ( x_0 ) , f' ( x_0 ) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; as the result.

===Vector arguments and functions===

Multivariate functions can be handled with the same efficiency and mechanisms as univariate functions by adopting a directional derivative operator.  That is, if it is sufficient to compute &lt;math&gt;y' = \nabla f(x)\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt;, the directional derivative &lt;math&gt;y' \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; in the direction &lt;math&gt;x' \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, this may be calculated as &lt;math&gt;(\langle y_1,y'_1\rangle, \ldots, \langle y_m,y'_m\rangle) = f(\langle x_1,x'_1\rangle, \ldots, \langle x_n,x'_n\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; using the same arithmetic as above.  If all the elements of &lt;math&gt;\nabla f&lt;/math&gt; are desired, then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; function evaluations are required.    Note that in many optimization applications, the directional derivative is indeed sufficient.

===High order and many variables===

The above arithmetic can be generalized to calculate second order and higher derivatives of multivariate functions. However, the arithmetic rules quickly grow very complicated: complexity will be quadratic in the highest derivative degree. Instead, truncated Taylor polynomial algebra can be used. The resulting arithmetic, defined on generalized dual numbers, allows to efficiently compute using functions as if they were a new data type. Once the Taylor polynomial of a function is known, the derivatives are easily extracted. 
A rigorous, general formulation is achieved through the [[Automatic differentiation#Tensor series expansion|tensor series expansion]] using [[Automatic differentiation#Operational calculus on programming spaces|operational calculus on programming spaces]].

==Operational calculus on programming spaces==
[[Operational calculus]]  on programming spaces &lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Sajovic |first=Žiga |last2=Vuk |first2=Martin |date=2016 |title=Operational calculus on programming spaces |eprint=1610.07690 |class=math.FA}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides differentiable programming with formal semantics through an algebra of higher-order constructs. It can thus be used to express the concepts underlying automatic differentiation.

===Differentiable programming space===

A differentiable programming space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; is any subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_0:\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; such that	
:&lt;math&gt;\partial\mathcal{P}_0\subset\mathcal{P}_0\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tensor algebra]] of the [[dual space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}^*&lt;/math&gt;. When all elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; are analytic, we call &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; an analytic programming space.

:'''Theorem'''. Any differentiable programming space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitely differentiable programming space, meaning that 
::&lt;math&gt;\partial^k\mathcal{P}_0\subset\mathcal{P}_0\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; 
:for any &lt;math&gt;k\in\N.&lt;/math&gt; If all elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; are analytic, than so are the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition'''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable programming space. The space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_n&lt;\mathcal{F}_n:\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{V}\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^n\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^n=\{\partial^k | 0\le k\le n\},&lt;/math&gt; is called a differentiable programming space of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Corollary'''. A differentiable programming space of order &lt;math&gt;n, \mathcal{P}_n:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*),&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded into the tensor product of the function space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; and the subspace &lt;math&gt;T_n(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; of the tensor algebra of the dual of the virtual space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. By taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we consider 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_\infty&lt;\mathcal{P}_0\otimes \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*),&lt;/math&gt; 
:where 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*)=\prod_{k=0}^\infty (\mathcal{V}^*)^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt; 
:is the tensor series algebra, the algebra of the  infinite formal tensor series, which is a completion of the tensor algebra &lt;math&gt;T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; in suitable topology.

Proofs can be found in.&lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal" /&gt; 

This means that we can represent calculation of derivatives of the map &lt;math&gt;P:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;, with only one mapping &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. We define the operator &lt;math&gt;\tau_n&lt;/math&gt; as a direct sum of operators 

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_n = 1+\partial +\partial^2 +\cdots + \partial^n &lt;/math&gt;

The image &lt;math&gt;\tau_kP(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is a multitensor of order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which is a direct sum of the maps value and all derivatives of order &lt;math&gt;n\le k&lt;/math&gt;, all evaluated at the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_kP(\mathbf{x}) = P(\mathbf{x})+\partial_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}) + \partial^2_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}) + \cdots + \partial^k_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

The operator &lt;math&gt;\tau_n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recursive relation.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{k+1}=1+\partial\tau_{k},&lt;/math&gt; 

that can be used to recursively construct programming spaces of arbitrary order. Only explicit knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\tau:\mathcal{P}_0\to\mathcal{P}_1&lt;/math&gt; is required for the construction of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_n&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_1&lt;/math&gt;, which is evident from the above theorem.

===Virtual tensor machine===

The paper &lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal" /&gt; proposed an abstract virtual machine capable of constructing and implementing the theory. Such a machine provides a framework for analytic study of algorithmic procedures through algebraic means.

:'''Claim'''. The tuple &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{P}_0)&lt;/math&gt; and the belonging tensor series algebra are sufficient conditions for the existence and construction of infinitely differentiable programming spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, through linear combinations of elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0\otimes \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

This claim allows a simple definition of such a machine.

'''Definition''' (Virtual tensor machine). The tuple &lt;math&gt;M=\langle \mathcal{V},\mathcal{P}_0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a virtual tensor machine, where
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite dimensional vector space
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\otimes \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; is the virtual memory space
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; is an analytic programming space over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;      

===Tensor series expansion===

Expansion into a series offers valuable insights into programs through methods of analysis.
 
There exists a space spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^n=\{\partial^k | 0\le k\le n\}&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the expression 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(h\partial)^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; 

is well defined. The operator &lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping between function spaces 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}:\mathcal{P}\to\mathcal{P}_\infty.&lt;/math&gt; 

It also defines a map 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}:\mathcal{P}\times \mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}\otimes \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*),&lt;/math&gt;

by taking the image of the map &lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}(P)&lt;/math&gt; at a certain point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\in \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;.

We may construct a map from the space of programs, to the space of polynomials. Note that the space of multivariate polynomials &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\to K&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to symmetric algebra &lt;math&gt;S(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt;, which is in turn a quotient of tensor algebra &lt;math&gt;T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt;. To any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; one can attach corresponding element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\otimes S(\mathcal{V}^{i*})&lt;/math&gt; namely a polynomial map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we consider the completion of the symmetric algebra &lt;math&gt;S(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; as the ''[[formal power series]]'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}^{*})&lt;/math&gt;, which is in turn isomorphic to a quotient of ''tensor series algebra'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt;, arriving at

:&lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}: \mathcal{P}\times \mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}\otimes \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}^{i*}) &lt;/math&gt; 

For any element &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_0\in \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}(\cdot,\mathbf{v}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\to\mathcal{V}\otimes \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt;, mapping a program to a ''[[formal power series]]''. We can express the correspondence between multi-tensors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\otimes T(\mathcal{V}^*)&lt;/math&gt; and polynomial maps &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; given by multiple contractions for all possible indices.

:'''Theorem'''. For a program &lt;math&gt;P\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; the expansion into an infinite tensor series at the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_0\in \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed by multiple contractions 
::&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{v}_0+h\mathbf{v}) = \left ((e^{h\partial}P)(\mathbf{v}_0)\right )\cdot\mathbf{v}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{h^n}{n!}\partial^nP(\mathbf{v}_0)\cdot (\mathbf{v}^{\otimes n})&lt;/math&gt;

Proof can be found in.&lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal" /&gt; Evaluated at &lt;math&gt;h=1&lt;/math&gt;, the operator is a generalization of the [[shift operator]] widely used in physics. For a specific &lt;math&gt;v_0\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; it is here on denoted by 

:&lt;math&gt;e^\partial\vert_{v_0}:\mathcal{P}\to \mathcal{V}\otimes \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{V}^*).&lt;/math&gt; 

When the choice of &lt;math&gt;v_0\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we omit it from expressions for brevity. Following this work, a similar approach was taken by others &lt;ref name="Izzo"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=izzo |first=Dario |last2=Biscani |first2=Francesci |date=2016 |title=Differentiable Genetic Programming|eprint=1611.04766 |class=math.FA}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Operator of program composition===
Theory offers a generalization of both forward and reverse mode of automatic differentiation to arbitrary order, under a single invariant operator in the theory. This condenses complex notions to simple expressions allowing meaningful manipulations before being applied to a particular programming space.

:'''Theorem'''. Composition of maps &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as 
::&lt;math&gt;e^{h\partial}(f\circ g)=\exp(\partial_fe^{h\partial_g})(g,f)&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\exp(\partial_fe^{h\partial_g}):\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{P}\to\mathcal{P}_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an operator on pairs of maps &lt;math&gt;(g,f)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\partial_g&lt;/math&gt; is applied to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial_f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof can be found in.&lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal" /&gt;

Both forward and reverse mode (generalized to arbitrary order) are obtainable using this operator, by fixing the appropriate one of the two maps. This generalizes both concepts under a single operator in the theory. For example, by considering projections of the operator onto the space spanned by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}=\{1,\partial\}&lt;/math&gt;, and fixing the second map &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, we retrieve the basic first order forward mode of automatic differentiation, or reverse mode, by fixing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the operator alleviates the need for explicit implementation of the higher order chain rule (see [[Faà di Bruno's formula]]), as it is encoded in the structure of the operator itself, which can be efficiently implemented by manipulating its generating map (see &lt;ref name="SajovicOpCal" /&gt;).

===Order reduction for nested applications===

It is useful to be able to use the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th derivative of a program &lt;math&gt;P\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; as part of a different differentiable program &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. As such, we must be able to treat the derivative itself as a differentiable program &lt;math&gt;P^{\prime k}\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, while only coding the original program &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Theorem'''. There exists a reduction of order map &lt;math&gt;\phi:\mathcal{P}_n \to \mathcal{P}_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
::&lt;math&gt;\forall P_1\in\mathcal{P}_0 \quad \exists P_2\in\mathcal{P}_0 \qquad \phi^k\circ e^\partial_n(P_1)=e^\partial_{n-k}(P_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:for each &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e^\partial_n&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the operator &lt;math&gt;e^\partial&lt;/math&gt; onto the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^n=\{\partial^k| 0\le k\le n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

By the above Theorem, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-differentiable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th derivatives of a program &lt;math&gt;P\in\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; can be extracted by

:&lt;math&gt;^{n}P^{k\prime}=\phi^k\circ e^\partial_{n+k}(P)\in\mathcal{P}_n.&lt;/math&gt;  

Thus, we gained the ability of writing a differentiable program acting on derivatives of another program, stressed as crucial by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearlmutter |first=Barak A. |last2=Siskind |first2=Jeffrey M|date=May 2008|title=Putting the Automatic Back into AD: Part II|journal=ECE Technical Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

Forward-mode AD is implemented by a [[nonstandard interpretation]] of the program in which real numbers are replaced by dual numbers, constants are lifted to dual numbers with a zero epsilon coefficient, and the numeric primitives are lifted to operate on dual numbers.  This nonstandard interpretation is generally implemented using one of two strategies: ''source code transformation'' or ''operator overloading''.

=== Source code transformation (SCT) ===
[[Image:SourceTransformationAutomaticDifferentiation.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 4: Example of how source code transformation could work]]

The source code for a function is replaced by an automatically generated source code that includes statements for calculating the derivatives interleaved with the original instructions.

[[Source code transformation]] can be implemented for all programming languages, and it is also easier for the compiler to do compile time optimizations. However, the implementation of the AD tool itself is more difficult.

=== Operator overloading (OO) ===

[[Image:OperatorOverloadingAutomaticDifferentiation.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 5: Example of how operator overloading could work]]
[[Operator overloading]] is a possibility for source code written in a language supporting it. Objects for real numbers and elementary mathematical operations must be overloaded to cater for the augmented arithmetic depicted above. This requires no change in the form or sequence of operations in the original source code for the function to be differentiated, but often requires changes in basic data types for numbers and vectors to support overloading and often also involves the insertion of special flagging operations.

Operator overloading for forward accumulation is easy to implement, and also possible for reverse accumulation. However, current compilers lag behind in optimizing the code when compared to forward accumulation.

Operator overloading, for both forward and reverse accumulation, can be well-suited to applications where the objects are vectors of real numbers rather than scalars. This is because the tape then comprises vector operations; this can facilitate computationally efficient implementations where each vector operation performs many scalar operations. Vector adjoint algorithmic differentiation (vector AAD) techniques may be used, for example, to differentiate values calculated by Monte-Carlo simulation.

Examples of operator-overloading implementations of automatic differentiation in C++ are the [[Adept (C++ library)|Adept]] and [[Stan (software)|Stan]] libraries.

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}
The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''Sa''.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''Sa'' ≠ ''Sb''.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers ("''[[Mathematical induction#Axiom of induction|Induction axiom]]''").

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

In [[discrete geometry]], '''Beck's theorem''' is any of several different results, two of which are given below. Both appeared, alongside several other important theorems, in a well-known paper by [[József Beck]].&lt;ref name="becks-paper"/&gt; The two results described below primarily concern lower bounds on the number of lines ''determined'' by a set of points in the plane. (Any line containing at least two points of point set is said to be ''determined'' by that point set.)

==Erdős–Beck theorem==
The '''Erdős–Beck theorem''' is a variation of a classical result by [[Leroy Milton Kelly|L. M. Kelly]] and W. O. J. Moser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/people/moser|title=William O. J. Moser}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving configurations of ''n'' points of which at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' are collinear, for some 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''O''({{radic|''n''}}). They showed that if ''n'' is sufficiently large, relative to ''k'', then the  configuration spans at least ''kn''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(1/2)(3''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kelly|first1= L. M.|author1-link=Leroy Milton Kelly|last2= Moser|first2= W. O. J. | title = On the number of ordinary lines determined by ''n'' points | journal = Can. J. Math. | volume = 10 | year = 1958 | pages = 210–219 | url = http://www.cms.math.ca/cjm/v10/p210 | doi = 10.4153/CJM-1958-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elekes and Csaba Toth noted that the Erdős–Beck theorem does not easily extend to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elekes|first=György |author1-link=György Elekes|author2=Tóth, Csaba D.|author2-link=Csaba D. Tóth|year=2005|title=Incidences of not-too-degenerate hyperplanes|isbn=1-58113-991-8|journal=Proceedings of the twenty-first annual symposium on Computational geometry|publisher=Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry|location=Pisa, Italy|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take for example a set of 2''n'' points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; all lying on two [[skew lines]]. Assume that these two lines are each incident to ''n'' points.  Such a configuration of points spans only 2''n'' planes. Thus, a trivial extension to the hypothesis for point sets in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is not sufficient to obtain the desired result.

This result was first conjectured by [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]], and proven by Beck. (See ''Theorem 5.2'' in.&lt;ref name="becks-paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=József|author-link=József Beck|year=1983|title=On the lattice property of the plane and some problems of Dirac, Motzkin, and Erdős in combinatorial geometry|journal=Combinatorica |volume=3|pages=281–297|mr=0729781|doi=10.1007/BF02579184}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Statement of the theorem===
Let ''S'' be a set of ''n'' points in the plane. If no more than ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' points lie on any line for some 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, then there exist Ω(''nk'') lines determined by the points of&amp;nbsp;''S''.

===Proof===
{{Empty section|A proof of this theorem|date=March 2010}}

==Beck's theorem==
'''Beck's theorem''' says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points.

Although not mentioned in Beck's paper, this result is implied by the [[Erdős–Beck theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Beck's Theorem can be derived by letting ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''C'') and applying the Erdős–Beck theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement of the theorem===
The theorem asserts the existence of positive constants ''C'', ''K'' such that given any ''n'' points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true:

# There is a line which contains at least ''n''/''C'' of the points.
# There exist at least &lt;math&gt;n^2/K&lt;/math&gt; lines, each of which contains at least two of the points.

In Beck's original argument, ''C'' is 100 and ''K'' is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of ''C'' and ''K'' are.

=== Proof ===
A proof of Beck's theorem can be given as follows. Consider a set ''P'' of ''n'' points in the plane.  Let ''j'' be a positive integer.  Let us say that a pair of points ''A'', ''B'' in the set ''P'' is ''j-connected'' if the line connecting ''A'' and ''B'' contains between &lt;math&gt;2^j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^{j+1}-1&lt;/math&gt; points of ''P'' (including ''A'' and ''B'').

From the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]], the number of such lines is &lt;math&gt;O( n^2 / 2^{3j} + n / 2^j )&lt;/math&gt;, as follows: Consider the set ''P'' of ''n'' points, and the set ''L'' of all those lines spanned by pairs of points of ''P'' that contain at least &lt;math&gt; 2^j &lt;/math&gt; points of ''P''. Note that &lt;math&gt; |L| \cdot {2^j \choose 2} \leq {n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;, since no two points can lie on two distinct lines. Now using [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]], it follows that the number of incidences between ''P'' and ''L'' is at most &lt;math&gt;O(n^2/2^{2j} + n)&lt;/math&gt;. All the lines connecting ''j-connected'' points also lie in ''L'', and each contributes at least &lt;math&gt;2^j&lt;/math&gt; incidences. Therefore the total number of such lines is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2/2^{3j} + n/2^j)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since each such line connects together &lt;math&gt;\Omega( 2^{2j} )&lt;/math&gt; pairs of points, we thus see that at most &lt;math&gt;O( n^2 / 2^j + 2^j n )&lt;/math&gt; pairs of points can be ''j''-connected.

Now, let ''C'' be a large constant. By summing the [[geometric series]], we see that the number of pairs of points which are ''j''-connected for some ''j'' satisfying &lt;math&gt;C \leq 2^j \leq n/C&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;O( n^2 / C)&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the total number of pairs is &lt;math&gt;\frac{n(n-1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus if we choose ''C'' to be large enough, we can find at least &lt;math&gt;n^2 / 4 &lt;/math&gt; pairs (for instance) which are not ''j''-connected for any &lt;math&gt;C \leq 2^j \leq n/C&lt;/math&gt;.  The lines that connect these pairs either pass through fewer than 2''C'' points, or pass through more than ''n''/''C'' points.  If the latter case holds for even one of these pairs, then we have the first conclusion of Beck's theorem. Thus we may assume that all of the &lt;math&gt;n^2 / 4&lt;/math&gt; pairs are connected by lines which pass through fewer than 2''C'' points.  But each such line can connect at most &lt;math&gt;C(2C-1)&lt;/math&gt; pairs of points.  Thus there must be at least &lt;math&gt;n^2 / 4C(2C-1)&lt;/math&gt; lines connecting at least two points, and the claim follows by taking &lt;math&gt;K = 4C(2C-1)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''binary constraint''', in [[mathematical optimization]], is a constraint that involves exactly two variables.

For example, consider the [[n-queens problem]], where the goal is to place ''n'' [[Queen (chess)|chess queens]] on an ''n''-by-''n'' chessboard such that none of  the queens can attack each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  The formal set of constraints are therefore "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 2", "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 3", and so on between all pairs of queens.  Each constraint in this problem is binary, in that it only considers the placement of two individual queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Programming with Constraints: An Introduction|first1=Kim|last1=Marriott|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=9780262133418|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBYAleHTldsC&amp;pg=PA282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6002">'''Boole's expansion theorem''', often referred to as the '''Shannon expansion''' or '''decomposition''', is the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]: &lt;math&gt;F = x \cdot F_x + x' \cdot F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Boolean function]], &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is the complement of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with the argument &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; set equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The terms &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes called the positive and negative '''Shannon cofactors''', respectively, of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. These are functions, computed by '''restrict''' operator, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[valuation (logic)]] and [[partial application]]).

It has been called the "fundamental theorem of Boolean algebra".&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Rosenbloom, ''The Elements of Mathematical Logic'', 1950, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its theoretical importance, it paved the way for [[binary decision diagram]]s, [[Boolean satisfiability problem|satisfiability solvers]], and many other techniques relevant to [[computer engineering]] and [[formal verification]] of digital circuits.

==Statement of the theorem==
A more explicit way of stating the theorem is:

: &lt;math&gt;f(X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n) = X_1 \cdot f(1, X_2, \dots , X_n) + X_1' \cdot f(0, X_2, \dots , X_n)&lt;/math&gt;

== Variations and implications ==
; XOR-Form : The statement also holds when the [[disjunction]] "+" is replaced by the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operator:
: &lt;math&gt;f(X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n) = X_1 \cdot f(1, X_2, \dots , X_n) \oplus X_1' \cdot f(0, X_2, \dots , X_n)&lt;/math&gt;
; Dual form: There is a dual form of the Shannon expansion (which does not have a related XOR form):
: &lt;math&gt;f(X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n) = (X_1 + f(0, X_2, \dots , X_n)) \cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2, \dots , X_n))&lt;/math&gt;

Repeated application for each argument leads to the [[Sum of Products]] (SoP) canonical form of the Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. For example for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; that would be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) &amp; = X_1 \cdot f(1, X_2) + X_1' \cdot f(0, X_2)\\
                                &amp; = X_1 X_2 \cdot f(1, 1) + X_1 X_2' \cdot f(1, 0) + X_1' X_2 \cdot f(0, 1) + X_1' X_2' \cdot f(0, 0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, application of the dual form leads to the [[Product of Sums]] (PoS) canonical form (using the [[Distributive property#Truth functional connectives|distributivity law]] of &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) &amp; = (X_1 + f(0, X_2)) \cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2))\\
                                &amp; = (X_1 + X_2 + f(0, 0)) \cdot (X_1 + X_2' + f(0, 1)) \cdot (X_1' + X_2 + f(1, 0)) \cdot (X_1' + X_2' + f(1, 1))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties of Cofactors ==

; '''Linear Properties of Cofactors:'''
: For a boolean function ''F'' which is made up of two boolean functions ''G'' and ''H'' the following are true:
: If &lt;math&gt;F = H'&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F_x = H'_x&lt;/math&gt;
: If &lt;math&gt;F = G \cdot H&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F_x = G_x \cdot H_x&lt;/math&gt;
: If &lt;math&gt;F = G + H&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F_x = G_x + H_x&lt;/math&gt;
: If &lt;math&gt;F = G \oplus H&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F_x = G_x \oplus H_x&lt;/math&gt;

; '''Characteristics of Unate Functions:'''
: If ''F'' is a [[unate function]] and...
: If ''F'' is positive unate then &lt;math&gt;F = x \cdot F_x + F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;
: If ''F'' is negative unate then &lt;math&gt;F = F_x + x' \cdot F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;

== Operations with Cofactors ==

; '''Boolean Difference:'''
: The boolean difference or [[Boolean differential calculus|boolean derivative]] of the function F with respect to the literal x is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = F_x \oplus F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;

; '''Universal Quantification:'''
: The universal quantification of F is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; \forall x F = F_x \cdot F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;

; '''Existential Quantification:'''
: The existential quantification of F is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; \exists x F = F_x + F_{x'}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
[[George Boole]] presented this expansion as his Proposition II, "To expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols", in his ''[[The Laws of Thought|Laws of Thought]]'' (1854),&lt;ref&gt;George Boole, ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought: On which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'', 1854, p. 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SWgLVT0otY8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=to+expand+or+develop+a+function full text at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was "widely applied by Boole and other nineteenth-century logicians".&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Frank Markham Brown, ''Boolean Reasoning: The Logic of Boolean Equations'', 2nd edition, 2003, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Shannon]] mentioned this expansion, among other Boolean identities, in a 1948 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Shannon, "The Synthesis of Two-Terminal Switching Circuits", ''Bell System Technical Journal'' '''28''':59–98, [https://archive.org/download/bstj28-1-59/bstj28-1-59.pdf full text], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and showed the switching network interpretations of the identity.  In the literature of computer design and switching theory, the identity is often incorrectly attributed to Shannon.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;

==Application to switching circuits==
# [[Binary decision diagrams]] follow from systematic use of this theorem
# Any Boolean function can be implemented directly in a [[switching circuit theory|switching circuit]] using a hierarchy of basic [[multiplexer]] by repeated application of this theorem.

The '''butterfly curve''' is a [[Transcendental function|transcendental]] [[plane curve]] discovered by [[Temple H. Fay]].  The curve is given by the following [[parametric equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sin(t) \left(e^{\cos(t)} - 2\cos(4t) - \sin^5\left({t \over 12}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = \cos(t) \left(e^{\cos(t)} - 2\cos(4t) - \sin^5\left({t \over 12}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0\le t \le 12\pi&lt;/math&gt;

or by the following [[polar equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;r=e^{\sin \theta} - 2 \cos (4 \theta ) + \sin^5\left(\frac{2 \theta - \pi}{24}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Carsten Lund''' (born July 1, 1963) is a [[Denmark|Danish]]-born [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical computer scientist]], currently working at [[AT&amp;T Labs]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.att.com/people/Lund_Carsten/index.html Lund's home page at AT&amp;T].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lund was born in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], and received the
"kandidat" degree in 1988 from the [[University of Aarhus]] and his Ph.D.
from the [[University of Chicago]] in computer science. His thesis, entitled The
Power of Interaction, was chosen as an [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] 'Distinguished Dissertation'.

Lund was a co-author on two of five competing papers at the 1990 [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] characterizing [[Computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] such as [[PSPACE]] and [[NEXPTIME]] in terms of [[interactive proof system]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In a Frenzy, Math Enters Age of Electronic Mail|first=Gina|last=Kolata|journal=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/26/science/in-a-frenzy-math-enters-age-of-electronic-mail.html|date=June 26, 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Carsten|last1=Lund|first2=Lance|last2=Fortnow|first3=Howard J.|last3=Karloff|first4=Noam|last4=Nisan|author4-link=Noam Nisan|contribution=Algebraic Methods for Interactive Proof Systems|pages=2–10|title=Proc. 31st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|year=1990|doi=10.1109/FSCS.1990.89518|isbn=0-8186-2082-X}}.

==Theory for one complex variable==

===Statement of the theorem===
Consider the formal [[power series]] in one complex variable z of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} c_{n} (z-a)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a,c_n\in\mathbb{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the [[radius of convergence]] of ''&amp;fnof;'' at the point ''a'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \big( | c_{n} |^{1/n} \big)&lt;/math&gt;

where lim sup denotes the [[limit superior]], the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity of the [[supremum]] of the sequence values after the ''n''th position. If the sequence values are unbounded so that the lim sup is ∞, then the power series does not converge near ''a'', while if the lim sup is 0 then the radius of convergence is ∞, meaning that the series converges on the entire plane.

===Proof of the theorem===
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complex Analysis: Fourth Edition|first=Serge|last=Lang|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-98592-1|pages=55–56}}Graduate Texts in Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; Without loss of generality assume that &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;. We will show first that the power series &lt;math&gt;\sum c_n z^n&lt;/math&gt; converges for &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and then that it diverges for &lt;math&gt;|z|&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

First suppose &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;t=1/R&lt;/math&gt; not be zero or ±infinity. For any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists only a finite number of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{|c_n|}\geq t+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Now &lt;math&gt;|c_n|\leq(t+\varepsilon)^n&lt;/math&gt; for all but a finite number of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, so the series &lt;math&gt;\sum c_n z^n&lt;/math&gt; converges if &lt;math&gt;|z| &lt; 1/(t+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;. This proves the first part.

Conversely, for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|c_n|\geq (t-\varepsilon)^n&lt;/math&gt; for infinitely many &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt;, so if &lt;math&gt;|z|=1/(t-\varepsilon) &gt; R&lt;/math&gt;, we see that the series cannot converge because its ''n''th term does not tend to 0.

==Several complex variables==

===Statement of the theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a multi-index (a ''n''-tuple of integers) with &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|=\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges with radius of convergence &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (which is also a multi-index) if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{|\alpha|\to\infty} \sqrt[|\alpha|]{|c_\alpha|\rho^\alpha}=1&lt;/math&gt;

to the multidimensional power series

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\alpha\geq0}c_\alpha(z-a)^\alpha := \sum_{\alpha_1\geq0,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq0}c_{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n}(z_1-a_1)^{\alpha_1}\cdots(z_n-a_n)^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof of the theorem===
The proof can be found in the book [https://books.google.com/books?id=OTqSiRwHDNcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=complex%20analysis%20several%20variables&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Complex Analysis Part II functions in several Variables by B. V. Shabat]

[[Image:Circle_caustic.png|right|frame|Reflective caustic generated from a [[circle]] and parallel rays]]

In [[differential geometry]] and [[geometric optics]], a '''caustic''' is the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]]s either [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflected]] or [[refracted]] by a [[manifold]]. It is related to the concept of [[Caustic (optics)|caustics in optics]]. The ray's source may be a point (called the radiant) or parallel rays from a point at infinity, in which case a direction vector of the rays must be specified.

More generally, especially as applied to [[symplectic geometry]] and [[singularity theory]], a  caustic is the [[critical value|critical value set]] of a [[Lagrangian mapping]] {{nowrap|1=(''π'' ○ ''i'') : ''L'' ↪ ''M'' ↠ ''B'';}} where {{nowrap|1=''i'' : ''L'' ↪ ''M''}} is a [[Symplectic_manifold#Lagrangian_mapping|Lagrangian immersion]] of a [[Symplectic_manifold#Lagrangian_and_other_submanifolds|Lagrangian submanifold]] ''L'' into a [[symplectic manifold]] ''M'', and {{nowrap|1=''π'' :  ''M'' ↠ ''B''}} is a [[Symplectic_manifold#Lagrangian_fibration|Lagrangian fibration]] of the symplectic manifold ''M''. The caustic is a [[subset]] of the Lagrangian [[fibration]]'s [[base space]] ''B''.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|first=V. I.|last=Arnold|first2=A. N.|last2=Varchenko|first3=S. M.|last3=Gusein-Zade|authorlink1=Vladimir Arnold|authorlink3=Sabir Gusein-Zade|authorlink2=Alexander Varchenko|title=The Classification of Critical Points, Caustics and Wave Fronts: Singularities of Differentiable Maps, Vol 1|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1985|isbn=0-8176-3187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catacaustic==
A '''catacaustic''' is the reflective case. 

With a radiant, it is the [[evolute]] of the [[orthotomic]] of the radiant.

The planar, parallel-source-rays case: suppose the direction vector is &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and the mirror curve is parametrised as &lt;math&gt;(u(t),v(t))&lt;/math&gt;. The normal vector at a point is &lt;math&gt;(-v'(t),u'(t))&lt;/math&gt;; the reflection of the direction vector is (normal needs special normalization)
:&lt;math&gt;2\mbox{proj}_nd-d=\frac{2n}{\sqrt{n\cdot n}}\frac{n\cdot d}{\sqrt{n\cdot n}}-d=2n\frac{n\cdot d}{n\cdot n}-d=\frac{
(av'^2-2bu'v'-au'^2,bu'^2-2au'v'-bv'^2)
}{v'^2+u'^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Having components of found reflected vector treat it as a tangent
:&lt;math&gt;(x-u)(bu'^2-2au'v'-bv'^2)=(y-v)(av'^2-2bu'v'-au'^2).&lt;/math&gt;
Using the simplest [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] form
:&lt;math&gt;F(x,y,t)=(x-u)(bu'^2-2au'v'-bv'^2)-(y-v)(av'^2-2bu'v'-au'^2)&lt;/math&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;=x(bu'^2-2au'v'-bv'^2)
-y(av'^2-2bu'v'-au'^2)
+b(uv'^2-uu'^2-2vu'v')
+a(-vu'^2+vv'^2+2uu'v')&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_t(x,y,t)=2x(bu'u''-a(u'v''+u''v')-bv'v'')
-2y(av'v''-b(u''v'+u'v'')-au'u'')&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;+b( u'v'^2 +2uv'v'' -u'^3 -2uu'u'' -2u'v'^2 -2u''vv' -2u'vv'')
+a(-v'u'^2 -2vu'u'' +v'^3 +2vv'v'' +2v'u'^2 +2v''uu' +2v'uu'')&lt;/math&gt;
which may be unaesthetic, but &lt;math&gt;F=F_t=0&lt;/math&gt; gives a [[linear system]] in &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and so it is elementary to obtain a parametrisation of the catacaustic. [[Cramer's rule]] would serve.

===Example===
Let the direction vector be (0,1) and the mirror be &lt;math&gt;(t,t^2).&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;u'=1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;u''=0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;v'=2t&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;v''=2&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7692">[[Image:Pseudoforest.svg|thumb|240px|A graph with three connected components.]]
In [[graph theory]], a '''connected component''' (or just '''component''') of an [[undirected graph]] is a [[subgraph (graph theory)|subgraph]] in which any two [[Vertex_(graph_theory)|vertices]] are [[connected graph|connected]] to each other by [[path (graph theory)|paths]], and which is connected to no additional vertices in the [[Glossary of graph theory terms#supergraph|supergraph]]. For example, the graph shown in the illustration has three connected components.   A vertex with no incident edges is itself a connected component.  A graph that is itself connected has exactly one connected component, consisting of the whole graph.

==An equivalence relation==
An alternative way to define connected components involves the equivalence classes of an [[equivalence relation]] that is defined on the vertices of the graph.
In an undirected graph, a vertex ''v'' is ''reachable'' from a vertex ''u'' if there is a path from ''u'' to ''v''. In this definition, a single vertex is counted as a path of length zero, and the same vertex may occur more than once within a path.
Reachability is an [[equivalence relation]], since:
*It is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: There is a trivial path of length zero from any vertex to itself.
*It is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: If there is a path from ''u'' to ''v'', the same edges form a path from ''v'' to ''u''.
*It is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]: If there is a path from ''u'' to ''v'' and a path from ''v'' to ''w'', the two paths may be concatenated together to form a path from ''u'' to ''w''.
The connected components are then the [[induced subgraph]]s formed by the [[equivalence class]]es of this relation.

==The number of connected components==
The number of connected components is an important [[topological invariant]] of a graph. In [[topological graph theory]] it can be interpreted as the zeroth [[Betti number]] of the graph. In [[algebraic graph theory]] it equals the multiplicity of 0 as an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Laplacian matrix]] of the graph. It is also the index of the first nonzero coefficient of the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a graph. Numbers of connected components play a key role in the [[Tutte theorem]] characterizing graphs that have [[perfect matching]]s, and in the definition of [[graph toughness]].

==Algorithms==
It is straightforward to compute the connected components of a graph in linear time (in terms of the numbers of the vertices and edges of the graph) using either [[breadth-first search]] or [[depth-first search]]. In either case, a search that begins at some particular vertex ''v'' will find the entire connected component containing ''v'' (and no more) before returning. To find all the connected components of a graph, loop through its vertices, starting a new breadth first or depth first search whenever the loop reaches a vertex that has not already been included in a previously found connected component.  {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Tarjan|1973}} describe essentially this algorithm, and state that at that point it was "well known".

There are also efficient algorithms to dynamically track the connected components of a graph as vertices and edges are added, as a straightforward application of [[disjoint-set data structure]]s. These algorithms require [[amortized analysis|amortized]] O(α(''n'')) time per operation, where adding vertices and edges and determining the connected component in which a vertex falls are both operations, and α(''n'') is a very slow-growing inverse of the very quickly growing [[Ackermann function]]. A related problem is tracking connected components as all edges are deleted from a graph, one by one; an algorithm exists to solve this with constant time per query, and O(|V||E|) time to maintain the data structure; this is an amortized cost of O(|V|) per edge deletion. For [[forest (graph theory)|forests]], the cost can be reduced to O(q + |V| log |V|), or O(log |V|) amortized cost per edge deletion {{harv|Shiloach|Even|1981}}.

Researchers have also studied algorithms for finding connected components in more limited models of computation, such as programs in which the working memory is limited to a [[logarithm]]ic number of bits (defined by the [[complexity class]] [[L (complexity)|L]]). {{harvtxt|Lewis|Papadimitriou|1982}} asked whether it is possible to test in logspace whether two vertices belong to the same connected component of an undirected graph, and defined a complexity class [[SL (complexity)|SL]] of problems logspace-equivalent to connectivity. Finally {{harvtxt|Reingold|2008}} succeeded in finding an algorithm for solving this connectivity problem in logarithmic space, showing that L&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;SL.

== Connected component in random graphs ==
In random graphs the sizes of connected components are given by a random variable, which, in turn, depends on the specific model. 

The &lt;math&gt;G(n, p)

&lt;/math&gt; model has three regions with seemingly different behavior: 

''Subcritical'' &lt;math&gt;n p &lt; 1

&lt;/math&gt;: All components are simple and very small, the largest component has size &lt;math&gt;|C_1| = O(\log n)

&lt;/math&gt;;

''Critical'' &lt;math&gt;n p = 1

&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;|C_1| = O(n^\frac{2}{3}) 

&lt;/math&gt;;

''Supercritical'' &lt;math&gt;n p &gt;1

&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;|C_1| \approx yn
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y = y(n p)

&lt;/math&gt; is the positive solution to the equation &lt;math&gt;e^{-p n y }=1-y 

&lt;/math&gt;.

Where &lt;math&gt;C_1
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2
&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the largest and the second largest components. All other components have their sizes of the order &lt;math&gt; O(\log n) 

&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''convex body''' in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact space|compact]] [[convex set]] with non-[[empty set|empty]] [[interior (topology)|interior]].

A convex body ''K'' is called '''symmetric''' if it is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin, i.e. a point ''x'' lies in ''K'' [[if and only if]] its [[Antipodal point|antipode]], &amp;minus;''x'', also lies in ''K''. Symmetric convex bodies are in a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the [[unit ball]]s of [[norm (mathematics)|norms]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Important examples of convex bodies are the [[Euclidean ball]], the [[hypercube]] and the [[cross-polytope]].

[[File:Cuisenaire ten.JPG|thumb|The divisors of 10 illustrated with [[Cuisenaire rods]]: 1, 2, 5, and 10]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''divisor''' of an [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, also called a '''factor''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is an integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that may be multiplied by some integer to produce &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one also says that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multiple''' of &lt;math&gt;m.&lt;/math&gt; An integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is '''divisible''' by another integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;; this implies dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; leaves no remainder.

==Definition==
Two versions of the definition of a divisor are commonplace:

* If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are integers, and more generally, elements of an [[integral domain]], it is said that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; '''divides''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a '''divisor''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multiple''' of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and this is written as
*:&lt;math&gt;m \mid n,&lt;/math&gt;
:if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or an element &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of the integral domain, such that &lt;math&gt;mk = n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, {{harvnb|Sims|1984|loc=p. 42}} or {{harvnb|Durbin|1992|loc=p. 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the statement &lt;math&gt;m \mid 0&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

* As before, but with the additional constraint &lt;math&gt;k \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herstein|1986|loc=p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the statement &lt;math&gt;m \mid 0&lt;/math&gt; does not hold for &lt;math&gt;m\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In the remainder of this article, which definition is applied is indicated where this is significant.

==General==
Divisors can be [[negative number|negative]] as well as positive, although sometimes the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.

1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself.&lt;ref&gt;This statement either requires 0|0 or needs to be restricted to nonzero integers.&lt;/ref&gt; Every integer is a divisor of 0.&lt;ref&gt;This statement either requires 0|0 or needs to be restricted to nonzero integers.&lt;/ref&gt; Integers divisible by 2 are called [[even and odd numbers|even]], and integers not divisible by 2 are called [[even and odd numbers|odd]].

1, −1, ''n'' and −''n'' are known as the '''trivial divisors''' of ''n''. A divisor of ''n'' that is not a trivial divisor is known as a '''non-trivial divisor'''. A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a [[composite number]], while the [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] −1 and 1 and [[prime number]]s have no non-trivial divisors.

There are [[divisibility rule]]s that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.

The [[Generalization (logic)|generalization]] can be said to be the concept of ''divisibility'' in any [[integral domain]].

==Examples==
[[File:Highly composite numbers.svg|thumb|250px|Plot of the number of divisors of integers from 1 to 1000. [[Prime number]]s have exactly 2 divisors, and [[highly composite number]]s are in bold.]]
*7 is a divisor of 42 because &lt;math&gt;7 \times 6 = 42&lt;/math&gt;, so we can say &lt;math&gt;7 \mid 42&lt;/math&gt;. It can also be said that 42 is '''divisible''' by 7, 42 is a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of 7, 7 '''divides''' 42, or 7 is a '''factor''' of 42.
*The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, &amp;minus;2, 3, &amp;minus;3.
*The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
*&lt;math&gt;5 \mid 0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;5 \times 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all positive divisors of 60, &lt;math&gt;A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 \}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by divisibility, has the [[Hasse diagram]]:

[[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60; factors.svg|center|350px]]

==Further notions and facts==
There are some elementary rules:
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. divisibility is a [[transitive relation]].
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \mid a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a = -b&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; a \mid (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; holds, as does &lt;math&gt; a \mid (b - c)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \mid b,\, a \mid c \Rightarrow b=ja,\, c=ka \Rightarrow b+c=(j+k)a \Rightarrow a \mid (b+c)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;a \mid b,\, a \mid c \Rightarrow b=ja,\, c=ka \Rightarrow b-c=(j-k)a \Rightarrow a \mid (b-c)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \mid b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(a + c) \mid b&lt;/math&gt; does ''not'' always hold (e.g. &lt;math&gt;2\mid6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3 \mid 6&lt;/math&gt; but 5 does not divide 6).

If &lt;math&gt;a \mid bc&lt;/math&gt;, and [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]&lt;math&gt;(a, b) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \mid c&lt;/math&gt;. This is called [[Euclid's lemma]].

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime number and &lt;math&gt;p \mid ab&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \mid a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p \mid b&lt;/math&gt;.

A positive divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; which is different from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''proper divisor''' or an '''aliquot part''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A number that does not evenly divide &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but leaves a remainder is called an '''aliquant part''' of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

An integer &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a [[prime number]]. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.

Any positive divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of [[prime factor|prime divisor]]s of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raised to some power. This is a consequence of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].

A number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[perfect number|perfect]] if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, [[deficient number|deficient]] if the sum of its proper divisors is less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and [[abundant number|abundant]] if this sum exceeds &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The total number of positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiplicative function]] &lt;math&gt;d(n)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that when two numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[relatively prime]], then &lt;math&gt;d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;d(42) = 8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = d(2) \times d(3) \times d(7)&lt;/math&gt;; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; share a common divisor, then it might not be true that &lt;math&gt;d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is another multiplicative function &lt;math&gt;\sigma (n)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sigma (42) = 96 = 3 \times 4 \times 8 = \sigma (2) \times \sigma (3) \times \sigma (7) = 1+2+3+6+7+14+21+42&lt;/math&gt;). Both of these functions are examples of [[divisor function]]s.

{{anchor|number_of_divisors_formula}}
If the [[prime factorization]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; n = p_1^{\nu_1} \, p_2^{\nu_2} \cdots p_k^{\nu_k} &lt;/math&gt;

then the number of positive divisors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; d(n) = (\nu_1 + 1) (\nu_2 + 1) \cdots (\nu_k + 1), &lt;/math&gt;
and each of the divisors has the form

:&lt;math&gt; p_1^{\mu_1} \, p_2^{\mu_2} \cdots p_k^{\mu_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le \mu_i \le \nu_i &lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le k.&lt;/math&gt;

For every natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(n) &lt; 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In abstract algebra==
Given the definition for which &lt;math&gt;0 \mid 0&lt;/math&gt; holds, the relation of divisibility turns the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[non-negative]] integers into a [[partially ordered set]]: a [[lattice (order)|complete distributive lattice]]. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation '''∧''' is given by the [[greatest common divisor]] and the join operation '''∨''' by the [[least common multiple]]. This lattice is isomorphic to the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] of the [[lattice of subgroups]] of the infinite [[cyclic group]] [[integer|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">In [[mathematics]], an '''exponentially closed field''' is an [[ordered field]] of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; which has an order preserving [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; of the additive group of  &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; onto the multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 
&lt;math&gt;1+1/n&lt;E(1)&lt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Isomorphism &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; is called an exponential function in &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* The canonical example for an exponentially closed field is the ordered field of real numbers; here &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; can be any function &lt;math&gt; a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1&lt; a\in F&lt;/math&gt;. 

==Properties==
* Every exponentially closed field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is ''root-closed'', i.e., every positive element of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; has an &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;-th root for all positive integer &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; (or in other words the  multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Divisible group|divisible]]). This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\left(\frac{1}{n}E^{-1}(a)\right)^n=E(E^{-1}(a))=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an [[Euclidean field]]. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an ordered [[Pythagorean field]].
* Not every [[real-closed field]] is an exponentially closed field, e.g., the field of real [[algebraic number]]s is not exponentially closed.  This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be &lt;math&gt;E(x)=a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\in F\,&lt;/math&gt; in every exponentially closed subfield &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; of the real numbers; and &lt;math&gt;E(\sqrt{2})=a^\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not algebraic if  &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic by [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]].
* Consequently, the class of exponentially closed fields is not an [[elementary class]] since the field of real numbers and the field of  real algebraic numbers are [[elementarily equivalent]] structures. 
* The class of exponentially closed fields is a [[pseudoelementary class]]. This is so since a field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is  exponentially closed iff there is a surjective function &lt;math&gt;E_2:F\rightarrow F^+&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E_2(x+y)=E_2(x)E_2(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;; and these properties of &lt;math&gt;E_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are axiomatizable.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}
In [[mathematics]], and in other disciplines involving [[formal language]]s, including [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], a '''free variable''' is a [[Mathematical notation|notation]] (symbol) that specifies places in an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] where [[Substitution (logic)|substitution]] may take place and is not a parameter of this or any containiner expression. Some older books use the terms '''real variable''' and '''apparent variable''' for free variable and bound variable. The idea is related to a '''placeholder''' (a [[symbol]] that will later be replaced by some [[literal string]]), or a [[wildcard character]] that stands for an unspecified symbol.

In [[computer programming]], the term '''free variable''' refers to [[variable (programming)|variables]] used in a [[function (computer science)|function]] that are neither [[local variable]]s nor [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s of that function. The term [[non-local variable]] is often a synonym in this context.

A '''bound variable''' is a variable that was previously ''free'', but has been ''bound'' to a specific value or set of values called [[domain of discourse]] or [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]. For example, the variable ''x'' becomes a '''bound variable''' when we write:

:'[[For all]] ''x'', (''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 1.'

or

:'[[There exists]] ''x'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.'

In either of these propositions, it does not matter logically whether we use ''x'' or some other letter.  However, it could be confusing  to use the same letter again elsewhere in some compound [[proposition]]. That is, free variables become bound, and then in a sense ''retire'' from being available as stand-in values for other values in the creation of formulae.

The term "dummy variable" is also sometimes used for a bound variable (more often in general mathematics than in computer science), but that use can create an ambiguity with the definition of [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables in regression analysis]].

==Examples==
Before stating a precise definition of '''free variable''' and '''bound variable''', the following are some examples that perhaps make these two concepts clearer than the definition would:

In the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{10} f(k,n),&lt;/math&gt;

''n'' is a free variable and ''k'' is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of ''n'', but there is nothing called ''k'' on which it could depend.

In the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{y-1} e^{-x}\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

''y'' is a free variable and ''x'' is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of ''y'', but there is nothing called ''x'' on which it could depend.

In the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},&lt;/math&gt;

''x'' is a free variable and ''h'' is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of ''x'', but there is nothing called ''h'' on which it could depend.

In the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\ \exists y\ \Big[\varphi(x,y,z)\Big],&lt;/math&gt;

''z'' is a free variable and ''x'' and ''y'' are bound variables; consequently the [[logical value]] of this expression depends on the value of ''z'', but there is nothing called ''x'' or ''y'' on which it could depend.

===Variable-binding operators===
The following

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{x\in S} 
\quad\quad  \prod_{x\in S}
\quad\quad  \int_0^\infty \cdots \,dx
\quad\quad  \lim_{x\to 0}
\quad\quad  \forall x
\quad\quad  \exists x&lt;/math&gt;

are some common '''variable-binding operators'''.  Each of them binds the variable '''x''' for some set '''S'''.

Note that many of these are [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] which act on functions of the bound variable.  In more complicated contexts, such notations can become awkward and confusing.  It can be useful to switch to notations which make the binding explicit, such as

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{1, \ldots, 10} \left( k \mapsto f(k,n) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

for sums or

: &lt;math&gt;D \left( x \mapsto x^2 + 2x + 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

for differentiation.

==Formal explanation==
[[File:Binary math expression tree.svg|thumb|Tree summarizing the syntax of the expression &lt;math&gt;\forall x\, ((\exists y\, A(x)) \vee B(z)) &lt;/math&gt;]]

Variable-binding mechanisms occur in different contexts in mathematics, logic and computer science. In all cases, however, they are purely [[syntax|syntactic]] properties of expressions and variables in them. For this section we can summarize syntax by identifying an expression with a [[Abstract syntax tree|tree]] whose leaf nodes are variables, constants, function constants or predicate constants and whose non-leaf nodes are logical operators. This expression can then be determined by doing an [[Tree traversal|inorder traversal]] of the tree. Variable-binding operators are [[logical operator]]s that occur in almost every formal language.  Languages that do not have them may be either extremely inexpressive or extremely difficult to use. A binding operator Q takes two arguments: a variable ''v'' and an expression ''P'', and when applied to its arguments produces a new expression Q(''v'', ''P'').  The meaning of binding operators is supplied by the [[semantics]] of the language and does not concern us here.

Variable binding relates three things: a variable ''v'', a location ''a'' for that variable in an expression and a non-leaf node ''n'' of the form Q(''v'', ''P'').  Note: we define a location in an expression as a leaf node in the syntax tree.  Variable binding occurs when that location is below the node ''n''.

In the [[lambda calculus]], &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a bound variable in the term &lt;code&gt;M = λx. T&lt;/code&gt;, and a free variable of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. We say &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is bound in &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and free in &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; contains a subterm &lt;code&gt;λx. U&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is rebound in this term. This nested, inner binding of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is said to "shadow" the outer binding. Occurrences of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; are free occurrences of the new &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=33}}

Variables bound at the top level of a program are technically free variables within the terms to which they are bound but are often treated specially because they can be compiled as fixed addresses. Similarly, an identifier bound to a [[computable function|recursive function]] is also technically a free variable within its own body but is treated specially.

A ''closed term'' is one containing no free variables.

===Function expressions===
To give an example from mathematics, consider an expression which defines a function

: &lt;math&gt;f = \left[ (x_1, \ldots , x_n) \mapsto \operatorname{t} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where t is an expression. t may contain some, all or none of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and it may contain other variables. In this case we say that function definition binds the variables
''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this manner, function definition expressions of the kind shown above can be thought of as ''the'' variable binding operator, analogous to the lambda expressions of [[lambda calculus]]. Other binding operators, like the [[summation]] sign, can be thought of as [[higher-order functions]] applying to a function. So, for example, the expression

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in \mathbb{A}}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

could be treated as a notation for

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbb{A}}{(x \mapsto x^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbb{S}}{f}&lt;/math&gt; is an operator with two parameters—a one-parameter function, and a set to evaluate that function over. The other operators listed above can be expressed in similar ways; for example, the [[universal quantifier]] &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb{S}\ P(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as an operator that evaluates to the [[logical conjunction]] of the [[boolean-valued function]] ''P'' applied over the (possibly infinite) set ''S''.

==Natural language==

{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}

When analyzed in [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]], natural languages can be seen to have free and [[Bound variable pronoun|bound]] variables. In English, [[personal pronoun]]s like ''he'', ''she'', ''they'', etc. can act as free variables.

: ''Lisa found '''her''' book.''

In the sentence above, the possessive pronoun ''her'' is a free variable. It may [[Reference#Semantics|refer]] to the previously mentioned ''Lisa'' or to any other female. In other words, ''her book'' could be referring to Lisa's book (an instance of [[coreference]]) or to a book that belongs to a different female (e.g. Jane's book). Whoever the [[referent]] of ''her'' is can be established according to the situational (i.e. [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]]) context. The identity of the referent can be shown using coindexing subscripts where ''i'' indicates one referent and ''j'' indicates a second referent (different from ''i''). Thus, the sentence ''Lisa found her book'' has the following interpretations:

: ''Lisa&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; found her&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; book.'' (interpretation #1: ''her'' = of ''Lisa'')
: ''Lisa&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; found her&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt; book.'' (interpretation #2: ''her'' = of a female that is not Lisa)

The distinction is not purely of academic interest, as some languages do actually have different forms for ''her&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''her&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt;'': for example, [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] translates coreferent ''her&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt;'' as ''sin'' and noncoreferent ''her&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt;'' as ''hennes''.

English does allow specifying coreference, but it is optional, as both interpretations of the previous example are valid (the ungrammatical interpretation is indicated with an asterisk):

: ''Lisa&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; found her&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; own book.'' (interpretation #1: ''her'' = of ''Lisa'')
: *''Lisa&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; found her&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt; own book.'' (interpretation #2: ''her'' = of a female that is not Lisa)

However, [[reflexive pronoun]]s, such as ''himself'', ''herself'', ''themselves'', etc., and [[reciprocal pronoun]]s, such as ''each other'', act as bound variables. In a sentence like the following:

: ''Jane hurt '''herself'''.''

the reflexive ''herself'' can only refer to the previously mentioned [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] ''Jane''. It can never refer to a different female person. In other words, the person being hurt and the person doing the hurting are both the same person, i.e. ''Jane''. The semantics of this sentence is abstractly: JANE hurt JANE. And it cannot be the case that this sentence could mean JANE hurt LISA. The reflexive ''herself'' must refer and can only refer to the previously mentioned ''Jane''. In this sense, the variable ''herself'' is bound to the noun ''Jane'' that occurs in [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position. Indicating the coindexation, the first interpretation with ''Jane'' and ''herself'' coindexed is permissible, but the other interpretation where they are not coindexed is [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]]:

: ''Jane&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; hurt herself&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt;.'' (interpretation #1: ''herself'' = ''Jane'')
: *''Jane&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; hurt herself&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt;.'' (interpretation #2: ''herself'' = a female that is not Jane)

Note that the coreference binding can be represented using a [[Lambda calculus|lambda expression]] as mentioned in the previous [[#Formal explanation|Formal explanation section]]. The sentence with the reflexive could be represented as

:  (λx.x hurt x)Jane

in which ''Jane'' is the subject referent argument and ''λx.x hurt x'' is the predicate function (a lambda abstraction) with the lambda notation and ''x'' indicating both the semantic subject and the semantic object of sentence as being bound. This returns the semantic interpretation ''JANE hurt JANE'' with ''JANE'' being the same person.

Pronouns can also behave in a different way. In the sentence below

: ''Ashley hit '''her'''.''

the pronoun ''her'' can only refer to a female that is not Ashley. This means that it can never have a reflexive meaning equivalent to ''Ashley hit herself''. The grammatical and ungrammatical interpretations are:

: *''Ashley&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; hit her&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt;.'' (interpretation #1: ''her'' = ''Ashley'')
: ''Ashley&lt;sub&gt;'''i'''&lt;/sub&gt; hit her&lt;sub&gt;'''j'''&lt;/sub&gt;.'' (interpretation #2: ''her'' = a female that is not Ashley)

The first interpretation is impossible. Only the second interpretation is permitted by the grammar.

Thus, it can be seen that reflexives and reciprocals are bound variables (known technically as [[anaphor]]s) while true pronouns are free variables in some grammatical structures but variables that cannot be bound in other grammatical structures. The binding phenomena found in natural languages was particularly important to the syntactic [[government and binding theory]] (see also: [[Binding (linguistics)]]).

In [[mathematical analysis]], and applications in [[geometry]], [[applied mathematics]], [[engineering]], [[natural sciences]], and [[economics]], a '''function of several real variables''' or '''real multivariate function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with more than one [[argument of a function|argument]], with all arguments being [[real number|real]] variables. This concept extends the idea of a [[function of a real variable]] to several variables. The "input" variables take real values, while the "output", also called the "value of the function", may be real or [[complex number|complex]]. However, the study of the complex valued functions may be easily reduced to the study of the real valued functions, by considering the real and imaginary parts of the complex function; therefore, unless explicitly specified, only real valued functions will be considered in this article.

The [[domain of a function|domain]] of a function of ''n'' variables is the [[subset]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for which the function is defined. As usual, the domain of a function of several real variables is supposed to contain an [[open set|open]] subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

A '''real-valued function of {{math|''n''}} real variables''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that takes as input {{math|''n''}} [[real number]]s, commonly represented by the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, for producing another real number, the ''value'' of the function, commonly denoted {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}. For simplicity, in this article a real-valued function of several real variables will be simply called a '''function'''. To avoid any ambiguity, the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified.

Some functions are defined for all real values of the variables (one says that they are everywhere defined), but some other functions are defined only if the value of the variable are taken in a subset {{math|''X''}} of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the [[domain of a function|domain]] of the function, which is always supposed to contain an [[open set|open]] subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In other words, a real-valued function of {{math|''n''}} real variables is a function

:&lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;

such that its domain {{math|''X''}} is a subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that contains an open set.

An element of {{math|''X''}} being an {{math|''n''}}-[[tuple (mathematics)|tuple]] {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} (usually delimited by parentheses), the general notation for denoting functions would be {{math|''f''((''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;))}}. The common usage, much older than the general definition of functions between sets, is to not use double parentheses and to simply write {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

It is also common to abbreviate the {{math|''n''}}-tuple {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} by using a notation similar to that for [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]], like boldface {{math|'''''x'''''}}, underline {{math|{{underline|''x''}}}}, or  overarrow {{math|{{overset|→|''x''}}}}. This article will use bold.

A simple example of a function in two variables could be:

:&lt;math&gt; V : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; X = \{ (A,h) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid A&gt;0, h&gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V(A,h) = \frac{1}{3}A h&lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[volume]] {{math|''V''}} of a [[cone]] with base area {{math|''A''}} and height {{math|''h''}} measured perpendicularly from the base. The domain restricts all variables to be positive since [[length]]s and [[area]]s must be positive.

For an example of a function in two variables:

:&lt;math&gt; z : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z(x,y) = ax + by &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are real non-zero constants. Using the [[three-dimensional]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]], where the xy plane is the domain {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the z axis is the codomain {{math|ℝ}}, one can visualize the image to be a two-dimensional plane, with a [[slope]] of {{math|''a''}} in the positive x direction and a slope of {{math|''b''}} in the positive y direction. The function is well-defined at all points {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The previous example can be extended easily to higher dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt; z : \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_p) = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_p x_p  &lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''p''}} non-zero real constants {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which describes a {{math|''p''}}-dimensional [[hyperplane]].

The [[Euclidean norm]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{x})=\|\boldsymbol{x}\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is also a function of ''n'' variables which is everywhere defined, while
:&lt;math&gt;g(\boldsymbol{x})=\frac{1}{f(\boldsymbol{x})}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined only for {{math|'''''x''''' ≠ (0, 0, ..., 0)}}.

For a non-linear example function in two variables:

:&lt;math&gt; z : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, : \, x^2 + y^2 \leq 8 \, , \, x \neq 0 \, , \, y \neq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z(x,y) = \frac{1}{2xy}\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which takes in all points in {{math|''X''}}, a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] of radius {{math|{{sqrt|8}}}} "punctured" at the origin {{math|(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} (0, 0)}} in the plane {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and returns a point in {{math|ℝ}}. The function does not include the origin {{math|(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} (0, 0)}}, if it did then {{math|''f''}} would be ill-defined at that point. Using a 3d Cartesian coordinate system with the xy plane as the domain {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the z axis the codomain {{math|ℝ}}, the image can be visualized as a curved surface.

The function can be evaluated at the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} (2, {{sqrt|3}})}} in {{math|''X''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;z(2,\sqrt{3}) = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{3}}\sqrt{(2)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{7} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

However, the function couldn't be evaluated at, say

:&lt;math&gt;(x,y) = (65,\sqrt{10}) \, \Rightarrow \, x^2 + y^2 = (65)^2 + (\sqrt{10})^2 &gt; 8 &lt;/math&gt;

since these values of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} do not satisfy the domain's rule.

===Image===

The '''[[image (mathematics)|image]]''' of a function {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is the set of all values of {{mvar|''f''}} when the {{math|''n''}}-tuple {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} runs in the whole domain of {{mvar|''f''}}. For a continuous (see below for a definition) real-valued function which has a connected domain, the image is either an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or a single value. In the latter case, the function is a [[constant function]].

The [[preimage]] of a given real number {{math|''c''}} is called a [[level set]]. It is the set of the solutions of the [[equation]] {{math|1= ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''}}.

===Domain===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

The [[Domain of a function|domain]] of a function of several real variables is a subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that is sometimes, but not always, explicitly defined. In fact, if one restricts the domain {{math|''X''}} of a function {{math|''f''}} to a subset {{math|''Y'' ⊂ ''X''}}, one gets formally a different function, the ''restriction'' of {{math|''f''}} to {{math|''Y''}}, which is denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In practice, it is often (but not always) not harmful to identify {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and to omit the subscript {{math|&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Conversely, it is sometimes possible to enlarge naturally the domain of a given function, for example by [[continuous function|continuity]] or by [[analytic continuation]]. 

Moreover, many functions are defined in such a way that it is difficult to specify explicitly their domain. For example, given a function  {{math|''f''}}, it may be difficult to specify the domain of the function &lt;math&gt;g(\boldsymbol{x}) = 1/f(\boldsymbol{x}).&lt;/math&gt; If {{math|''f''}} is a [[multivariate polynomial]], (which has &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; as a domain), it is even difficult to test whether the domain of {{math|''g''}} is also &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to test whether a polynomial is always positive, and is the object of an active research area (see [[Positive polynomial]]).

===Algebraic structure===

The usual operations of arithmetic on the reals may be extended to real-valued functions of several real variables in the following way: 
* For every real number {{math|''r''}}, the [[constant function]]
::&lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto r&lt;/math&gt;
:is everywhere defined.
* For every real number {{math|''r''}} and every function {{math|''f''}}, the function:
::&lt;math&gt;rf:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto rf(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:has the same domain as {{math|''f''}} (or is everywhere defined if {{math|''r'' {{=}} 0}}).
* If {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are two functions of respective domains {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} such that {{math|''X'' ∩ ''Y''}} contains an open subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then
::&lt;math&gt;f\,g:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\,g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;f\,g:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\,g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:are functions that have a domain containing {{math|''X'' ∩ ''Y''}}.

It follows that the functions of {{math|''n''}}} variables that are everywhere defined and the functions of {{math|''n''}} variables that are defined in some [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a given point both form [[commutative algebra (structure)|commutative algebras]] over the reals ({{math|ℝ}}-algebras). This is a prototypical example of a [[function space]].

One may similarly define
:&lt;math&gt;1/f:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto 1/f(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt;
which is a function only if the set of the points {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}} such that {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≠ 0}} contains an open subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This constraint implies that the above two algebras are not [[field (mathematics)|fields]].

===Univariable functions associated with a multivariable function===

One can easily obtain a function in one real variable by giving a constant value to all but one of the variables. For example, if {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is a point of the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the domain of the function {{math|''f''}}, we can fix the values of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} respectively, to get a univariable function
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(x, a_2, \ldots, a_n),&lt;/math&gt;
whose domain contains an interval centered at {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This function may also be viewed as the [[restriction of a function|restriction of the function]] {{math|''f''}} to the line defined by the equations {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 2, ...,''n''}}.

Other univariable functions may be defined by restricting {{math|''f''}} to any line passing through {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}. These are the functions
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(a_1+c_1 x, a_2+c_2 x, \ldots, a_n+c_n x),&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are real numbers that are not all zero.

In next section, we will show that, if the multivariable function is continuous, so are all these univariable functions, but the converse is not necessarily true.

===Continuity and limit===
Until the second part of 19th century, only [[continuous function]]s were considered by mathematicians. At that time, the notion of continuity was elaborated for the functions of one or several real variables a rather long time before the formal definition of a [[topological space]] and a [[continuous map]] between topological spaces. As continuous functions of several real variables are ubiquitous in mathematics, it is worth to define this notion without reference to the general notion of continuous maps between topological space.

For defining the continuity, it is useful to consider the [[distance function]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is an everywhere defined function of {{math|2''n''}} real variables:
:&lt;math&gt;d(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})=d(x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n)=\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+\cdots +(x_n-y_n)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

A function {{math|''f''}} is '''continuous''' at a point {{math|'''''a''''' {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} which is [[interior (topology)|interior]] to its domain, if, for every positive real number {{math|''ε''}}, there is a positive real number {{math|''φ''}} such that {{math|{{!}}''f''('''''x''''') − ''f''('''''a'''''){{!}} &lt; ''ε''}} for all {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''d''('''''x''''' '''''a''''') &lt; ''φ''}}. In other words, {{math|''φ''}} may be chosen small enough for having the image by {{math|''f''}} of the ball of radius {{math|''φ''}} centered at {{math|'''''a'''''}} contained in the interval of length {{math|2''ε''}} centered at {{math|''f''('''''a''''')}}. A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point of its domain.

If a function is continuous at {{math|''f''('''''a''''')}}, then all the univariate functions, that are obtained by fixing all the variables {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} but one at the value {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, are continuous at {{math|''f''('''''a''''')}}. The converse is false; this means that all these univariate functions may be continuous for a function that is not continuous at {{math|''f''('''''a''''')}}. For an example, let us consider the function {{math|''f''}} such that {{math|''f''(0, 0) {{=}} 0}}, and is otherwise defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The functions {{math|''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x'', 0)}} and {{math|''y'' ↦ ''f''(0, ''y'')}} are both constant and equal to zero, and are therefore continuous. The function {{math|''f''}} is not continuous at {{math|(0, 0)}}, because, if {{math|''ε'' &lt; 1/2}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 0}}, we have {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 1/2}}, even if {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} is very small. Although not continuous, this function has the further property that all the univariate functions obtained by restricting it to a line passing through {{math|(0, 0)}} are also continuous. In fact, we have
:&lt;math&gt; f(x, \lambda x) =\frac{\lambda x}{x^2+\lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''λ'' ≠ 0}}. The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a real-valued function of several real variables is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential and Integral Calculus|volume=2|author=R. Courant|pages=46–47|publisher=Wiley Classics Library|isbn=0-471-60840-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|'''''a''''' {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a point in [[closure (topology)|topological closure]] of the domain {{math|''X''}} of the function {{math|''f''}}. The function, {{math|''f''}} has a limit {{math|''L''}} when {{math|'''''x'''''}} tends toward {{math|'''''a'''''}}, denoted
:&lt;math&gt;L = \lim_{\boldsymbol{x} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{a}} f(\boldsymbol{x}), &lt;/math&gt;
if the following condition is satisfied:
For every positive real number {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, there is a positive real number {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(\boldsymbol{x}) - L| &lt; \varepsilon  &lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|'''''x'''''}} in the domain such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{a})&lt; \delta.&lt;/math&gt;

If the limit exists, it is unique. If {{math|'''''a'''''}} is in the interior of the domain, the limit exists if and only if the function is continuous at {{math|'''''a'''''}}. In this case, we have

:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{a}) = \lim_{\boldsymbol{x} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{a}} f(\boldsymbol{x}). &lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|'''''a'''''}} is in the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the domain of {{math|''f''}}, and if {{math|''f''}} has a limit at {{math|'''''a'''''}}, the latter formula allows to "extend by continuity" the domain of {{math|''f''}} to {{math|'''''a'''''}}.

==Symmetry==

A [[symmetric function]] is a function {{math|''f''}} that is unchanged when two variables {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are interchanged:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\ldots, x_i,\ldots,x_j,\ldots) = f(\ldots, x_j,\ldots,x_i,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} are each one of {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z,t) = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is symmetric in {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} since interchanging any pair of {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} leaves {{math|''f''}} unchanged, but is not symmetric in all of {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t''}}, since interchanging {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''x''}} or {{math|''y''}} or {{math|''z''}} gives a different function.

==Function composition==

Suppose the functions

:&lt;math&gt;\xi_1 = \xi_1(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n), \quad \xi_2 = \xi_2(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n), \ldots \xi_m = \xi_m(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

or more compactly {{math|'''''ξ''''' {{=}} '''''ξ'''''('''''x''''')}}, are all defined on a domain {{math|''X''}}. As the {{math|''n''}}-tuple {{math|'''''x''''' {{=}} (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} varies in {{math|''X''}}, a subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the {{math|''m''}}-tuple {{math|'''''ξ''''' {{=}} (''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} varies in another region {{math|Ξ}} a subset of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. To restate this:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\xi} : X \rightarrow \Xi .&lt;/math&gt;

Then, a function {{math|''ζ''}} of the functions {{math|'''''ξ'''''('''''x''''')}} defined on {{math|Ξ}},

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta : \Xi \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \zeta(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m), &lt;/math&gt;

is a '''[[function composition]]''' defined on {{math|''X''}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential and Integral Calculus|volume=2|author=R. Courant|page=70|publisher=Wiley Classics Library|isbn=0-471-60840-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other terms the mapping

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \zeta(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m) = f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Note the numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}} do not need to be equal.

For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = e^{xy}[\sin 3(x-y) - \cos 2(x+y)]&lt;/math&gt;

defined everywhere on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be rewritten by introducing

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta, \gamma ) = (\alpha(x,y), \beta(x,y) , \gamma(x,y) ) =  ( xy ,  x-y, x+y )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!---please leave this written out fully, to show the transition from the (x, y) variables to the (alpha, beta, gamma) clearer, thanks---&gt;

which is also everywhere defined in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \zeta(\alpha(x,y),\beta(x,y),\gamma(x,y)) = \zeta(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) = e^\alpha[\sin (3\beta) - \cos (2\gamma)] \,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!---again please leave this written out fully, thanks---&gt;

Function composition can be used to simplify functions, which is useful for carrying out [[multiple integral]]s and solving [[partial differential equation]]s.

==Calculus==

[[Calculus|Elementary calculus]] is the calculus of real-valued functions of one real variable, and the principal ideas of [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[integration (mathematics)|integration]] of such functions can be extended to functions of more than one real variable; this extension is [[multivariable calculus]].

===Partial derivatives===

{{main|Partial derivative}}

[[Partial derivative]]s can be defined with respect to each variable:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,,\quad \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)\,,\ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n). &lt;/math&gt;

Partial derivatives themselves are functions, each of which represents the rate of change of {{math|''f''}} parallel to one of the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} axes at all points in the domain (if the derivatives exist and are continuous—see also below). A first derivative is positive if the function increases along the direction of the relevant axis, negative if it decreases, and zero if there is no increase or decrease. Evaluating a partial derivative at a particular point in the domain gives the rate of change of the function at that point in the direction parallel to a particular axis, a real number.

For real-valued functions of a real variable, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}, its [[ordinary derivative]] {{math|''dy''/''dx''}} is geometrically the gradient of the tangent line to the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at all points in the domain. Partial derivatives extend this idea to tangent hyperplanes to a curve.

The second order partial derivatives can be calculated for every pair of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2_1} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,,\quad \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_1 x_2} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)\,,\ldots, \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2_n} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, they are related to the local [[curvature]] of the function's image at all points in the domain. At any point where the function is well-defined, the function could be increasing along some axes, and/or decreasing along other axes, and/or not increasing or decreasing at all along other axes.

This leads to a variety of possible [[stationary point]]s: global or local [[Maxima and minima|maxima]], global or local [[Maxima and minima|minima]], and [[saddle point]]s—the multidimensional analogue of [[inflection point]]s for real functions of one real variable. The [[Hessian matrix]] is a matrix of all the second order partial derivatives, which are used to investigate the stationary points of the function, important for [[mathematical optimization]].

In general, partial derivatives of higher order {{math|''p''}} have the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^p}{\partial x_1^{p_1}\partial x_2^{p_2}\ldots\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \equiv \frac{\partial^{p_1}}{\partial x_1^{p_1}} \frac{\partial^{p_2}}{\partial x_2^{p_2}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{p_n}}{\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are each integers between {{math|0}} and {{math|''p''}} such that {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''p''}}, using the definitions of zeroth partial derivatives as [[Identity function|identity operator]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^0}{\partial x_1^0}f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,,\quad \ldots \frac{\partial^0}{\partial x_n^0}f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)=f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The number of possible partial derivatives increases with {{math|''p''}}, although some mixed partial derivatives (those with respect to more than one variable) are superfluous, because of the [[Symmetry of second derivatives|symmetry of second order partial derivatives]]. This reduces the number of partial derivatives to calculate for some {{math|''p''}}.

===Multivariable differentiability===

{{main|differentiable function}}

A function {{math|''f''('''''x''''')}} is '''differentiable''' in a neighborhood of a point {{math|'''''a'''''}} if there is an {{math|''n''}}-tuple of numbers dependent on {{math|'''''a'''''}} in general, {{math|'''''A'''''('''''a''''') {{=}} (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''''a'''''), ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''''a'''''), ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''''a'''''))}}, so that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced calculus|author=W. Fulks|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1978|pages=300–302|isbn=0-471-02195-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\boldsymbol{a}) + \boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol{a})\cdot(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{a}) + \alpha(\boldsymbol x)|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{a}|&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α'' → 0}} as {{math|{{!}}'''''x''''' − '''''a'''''{{!}} → 0}}. This means that if {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at a point {{math|'''''a'''''}}, then {{math|''f''}} is continuous at {{math|'''''x''''' {{=}} '''''a'''''}}, although the converse is not true - continuity in the domain does not imply differentiability in the domain. If {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|'''''a'''''}} then the first order partial derivatives exist at {{math|'''''a'''''}} and:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i}\right|_{\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{a}} = A_i (\boldsymbol{a}) &lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, which can be found from the definitions of the individual partial derivatives, so the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} exist.

Assuming an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional analogue of a rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]], these partial derivatives can be used to form a vectorial [[linear operator|linear]] [[differential operator]], called the [[gradient#Definition|gradient]] (also known as "[[Del|nabla]]" or "[[del]]") in this coordinate system:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \right) f(\boldsymbol{x}) &lt;/math&gt;

used extensively in [[vector calculus]], because it is useful for constructing other differential operators and compactly formulating theorems in vector calculus.

Then substituting the gradient {{math|∇''f''}} (evaluated at {{math|'''''x''''' {{=}} '''''a''''')}} with a slight rearrangement gives:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{x}) - f(\boldsymbol{a})= \nabla f(\boldsymbol{a})\cdot(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{a}) + \alpha |\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{a}|&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|·}} denotes the [[dot product]]. This equation represents the best linear approximation of the function {{math|''f''}} at all points {{math|'''''x'''''}} within a neighborhood of {{math|'''''a'''''}}. For [[differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimal change]]s in {{math|''f''}} and {{math|'''''x'''''}} as {{math|'''''x''''' → '''''a'''''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;df = \left.\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_1}\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}dx_1 + \left.\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_2}\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}dx_2 + \cdots \left.\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_n}\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}dx_n = \nabla f(\boldsymbol{a}) \cdot d\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt;

which is defined as the '''total [[differential of a function|differential]]''', or simply '''differential''', of {{math|''f''}}, at {{math|'''''a'''''}}. This expression corresponds to the total infinitesimal change of {{math|''f''}}, by adding all the infinitesimal changes of {{math|''f''}} in all the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} directions. Also, {{math|''df''}} can be construed as a [[covector]] with [[basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] as the infinitesimals {{math|''dx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in each direction and partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} as the components.

Geometrically {{math|∇''f''}} is perpendicular to the level sets of {{math|''f''}}, given by {{math|''f''('''''x''''') {{=}} ''c''}} which for some constant {{math|''c''}} describes an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional hypersurface. The differential of a constant is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;df = (\nabla f) \cdot d \boldsymbol{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|''d'''x'''''}} is an infinitesimal change in {{math|'''''x'''''}} in the hypersurface {{math|''f''('''''x''''') {{=}} ''c''}}, and since the dot product of {{math|∇''f''}} and {{math|''d'''x'''''}} is zero, this means {{math|∇''f''}} is perpendicular to {{math|''d'''x'''''}}.

In arbitrary [[curvilinear coordinate system]]s in {{math|''n''}} dimensions, the explicit expression for the gradient would not be so simple - there would be scale factors in terms of the [[metric tensor]] for that coordinate system. For the above case used throughout this article, the metric is just the [[Kronecker delta]] and the scale factors are all 1.

===Differentiability classes===

If all first order partial derivatives evaluated at a point {{math|'''''a'''''}} in the domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} f(\boldsymbol{x})\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}\,,\quad \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} f(\boldsymbol{x})\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}\,,\ldots, \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} f(\boldsymbol{x})\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

exist and are continuous for all {{math|'''''a'''''}} in the domain, {{math|''f''}} has differentiability class {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In general, if all order {{math|''p''}} partial derivatives evaluated at a point {{math|'''''a'''''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial^p}{\partial x_1^{p_1}\partial x_2^{p_2}\ldots\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(\boldsymbol{x})\right|_{\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

exist and are continuous, where {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and {{math|''p''}} are as above, for all {{math|'''''a'''''}} in the domain, then {{math|''f''}} is differentiable to order {{math|''p''}} throughout the domain and has differentiability class {{math|''C'' &lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

If {{math|''f''}} is of differentiability class {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{math|''f''}} has continuous partial derivatives of all order and is called ''[[smooth function|smooth]]''. If {{math|''f''}} is an ''[[analytic function]]'' and equals its [[Taylor series]] about any point in the domain, the notation {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;''}} denotes this differentiability class.

===Multiple integration===

{{main|Multiple integration}}

[[Definite integral|Definite integration]] can be extended to [[multiple integration]] over the several real variables with the notation;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{R_n} \cdots \int_{R_2} \int_{R_1} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \, dx_1 dx_2\cdots dx_n \equiv \int_R f(\boldsymbol{x}) \, d^n\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where each region {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a subset of or all of the real line:

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 \subseteq \mathbb{R} \,, \quad R_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R} \,, \ldots , R_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}, &lt;/math&gt;

and their Cartesian product gives the region to integrate over as a single set:

:&lt;math&gt;R = R_1 \times R_2 \times \ldots R_n \,,\quad R \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \,,&lt;/math&gt;

an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[hypervolume]]. When evaluated, a definite integral is a real number if the integral [[Convergence (mathematics)|converges]] in the region {{math|''R''}} of integration (the result of a definite integral may diverge to infinity for a given region, in such cases the integral remains ill-defined). The variables are treated as "dummy" or [[Free variables and bound variables|"bound" variable]]s which are substituted for numbers in the process of integration.

The integral of a real-valued function of a real variable {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} has geometric interpretation as the area bounded by the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Multiple integrals extend the dimensionality of this concept: assuming an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional analogue of a rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the above definite integral has the geometric interpretation as the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional hypervolume bounded by {{math|''f''('''''x''''')}} and the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} axes, which may be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the function being integrated (if the integral is convergent).

While bounded hypervolume is a useful insight, the more important idea of definite integrals is that they represent total quantities within space. This has significance in applied mathematics and physics: if {{math|''f''}} is some [[scalar density]] field and {{math|'''''x'''''}} are the [[position vector]] coordinates, i.e. some [[scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]] per unit ''n''-dimensional hypervolume, then integrating over the region {{math|''R''}} gives the total amount of quantity in {{math|''R''}}. The more formal notions of hypervolume is the subject of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]]. Above we used the [[Lebesgue measure]], see [[Lebesgue integration]] for more on this topic.

===Theorems===

With the definitions of multiple integration and partial derivatives, key theorems can be formulated, including the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] in several real variables (namely [[Stokes' theorem]]), [[integration by parts#Higher dimensions|integration by parts]] in several real variables, and [[Taylor's theorem#Taylor's theorem for multivariate functions|Taylor's theorem for multivariable functions]]. Evaluating a mixture of integrals and partial derivatives can be done by using theorem [[differentiation under the integral sign]].

===Vector calculus===

One can collect a number of functions each of several real variables, say

:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = f_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,,\quad y_2 = f_2(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\,,\ldots, y_m = f_m(x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n) &lt;/math&gt;

into an {{math|''m''}}-tuple, or sometimes as a [[column vector]] or [[row vector]], respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m) \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \\  f_2(x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n) \\ \vdots \\ f_m(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \end{bmatrix} \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) &amp;  f_2(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) &amp; \cdots &amp; f_m(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

all treated on the same footing as an {{math|''m''}}-component [[vector field]], and use whichever form is convenient. All the above notations have a common compact notation {{math|'''''y''''' {{=}} '''''f'''''('''''x''''')}}. The calculus of such vector fields is [[vector calculus]]. For more on the treatment of row vectors and column vectors of multivariable functions, see [[matrix calculus]].

==Implicit functions==

A '''real-valued [[implicit function]] of several real variables''' is not written in the form "{{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(...)}}". Instead, the mapping is from the space {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to the [[zero element]] in {{math|ℝ}} (just the ordinary zero 0):

:&lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \rightarrow \{0\} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is an equation in all the variables. Implicit functions are a more general way to represent functions, since if:

:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;

then we can always define:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, y) = y - f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

but the converse is not always possible, i.e. not all implicit functions have an explicit form.

For example, using [[interval (mathematics)|interval notation]], let

:&lt;math&gt; \phi : X \rightarrow \{ 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x,y,z) = \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z}{c}\right)^2 - 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; X = [-a,a] \times [-b,b] \times [-c,c] = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \,:\, -a\leq x\leq a, -b\leq y\leq b, -c\leq z\leq c \}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing a 3-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinate system, this function describes the surface of a 3D [[ellipsoid]] centered at the origin {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (0, 0, 0)}} with constant [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}}, along the positive ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' axes respectively. In the case {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} ''r''}}, we have a [[sphere]] of radius {{math|''r''}} centered at the origin. Other [[conic section]] examples which can be described similarly include the [[hyperboloid]] and [[paraboloid]], more generally so can any 2D surface in 3D Euclidean space. The above example can be solved for {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} or {{math|''z''}}; however it is much tidier to write it in an implicit form.

For a more sophisticated example:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi : \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \{ 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \phi(t,x,y,z) = C tz e^{tx-yz} + A \sin(3\omega t) \left(x^2z - B y^6\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for non-zero real constants {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''ω''}}, this function is well-defined for all {{math|(''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, but it cannot be solved explicitly for these variables and written as "{{math|''t'' {{=}} }}", "{{math|''x'' {{=}} }}", etc.

The '''[[implicit function theorem]]''' of more than two real variables deals with the continuity and differentiability of the function, as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential and Integral Calculus|volume=2|author=R. Courant|pages=117–118|publisher=Wiley Classics Library|isbn=0-471-60840-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|''ϕ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a continuous function with continuous first order partial derivatives, and let ''ϕ'' evaluated at a point {{math|('''''a''''', ''b'') {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b'')}} be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\boldsymbol{a}, b) = 0;&lt;/math&gt;

and let the first partial derivative of {{math|''ϕ''}} with respect to {{math|''y''}} evaluated at {{math|('''''a''''', ''b'')}} be non-zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial \phi(\boldsymbol{x},y)}{\partial y}\right|_{(\boldsymbol{x},y) = (\boldsymbol{a},b)} \neq 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Then, there is an interval {{math|[''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} containing {{math|''b''}}, and a region {{math|''R''}} containing {{math|('''''a''''', ''b'')}}, such that for every {{math|'''''x'''''}} in {{math|''R''}} there is exactly one value of {{math|''y''}} in {{math|[''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} satisfying {{math|''ϕ''('''''x''''', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}, and {{math|''y''}} is a continuous function of {{math|'''''x'''''}} so that {{math|''ϕ''('''''x''''', ''y''('''''x''''')) {{=}} 0}}. The [[total differential]]s of the functions are:

:&lt;math&gt;dy=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2}dx_2 + \ldots + \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_n}dx_n ;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d\phi=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_2}dx_2 + \ldots + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_n}dx_n + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}dy .&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|''dy''}} into the latter differential and equating coefficients of the differentials gives the first order partial derivatives of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in terms of the derivatives of the original function, each as a solution of the linear equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}.

==Complex-valued function of several real variables==

A '''complex-valued function of several real variables''' may be defined by relaxing, in the definition of the real-valued functions, the restriction of the codomain to the real numbers, and allowing [[complex number|complex]] values.

If {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is such a complex valued function, it may be decomposed as
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_n)=g(x_1,\ldots, x_n)+ih(x_1,\ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''g''}} and {{math|''h''}} are real-valued functions. In other words, the study of the complex valued functions reduces easily to the study of the pairs of real valued functions.

This reduction works for the general properties. However, for an explicitly given function, such as:

:&lt;math&gt; z(x,y,\alpha,a,q) = \frac{q}{2\pi}\left[\ln(x+iy- ae^{i\alpha}) - \ln(x+iy + ae^{-i\alpha})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

the computation of the real and the imaginary part may be difficult.

==Applications==

Multivariable functions of real variables arise inevitably in [[engineering]] and [[physics]], because [[observable]] [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] are real numbers (with associated [[units of measurement|units]] and [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]]), and any one physical quantity will generally depend on a number of other quantities.

===Examples of real-valued functions of several real variables===

Examples in [[continuum mechanics]] include the local mass [[density]] {{math|''ρ''}} of a mass distribution, a [[scalar field]] which depends on the spatial position coordinates (here Cartesian to exemplify), {{math|'''r''' {{=}} (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, and time {{math|''t''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho(\mathbf{r},t) = \rho(x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for electric [[charge density]] for [[electric charge|electrically charged]] objects, and numerous other [[scalar potential]] fields.

Another example is the [[velocity field]], a [[vector field]], which has components of velocity {{math|'''v''' {{=}} (''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} that are each multivariable functions of spatial coordinates and time similarly:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{v}(x,y,z,t) = [v_x(x,y,z,t), v_y(x,y,z,t), v_z(x,y,z,t)]&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for other physical vector fields such as [[electric field]]s and [[magnetic field]]s, and [[vector potential]] fields.

Another important example is the [[equation of state]] in [[thermodynamics]], an equation relating [[pressure]] {{math|''P''}}, [[temperature]] {{math|''T''}}, and [[volume]] {{math|''V''}} of a fluid, in general it has an implicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(P, V, T) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The simplest example is the [[ideal gas law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(P, V, T) = PV - nRT = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''}} is the [[number of moles]], constant for a fixed [[amount of substance]], and {{math|''R''}} the [[gas constant]]. Much more complicated equations of state have been empirically derived, but they all have the above implicit form.

Real-valued functions of several real variables appear pervasively in [[economics]]. In the underpinnings of consumer theory, [[utility]] is expressed as a function of the amounts of various goods consumed, each amount being an argument of the utility function. The result of maximizing utility is a set of [[demand function]]s, each expressing the amount demanded of a particular good as a function of the prices of the various goods and of income or wealth. In [[supply (economics)|producer theory]], a firm is usually assumed to maximize profit as a function of the quantities of various goods produced and of the quantities of various factors of production employed. The result of the optimization is a set of demand functions for the various factors of production and a set of [[supply (economics)|supply function]]s for the various products; each of these functions has as its arguments the prices of the goods and of the factors of production.

===Examples of complex-valued functions of several real variables===

Some "physical quantities" may be actually complex valued - such as [[complex impedance]], [[complex permittivity]], [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Complex permeability|complex permeability]], and [[refractive index#Complex index of refraction and absorption|complex refractive index]]. These are also functions of real variables, such as frequency or time, as well as temperature.

In two-dimensional [[fluid mechanics]], specifically in the theory of the [[potential flow#Examples of two-dimensional potential flows|potential flows]] used to describe fluid motion in 2d, the [[potential flow#Analysis for two-dimensional flow|complex potential]]

:&lt;math&gt;F(x,y,\ldots) = \varphi(x,y,\ldots) + i\psi(x,y,\ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

is a complex valued function of the two spatial coordinates {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, and other ''real'' variables associated with the system. The real part is the [[velocity potential]] and the imaginary part is the [[stream function]].

The [[spherical harmonics]] occur in physics and engineering as the solution to [[Laplace's equation]], as well as the [[eigenfunction]]s of the z-component [[angular momentum operator]], which are complex-valued functions of real-valued [[spherical polar coordinates|spherical polar angles]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Y^m_\ell = Y^m_\ell(\theta,\phi) &lt;/math&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[wavefunction]] is necessarily complex-valued, but is a function of ''real'' spatial coordinates (or [[momentum]] components), as well as time {{math|''t''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \Psi(x,y,z,t)\,,\quad \Phi = \Phi(\mathbf{p},t) = \Phi(p_x,p_y,p_z,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where each is related by a [[Fourier transform]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">In [[mathematics]], a '''generalized permutation matrix''' (or '''monomial matrix''') is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with the same nonzero pattern as a [[permutation matrix]], i.e. there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column. Unlike a permutation matrix, where the nonzero entry must be 1, in a generalized permutation matrix the nonzero entry can be any nonzero value. An example of a generalized permutation matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp;  0 &amp; 3 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Structure ==
An [[invertible matrix]] ''A'' is a generalized permutation matrix [[if and only if]] it can be written as a product of an [[invertible matrix|invertible]] [[diagonal matrix]] ''D'' and an (implicitly [[invertible matrix|invertible]]) [[permutation matrix]] ''P'': i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; A=DP.&lt;/math&gt;

===Group structure===
The set of ''n''&amp;times;''n'' generalized permutation matrices with entries in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' forms a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'',''F''), in which the group of nonsingular diagonal matrices Δ(''n'', ''F'') forms a [[normal subgroup]]. Indeed, the generalized permutation matrices are the [[normalizer]] of the diagonal matrices, meaning that the generalized permutation matrices are the ''largest'' subgroup of GL in which diagonal matrices are normal.

The abstract group of generalized permutation matrices is the [[wreath product]] of ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Concretely, this means that it is the [[semidirect product]] of Δ(''n'', ''F'') by the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&amp;Delta;(''n'', ''F'') &amp;#x22C9; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,
where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acts by permuting coordinates and the diagonal matrices Δ(''n'', ''F'') are isomorphic to the ''n''-fold product (''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

To be precise, the generalized permutation matrices are a (faithful) [[linear representation]] of this abstract wreath product: a realization of the abstract group as a subgroup of matrices.

===Subgroups===
* The subgroup where all entries are 1 is exactly the [[permutation matrices]], which is isomorphic to the symmetric group.
* The subgroup where all entries are ±1 is the [[signed permutation matrices]], which is the [[hyperoctahedral group]].
* The subgroup where the entries are ''m''th [[roots of unity]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_m&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a [[generalized symmetric group]].
* The subgroup of diagonal matrices is abelian, normal, and a maximal abelian subgroup. The quotient group is the symmetric group, and this construction is in fact the [[Weyl group]] of the general linear group: the diagonal matrices are a [[maximal torus]] in the general linear group (and are their own centralizer), the generalized permutation matrices are the normalizer of this torus, and the quotient, &lt;math&gt;N(T)/Z(T) = N(T)/T \cong S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the Weyl group.

== Properties ==
* If a nonsingular matrix and its inverse are both [[nonnegative matrices]] (i.e. matrices with nonnegative entries), then the matrix is a permutation matrix.

== Generalizations ==
One can generalize further by allowing the entries to lie in a ring, rather than in a field. In that case if the non-zero entries are required to be [[unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring (invertible), one again obtains a group. On the other hand, if the non-zero entries are only required to be non-zero, but not necessarily invertible, this set of matrices forms a [[semigroup]] instead.

One may also schematically allow the non-zero entries to lie in a group ''G,'' with the understanding that matrix multiplication will only involve multiplying a single pair of group elements, not "adding" group elements. This is an [[abuse of notation]], since element of matrices being multiplied must allow multiplication and addition, but is suggestive notion for the (formally correct) abstract group &lt;math&gt;G \wr S_n&lt;/math&gt; (the wreath product of the group ''G'' by the symmetric group).

==Signed permutation group==
{{further|Hyperoctahedral group}}
A '''signed permutation matrix''' is a generalized permutation matrix whose nonzero entries are ±1, and are the integer generalized permutation matrices with integer inverse.

===Properties===
* It is the [[Coxeter group]] &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;, and has order &lt;math&gt;2^nn!&lt;/math&gt;.
* It is the symmetry group of the [[hypercube]] and (dually) of the [[cross-polytope]].
* Its index 2 subgroup of matrices with determinant 1 is the Coxeter group &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; and is the symmetry group of the [[demihypercube]].
* It is a subgroup of the [[orthogonal group]].

==Applications==

===Monomial representations===
{{main|Monomial representation}}
Monomial matrices occur in [[representation theory]] in the context of [[monomial representation]]s. A monomial representation of a group ''G'' is a linear representation ''&amp;rho;'' : ''G'' → GL(''n'', ''F'') of ''G'' (here ''F'' is the defining field of the representation) such that the image ''&amp;rho;''(''G'')  is a subgroup of the group of monomial matrices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">In algebraic geometry, the '''Grassmann ''d''-plane bundle''' of a vector bundle ''E'' on an [[algebraic scheme]] ''X'' is a scheme over ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;p: G_d(E) \to X&lt;/math&gt;
such that the fiber &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(x) = G_d(E_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grassmannian]] of the ''d''-dimensional vector subspaces of &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;G_1(E) = \mathbb{P}(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[projective bundle]] of ''E''. In the other direction, a Grassmann bundle is a special case of a (partial) [[flag bundle]]. Concretely, the Grassmann bundle can be constructed as a [[Quot scheme]].

Like the usual Grassmannian, the Grassmann bundle comes with natural vector bundles on it; namely, there are universal or [[tautological subbundle]] ''S'' and universal quotient bundle ''Q'' that fit into
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to S \to p^*E \to Q \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Specifically, if ''V'' is in the fiber ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), then the fiber of ''S'' over ''V'' is ''V'' itself; thus, ''S'' has rank ''r'' = rk(''E'') and &lt;math&gt;\wedge^r S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant line bundle]]. Now, by the universal property of a projective bundle, the injection &lt;math&gt;\wedge^r S \to p^* (\wedge^r E)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the morphism over ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_d(E) \to \mathbb{P}(\wedge^r E)&lt;/math&gt;,
which is nothing but a family of [[Plücker embedding]]s.

The [[relative tangent bundle]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'')/''X''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulton|loc=Appendix B.5.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{G_d(E)/X} = \operatorname{Hom}(S, Q) = S^{\vee} \otimes Q,&lt;/math&gt;
which morally is given by the [[second fundamental form]]. In the case ''d'' = 1, it is given as follows: if ''V'' is a finite-dimensional vector space, then for each line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in ''V'' passing through the origin (a point of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(V)&lt;/math&gt;), there is the natural identification (see [[Chern class#Complex projective space]] for example):
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(l, V/l) = T_l \mathbb{P}(V)&lt;/math&gt;
and the above is the family-version of this identification. (The general care is a generalization of this.)

In the case ''d'' = 1, the early exact sequence tensored with the dual of ''S'' = ''O''(-1) gives:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(E)} \to p^* E \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(E)}(1) \to T_{\mathbb{P}(E)/X} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the relative version of the [[Euler sequence]].

== Description ==
{{stub section|date=May 2015}}
{{further|Invertible matrix#Blockwise inversion|Block matrix#Inversion}}
{{see also|Fast Kalman Filter#Description}}

== Limitations ==
The HWB solution is very fast to compute but it is optimal only if observational errors do not correlate between the data blocks. The [[generalized canonical correlation]] analysis (gCCA) is the statistical method of choice for making those harmful cross-covariances vanish. This may, however, become quite tedious depending on the nature of the problem.

== Applications ==
The HWB method is critical to satellite geodesy and similar large problems.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The HWB method can be extended to [[fast Kalman filter]]ing (FKF) by augmenting its [[linear regression]] equation system to take into account information from numerical forecasts, physical constraints and other ancillary data sources that are available in realtime. Operational accuracies can then be computed reliably from the theory of minimum-norm quadratic unbiased estimation ([[Minque]]) of [[C. R. Rao]].

House|others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek mystic, philosopher and mathematician.

Aside from Iamblichus' own philosophical contribution, his ''Protrepticus'' is of importance for the study of the [[Sophists]], owing to its preservation of approximately ten pages of an otherwise unknown Sophist known as the '''Anonymus Iamblichi'''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Cassin, 'Anonymus Iamblichi', in [[Brill's New Pauly]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Iamblichus' life==
Iamblichus was the chief representative of [[Syria]]n [[Neoplatonism]],&lt;ref name=ShawShaw1971/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, Charles. ''Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern'' (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; though his influence spread over much of the ancient world.  The events of his life and his religious beliefs are not entirely known, but the main tenets of his beliefs can be worked out from his extant writings.  According to the [[Suda]], and his biographer [[Eunapius]], he was born at [[Chalcis (Syria)|Chalcis]] (modern [[Qinnasrin]]) in [[Syria]].  He was the son of a rich and illustrious family, and he is said to have been the descendant of several priest-kings of the [[Arab]] [[Royal family of Emesa]].  He initially studied under [[Anatolius of Laodicea]], and later went on to study under [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], a pupil of [[Plotinus]], the founder of Neoplatonism. He disagreed with Porphyry over the practice of [[theurgy]]; Iamblichus responds to Porphyry's criticisms of theurgy in a book attributed to him, ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum]]'' (''On the Egyptian Mysteries'').

Around 304, he returned to Syria to found his own school at [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] (near [[Antioch]]), a city famous for its Neoplatonic philosophers. Here he designed a curriculum for studying Plato and Aristotle, and he wrote commentaries on the two that survive only in fragments.  Still, for Iamblichus, Pythagoras was the supreme authority. He is known to have written the ''Collection of Pythagorean Doctrines'', which, in ten books, comprised extracts from several ancient philosophers.  Only the first four books, and fragments of the fifth, survive{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Scholars noted that the ''Exhortation to Philosophy of Iamblichus'' was composed in Apamea in the early 4th c. AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2014/04/introduction-to-iamblichus-exhortation.html|title=Introduction to Iamblichus' Exhortation to Philosophy (upcoming talk)|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iamblichus was said to have been a man of great culture and learning. He was also renowned for his charity and self-denial.  Many students gathered around him, and he lived with them in genial friendship. According to [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]], he died during the reign of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], sometime before 333.

Only a fraction of Iamblichus' books have survived. For our knowledge of his system, we are indebted partly to the fragments of writings preserved by [[Stobaeus]] and others.  The notes of his successors, especially [[Proclus]], as well as his five extant books and the sections of his great work on Pythagorean philosophy also reveal much of Iamblichus' system. Besides these, Proclus seems to have ascribed to him the authorship of the celebrated treatise ''Theurgia'', or ''On the Egyptian Mysteries''. However, the differences between this book and Iamblichus' other works in style and in some points of doctrine have led some to question whether Iamblichus was the actual author.  Still, the treatise certainly originated from his school, and in its systematic attempt to give a speculative justification of the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] cult practices of the day, it marks a turning-point in the history of thought where Iamblichus stood.

As a speculative theory, Neoplatonism had received its highest development from [[Plotinus]]. The modifications introduced by lamblichus were the detailed elaboration of its formal divisions, the more systematic application of the Pythagorean number-symbolism, and, under the influence of Oriental systems, a thoroughly mythical interpretation of what Neoplatonism had formerly regarded as notional. Unlike Plotinus who broke from Platonic tradition and asserted an undescended soul, Iamblichus re-affirmed the soul's embodiment in matter, believing matter to be as divine as the rest of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Gregory, ‘Neoplatonism I: Antiquity’, in Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism, ed. by Wouter J. Hanegraff (Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 834-835&lt;/ref&gt; It is most likely on this account that lamblichus was venerated.

Iamblichus was highly praised by those who followed his thought.  By his contemporaries, Iamblichus was accredited with [[Miracle|miraculous]] powers.  The Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], not content with Eunapius' more modest eulogy that he was inferior to Porphyry only in style, regarded Iamblichus as more than second to Plato, and claimed he would give all the gold of [[Lydia]] for one epistle of Iamblichus. During the revival of interest in his philosophy in the 15th and 16th centuries, the name of Iamblichus was scarcely mentioned without the epithet "divine" or "most divine".

==Iamblichus' cosmology==
At the head of his system, Iamblichus placed the transcendent incommunicable "One", the ''[[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]'', whose first principle is intellect, ''[[nous]]''.  Immediately after the absolute One, lamblichus introduced a second superexistent "One" to stand between it and 'the many' as the producer of intellect, or soul, ''psyche''.  This is the initial ''dyad''.  The first and highest One (''nous''), which Plotinus represented under the three stages of (objective) being, (subjective) life, and (realized) intellect, is distinguished by Iamblichus into spheres of intelligible and intellective, the latter sphere being the domain of thought, the former of the objects of thought. These three entities, the ''psyche'', and the ''nous'' split into the intelligible and the intellective, form a ''triad''.

Between the two worlds, at once separating and uniting them, some scholars think there was inserted by lamblichus, as was afterwards by [[Proclus]], a third sphere partaking of the nature of both.  But this supposition depends on a merely conjectural emendation of the text. We read, however, that in the intellectual triad he assigned the third rank to the [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara', Dominic J. ''Pythagoras Revived: Mathematics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Demiurge, the Platonic creator-god, is thus identified with the perfected ''[[nous]]'', the intellectual triad being increased to a ''[[hebdomad (disambiguation)|hebdomad]]''.  The identification of ''nous'' with the Demiurge is a significant moment in the Neoplatonic tradition and its adoption into and development within the [[Christian tradition]].  [[St. Augustine]] follows Plotinus by identifying ''nous'', which bears the ''logos'', with the creative principle.  Whereas the Hellenes call that principle the Demiurge, Augustine identifies the activity and content of that principle as belonging to one of the three aspects of the [[Divine Trinity]]—the Son, who is the Word (''logos'').  Iamblichus and Plotinus commonly assert that ''nous'' produced nature by mediation of the intellect, so here the intelligible gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.

The first of these "psychic gods" is incommunicable and supramundane, while the other two seem to be mundane, though rational. In the third class, or mundane gods, there is a still greater wealth of divinities, of various local position, function, and rank. Iamblichus wrote of gods, angels, demons and heroes, of twelve heavenly gods whose number is increased to thirty-six or three hundred and sixty, and of seventy-two other gods proceeding from them, of twenty-one chiefs and forty-two nature-gods, besides guardian divinities, of particular individuals and nations.  The realm of divinities stretched from the original One down to material nature itself, where soul in fact descended into matter and became "embodied" as human beings.  Basically, Iamblichus greatly multiplied the ranks of being and divine entities in the universe, the number at each level relating to various mathematical proportions.  The world is thus peopled by a crowd of superhuman beings influencing natural events and possessing and communicating knowledge of the future, and who are all accessible to prayers and offerings.

The whole of Iamblichus's complex theory is ruled by a [[mathematics|mathematical]] formalism of triad, hebdomad, etc., while the first principle is identified with the monad, dyad and triad; symbolic meanings being also assigned to the other numbers. The theorems of mathematics, he says, apply absolutely to all things, from things divine to original matter.  But though he subjects all things to number, he holds elsewhere that numbers are independent existences, and occupy a middle place between the limited and unlimited.

Another difficulty of the system is the account given of nature. It is said to be bound by the indissoluble chains of necessity called [[destiny|fate]], and is distinguished from divine things that are not subject to fate. Yet, being itself the result of higher powers becoming corporeal, a continual stream of elevating influence flows from them to it, interfering with its necessary laws and turning to good ends the imperfect and [[evil]]. Of evil no satisfactory account is given; it is said to have been generated accidentally in the conflict between the finite and the [[Infinity|infinite]].

The "'''Instant Insanity'''" puzzle consists of four cubes with faces colored with four colors (commonly red, blue, green, and white). The objective of the puzzle is to stack these cubes in a column so that each side (front, back, left, and right) of the stack shows each of the four colors. The distribution of colors on each cube is unique.

This problem has a [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] solution in which a graph with four vertices labeled B, G, R, W (for blue, green, red, and white) can be used to represent each cube; there is an edge between two vertices if the two colors are on the opposite sides of the cube, and a loop at a vertex if the opposite sides have the same color. Trial and error is a slow way to solve this problem, as there are 41,472 possible arrangements of the four cubes, and only 8 of these give a valid solution.

Every position of Instant Insanity can be solved in eight moves or less.&lt;ref&gt;https://habrahabr.ru/post/336858/{{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puzzle was created by Franz Owen Armbruster, also known as [[Frank Armbruster]], and published by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1967. Over 12 million puzzles were sold. The puzzle is [[isomorphic]] to numerous older puzzles, among them the ''Katzenjammer'' puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Slocum|last2=Botermans|title=Puzzles Old &amp; New|year=1986|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~stegmann/pattern.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022103557/http://home.comcast.net/~stegmann/pattern.htm |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; patented&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 646,463&lt;/ref&gt; by Frederick A. Schossow in 1900, and ''The Great Tantalizer'' (circa 1940, and the most popular name prior to ''Instant Insanity'').

The puzzle is currently being marketed by [[Winning Moves]].

==Solution==
{{original research|date=January 2018}}
Given the already colored cubes and the four distinct colors are (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), we will try to generate a graph which gives a clear picture of all the positions of colors in all the cubes. The resultant graph will contain four vertices one for each color and we will number each edge from one through four (one number for each cube). If an edge connects two vertices (Red and Green) and the number of the edge is three, then it means that the third cube has Red and Green faces opposite to each other.

[[File:Instant insanity Cube.png|thumb|center|Four cubes and their colors]]

[[File:Instant sanity graph.png|thumb|center|The graph generated by the four cubes]]

To find a solution to this problem we need the arrangement of four faces of each of the cubes. To represent the information of two opposite faces of all the four cubes we need a directed subgraph instead of an undirected one because two directions can only represent two opposite faces, but not whether a face should be at the front or at the back.

So if we have two directed subgraphs, we can actually represent all the four faces (which matter) of all the four cubes.
* First directed graph will represent the front and rear faces.
* Second directed graph will represent the left and right faces. 

'''We cannot randomly select any two subgraphs - so what are the criteria for selecting?''' 

We need to choose graphs such that:
# the two subgraphs have no edges in common, because if there is an edge which is common that means at least one cube has the pair of opposite faces of exactly same color. Meaning: A cube has Red and Blue as front and rear face as well as left and right face.
# a subgraph contains only one edge from each cube, because the sub graph has to account for all the cubes and one edge can completely represent a pair of opposite faces.
# a subgraph can contain only vertices of degree two, because a degree of two means a color can only be present at faces of two cubes. Easy way to understand is that there are eight faces to be equally divided into four colors. So, two per color.

After understanding these restrictions if we try to derive the two sub graphs, we may end up with one possible set as shown in Image 3. Each edge color represents a cube.
[[File:Instant insanity final.png|thumb|The images are steps to solve the instant insanity problem]]

From the first sub graph we will derive the front and the rear face colors of the corresponding cube. For e.g.:
# The black arrow from Yellow to Blue says that the first cube will have Yellow in the front face and Blue at the Rear.
# The blue arrow from Green to Yellow says that the second cube will have Green in the front face and Yellow at the Rear.
# The orange arrow from Blue to Red says that the third cube will have Blue in the front face and Red at the Rear.
# The purple arrow from Red to Green says that the fourth cube will have Red in the front face and Green at the Rear.

From the second sub graph we will derive the left and the right face colors of the corresponding cube. For e.g.:
# The black arrow from Red to Green says that the first cube will have Red in the left face and Green at the Right.
# The blue arrow from Blue to Red says that the second cube will have Blue in the left face and Red at the Right.
# The orange arrow from Yellow to Blue says that the third cube will have Yellow in the left face and Blue  at the Right.
# The purple arrow from Green to Yellow says that the fourth cube will have Green in the left face and Yellow at the Right.

The third image shows the derived stack of cube which is the solution to the problem.

It is important to note that:
# You can arbitrarily label the cubes as one such solution will render 23 more by swapping the positions of the cubes but not changing their configurations.
# The two directed subgraphs can represent front-to-back, and left-to-right interchangeably, i.e. one of them can represent front-to-rear '''or''' left-to-right. This is because one such solution also render 3 more just by rotating. Adding the effect in 1., we generate 95 more solutions by providing only one. To put it into perspective, such four cubes can generate 24&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × 3 = 41472 configurations.
# It is '''not''' important to take notice of the top and the bottom of the stack of cubes.

==Generalizations==

Given n cubes, with the faces of each cube coloured with one of n colours, determining if it's possible to stack the cubes so that each colour appears exactly once on each of the 4 sides of the stack is [[NP-complete]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=M. R.|last1=Garey|first2=D. S.|last2=Johnson|title=Computers and Intractibility: a guide to the theory of NP-completeness|publisher=W.H. Freeman|year=1979|pages=258}} (problem GP15);&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=E.|last1=Robertson|first2=I.|last2=Munro|title=NP-completeness, puzzles, and games|journal=Util.

The '''cube stacking game''' is a two-player game version of this puzzle. Given an ordered list of cubes, the players take turns adding the next cube to the top of a growing stack of cubes. The loser is the first player to add a cube that causes one of the four sides of the stack to have a color repeated more than once. Robertson and Munro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Edward|last2=Munro|first2=Ian|title=NP-completeness, puzzles and games|journal=Utilitas Mathematica|date=1978|volume=13|pages=99–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that this game is [[PSPACE-complete]], which illustrates the observation that NP-complete puzzles tend to lead to PSPACE-complete games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18509">In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the '''linear canonical transformation''' ('''LCT''') is a family of [[integral transform]]s that generalizes many classical transforms. It has 4 parameters and 1 constraint, so it is a 3-dimensional family, and can be visualized as the action of the [[special linear group]] [[SL2(R)|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')]] on the [[Time–frequency representation|time–frequency plane]] (domain).

The LCT generalizes the [[Fourier transform|Fourier]], [[fractional Fourier transform|fractional Fourier]], [[Laplace transform|Laplace]], [[Weierstrass transform|Gauss–Weierstrass]], [[Segal–Bargmann space#The Segal–Bargmann transform|Bargmann]] and the [[Fresnel transform|Fresnel]] transforms as particular cases. The name "linear canonical transformation" is from [[canonical transformation]], a map that preserves the symplectic structure, as SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') can also be interpreted as the [[symplectic group]] Sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus LCTs are the linear maps of the time–frequency domain which preserve the [[symplectic form]].

The basic properties of the properties of  the  transformations mention above, such as scaling, shift, coordinate multiplication  are considered.  Any linear canonical transformation is related to affine transformations in phase space, defined by time-frequency or position-momentum coordinates.

==Definition==
The LCT can be represented in several ways; most easily,&lt;ref&gt;de Bruijn, N. G. (1973). "A theory of generalized functions, with applications to Wigner distribution and Weyl correspondence",  ''Nieuw Arch. Wiskd.'', '''III. Ser., 21'''  205-280.&lt;/ref&gt; it can be parameterized by a 2×2 matrix with determinant 1, i.e., an element of the [[special linear group]] SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''). Then for any such matrix &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a &amp; b\\c &amp; d\end{smallmatrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt; with ''ad''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''bc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the corresponding [[integral transform]] from a function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X(u)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;X_{(a,b,c,d)}(u) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{ib}} \cdot e^{i  \pi \frac{d}{b} u^{2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-i 2 \pi \frac{1}{b} ut}e^{i  \pi \frac{a}{b} t^2} x(t) \; dt \, , &lt;/math&gt; {{pad|3em}} || when ''b''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;X_{(a,0,c,d)}(u) = \sqrt{d} \cdot e^{i  \pi cdu^{2}} x(du) \, ,&lt;/math&gt; || when ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
|}

==Special cases==
Many classical transforms are special cases of the linear canonical transform:

* The [[Fourier transform]] corresponds to rotation by 90°, represented by the matrix:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  0  &amp; 1 \\
  -1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[fractional Fourier transform]] corresponds to rotation by an arbitrary angle; they are the [[SL2(R)#Elliptic_elements|elliptic elements]] of SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), represented by the matrices:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  \cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta \\
 -\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[Fresnel transform]] corresponds to shearing, and are a family of [[SL2(R)#Parabolic_elements|parabolic elements]], represented by the matrices:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1  &amp; \lambda z \\
  0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''z'' is distance and ''λ'' is wave length.

* The [[Laplace transform]] corresponds to rotation by 90° into the complex domain, and can be represented by the matrix:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; i \\
  i &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[Fractional Laplace transform]] corresponds to rotation by an arbitrary angle into the complex domain, and can be represented by the matrix:&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Deshmukh &amp; A.S. Gudadhe (2011) Convolution structure for two version of fractional Laplace transform. Journal of Science and Arts, 2(15):143-150. {{cite web |url=http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/display/1140726 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223133921/http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/display/1140726 |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  i \cos \theta &amp; i \sin \theta \\
  i \sin \theta &amp; -i \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Composition==
Composition of LCTs corresponds to multiplication of the corresponding matrices; this is also known as the "additivity property of the [[Wigner distribution function|WDF]]".

In detail, if the LCT is denoted by ''O&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(a,b,c,d)&lt;/sup&gt;'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;X_{(a,b,c,d)}(u) = O_F^{(a,b,c,d)}[x(t)] \, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;O_F^{(a2,b2,c2,d2)} \left \{ O_F^{(a1,b1,c1,d1)}[x(t)] \right \} = O_F^{(a3,b3,c3,d3)}[x(t)] \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a3 &amp; b3 \\
  c3 &amp; d3
\end{bmatrix}
 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  a2  &amp; b2 \\
  c2 &amp; d2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  a1  &amp; b1 \\
  c1 &amp; d1
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If  &lt;math&gt;W_{X(a,b,c,d)}(u,v)  &lt;/math&gt;is the &lt;math&gt;X_{(a,b,c,d)}(u)  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X_{(a,b,c,d)}(u)  &lt;/math&gt;is the LCT of &lt;math&gt;x(t) &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} W_{X(a,b,c,d)}(u,v) = W_{x}(du-bv,-cu+av) \\ W_{X(a,b,c,d)}(au+bv,cu+dv) = W_{x}(u,v) \end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;

LCT is equal to the twisting operation for the WDF and the Cohen's class distribution also has the twisting operation.

We can freely use the LCT to transform the parallelogram whose center is at (0,0) to another parallelogram which has the same same area and the same center
[[File:Transform.png|thumb|alt=|none]]

From this picture we know that the point (-1,2) transform to the point (0,1) and the point (1,2) transform to the point (4,3). As the result, we can write down the equations below

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} -a + 2b = 0 \\ -c + 2d = 1  \end{cases} \,and \, \begin{cases} a + 2b = 4 \\ c + 2d = 3  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

we can solve the equations and get (a,b,c,d) is equal to (2,1,1,1)

== Relation ==
From the following picture, we summarize the LCT with other transform or properties[[File:LCT Relation.png|thumb|alt=|none]]

==In optics and quantum mechanics==

[[Paraxial optical system]]s implemented entirely with [[thin lens]]es and propagation through free space and/or graded index (GRIN) media, are quadratic phase systems (QPS); these were known before Moshinsky and Quesne (1974) called attention to their significance in connection with canonical transformations in quantum mechanics.  The effect of any arbitrary QPS on an input wavefield can be described using the linear canonical transform, a particular case of which was developed by Segal (1963) and Bargmann (1961) in order to formalize Fock's (1928) boson calculus.&lt;ref&gt;K.B. Wolf (1979)  [http://www.fis.unam.mx/~bwolf/Book%27s/Integral%20Transforms/IX.pdf Ch. 9:Canonical transforms].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shown that linear canonical transformations in quantum theory can be defined as the linear transformations mixing the momentum and position operators and leaving invariant the [[Canonical commutation relation]]s &lt;ref&gt;Raoelina Andriambololona, R. T. Ranaivoson, H.D.E Randriamisy, R. Hanitriarivo (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Canonical transforms are used to analyze differential equations. These include [[diffusion]], the [[free particle|Schrödinger free particle]], the linear potential (free-fall), and the attractive and repulsive oscillator equations. It also includes a few others such as the [[Fokker–Planck equation]]. Although this class is far from universal, the ease with which solutions and properties are found makes canonical transforms an attractive tool for problems such as these.&lt;ref&gt;K.B. Wolf (1979) Ch. [http://www.fis.unam.mx/~bwolf/Book%27s/Integral%20Transforms/IX.pdf 9] &amp; [http://www.fis.unam.mx/~bwolf/Book%27s/Integral%20Transforms/X.pdf 10].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wave propagation through air, a lens, and between satellite dishes are discussed here. All of the computations can be reduced to 2×2 matrix algebra. This is the spirit of LCT.

===Electromagnetic wave propagation===
[[Image:TFA LCT fresnel.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

&lt;!--  ARRRGH so many different i's and j's , so confusing --&gt;

Assuming the system looks like as depicted in the figure, the wave travels from plane ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the plane of ''x'' and ''y''.
The [[Fresnel transform]] is used to describe electromagnetic wave propagation in air:

:&lt;math&gt; U_0(x,y) = - \frac{j}{\lambda} \frac{e^{jkz}}{z} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{j \frac{k}{2z}  [ (x-x_i)^2 +(y-y_i)^2 ] } U_i(x_i,y_i) \; dx_i\; dy_i, &lt;/math&gt;

with

:{|
|-
| ''k'' = 2 ''π'' / ''λ'' {{pad|1em}} || : [[wave number]]; 
|-
| ''λ'' || : [[wavelength]];
|-
| ''z'' || : distance of propagation;
|-
| ''j'' || : imaginary unit.
|}

This is equivalent to LCT (shearing), when

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d 
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; \lambda z \\
  0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

When the travel distance (''z'') is larger, the shearing effect is larger.

===Spherical lens===

[[Image:TFA LCT lens.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

With the lens as depicted in the figure, and the refractive index denoted as ''n'', the result is:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Introduction to Fourier optics | first=Joseph W. | last=Goodman | edition=3rd | publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers | year=2005 | isbn=0-9747077-2-4 }}, §5.1.3, pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U_0(x,y) = e^{jkn \Delta} e^{-j \frac{k}{2f} [x^2 + y ^2]} U_i(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;

with ''f'' the focal length and ''Δ'' the thickness of the lens.

The distortion passing through the lens is similar to LCT, when

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d 
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda f} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is also a shearing effect: when the focal length is smaller, the shearing effect is larger.

===Spherical Mirror===

[[Image:TFA LCT disk.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

The spherical mirror—e.g., a satellite dish—can be described as a LCT, with

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d 
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda R} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is very similar to lens, except focal length is replaced by the radius of the dish. Therefore, if the radius is smaller, the shearing effect is larger.

=== Joint Free space and Spherical lens ===
[[File:Joint Free space and spherical lens.png|none|thumb]]
The relation between the input and output we can use LCT to represent

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \lambda z_2 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1/\lambda f \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \lambda z_1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 1-z_2/f &amp; \lambda (z_1+z_2)-\lambda z_1z_2/f\\ -1/\lambda f &amp; 1-z_1/f \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

(1) If z1 = z2 = 2f, it is reverse real image

(2) If z1 = z2 = f, it is fourier transform+scaling

(3) if z1=z2, it is fractional fourier transform+scaling

== Basic Properties ==

==Example==
[[Image:TFA LCT dish2.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

The system considered is depicted in the figure to the right: two dishes – one being the emitter and the other one the receiver – and a signal travelling between them over a distance ''D''.
First, for dish A (emitter), the LCT matrix looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda R_A} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for dish B (receiver), the LCT matrix similarly becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda R_B} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Last, for the propagation of the signal in air, the LCT matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; \lambda D \\
  0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Putting all three components together, the LCT of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda R_B} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; \lambda D \\
  0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\
  \frac{-1}{\lambda R_A} &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1-\frac{D}{R_A} &amp; - \lambda D \\
  \frac{1}{\lambda} (R_A^{-1} + R_B^{-1} - R_A^{-1}R_B^{-1}D)  &amp; 1 - \frac{D}{R_B} 
\end{bmatrix}
\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation with Particle physics==

It was shown that a relation can be established between properties of the elementary [[Fermion]] in the [[Standard Model]] of [[Particle physics]] and [[Spin representation]] of some particular linear canonical transformations.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Ranaivoson, Raoelina Andriambololona, R. Hanitriarivo (2018). https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07228&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the [[Electric charge]], [[Weak hypercharge]] and [[Weak isospin]] of the particles are expressed as linear combinations of some operators defined from the generators of the [[Clifford algebra]] corresponding to the spinorial representation of linear canonical transformations.

This page lists some important classes of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] used in [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. A '''matrix''' (plural matrices, or less commonly matrixes) is a rectangular [[Array data structure|array]] of [[number]]s called ''entries''. Matrices have a long history of both study and application, leading to diverse ways of classifying matrices. A first group is matrices satisfying concrete conditions of the entries, including constant matrices. An important example is the [[identity matrix]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;
I_n = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further ways of classifying matrices are according to their [[eigenvalue]]s or by imposing conditions on the [[matrix product|product]] of the matrix with other matrices.  Finally, many domains, both in mathematics and other sciences including [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] have particular matrices that are applied chiefly in these areas.

==Matrices with explicitly constrained entries==
The following lists matrices whose entries are subject to certain conditions. Many of them apply to ''square matrices'' only, that is matrices with the same number of columns and rows. The [[main diagonal]] of a square matrix is the [[diagonal]] joining the upper left corner and the lower right one or equivalently the entries ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The other diagonal is called anti-diagonal (or counter-diagonal).

==Matrices satisfying conditions on products or inverses==
A number of matrix-related notions is about properties of products or inverses of the given matrix. The [[matrix product]] of a ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' and a ''n''-by-''k'' matrix ''B'' is the ''m''-by-''k'' matrix ''C'' given by
:&lt;math&gt; (C)_{i,j} = \sum_{r=1}^n A_{i,r}B_{r,j}.&lt;/math&gt;
This matrix product is denoted ''AB''. Unlike the product of numbers, matrix products are not [[commutative]], that is to say ''AB'' need not be equal to ''BA''. A number of notions are concerned with the failure of this commutativity. An [[inverse of a matrix|inverse]] of square matrix ''A'' is a matrix ''B'' (necessarily of the same dimension as ''A'') such that ''AB'' = ''I''. Equivalently, ''BA'' = ''I''. An inverse need not exist. If it exists, ''B'' is uniquely determined, and is also called ''the'' inverse of ''A'', denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Various types of [[Stability theory|stability]] may be discussed for the solutions of [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s describing [[dynamical system]]s. The most important type is that concerning the stability of solutions near to a point of equilibrium. This may be discussed by the theory of Lyapunov. In simple terms,  if the solutions that start out near an equilibrium point &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; stay near &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; forever, then &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; is '''Lyapunov stable'''.  More strongly, if &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; is Lyapunov stable and all solutions that start out near &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; converge to &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; is [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotically stable]]. The notion of '''exponential stability''' guarantees a minimal rate of decay, i.e., an estimate of how quickly the solutions converge. The idea of Lyapunov stability can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds, where it is known as [[structural stability]], which concerns the behavior of different but "nearby" solutions to differential equations. [[Input-to-state stability]] (ISS) applies Lyapunov notions to systems with inputs.

==History==
Lyapunov stability is named after [[ Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov]], a Russian mathematician who defended the thesis ''The General Problem of Stability of Motion'' at Moscow University in 1892.&lt;ref name=lyapunov&gt;[[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov, A. M.]] ''The General Problem of the Stability of Motion'' (In Russian), Doctoral dissertation, Univ. Kharkov 1892 English translations: (1) ''Stability of Motion'', Academic Press, New-York &amp; London, 1966 (2) ''The General Problem of the Stability of Motion'', (A. T. Fuller trans.) Taylor &amp; Francis, London 1992. Included is a biography by Smirnov and an extensive bibliography of Lyapunov's work.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Lyapunov was a pioneer in successful endeavoring to develop the global approach to the analysis of the stability of nonlinear dynamical systems by comparison with the widely spread local method of linearizing them about points of equilibrium. His work, initially published in Russian and then translated to French, received little attention for many years. The mathematical theory of stability of motion, founded by A. M. Lyapunov, considerably anticipated the time for its implementation in science and technology. Moreover Lyapunov did not himself make application in this field, his own interest being in the stability of rotating fluid masses with astronomical application. He did not have doctoral students who followed the research in the field of stability and his own destiny was terribly tragic because of the Russian revolution of 1917. For several decades the theory of stability sank into complete oblivion.  The Russian-Soviet mathematician and mechanician [[Nikolay Gur'yevich Chetaev]] working at the Kazan Aviation Institute in the 1930s was the first who realized the incredible magnitude of the discovery made by A. M. Lyapunov. Actually, his figure as a great scientist is comparable to the one of A. M. Lyapunov. The contribution to the theory made by N. G. Chetaev&lt;ref&gt;Chetaev, N. G. The Stability of Motion - Translated by Morton Nadler, Oxford, 1961, 200 pages. Originally published in Russian in 1946 by ОГИЗ. Гос. изд-во технико-теорет. лит., Москва-Ленинград.&lt;/ref&gt; was so significant that many mathematicians, physicists and engineers consider him Lyapunov’s direct successor and the next-in-line scientific descendant in the creation and development of the mathematical theory of stability. 

The interest in it suddenly skyrocketed during the [[Cold War (1953–62)|Cold War]] period when the so-called "Second Method of Lyapunov" (see below) was found to be applicable to the stability of aerospace [[guidance system]]s which typically contain strong nonlinearities not treatable by other methods. A large number of publications appeared then and since in the control and systems literature.&lt;ref name=letov&gt;{{cite book |last=Letov |first=A.

More recently the concept of the [[Lyapunov exponent]] (related to Lyapunov's First Method of discussing stability) has received wide interest in connection with [[chaos theory]]. Lyapunov stability methods have also been applied to finding equilibrium solutions in traffic assignment problems.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=M.

==Definition for continuous-time systems==
Consider an autonomous nonlinear dynamical system

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x(t)), \;\;\;\; x(0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;x(t) \in \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[State space representation|system state vector]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; an open set containing the origin, and &lt;math&gt;f: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; continuous on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has an equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; f(x_e)=0 &lt;/math&gt;  then

# This equilibrium is said to be '''Lyapunov stable''', if, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that, if &lt;math&gt;\|x(0)-x_e\| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, then for every &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\|x(t)-x_e\| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
# The equilibrium of the above system is said to be '''asymptotically stable''' if it is Lyapunov stable and there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\|x(0)-x_e \|&lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \|x(t)-x_e\| = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# The equilibrium of the above system is said to be '''exponentially stable''' if it is asymptotically stable and there exist &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0, \beta &gt;0, \delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\|x(0)-x_e\| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\|x(t)-x_e\| \leq \alpha\|x(0)-x_e\|e^{-\beta t}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Conceptually, the meanings of the above terms are the following:
# Lyapunov stability of an equilibrium means that solutions starting "close enough" to the equilibrium (within a distance &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; from it) remain "close enough" forever (within a distance &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; from it). Note that this must be true for ''any'' &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; that one may want to choose.
# Asymptotic stability means that solutions that start close enough not only remain close enough but also eventually converge to the equilibrium.
# Exponential stability means that solutions not only converge, but in fact converge faster than or at least as fast as a particular known rate &lt;math&gt;\alpha\|x(0)-x_e\|e^{-\beta t}&lt;/math&gt;.

The trajectory ''x'' is (locally) ''attractive'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\|y(t)-x(t)\| \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[State space representation|system output]]) for &lt;math&gt; t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; for all trajectories that start close enough, and ''globally attractive'' if this property holds for all trajectories.

That is, if ''x'' belongs to the interior of its [[stable manifold]], it is ''asymptotically stable'' if it is both attractive and stable.  (There are examples showing that attractivity does not imply asymptotic stability.  Such examples are easy to create using [[homoclinic orbit|homoclinic connections]].)

If the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the dynamical system at an equilibrium happens to be a [[Hurwitz matrix#Hurwitz stable matrices|stability matrix]] (i.e., if the real part of each eigenvalue is strictly negative), then the equilibrium is asymptotically stable.

===Lyapunov's second method for stability===
Lyapunov, in his original 1892 work, proposed two methods for demonstrating stability.&lt;ref name=lyapunov/&gt; The first method developed the solution in a series which was then proved convergent within limits. The second method, which is now referred to as the Lyapunov stability criterion, makes use of a ''Lyapunov function V(x)'' which has an analogy to the potential function of classical dynamics. It is introduced as follows for a system &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; having a point of equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a function &lt;math&gt;V(x) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;V(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;V(x)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x) = \frac{d}{dt}V(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}f_i(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt; for all values of &lt;math&gt;x\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; . Note: for asymptotic stability, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is required .
Then ''V(x)'' is called a [[Lyapunov function]] candidate and the system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov (Note that &lt;math&gt;V(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; is required; otherwise for example &lt;math&gt;V(x) = 1/(1+|x|)&lt;/math&gt; would "prove" that &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t) = x&lt;/math&gt; is locally stable). An additional condition called "properness" or "radial unboundedness" is required in order to conclude global stability. Global asymptotic stability (GAS) follows similarly.

It is easier to visualize this method of analysis by thinking of a physical system (e.g. vibrating spring and mass) and considering the [[energy]] of such a system. If the system loses energy over time and the energy is never restored then eventually the system must grind to a stop and reach some final resting state. This final state is called the [[attractor]]. However, finding a function that gives the precise energy of a physical system can be difficult, and for abstract mathematical systems, economic systems or biological systems, the concept of energy may not be applicable.

Lyapunov's realization was that stability can be proven without requiring knowledge of the true physical energy, provided a [[Lyapunov function]] can be found to satisfy the above constraints.

==Definition for discrete-time systems==
The definition for [[discrete-time]] systems is almost identical to that for continuous-time systems. The definition below provides this, using an alternate language commonly used in more mathematical texts.

Let (''X'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]] and ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' a [[continuous function]]. A point ''x'' in ''X'' is said to be '''Lyapunov stable''', if,

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon&gt;0 \  \exists \delta&gt;0 \  \forall y\in X \ \left [d(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow \forall n \in \mathbf{N} \  d\left (f^n(x),f^n(y) \right )&lt;\epsilon \right ].&lt;/math&gt;

We say that ''x'' is '''asymptotically stable''' if it belongs to the interior of its [[stable manifold|stable set]], ''i.e.'' if,

:&lt;math&gt; \exists \delta&gt;0 \left [ d(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow \lim_{n\to\infty} d \left(f^n(x),f^n(y) \right)=0\right ].&lt;/math&gt;

==Stability for linear state space models==
A linear [[State space (controls)|state space]] model

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}} = A\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; is a finite matrix, is asymptotically stable (in fact, [[Exponential stability|exponentially stable]]) if all real parts of the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; are negative.  This condition is equivalent to the following one:

:&lt;math&gt;A^{T}M + MA&lt;/math&gt;

is negative definite for some [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix &lt;math&gt;M = M^{T}&lt;/math&gt;. (The relevant Lyapunov function is &lt;math&gt;V(x) = x^TMx&lt;/math&gt;.)

Correspondingly, a time-discrete linear [[State space (controls)|state space]] model

:&lt;math&gt;{\textbf{x}_{t+1}} = A\textbf{x}_t&lt;/math&gt;

is asymptotically stable (in fact, exponentially stable) if all the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; have a modulus smaller than one.

This latter condition has been generalized to switched systems: a linear switched discrete time system (ruled by a set of matrices
&lt;math&gt;\{A_1, \dots, A_m\}&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;{\textbf{x}_{t+1}} = A_{i_t}\textbf{x}_t,\quad A_{i_t} \in \{A_1, \dots, A_m\}&lt;/math&gt;

is asymptotically stable (in fact, exponentially stable) if the [[joint spectral radius]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{A_1, \dots, A_m\}&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than one.

==Stability for systems with inputs==

A system with inputs (or controls) has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}} = \textbf{f(x,u)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the (generally time-dependent) input u(t) may be viewed as a ''control'', ''external input'',
''stimulus'', ''disturbance'', or ''forcing function''.  It has been shown &lt;ref&gt; Malkin I.G. On stability under constantly acting disturbances Prikl Mat 1944, vol. 8 no.3 241-245 (Russian); Amer. Math. Soc. transl. no. 8 &lt;/ref&gt; that near to a point of equilibrium which is Lyapunov stable the system remains stable under small disturbances.  For larger input disturbances the study of such systems is the subject of [[control theory]] and applied in [[control engineering]].  For systems with inputs, one must quantify the effect of inputs on the stability of the system.  The main two approaches to this analysis are [[BIBO stability]] (for [[linear system]]s) and [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS) (for [[nonlinear system]]s)

==Example==
Consider an equation, where compared to the [[Van der Pol oscillator]] equation the friction term is changed:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{y} + y -\varepsilon \left( \frac{\dot{y}^{3}}{3} - \dot{y}\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium is at: &lt;math&gt; \ddot{y} = y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here is a good example of an unsuccessful try to find a Lyapunov function that proves stability:

Let

:&lt;math&gt; x_{1} = y , x_{2} = \dot{y} &lt;/math&gt;

so that the corresponding system is

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} + \varepsilon \left( \frac{{x_{2}^{3}}}{3} - {x_{2}}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Let us choose as a Lyapunov function

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {1}{2} \left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly [[positive-definite function|positive definite]]. Its derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{V} = x_{1} \dot x_{1} + x_{2} \dot x_{2}
= x_{1} x_{2} - x_{1} x_{2}+\varepsilon
\frac{x_{2}^4}{3} - \varepsilon {x_{2}^2}
=   \varepsilon \frac{x_{2}^4}{3} -\varepsilon {x_{2}^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

It seems that if the parameter &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is positive, stability is asymptotic for &lt;math&gt; x_{2}^{2} &lt; 3.&lt;/math&gt; But this is wrong, since &lt;math&gt;  \dot{V} &lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and will be 0 everywhere on the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; axis. The system is Lyapunov stable.

==Barbalat's lemma and stability of time-varying systems==
Assume that f is function of time only.

* Having &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}(t) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; does not imply that &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; has a limit at &lt;math&gt;t\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(t)=\sin(\ln(t)),\; t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Having &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; approaching a limit as &lt;math&gt;t \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; does not imply that &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}(t) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(t)=\sin(t^2)/t,\; t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Having &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; lower bounded and decreasing (&lt;math&gt;\dot{f}\le 0&lt;/math&gt;) implies it converges to a limit. But it does not say whether or not &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Barbalat's [[Lemma (mathematics)|Lemma]] says:
:If &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; has a finite limit as &lt;math&gt;t \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous (or &lt;math&gt;\ddot{f}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded), then &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}(t) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The following example is taken from page 125 of Slotine and Li's book ''Applied Nonlinear Control''.

Consider a [[Non-autonomous system (mathematics)|non-autonomous system]]
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{e}=-e + g\cdot w(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{g}=-e \cdot w(t).&lt;/math&gt;

This is non-autonomous because the input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a function of time.  Assume that the input &lt;math&gt;w(t)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.

Taking &lt;math&gt;V=e^2+g^2&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}=-2e^2 \le 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This says that &lt;math&gt;V(t)\leq V(0)&lt;/math&gt; by first two conditions and hence &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are bounded. But it does not say anything about the convergence of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; to zero. Moreover, the invariant set theorem cannot be applied, because the dynamics is non-autonomous.

Using Barbalat's lemma:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{V}= -4e(-e+g\cdot w)&lt;/math&gt;.

This is bounded because &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are bounded. This implies &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;e \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. This proves that the error converges.

'''Named graphs''' are a key concept of [[Semantic Web]] architecture in which a set of [[Resource Description Framework]] statements (a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) are identified using a [[URI]],&lt;ref&gt;strictly speaking a URIRef&lt;/ref&gt; allowing descriptions to be made of that set of statements such as context, provenance information or other such [[metadata]].

Named graphs are a simple extension of the RDF data model&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/ "Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification"&lt;/ref&gt; through which graphs can be created but the model lacks an effective means of distinguishing between them once published on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] at large.

== Named graphs and HTTP ==

One conceptualization of the Web is as a graph of document nodes identified with URIs and connected by [[hyperlink]] arcs which are expressed within the [[HTML]] documents. By doing a [[HTTP]] GET on a URI (usually via a [[Web browser]]), a somehow-related document may be retrieved. This "follow your nose" approach also applies to RDF documents on the Web in the form of [[Linked Data]], where typically an RDF syntax is used to express data as a series of statements, and [[URI]]s within the RDF point to other resources. This Web of data has been described by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] as the "Giant Global Graph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215 Giant Global Graph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713021037/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215 |date=2016-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Named-graphs-2.jpg|thumb|300px|Describing a named graph]]

Named graphs are a formalization of the intuitive idea that the contents of an RDF document (a graph) on the Web can be considered to be named by the URI of the document. This considerably simplifies techniques for managing chains of provenance for pieces of data and enabling fine-grained access control to the source data. Additionally trust can be managed through the publisher applying a digital signature to the data in the named graph. (Support for these facilities was originally intended to come from RDF reification, however that approach proved problematic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Reify.html Reification of RDF and N3]&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Named graphs and RDF stores ==

While named graphs may appear on the Web as simple linked documents (i.e. [[Linked Data]]), they are also very useful for managing sets of RDF data within an RDF store. In particular, the scope of a [[SPARQL]] query may be limited to a specific set of named graphs.

=== Example ===

Assume the following ([[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]) RDF document has been placed in a [[SPARQL]]-capable store with the name '''{{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.org/joe&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}'''.

&lt;source lang="turtle"&gt;
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .

&lt;http://example.org/joe#me&gt; a foaf:Person .
&lt;http://example.org/joe#me&gt; foaf:homepage &lt;http://example.org/joe/index.html&gt; .
&lt;http://example.org/joe#me&gt; foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:joe@example.org&gt; .
&lt;http://example.org/joe#me&gt; foaf:name "Joe Lambda" .
&lt;/source&gt;

''This data has been written in a more verbose form than necessary to show the triple structures''

The homepage of the person with the email address '''{{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;mailto:joe@example.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' can be obtained using the [[SPARQL]] query:

&lt;source lang="sparql"&gt;
PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;

SELECT ?homepage

FROM NAMED &lt;http://example.org/joe&gt;

WHERE {
	GRAPH ?g {
		?person foaf:homepage ?homepage .
		?person foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:joe@example.org&gt; .
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''FROM NAMED''' here identifies the target graph for the query.

=== Named graphs and quads ===

Prior to the publication of the papers describing named graphs, there was considerable discussion about fulfilling their role within a store by using an [[arity]] above that of RDF triple statements: where ''triples'' have the form ''&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt;'', ''quads'' would have a form along the lines of ''&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;context&gt;''. Named graphs can be represented this way, as ''&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;graphname&gt;'', with the advantage that the ''&lt;graphname&gt;'' part will be a URI, giving the quad Web-global scope compared to arbitrary local statement names. This way of representing quads resp. quad-statements was incorporated in the specification of [[N-Quads]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==

A paper from the WWW 2005 conference by Carroll et al. includes a formal definition of named graphs.&lt;ref name="Carroll-1"&gt;[http://wwwconference.org/2005a/cdrom/docs/p613.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications ==

There is currently no specification for named graphs in themselves beyond that described in Carroll et al. (2005)&lt;ref name="Carroll-1" /&gt; and Carroll and Stickler (2004)&lt;ref name="Carroll-2"&gt;[http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-56.pdf TriX : RDF Triples in XML]&lt;/ref&gt; (which includes syntaxes for representing named graphs), but they do form part of the [[SPARQL]] Protocol and RDF Query Language specification.

== Proposed specifications ==

* [[TriX (syntax)|TriX]] - Named Graphs in [[XML]]
* [[TriG (syntax)|TriG]] - Named Graphs in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]
* [[N-Quads]] - Named Graphs in [[N-Triples]]

In [[mathematics]] '''normal convergence''' is a type of [[Convergent series|convergence]] for [[series (mathematics)|series]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s.  Like [[absolute convergence|absolute-convergence]], it has the useful property that it is preserved when the order of summation is changed.

== History ==

The concept of normal convergence was first introduced by [[René Baire]] in 1908 in his book ''Leçons sur les théories générales de l'analyse''.

== Definition ==
Given a set ''S'' and functions &lt;math&gt;f_n : S \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (or to any [[normed vector space]]), the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''normally convergent''' if the series of [[uniform norm]]s of the terms of the series converges,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/N/n067430.htm Normal Convergence at EOM]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \|f_n\| := \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sup_S |f_n(x)| &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

== Distinctions ==
Normal convergence implies, but should not be confused with, [[uniform absolute convergence]], i.e. uniform convergence of the series of nonnegative functions &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty |f_n(x)|&lt;/math&gt;.  To illustrate this, consider

: &lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 1/n, &amp; x = n, \\ 0, &amp; x \ne n. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty |f_n(x)|&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly convergent (for any ''&amp;epsilon;'' take ''n'' ≥ 1/''&amp;epsilon;''), but the series of uniform norms is the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] and thus diverges.  An example using continuous functions can be made by replacing these functions with bump functions of height 1/''n'' and width 1 centered at each natural number&amp;nbsp;''n''.

As well, normal convergence of a series is different from ''norm-topology convergence'', i.e. convergence of the partial sum sequence in the topology induced by the uniform norm.  Normal convergence implies norm-topology convergence if and only if the space of functions under consideration is [[Banach space|complete]] with respect to the uniform norm.  (The converse does not hold even for complete function spaces: for example, consider the harmonic series as a sequence of constant functions).

== Generalizations ==

=== Local normal convergence ===

A series can be called "locally normally convergent on ''X''" if each point ''x'' in ''X'' has a neighborhood ''U'' such that the series of functions ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; restricted to the domain ''U''
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n\mid_U&lt;/math&gt;
is normally convergent, i.e. such that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \| f_n\|_U &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
where the norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_U &lt;/math&gt; is the supremum over the domain&amp;nbsp;''U''.

=== Compact normal convergence ===

A series is said to be "normally convergent on compact subsets of ''X''" or "compactly normally convergent on ''X''" if for every compact subset ''K'' of ''X'', the series of functions ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; restricted to ''K''
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n\mid_K&lt;/math&gt;
is normally convergent on&amp;nbsp;''K''.

'''Note''': if ''X'' is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense), local normal convergence and compact normal convergence are equivalent.

== Properties ==
* Every normal convergent series is uniformly convergent, locally uniformly convergent, and compactly uniformly convergent. This is very important, since it assures that any re-arrangement of the series, any derivatives or integrals of the series, and sums and products with other convergent series will converge to the "correct" value.
* If &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is normally convergent to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then any re-arrangement of the sequence {{nowrap|(''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...)}} also converges normally to the same ''ƒ''. That is, for every [[bijection (mathematics)|bijection]] &lt;math&gt;\tau: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_{\tau(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is normally convergent to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[economics]] and [[game theory]], it is sometimes assumed that agents have '''perfect rationality''': that is, they always act in a way that maximizes their [[utility]], and are capable of arbitrarily complex deductions towards that end. They will always be capable of thinking through all possible outcomes and choosing that course of action which will result in the best possible outcome.

Perfect rationality is often contrasted to [[bounded rationality]], which assumes that practical elements such as cognitive and time limitations restrict the rationality of agents.

Perfect rationality is similar to the concept of ''[[homo economicus]]'' but is more commonly used in the field of [[game theory]]. However it focuses more on the ability of agents to always make mathematically perfect deductions than on agents being self-interested: since the utility function could theoretically take any form, even be linked to the utility of other agents such as one's wife or children, perfect rationality could even be made compatible with the concept of ''[[homo reciprocans]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6759">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''Prüfer sequence''' (also '''Prüfer code''' or '''Prüfer numbers''') of a [[labeled tree]] is a unique [[sequence]] associated with the tree.  The sequence for a tree on ''n'' vertices has length ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, and can be generated by a simple iterative algorithm.  Prüfer sequences were first used by [[Heinz Prüfer]] to prove [[Cayley's formula]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Prüfer, H. | title=Neuer Beweis eines Satzes über Permutationen | journal=Arch. Math. Phys. | year=1918 | volume=27 | pages=742–744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm to convert a  tree into a Prüfer sequence==
One can generate a labeled tree's Prüfer sequence by iteratively removing vertices from the tree until only two vertices remain.  Specifically, consider a labeled tree ''T'' with vertices {1, 2, ..., ''n''}.  At step ''i'', remove the leaf with the smallest label and set the ''i''th element of the Prüfer sequence to be the label of this leaf's neighbour.

The Prüfer sequence of a labeled tree is unique and has length ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2.

===Example===
[[File:Tree graph.svg|right|frame|A labeled tree with Prüfer sequence {4,4,4,5}.]]
Consider the above algorithm run on the tree shown to the right.  Initially, vertex 1 is the leaf with the smallest label, so it is removed first and 4 is put in the Prüfer sequence.  Vertices 2 and 3 are removed next, so 4 is added twice more.  Vertex 4 is now a leaf and has the smallest label, so it is removed and we append 5 to the sequence.  We are left with only two vertices, so we stop.  The tree's sequence is {4,4,4,5}.

==Algorithm to convert a Prüfer sequence into a tree==

Let &lt;code&gt;{a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]}&lt;/code&gt; be a Prüfer sequence:

The tree will have &lt;code&gt;n+2&lt;/code&gt; nodes, numbered from &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;n+2&lt;/code&gt;.
For each node set its degree to the number of times it appears in the sequence plus 1.
For instance, in pseudo-code:

  '''Convert-Prüfer-to-Tree'''(''a'')
  1 ''n'' ← ''length''[''a'']
  2 ''T'' ← a graph with ''n'' + 2 isolated nodes, numbered 1 '''to''' ''n'' + 2
  3 ''degree'' ← an array of integers
  4 '''for''' each node ''i'' in ''T''
  5     '''do''' ''degree''[''i''] ← 1
  6 '''for''' each value ''i'' in ''a''
  7     '''do''' ''degree''[''i''] ← ''degree''[''i''] + 1

Next, for each number in the sequence &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;, find the first (lowest-numbered) node, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, with degree equal to 1, add the edge &lt;code&gt;(j, a[i])&lt;/code&gt; to the tree, and decrement the degrees of &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;. In pseudo-code:

  8 '''for''' each value ''i'' in ''a''
  9     '''for''' each node ''j'' in ''T''
 10          '''if''' ''degree''[''j''] = 1
 11             '''then''' Insert ''edge''[''i'', ''j''] into ''T''
 12                  ''degree''[''i''] ← ''degree''[''i''] - 1
 13                  ''degree''[''j''] ← ''degree''[''j''] - 1
 14                  '''break'''

At the end of this loop two nodes with degree 1 will remain (call them &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;). Lastly, add the edge &lt;code&gt;(u,v)&lt;/code&gt; to the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jens Gottlieb |author2=Bryant A. Julstrom |author3=Günther R.

==Cayley's formula==

The Prüfer sequence of a labeled tree on ''n'' vertices is a unique sequence of length ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 on the labels 1 to ''n'' &amp;mdash; this much is clear.  Somewhat less obvious is the fact that for a given sequence ''S'' of length ''n''&amp;ndash;2 on the labels 1 to ''n'', '''there is a ''unique'' labeled tree whose Prüfer sequence is ''S'''''.

The immediate consequence is that Prüfer sequences provide a [[bijection]] between the set of labeled trees on ''n'' vertices and the set of sequences of length ''n''&amp;ndash;2 on the labels 1 to ''n''.  The latter set has size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the existence of this bijection proves [[Cayley's formula]], i.e. that there are 
''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; labeled trees on ''n'' vertices.

* Cayley's formula can be strengthened to prove the following claim: 
:The number of spanning trees in a complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; with a degree &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; specified for each vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the [[multinomial coefficient]]
::&lt;math&gt;\binom{n-2}{d_1-1,\,d_2-1,\,\dots,\,d_n-1}=\frac{(n-2)!}{(d_1-1)!(d_2-1)!\cdots(d_{n}-1)!}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The proof follows by observing that in the Prüfer sequence number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; appears exactly &lt;math&gt;(d_i-1)&lt;/math&gt; times.

* Cayley's formula can be generalized:  a labeled tree is in fact a [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]] of the labeled [[complete graph]].  By placing restrictions on the enumerated Prüfer sequences, similar methods can give the number of spanning trees of a complete [[bipartite graph]].  If ''G'' is the complete bipartite graph with vertices 1 to ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in one partition and vertices ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to ''n'' in the other partition, the number of labeled spanning trees of ''G'' is &lt;math&gt;n_1^{n_2-1} n_2^{n_1-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Generating uniformly distributed random Prüfer sequences and converting them into the corresponding trees is a straightforward method of generating uniformly distributed random labelled trees.

In [[mathematics]], '''Puiseux series''' are a generalization of [[power series]] that allow for negative and fractional exponents of the [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] ''T''.  They were first introduced by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1676&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Newton|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rediscovered by [[Victor Puiseux]] in 1850.&lt;ref name="Puiseux1850"&gt;Puiseux (1850, 1851)&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the series
:&lt;math&gt; T^{-2} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + 2T^{11/6} + T^{8/3} + 2T^{25/6} + T^5 + 2T^{13/2} + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
is a Puiseux series in ''T''.

'''Puiseux's theorem''', sometimes also called the '''Newton–Puiseux theorem''', asserts that, given a [[polynomial equation]] &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;, its solutions in {{mvar|''y''}}, viewed as functions of {{mvar|''x''}}, may be expanded as Puiseux series that are [[convergent series|convergent]] in some [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the origin (0 excluded, in the case of a solution that tends to infinity at the origin). In other words, every branch of an [[algebraic curve]] may be locally (in terms of {{mvar|''x''}}) described by a Puiseux series.

The set of Puiseux series over an [[algebraically closed field]] of characteristic 0 is itself an algebraically closed field, called the '''field of Puiseux series'''. It is the [[algebraic closure]] of the [[Laurent series|field of Laurent series]]. This statement is also referred to as '''Puiseux's theorem''', being an expression of the original Puiseux theorem in modern abstract language.  Puiseux series are generalized by [[Hahn series]].

== Formal definition ==
If ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] (such as the [[complex number]]s) then we can define the field of Puiseux series with coefficients in ''K'' informally as the set of expressions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{k=k_0}^{+\infty} c_k T^{k/n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer and &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary integer.  In other words, Puiseux series differ from [[Laurent series]] in that they allow for fractional exponents of the indeterminate, as long as these fractional exponents have bounded denominator (here ''n'').  Just as with Laurent series, Puiseux series allow for negative exponents of the indeterminate as long as these negative exponents are bounded below (here by &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;).  Addition and multiplication are as expected: for example, 
:&lt;math&gt; (T^{-1} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + \ldots) + (T^{-5/4} - T^{-1/2} + 2 + \ldots) = T^{-5/4} + T^{-1} + T^{-1/2} + 2 + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; (T^{-1} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + \ldots) \cdot (T^{-5/4} - T^{-1/2} + 2 + \ldots) = T^{-9/4} + 2T^{-7/4} - T^{-3/2} + T^{-11/12} + 4T^{-1/2} + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;.
One might define them by first "upgrading" the denominator of the exponents to some common denominator {{math|''N''}} and then performing the operation in the corresponding field of formal Laurent series of &lt;math&gt;T^{1/N}&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, the field of Puiseux series with coefficients in ''K'' is the union of the fields &lt;math&gt;K(\!(T^{1/n})\!)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' ranges over the positive integers), where each element of the union is a field of formal Laurent series over &lt;math&gt;T^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; (considered as an indeterminate), and where each such field is considered as a subfield of the ones with larger ''n'' by rewriting the fractional exponents to use a larger denominator (so, for example, &lt;math&gt;T^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is identified with &lt;math&gt;T^{15/30}&lt;/math&gt; ).{{clarify|This is problematic as written: it's only when one denominator divides the other that we get inclusion, right?|date=April 2017}}

This yields a formal definition of the field of Puiseux series: it is the [[direct limit]] of the direct system, indexed over the non-zero natural numbers ''n'' ordered by [[Divisor|divisibility]], whose objects are all &lt;math&gt;K(\!(T)\!)&lt;/math&gt; (the field of formal Laurent series, which we rewrite as
&lt;math&gt;K(\!(T_n)\!)&lt;/math&gt; for clarity),
with a morphism
&lt;math&gt;K(\!(T_m)\!) \to K(\!(T_n)\!)&lt;/math&gt;
being given, whenever ''m'' divides ''n'', by &lt;math&gt;T_m \mapsto (T_n)^{n/m}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Valuation and order ===
The Puiseux series over a field ''K'' form a [[Valuation (algebra)|valued]] field with value group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[rationals]]): the ''valuation'' &lt;math&gt;v(f)&lt;/math&gt; of a series
:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{k=k_0}^{+\infty} c_k T^{k/n}&lt;/math&gt;

as above is defined to be the smallest rational &lt;math&gt;k/n&lt;/math&gt; such that the coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; of the term with exponent &lt;math&gt;k/n&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero (with the usual convention that the valuation of 0 is +∞).  The coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; in question is typically called the ''valuation coefficient'' of ''f''.

This valuation in turn defines a (translation-invariant) [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] (which is [[Ultrametric space|ultrametric]]), hence a [[Topological space|topology]] on the field of Puiseux series by letting the distance from ''f'' to 0 be &lt;math&gt;\exp(-v(f))&lt;/math&gt;.  This justifies ''a posteriori'' the notation
:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{k=k_0}^{+\infty} c_k T^{k/n}&lt;/math&gt;

as the series in question does, indeed, converge to ''f'' in the Puiseux series field (this is in contrast to [[Hahn series]] which ''cannot'' be viewed as converging series).

If the base field ''K'' is [[Ordered field|ordered]], then the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' is also naturally (“[[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]]”) ordered as follows: a non-zero Puiseux series ''f'' with 0 is declared positive whenever its valuation coefficient is so.  Essentially, this means that any positive rational power of the indeterminate ''T'' is made positive, but smaller than any positive element in the base field ''K''.

If the base field ''K'' is endowed with a valuation ''w'', then we can construct a different valuation on the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' by letting the valuation
&lt;math&gt;\hat w(f)&lt;/math&gt; 
be &lt;math&gt;\omega\cdot v + w(c_k),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v=k/n&lt;/math&gt; is the previously defined valuation (&lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; is the first non-zero coefficient) and ω is infinitely large (in other words, the value group of &lt;math&gt;\hat w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \times \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; ordered lexicographically, where Γ is the value group of ''w'').  Essentially, this means that the previously defined valuation ''v'' is corrected by an infinitesimal amount to take into account the valuation ''w'' given on the base field.

=== Algebraic closedness of Puiseux series ===
One essential property of Puiseux series is expressed by the following theorem, attributed to Puiseux&lt;ref name="Puiseux1850"/&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;K=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;) but which was implicit in [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s use of the [[Newton polygon]] as early as 1671&lt;ref&gt;Newton (1736)&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore known either as Puiseux's theorem or as the Newton–Puiseux theorem:&lt;ref name="Kedlaya2001Intro"&gt;cf. Kedlaya (2001), introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem''': if ''K'' is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, then the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' is the algebraic closure of the field of formal Laurent series over ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Eisenbud (1995), corollary&amp;nbsp;13.15 (p.&amp;nbsp;295)&lt;/ref&gt;

Very roughly, the proof proceeds essentially by inspecting the Newton polygon of the equation and extracting the coefficients one by one using a valuative form of [[Newton's method]].  Provided algebraic equations can be solved algorithmically in the base field ''K'', then the coefficients of the Puiseux series solutions can be computed to any given order.

For example, the equation &lt;math&gt;X^2 - X = T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has solutions
:&lt;math&gt;X = T^{-1/2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8}T^{1/2} - \frac{1}{128}T^{3/2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;X = -T^{-1/2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{8}T^{1/2} + \frac{1}{128}T^{3/2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

(one readily checks on the first few terms that the sum and product of these two series are 1 and &lt;math&gt;-T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively; this is valid whenever the base field ''K'' has characteristic different from&amp;nbsp;2).

As the powers of 2 in the denominators of the coefficients of the previous example might lead one to believe, the statement of the theorem is not true in positive characteristic.  The example of the [[Artin–Schreier theory|Artin–Schreier]] equation &lt;math&gt;X^p - X = T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; shows this: reasoning with valuations shows that ''X'' should have valuation &lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;, and if we rewrite it as &lt;math&gt;X = T^{-1/p} + X_1&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;X^p = T^{-1} + {X_1}^p,\text{ so }{X_1}^p - X_1 = T^{-1/p}&lt;/math&gt;

and one shows similarly that &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; should have valuation &lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and proceeding in that way one obtains the series
:&lt;math&gt;T^{-1/p} + T^{-1/p^2} + T^{-1/p^3} + \cdots ; \, &lt;/math&gt;

since this series makes no sense as a Puiseux series—because the exponents have unbounded denominators—the original equation has no solution.  However, such [[Eisenstein's criterion|Eisenstein equations]] are essentially the only ones not to have a solution, because, if ''K'' is algebraically closed of characteristic ''p''&amp;gt;0, then the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' is the perfect closure of the maximal tamely [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramified]] extension of &lt;math&gt;K(\!(T)\!)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kedlaya2001Intro" /&gt;

Similarly to the case of algebraic closure, there is an analogous theorem for [[Real closed field|real closure]]: if ''K'' is a real closed field, then the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' is the real closure of the field of formal Laurent series over ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;Basu &amp;amp;al (2006), chapter&amp;nbsp;2 ("Real Closed Fields"), theorem&amp;nbsp;2.91 (p.&amp;nbsp;75)&lt;/ref&gt;  (This implies the former theorem since any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is the unique quadratic extension of some real-closed field.)

There is also an analogous result for [[p-adically closed field|p-adic closure]]: if ''K'' is a ''p''-adically closed field with respect to a valuation ''w'', then the field of Puiseux series over ''K'' is also ''p''-adically closed.&lt;ref&gt;Cherlin (1976), chapter&amp;nbsp;2 ("The Ax–Kochen–Ershof Transfer Principle"), §7 ("Puiseux series fields")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I don't know whether it is *the* p-adic closure or whether it can be larger: can someone settle this? --&gt;

== Puiseux expansion of algebraic curves and functions ==

=== Algebraic curves ===
Let ''X'' be an [[algebraic curve]]&lt;ref&gt;We assume that ''X'' is [[Algebraic variety|irreducible]] or, at least, that it is reduced and that it does not contain the ''y'' coordinate axis.&lt;/ref&gt; given by an affine equation &lt;math&gt;F(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt; over an algebraically closed field ''K'' of characteristic zero, and consider a point ''p'' on ''X'' which we can assume to be (0,0).  We also assume that ''X'' is not the coordinate axis ''x''=0.  Then a ''Puiseux expansion'' of (the ''y'' coordinate of) ''X'' at ''p'' is a Puiseux series ''f'' having positive valuation such that &lt;math&gt;F(x,f(x))=0&lt;/math&gt;.

More precisely, let us define the ''branches'' of ''X'' at ''p'' to be the points ''q'' of the [[Noether normalization lemma|normalization]] ''Y'' of ''X'' which map to ''p''.  For each such ''q'', there is a local coordinate ''t'' of ''Y'' at ''q'' (which is a smooth point) such that the coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' can be expressed as formal power series of ''t'', say &lt;math&gt;x = t^n + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; (since ''K'' is algebraically closed, we can assume the valuation coefficient to be&amp;nbsp;1) and &lt;math&gt;y = c t^k + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;: then there is a unique Puiseux series of the form &lt;math&gt;f = c T^{k/n} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; (a power series in &lt;math&gt;T^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;), such that &lt;math&gt;y(t)=f(x(t))&lt;/math&gt; (the latter expression is meaningful since &lt;math&gt;x(t)^{1/n} = t+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is a well-defined power series in ''t'').  This is a Puiseux expansion of ''X'' at ''p'' which is said to be associated to the branch given by ''q'' (or simply, the Puiseux expansion of that branch of ''X''), and each Puiseux expansion of ''X'' at ''p'' is given in this manner for a unique branch of ''X'' at ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;Shafarevich (1994), II.5, pp.&amp;nbsp;133–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutkosky (2004), chapter&amp;nbsp;2, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–11&lt;/ref&gt;

This existence of a formal parametrization of the branches of an algebraic curve or function is also referred to as ''Puiseux's theorem'': it has arguably the same mathematical content as the fact that the field of Puiseux series is algebraically closed and is a historically more accurate description of the original author's statement.&lt;ref&gt;Puiseux (1850), p.&amp;nbsp;397&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the curve &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3 + x^2&lt;/math&gt; (whose normalization is a line with coordinate ''t'' and map &lt;math&gt;t \mapsto (t^2-1,t^3-t)&lt;/math&gt;) has two branches at the double point (0,0), corresponding to the points ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1 and ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 on the normalization, whose Puiseux expansions are &lt;math&gt;y = x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = - x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; respectively (here, both are power series because the ''x'' coordinate is [[Étale morphism|étale]] at the corresponding points in the normalization).  At the smooth point (−1,0) (which is ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in the normalization), it has a single branch, given by the Puiseux expansion &lt;math&gt;y = -(x+1)^{1/2} + (x+1)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''x'' coordinate ramifies at this point, so it is not a power series).

The curve &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3&lt;/math&gt; (whose normalization is again a line with coordinate ''t'' and map &lt;math&gt;t \mapsto (t^2,t^3)&lt;/math&gt;), on the other hand, has a single branch at the [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp point]] (0,0), whose Puiseux expansion is &lt;math&gt;y = x^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Analytic convergence ===
When &lt;math&gt;K = \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the field of complex numbers, the Puiseux expansion of an algebraic curve (as defined above) is [[Radius of convergence|convergent]] in the sense that for a given choice of ''n''-th root of ''x'', they converge for small enough &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt;, hence define an analytic parametrization of each branch of ''X'' in the neighborhood of ''p'' (more precisely, the parametrization is by the ''n''-th root of ''x'').

== Generalizations ==
=== Levi-Civita field ===
{{main|Levi-Civita field}}
The field of Puiseux series is not [[Complete metric space|complete]] as a [[metric space]]. Its completion, called the [[Levi-Civita field]], can be described as follows: it is the field of formal expressions of the form &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_e c_e T^e\,&lt;/math&gt;, where the support of the coefficients (that is, the set of ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;c_e \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;) is the range of an increasing sequence of rational numbers that either is finite or tends to +∞.  In other words, such series admit exponents of unbounded denominators, provided there are finitely many terms of exponent less than ''A'' for any given bound ''A''.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} T^{k+\frac{1}{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is not a Puiseux series, but it is the limit of a [[Cauchy sequence]] of Puiseux series; in particular, it is the limit of &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} T^{k+\frac{1}{k}}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;N \to +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  However, even this completion is still not "maximally complete" in the sense that it admits non-trivial extensions which are valued fields having the same value group and residue field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poonen |first1=Bjorn |year=1993 |title=Maximally complete fields |journal=Enseign. Math. |volume=39 |pages=87–106 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplansky |first1=Irving |year=1942 |title=Maximal Fields with Valuations |journal=Duke Math. J. |volume=9 |pages=303–321|ref=harv |doi=10.1215/s0012-7094-42-00922-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the opportunity of completing it even more.

=== Hahn series ===
{{main|Hahn series}}
[[Hahn series]] are a further (larger) generalization of Puiseux series, introduced by [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] in the course of the proof of his [[Hahn embedding theorem|embedding theorem]] in 1907 and then studied by him in his approach to [[Hilbert's seventeenth problem]].  In a Hahn series, instead of requiring the exponents to have bounded denominator they are required to form a [[Well-order|well-ordered subset]] of the value group (usually &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).  These were later further generalized by [[Anatoly Maltsev]] and [[Bernhard Neumann]] to a non-commutative setting (they are therefore sometimes known as ''Hahn–Mal'cev–Neumann series'').  Using Hahn series, it is possible to give a description of the algebraic closure of the field of power series in positive characteristic which is somewhat analogous to the field of Puiseux series.&lt;ref&gt;Kedlaya (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''queue number''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a [[graph invariant]] defined analogously to [[book thickness|stack number]] (book thickness) using [[Queue (abstract data type)|first-in first-out]] (queue) orderings in place of [[Stack (abstract data type)|last-in first-out]] (stack) orderings.

==Definition==
A queue layout of a given graph is defined by a [[total ordering]] of the [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the graph together with a partition of the [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] into a number of "queues". The set of edges in each queue is required to avoid edges that are properly nested: if ''ab'' and ''cd'' are two edges in the same queue, then it should not be possible to have {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''d'' &lt; ''b''}} in the vertex ordering. The queue number qn(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the minimum number of queues in a queue layout.&lt;ref name="hr92"&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently, from a queue layout, one could process the edges in a single queue using a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue data structure]], by considering the vertices in their given ordering, and when reaching a vertex, dequeueing all edges for which it is the second endpoint followed by enqueueing all edges for which it is the first endpoint. The nesting condition ensures that, when a vertex is reached, all of the edges for which it is the second endpoint are ready to be dequeued.&lt;ref name="hr92"/&gt; Another equivalent definition of queue layouts involves [[graph embedding|embeddings]] of the given graph onto a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], with the vertices placed on a line in the cylinder and with each edge wrapping once around the cylinder. Edges that are assigned to the same queue are not allowed to cross each other, but crossings are allowed between edges that belong to different queues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Auer|Bachmaier|Brandenburg|Brunner|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queue layouts were defined by {{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, by analogy to previous work on [[book embedding]]s of graphs, which can be defined in the same way using stacks in place of queues. As they observed, these layouts are also related to earlier work on sorting [[permutation]]s using systems of parallel queues, and may be motivated by applications in [[VLSI]] design and in communications management for [[distributed algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="hr92"/&gt;

==Graph classes with bounded queue number==
Every [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] has queue number 1, with a vertex ordering given by a [[breadth-first traversal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Proposition 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudoforest]]s and [[grid graph]]s also have queue number 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Propositions 4.2 and 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outerplanar graph]]s have queue number at most 2; the 3-sun graph (a triangle with each of its edges replaced by a triangle) is an example of an outerplanar graph whose queue number is exactly&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Rengarajan|Veni Madhavan|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Series-parallel graph]]s have queue number at most&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rengarajan|Veni Madhavan|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary [[de Bruijn graph]]s have queue number&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Proposition 4.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''d''-dimensional [[hypercube graph]] has queue number at most {{nowrap|''d'' &amp;minus; 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Proposition 4.10; {{harvtxt|Hasunuma|Hirota|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Pai|Chang|Wang|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Gregor|Škrekovski|Vukašinović|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The queue numbers of [[complete graph]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and [[complete bipartite graph]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are known exactly: they are &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\min\{\lceil a/2\rceil,\lceil b/2\rceil\}&lt;/math&gt;
respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Propositions 4.7 and 4.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsolved|mathematics|Does every [[planar graph]] have bounded queue number?}}
Every 1-queue graph is a [[planar graph]], with an "arched leveled" planar embedding in which the vertices are placed on parallel lines (levels) and each edge either connects vertices on two consecutive levels or forms an arch that connects two vertices on the same level by looping around all previous levels. Conversely, every arched leveled planar graph has a 1-queue layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Theorem 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}} conjectured that every planar graph has bounded queue number, but this remains unsolved. If the queue number of planar graphs is bounded, then the same is true for [[1-planar graph]]s and more generally ''k''-planar graphs.&lt;ref name="dw05"/&gt; The strongest known bound on the queue number of planar graphs is not constant, but {{nowrap|''O''(log ''n'')}}.&lt;ref name="planar-log"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|2015}}, improving an earlier bound of {{harvtxt|Di Battista|Frati|Pach|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Polylogarithmic bounds on the queue number are also known for graphs of bounded [[Genus (mathematics)#Graph theory|genus]] and more generally graphs in any [[Robertson–Seymour theorem|minor-closed graph family]].&lt;ref name="dmw13"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Morin|Wood|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a variation of queue number called the strong queue number, the queue number of a [[graph product]] can be bounded by a function of the queue numbers and strong queue numbers of the factors in the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wood|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related invariants==
Graphs with low queue number are [[sparse graph]]s: 1-queue graphs with ''n'' vertices have at most 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3 edges,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Theorem 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally graphs with queue number&amp;nbsp;''q'' have at most {{nowrap|2''qn'' &amp;minus; ''q''(2''q'' + 1)}} edges.&lt;ref name="dw04"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Wood|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that these graphs also have small [[chromatic number]]: in particular 1-queue graphs are 3-colorable, and graphs with queue number ''q'' may need at least {{nowrap|2''q'' + 1}} and at most 4''q'' colors.&lt;ref name="dw04"/&gt; In the other direction, a bound on the number of edges implies a much weaker bound on the queue number: graphs with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges have queue number at most ''O''({{radic|''m''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}}. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding a layout with close to this many queues is given by {{harvtxt|Shahrokhi|Shi|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Wood|2004}} improved the constant factor in this bound to ''e''{{radic|''m''}}, where [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] is the base of the [[natural logarithm]].&lt;/ref&gt; This bound is close to tight, because for random ''d''-regular graphs the queue number is, with high probability,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\frac{\sqrt{dn}}{n^{1/d}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Wood|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsolved|mathematics|Must every graph with bounded queue number also have bounded book thickness, and vice versa?}}
Graphs with queue number 1 have book thickness at most 2.&lt;ref name="hlr92"/&gt;
For any fixed vertex ordering, the product of the book thickness and queue numbers for that ordering is at least as large as the [[cutwidth]] of the graph divided by its maximum degree.&lt;ref name="hlr92"&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The book thickness may be much larger than the queue number: ternary [[Hamming graph]]s have logarithmic queue number but polynomially-large book thickness.&lt;ref name="hlr92"/&gt; It remains unknown whether the book thickness can be bounded by any function of the queue number. {{harvtxt|Heath|Leighton|Rosenberg|1992}} conjectured that the queue number is at most a linear function of the book thickness, but no functional bound in this direction is known either. It is known that, if all [[bipartite graph]]s with 3-page book embeddings have bounded queue number, then all graphs with bounded book thickness have bounded queue number.&lt;ref name="dw05"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Wood|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Ganley|Heath|2001}} asked whether the queue number of a graph could be bounded as a function of its [[treewidth]], and cited an unpublished Ph.D. dissertation of S. V. Pemmaraju as providing evidence that the answer was no: [[Apollonian network|planar 3-trees]] appeared from this evidence to have unbounded queue number. However, the queue number was subsequently shown to be bounded by a (doubly exponential) function of the treewidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Wood|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Morin|Wood|2005}}. See {{harvtxt|Wood|2002}} for a weaker preliminary result, bounding the queue number by the [[pathwidth]] or by a combination of treewidth and degree.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational complexity==
It is [[NP-complete]] to determine the queue number of a given graph, or even to test whether this number is one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Corollary 3.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the vertex ordering of a queue layout is given as part of the input, 
then the optimal number of queues for the layout equals the maximum number of edges in a ''k''-rainbow, a set of ''k'' edges each two of which form a nested pair. A partition of edges into queues can be performed by assigning an edge ''e'' that is the outer edge of an ''i''-rainbow (and of no larger rainbow) to the ''i''th queue. It is possible to construct an optimal layout in time {{nowrap|''O''(''m'' log log ''n'')}}, where ''n'' denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and ''m'' denotes the number of edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|Rosenberg|1992}}, Theorem 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphs of bounded queue number also have [[bounded expansion]], meaning that their [[shallow minor]]s are [[sparse graph]]s with a ratio of edges to vertices (or equivalently [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] or [[arboricity]]) that is bounded by a function of the queue number and the depth of the minor. As a consequence, several algorithmic problems including [[subgraph isomorphism]] for pattern graphs of bounded size have [[linear time]] algorithms for these graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|Wood|2012}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, pp. 321–327.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, because of their bounded expansion, it is possible to check whether any sentence in the [[first-order logic]] of graphs is valid for a given graph of bounded queue number, in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;18.2, p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in graph drawing==
Although queue layouts do not necessarily produce good two-dimensional [[graph drawing]]s, they have been used for three-dimensional graph drawing. In particular, a graph ''G'' has bounded queue number if and only if it is possible to place the vertices of ''G'' in a three-dimensional grid of dimensions {{nowrap|''O''(''n'') &amp;times; ''O''(1) &amp;times; ''O''(1)}} in such a way that no two edges cross each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wood|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Pór|Wood|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Morin|Wood|2005}}. See {{harvtxt|Di Giacomo|Meijer|2004}} for tighter bounds on the grid dimensions for graphs of small queue number.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for instance, de Bruijn graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth have three-dimensional embeddings of linear volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Wood|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Morin|Wood|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logarithmic or polylogarithmic bounds on the queue number translate in the same way into 3d embeddings with near-linear volume, in a grid with one dimension linear and the other two polylogarithmic. Planar graphs, bounded genus graphs, and graphs of bounded local treewidth have embeddings of volume {{nowrap|''O''(''n'' log ''n''),&lt;ref name="planar-log"/&gt;}} while graphs in minor-closed families have embeddings of volume {{nowrap|''O''(''n'' log&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1)&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'').&lt;ref name="dmw13"/&gt;}}

In [[model theory]], a complete theory  is called '''stable''' if it does not have too many types. One goal of '''classification theory''' is to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a theory is not stable then its models are too complicated and numerous to classify, while if a theory is stable there might be some hope of classifying its models, especially if the theory is '''superstable''' or '''totally transcendental'''.

Stability theory was started by {{harvtxt|Morley|1965}}, who introduced several of the fundamental concepts, such as totally transcendental theories and the Morley rank. 
Stable and superstable theories were first introduced by {{harvtxt|Shelah|1969}}, who is responsible for much of the development of stability theory. The definitive reference for stability theory is {{harv|Shelah|1990}}, though it is notoriously hard even for experts to read, as mentioned,  e.g., in {{harv|Grossberg|Iovino|Lessmann|2002|p=542}}.

==Definitions==
''T'' will be a complete theory in some language. 
*''T'' is called '''κ-stable''' (for an infinite cardinal κ) if for every set ''A'' of cardinality κ the set of [[complete type]]s over ''A'' has cardinality κ.
*'''ω-stable''' is an alternative name for ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-stable.
*''T'' is called '''stable''' if it is κ-stable for some infinite cardinal κ
*''T'' is called '''unstable''' if it is not κ-stable for any infinite cardinal κ.
*''T'' is called '''superstable''' if it is κ-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals κ.
*'''Totally transcendental''' theories are those such that every formula has [[Morley rank]] less than ∞.

As usual, a model of some language is said to have one of these properties if the complete theory of the model has that property.

An incomplete theory is defined to have one of these properties if every completion, or equivalently every model, has this property.

==Unstable theories==
Roughly speaking, a theory is unstable if one can use it to encode the ordered set of natural numbers. More precisely, if there is a model ''M'' and a formula Φ(''X'',''Y'') in 2''n'' variables ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defining a relation on  ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with an infinite totally ordered subset  then the theory is unstable. (Any infinite totally ordered set has a subset isomorphic to either the positive or negative integers under the usual order, so one can assume the totally ordered subset is ordered like the positive integers.) The totally ordered subset need not be definable in the theory.

The number of models of an unstable theory ''T'' of any uncountable cardinality κ&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;|''T''| is the maximum possible number 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;.

Examples:
*Most sufficiently complicated theories, such as set theories and Peano arithmetic, are unstable.
*The theory of the rational numbers, considered as an ordered set, is unstable. Its theory is the theory of [[List of first-order theories#Orders|dense linear orders without endpoints]].
*The theory of addition of the natural numbers is unstable.
*Any infinite [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is unstable.
*Any monoid with cancellation that is not a group is unstable, because if ''a'' is an element that is not a unit then the powers of ''a'' form an infinite totally ordered set under the relation of divisibility. For a similar reason any integral domain that is not a field is unstable.
*There are many unstable nilpotent groups. One example is the infinite dimensional [[Heisenberg group]] over the integers: this is generated by elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z'' for all natural numbers ''i'', with the relations that any of these two generators commute except that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; have commutator ''z'' for any ''i''.  If  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; have commutator ''z'' exactly when ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j'', so they form an infinite total order under a definable relation, so the group is unstable.
*[[Real closed field]]s are unstable, as they are infinite and have a definable total order.

==Stable theories==
''T'' is called '''stable''' if it is κ-stable for some cardinal κ.   
Examples:
*The theory of any module over a ring is stable.
*The theory of a countable number of equivalence relations ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' a natural number such that each equivalence relation has an infinite number of equivalence classes and  each equivalence class of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the union of an infinite number of different classes of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is stable but not superstable.
*{{harvtxt|Sela|2006}} showed that free groups, and more generally torsion free hyperbolic groups, are stable. Free groups on more than one generator are not superstable.
*A [[differentially closed field]] is stable. If it has non-zero characteristic it is not superstable, and if it has zero characteristic it is totally transcendental.

==Superstable theories==
''T'' is called '''superstable''' if it is stable for all sufficiently large cardinals, so all superstable theories are stable.  For countable ''T'' superstability is equivalent to stability for all κ≥2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.
The following conditions on a theory ''T'' are equivalent:
*''T'' is superstable.
*All types of ''T'' are ranked by at least one notion of rank.
*''T'' is κ-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals κ
*''T'' is κ-stable for all  cardinals κ that are at least 2&lt;sup&gt;|''T''|&lt;/sup&gt;.

If a theory is superstable but not totally transcendental it is called '''strictly superstable'''.

The number of countable models of a countable superstable theory must be 1, ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;. If the number of models is 1 the theory is totally transcendental.  There are examples with  1, ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; models, and it is not known if there are examples with ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; models if the continuum hypothesis does not hold. If a theory ''T'' is not superstable then the number of models of cardinality κ&gt;|''T''|  is 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;.

Examples:
*The additive group of integers is superstable, but not totally transcendental. It has 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; countable models.
*The theory with a countable number of unary relations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with model the positive integers where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is interpreted as saying ''n'' is divisible by the ''n''th prime is superstable but not totally transcendental.
*An abelian group ''A'' is superstable if and only if there are only finitely many pairs (''p'',''n'') with ''p'' prime, ''n'' a natural number, with ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''A''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' infinite.

==Totally transcendental theories and &amp;omega;-stable==
*'''Totally transcendental''' theories are those such that every formula has [[Morley rank]] less than ∞. Totally transcendental theories are stable in λ whenever λ≥|''T''|, so they are always superstable. '''ω-stable''' is an alternative name for ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-stable. ω-stable theories  in a countable language are κ-stable for all infinite cardinals κ. If |''T''| is countable then ''T'' is totally transcendental if and only if it is ω-stable. More generally, ''T'' is totally transcendental if and only if every restriction of ''T'' to a countable language is ω-stable.

Examples:
*Any ω-stable theory is totally transcendental.
*Any finite model is totally transcendental.
*An infinite field is totally transcendental if and only if it is  [[algebraically closed]]. ([[Angus Macintyre|Macintyre]]'s theorem.)
*A [[differentially closed field]] in characteristic 0 is totally transcendental.
*Any theory with a countable language that is [[categorical theory|categorical]] for some uncountable cardinal is totally transcendental.
*An abelian group  is totally transcendental if and only if it is the direct sum of a divisible group and a group of bounded exponent.
*Any [[linear algebraic group]] over an algebraically closed field is totally transcendental.
*Any [[group of finite Morley rank]] is totally transcendental.

[[Image:BooleanCellCoverage.svg|thumb|right|A possible stochastic geometry model (Boolean model) for [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|wireless network coverage]] and connectivity constructed from randomly sized disks placed at random locations]] 

In mathematics, '''stochastic geometry''' is the study of random spatial patterns. At the heart of the subject lies the study of random point patterns. This leads to the theory of [[Point process|spatial point processes]], hence notions of Palm conditioning, which extend to the more abstract setting of [[random measure]]s.

==Models==

There are various models for point processes, typically based on but going beyond the classic homogeneous [[Poisson process|Poisson point process]] (the basic model for ''[[complete spatial randomness]]'') to find  expressive models which allow effective statistical methods. 

The point pattern theory provides a major building block for generation of random object processes, allowing construction of elaborate random spatial patterns. The simplest version, the  [[Boolean model (probability theory)|Boolean model]], places a random compact object at each point of a Poisson point process.  More complex versions allow interactions based in various ways on the geometry of objects. Different directions of application include: the production of models for random images either as set-union of objects, or as patterns of overlapping objects; also the generation of geometrically inspired models for the underlying point process 
(for example, the point pattern distribution may be biased by an exponential factor involving the area of the union of the objects; this is related to the Widom-Rowlinson model&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of statistical mechanics).

==Random object==

What is  meant by a random object? A complete answer to this question requires the theory of [[Random compact set|random closed sets]], which makes contact with advanced concepts from measure theory. The key idea is to focus on the probabilities of the given random closed set hitting specified test sets. There arise questions of inference (for example, estimate the set which encloses a given point pattern) and theories of generalizations of means etc. to apply to random sets. Connections are now being made between this latter work and recent developments in geometric mathematical analysis concerning general metric spaces and their geometry. Good parametrizations of specific random sets can allow us to refer random object processes to the theory of marked point processes; object-point pairs are viewed as points in a larger product space formed as the product of the original space and the space of parametrization.

==Line and hyper-flat processes==

Suppose we are concerned no longer with compact objects, but with objects which are spatially extended: lines on the plane or flats in 3-space. This leads to consideration of line processes, and of processes of flats or hyper-flats. There can no longer be a preferred spatial location for each object; however the theory may be mapped back into point process theory by representing each object by a point in a suitable representation space. For example, in the case of directed lines in the plane one may take the representation space to be a cylinder.  A complication is that the Euclidean motion symmetries will then be expressed on the representation space in a somewhat unusual way. Moreover, calculations need to take account of interesting spatial biases (for example, line segments are less likely to be hit by random lines to which they are nearly parallel) and this provides an interesting and significant connection to the hugely significant area of [[stereology]], which in some respects can be viewed as yet another theme of stochastic geometry. It is often the case that calculations are best carried out in terms of bundles of lines hitting various test-sets, rather than by working in representation space.

Line and hyper-flat processes have their own direct applications, but also find application as one way of creating [[tessellation]]s dividing space; hence for example one may speak of Poisson line tessellations. A notable recent result&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; proves that the cell at the origin of the Poisson line tessellation is approximately circular when conditioned to be large. Tessellations in stochastic geometry can of course be produced by other means, for example by using [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] and variant constructions, and also by iterating various means of construction.

The tables below list all of the [[divisor]]s of the numbers 1 to 1000.

A '''divisor''' of an [[integer]] ''n'' is an integer ''m'', for which ''n''/''m'' is again an integer (which is necessarily also a divisor of ''n''). For example, 3 is a divisor of 21, since 21/7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 (and 7 is also a divisor of 21).

If ''m'' is a divisor of ''n'' then so is &amp;minus;''m''. The tables below only list positive divisors.

== Key to the tables ==

*[[Divisor function | ''d''(''n'')]] is the number of positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'' itself
*[[Divisor function | σ(''n'')]] is the sum of the positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'' itself
*[[Divisor function | ''s''(''n'')]] is the sum of the [[proper divisors]] of ''n'', which does not include ''n'' itself; that is,  ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;σ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[perfect number]] equals the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[deficient number]] is greater than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*an [[abundant number]] is lesser than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[prime number]] has only 1 and itself as divisors; that is, ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.  Prime numbers are always deficient as ''s''(''n'')=1
*a [[sublime number]] has a perfect number of divisors, that is ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''perfect number'', and whose divisors add up to another perfect number, that is σ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''perfect number''

[[File:William Hatherell - Robert Louis Stephenson - The Bottle Imp 1 - original scan (rotated, cropped).jpg|thumb|[[William Hatherell]]'s illustration of a 1905 edition of the story: the bottle is presented to Keawe by its previous owner]]
'''''The Bottle Imp''''' is an 1891 short story by the Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] usually found in the short story collection ''[[Island Nights' Entertainments]]''. It was first published in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' (February–March 1891) and ''[[Black and White (magazine)|Black and White]]'' London (March–April 1891).  In it, the protagonist buys a bottle with an [[imp]] inside that grants wishes.  However, the bottle is cursed; if the holder dies bearing it, his or her soul is forfeit to hell.

==Plot==
Keawe, a poor [[Native Hawaiian]], buys a strange unbreakable bottle from a sad, elderly gentleman who credits the bottle with his fortune.  He promises that an [[imp]] residing in the bottle will also grant Keawe his every desire.

Of course, there is a catch. The bottle must be sold, for cash, at a loss, i.e. for less than its owner originally paid, and cannot be thrown or given away, or else it will magically return to him. All of these rules must be explained by each seller to each purchaser. If an owner of the bottle dies without having sold it in the prescribed manner, that person's soul will burn for eternity in [[Hell]].

The bottle was said to have been brought to Earth by the [[Devil]] and first purchased by [[Prester John]] for millions; it was owned by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and Captain [[James Cook]] and accounted for their great successes. By the time of the story the price has diminished to fifty dollars.

Keawe buys the bottle and instantly tests it by wishing his money to be refunded, and by trying to sell it for more than he paid and abandoning it,  to test if the story is true. When these all work as described, he realizes the bottle does indeed have unholy power. He wishes for his heart's desire: a big, fancy mansion on a landed estate, and finds his wish granted, but at a price: his beloved uncle and cousins have been killed in a boating accident, leaving Keawe sole heir to his uncle's fortune. Keawe is horrified, but uses the money to build his house. Having all he wants, and being happy, he explains the risks to a friend who buys the bottle from him.

Keawe lives a happy life, but there is something missing. Walking along the beach one night, he meets a beautiful woman, Kokua. They soon fall in love and become engaged. Keawe's happiness is shattered on the night of his betrothal, when he discovers that he has contracted the then-incurable disease of [[leprosy]]. He must give up his house and wife, and live in [[Kalaupapa]]&amp;mdash;a remote community for lepers&amp;mdash;unless he can recover the bottle and use it to cure himself.

Keawe begins this quest by attempting to track down the friend to whom he sold the bottle, but the friend has become suddenly wealthy and left Hawaii. Keawe traces the path of the bottle through many buyers and eventually finds a [[Haole]] of Beritania Street, Honolulu.  The man of European ancestry has both good and bad news for Keawe: (a) he owns the bottle and is very willing to sell, but (b) he had only paid two cents for it. Therefore, if Keawe buys it, he will not be able to resell it.

Keawe decides to buy the bottle anyway, for the price of one cent, and indeed cures himself.  Now, however, he is understandably [[despondent]]: how can he possibly enjoy life, knowing his doom? His wife mistakes his depression for regret at their marriage, and asks for a divorce. Keawe confesses to her his secret.

His wife suggests they sail, with the bottle, to [[Tahiti]]; on that archipelago the colonists of [[French Polynesia]] use [[centime]]s, a coin worth one fifth of an American cent.  This offers a potential recourse for Keawe.

When they arrive, however, the suspicious natives will not touch the cursed bottle. Kokua determines to make a supreme sacrifice to save her husband from his fate.  Since, however, she knows he would never sell the bottle to her knowingly, Kokua is forced to bribe an old sailor to buy the bottle for four centimes, with the understanding that she will secretly buy it back for three. Now Keawe is happy, but she carries the curse.

Keawe discovers what his wife has done, and resolves to sacrifice himself for her in the same manner. He arranges for a brutish [[boatswain]] to buy the bottle for two centimes, promising he will buy it back for one, thus sealing his doom. However, the drunken sailor refuses to part with it, and is unafraid of the prospect of Hell. "I reckon I'm going anyway," he says.

Keawe returns to his wife, both of them free from the curse, and the reader is encouraged to believe that they live happily ever after.

==Background==
The theme of the bottle imp can be found in the German legend ''Spiritus familiaris'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.zeno.org/nid/20004906713 85. Spiritus familiaris]''. In: Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm: ''Deutsche Sagen. Zwei Bände in einem Band''. München 1965, pp. 121-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of publication in 1891, the currency system of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] included cent coins that circulated at par with the [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]].

The novel reflects Stevenson's impressions gained during his five-month visit of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson: ''Travels in Hawaii''. edited and with an introduction by A. Grove Day. University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu 1991. {{ISBN|0-8248-1397-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the storyline takes place in the little town [[Hoʻokena]] at the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] coast of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]], which the author visited.&lt;ref&gt;cf. his [http://www.infomotions.com/etexts/literature/english/1800-1899/stevenson-letters-640.htm letter to Charles Baxter (Honolulu, 10 May 1889)]: ''"I have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of Hawaii, the only white creature in many miles, riding five and a half hours one day, living with a native ..."''&lt;/ref&gt; In a scene which takes place in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] Stevenson mentions [[Heinrich Berger]], the bandmaster of the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[s:en:The Bottle Imp|The Bottle Imp]]: ''"Thither he went, because he feared to be alone; and there, among happy faces, walked to and fro, and heard the tunes go up and down, and saw Berger beat the measure, and all the while he heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burning in the bottomless pit."''&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Keawe's wife refers to the Hawaiian word ''kōkua'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717002755/http://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q-0hdict--00-0-0--010---4----den--0-000lp0--1en-Zz-1---Zz-1-home-kokua--00031-0000escapewin-00&amp;a=q&amp;d=D8697 Hawaiian Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; which means ''help''. In 1889 Stevenson also visited the [[leper colony]] on the island of [[Molokaʻi]] and met [[Father Damien]] there. Therefore, he had a first-hand experience from the fate of lepers.&lt;ref&gt;cf. his [http://www.infomotions.com/etexts/literature/english/1800-1899/stevenson-letters-640.htm letter to Sidney Colvin (Honolulu, June 1889)]: ''"I am just home after twelve days journey to Molokai, seven of them at the leper settlement, where I can only say that the sight of so much courage, cheerfulness, and devotion strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the sights."''&lt;/ref&gt; Several times Stevenson uses the Hawaiian word ''Haole'', which is the usual term for [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], for example describing the last owner of the bottle.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. [[s:en:The Bottle Imp|The Bottle Imp]]: ''"Now there was an old brutal Haole drinking with him, one that had been a boatswain of a whaler, a runaway, a digger in gold mines, a convict in prisons."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The story could be considered as both a continuation of and a rather light-hearted counterpoint to the theme of [[Deal with the Devil|selling one's soul to The Devil]], manifested in the numerous depictions of [[Doctor Faust]] as well as in such stories as "[[The Devil and Tom Walker]]" by [[Washington Irving]] and "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]" by [[Stephen Vincent Benet]].

==Publication==
"The Bottle Imp" was published in the missionary magazine ''O le sulu Samoa'' (The Samoan Torch) in 1891, with the title "O Le Tala I Le Fagu Aitu". According to ''Publishers Weekly'' and ''School Library Journal'' (both quoted by Amazon.com) "this tale was originally published, in Samoan, in 1891".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on the Amazon sales page for the edition with {{ISBN|0-395-72101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Locus Online Index to Science Fiction'' similarly states "The Stevenson story was first published in Samoan in 1891, appearing later that year in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/b455.htm#A6663 |title=Books, Listed by Author  |work=The Locus Index to Science Fiction |publisher=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project Gutenberg text of the story has a note by Stevenson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Stevenson |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/329/329-h/329-h.htm |title=Island Nights’ Entertainments  |first1=Robert Louis |year=1905 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which says "...the tale has been designed and written for a Polynesian audience..." which also suggests initial publication in Polynesia, not in the United States.

==Bottle Imp paradox==
The premise of the story creates a logical paradox similar to the [[unexpected hanging paradox]]. Clearly no rational person would buy it for one cent as this would make it impossible for it to be sold at a loss. However, it follows that no rational person would buy it for two cents either if it is later to be sold only to a rational person for a loss. By [[backward induction]], the bottle cannot be sold for ''any'' price in a perfectly rational world. And yet, the actions of the people in the story do not seem particularly unwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. Sharvy | year = 1983 | title = The Bottle Imp | journal = [[Philosophia (journal)|Philosophia]] | volume = 12 | pages = 401 | doi = 10.1007/BF02380917 | issue = 3–4}}&lt;br /&gt;Sorensen calls this "Sharv{{sic|e|hide=y}}y’s Bottle Imp paradox" or "Sharv{{sic|e|hide=y}}y’s paradox", see

The story shows that the paradox could be resolved by the existence of certain characters:
* Someone who loves the bottle's current owner enough to sacrifice his or her own soul for that person.
* Someone who believes he or she is inevitably destined for Hell already.
* Someone who believes he or she will never die.
* Someone who believes there is someone else willing to make an irrational decision to purchase the bottle.

Since the exchange rates of different currencies can fluctuate with respect to one another, it is also possible that the ''value'' of the bottle could increase from one transaction to the next even if the stated price decreases. This leads to an [[endless staircase]]-type paradox which would make it possible, in theory, for the bottle to keep getting sold infinitely many times. However, this might be forbidden depending on how the bottle imp interprets the idea of "selling at a loss".

==Adaptations==
[[File:Bottle Imp poster.jpg|thumb|upright|A poster for the 1917 film]]
[[The Bottle Imp (1917 film)|A silent film]] based on Stevenson's story was released in 1917. The [[screenplay]] was adapted by [[Charles Maigne]]. The film was directed by [[Marshall Neilan]], and starred [[Sessue Hayakawa]], Lehua Waipahu, H. Komshi, George Kuwa, [[Guy Oliver]] and [[James Neill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007740/|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Witch's Tale]], a horror anthology radio series, adapted the story as "The Wonderful Bottle" in 1934.

[[Käthe von Nagy]] was the star in the German film ''[[Love, Death and the Devil]]'' (1934) and the French film ''[[The Devil in the Bottle]]'' (1935).

A West German [[stop motion animation|stop motion]] animated feature film based on the story and directed by the Diehl Brothers was released in 1952 under the title ''Der Flaschenteufel''.

An Italian TV adaptation "Il diavolo nella bottiglia" aired on Rai2 on 23 Jun 1981 as part of the horror anthology series "I giochi del diavolo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798762/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wigner quasiprobability distribution''' (also called the '''Wigner function''' or the '''Wigner–Ville distribution''' after [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[:fr:Jean Ville|Jean-André Ville]])  is a [[quasiprobability distribution]]. It was introduced&lt;ref&gt;

Weyl, ''The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics''   (Dover, New York, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; in a context related to [[Group representation|representation theory]] in mathematics (cf. [[Weyl quantization]] in physics). In effect, it is the [[Wigner–Weyl transform]] of the density matrix, so the realization of that operator in phase space.  It was later rederived by Jean Ville in 1948 as a quadratic (in signal) [[Wigner distribution function|representation of the local time-frequency energy of a signal]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Ville, "Théorie et Applications de la Notion de Signal Analytique", ''Câbles et Transmission'', '''2''', 61–74 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; effectively a [[spectrogram]].

In 1949, [[José Enrique Moyal]], who had derived it independently, recognized it as the [[quantum]] moment-generating functional,&lt;ref&gt;[[José Enrique Moyal|J.E. Moyal]], "Quantum mechanics as a statistical theory", ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''45''', 99–124 (1949). {{DOI|10.1017/S0305004100000487}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus as the basis of an elegant encoding of all quantum expectation values, and hence quantum mechanics, in phase space (cf. [[phase space formulation]]). It has applications in [[statistical mechanics]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[quantum optics]], classical [[optics]] and signal analysis in diverse fields such as [[electrical engineering]], [[seismology]], [[time–frequency analysis for music signals]], [[spectrogram]]s in [[biology]] and speech processing, and [[Waterfall plot|engine design]].

== Relation to classical mechanics ==

A classical particle has a definite position and momentum, and hence it is represented by a point in phase space. Given a collection ([[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]]) of particles, the probability of finding a particle at a certain position in phase space is specified by a probability distribution, the Liouville density. This strict interpretation fails
for a quantum particle, due to the [[uncertainty principle]]. Instead, the above quasiprobability Wigner distribution plays an analogous role, but  does not satisfy all the properties of a conventional probability distribution; and, conversely, satisfies boundedness properties unavailable to classical distributions.

For instance, the Wigner distribution can and normally does take on negative values for states which have no classical model—and is a convenient indicator of quantum mechanical interference. (See below for a characterization of pure states whose Wigner functions are non-negative.)
Smoothing the Wigner distribution through a filter of size larger than {{mvar|ħ}} (e.g., convolving with a
phase-space Gaussian, a [[Weierstrass transform]], to yield the [[#Other related quasiprobability distributions|Husimi representation]], below), results in a positive-semidefinite function, i.e., it may be thought to have been coarsened to a semi-classical one.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, since this convolution is invertible, in fact, no information has been sacrificed, and the full quantum entropy has not increased, yet.  However, if this resulting Husimi distribution is then used as a plain measure in a phase-space integral evaluation of expectation values ''without the requisite star product of the Husimi representation'', then, at that stage,  quantum information ''has been forfeited'' and the distribution ''is a semi-classical one'', effectively. That is, depending on its usage in evaluating expectation values, the very '''same distribution may serve as a quantum or a classical distribution function'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions of such negative value are provable (by convolving them with a small Gaussian) to be "small":  they cannot extend to compact regions larger than a few  {{mvar|ħ}}, and hence disappear in the [[classical limit]]. They are shielded by the [[uncertainty principle]], which does not allow precise  location within phase-space regions smaller than {{mvar|ħ}}, and thus renders such "[[negative probability|negative probabilities]]" less paradoxical.

== Definition and meaning ==

The Wigner distribution {{math|''P''(''x'',''p'')}} of a pure state is defined as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; P(x,p)~\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}~\frac{1}{\pi\hbar}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x+y)\psi(x-y)e^{2ipy/\hbar}\,dy\,&lt;/math&gt;

|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
&lt;!--PLEASE DESIST FROM WANTONLY FLIPPING SIGNS BEFORE DISCUSSING IN TALKPAGE AND ASCERTAINING CONSISTENCY OF DEFINITIONS: YOU HAVE PROBABLY IGNORED SOMETHING IF THE SIGNS DISAGREE WITH YOU    --&gt;
where {{mvar|ψ}}  is the wavefunction and {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}} are position and momentum but could be any conjugate variable pair (i.e. real and imaginary parts of the electric field or frequency and time of a signal). Note that it may have support in {{mvar|x}}    even in regions where {{mvar|ψ}}  has no support in {{mvar|x}} ("beats").

It is symmetric in {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}},
:&lt;math&gt; P(x,p)=\frac{1}{\pi\hbar}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi^*(p+q)\varphi(p-q)e^{-2ixq/\hbar}\,dq&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|φ}} is the [[Fourier transform]] of {{mvar|ψ}}.

In 3D,
:&lt;math&gt; P(\vec{r},\vec{p}) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^3} \int \psi^*(\vec{r} + \hbar\vec{s}/2) \psi (\vec{r} - \hbar\vec{s}/2) e^{i\vec{p} \cdot \vec{s}} \, d^3 s. &lt;/math&gt;

In the general case, which includes mixed states, it is the Wigner transform of the  [[density matrix]],
:&lt;math&gt; P(x,p)=\frac{1}{\pi\hbar}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \langle x+y| \hat{\rho} |x-y \rangle e^{-2ipy/\hbar}\,dy,  &lt;/math&gt;
where  ⟨''x''|''ψ''⟩ = {{math|''ψ(x)''}}.  This [[#The Wigner–Weyl transformation|Wigner transformation]] (or map) is the inverse of the [[Weyl quantization|Weyl transform]], which maps phase-space functions to [[Hilbert space|Hilbert-space]] operators, in [[Weyl quantization]].

Thus, the Wigner function is the cornerstone of [[quantum mechanics]] in [[phase space]].

In 1949, [[José Enrique Moyal]] elucidated
how the Wigner function provides the integration measure (analogous
to a [[probability density function]]) in phase space, to yield [[expected value|expectation values]] from phase-space [[c-number]] functions {{math|''g''(''x'',''p'')}} uniquely associated to suitably ordered operators {{math|''Ĝ''}} through Weyl's transform (cf. [[Wigner–Weyl transform]] and property 7 below), in a manner evocative of classical [[probability theory]].

Specifically, an operator's  {{math|''Ĝ''}}  expectation value is a "phase-space average" of the Wigner transform of that operator,
: &lt;math&gt;\langle  \hat{G}  \rangle =\int\! dx \,dp~ P(x,p)~ g(x,p)   ~.  &lt;/math&gt;

== Mathematical properties ==

[[File:Wigner functions.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1:  The Wigner quasiprobability distribution for a) the vacuum b) An ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;1 [[Fock state]] (e.g. a single photon) c) An ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;5 Fock state.]]
1.  ''P''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is a real valued function.

2.  The ''x'' and ''p'' probability distributions are given by the [[Marginal distribution|marginals]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dp\,P(x,p)=\langle x|\hat{\rho}|x \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;  If the system can be described by a [[pure state]], one gets &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dp\,P(x,p)= |\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\,P(x,p)=\langle p|\hat{\rho}|p \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If the system can be described by a [[pure state]], one has &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\,P(x,p)=|\varphi(p)|^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\int_{-\infty}^\infty dp\,P(x,p)=Tr(\hat{\rho})&lt;/math&gt;
* Typically the trace of the density matrix  ''ρ̂'' is equal to 1.

3.  ''P''(''x'', ''p'') has the following reflection symmetries:
* Time symmetry: &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \rightarrow \psi(x)^* \Rightarrow P(x,p) \rightarrow P(x,-p)&lt;/math&gt;
* Space symmetry: &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \rightarrow \psi(-x) \Rightarrow P(x,p) \rightarrow P(-x,-p)&lt;/math&gt;

4.  ''P''(''x'', ''p'') is Galilei-covariant:
* &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \rightarrow \psi(x+y) \Rightarrow P(x,p) \rightarrow P(x+y,p)&lt;/math&gt;
* It is not [[Lorentz covariant]].

5.  The equation of motion for each point in the phase space is classical in the absence of forces:
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial P(x,p)}{\partial t}=\frac{-p}{m}\frac{\partial P(x,p)}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, it is classical even in the presence of harmonic forces.

6.  State overlap is calculated as:
* &lt;math&gt;|\langle \psi|\theta \rangle|^2=2\pi\hbar\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\,\int_{-\infty}^\infty dp\,P_{\psi}(x,p)P_{\theta}(x,p)&lt;/math&gt;

7.  Operator expectation values (averages) are calculated as
phase-space averages of the respective Wigner transforms:
* &lt;math&gt;g(x,p)\equiv\int_{-\infty}^\infty dy\, \langle x-y/2| \hat{G} |x+y/2 \rangle e^{ipy/\hbar},&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\langle \psi|\hat{G}|\psi\rangle=Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{G})=\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, \int_{-\infty}^\infty dp P(x,p)g(x,p).
&lt;/math&gt;

8.  In order that ''P''(''x'', ''p'') represent physical (positive) density matrices:
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, \int_{-\infty}^\infty dp\, P(x,p)P_\theta(x,p) \ge 0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
for all pure states |θ〉.

9. By virtue of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], for a pure state, it is constrained to be  bounded,
* &lt;math&gt; -\frac 2 h \leq P(x,p)  \leq \frac 2 h.&lt;/math&gt;

This bound disappears in the classical limit, ''ħ'' → 0.   In this limit, ''P''(''x'', ''p'')  reduces to the probability density in coordinate space ''x'', usually highly localized, multiplied by  δ-functions in momentum: the classical limit is "spiky".  Thus, this quantum-mechanical bound precludes a Wigner function which is a perfectly localized delta function in phase space, as a reflection of the uncertainty principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T.

{{Main|Wigner–Weyl transform|Phase space formulation}}

[[File:SmallDisplacedGaussianWF.gif|220px|left|thumb|Figure 2: Wigner function for the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] ground state, displaced from the origin of phase space (i.e., a [[coherent state]]). (Click to animate.) Note the rigid rotation, identical to classical motion: this is a special feature of the SHO. From the general pedagogy web-site.&lt;ref&gt;Curtright, T.L., [http://www.physics.miami.edu/~curtright/TimeDependentWignerFunctions.html Time-dependent Wigner Functions]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Wigner transformation''' is a general invertible transformation of an operator  {{math|''Ĝ''}} on a [[Hilbert space]] to a function ''g(x,p)''   on [[phase space]], and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;g(x,p)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty ds ~e^{ips/\hbar} \left.\left\langle x-\frac s2\right. \right|\ \hat G\ \left.\left|x+\frac s2 \right. \right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Hermitian operators map to real functions. The inverse of this transformation,
so from phase space to Hilbert space, is called the '''[[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl transformation]]''',
:&lt;math&gt;  \langle x |\ \hat G\ | y \rangle= \int_{-\infty}^\infty {dp \over h} ~
e^{ip(x-y)/\hbar}  g\left({x+y\over 2},p\right),&lt;/math&gt;
(not to be confused with another definition of the [[Weyl transformation]]).

The '''Wigner function''' ''P''(''x,p'') discussed here is thus seen to be the Wigner transform  of the [[density matrix]] operator ''ρ̂''. Thus,  the trace of an operator with the density matrix Wigner-transforms to the equivalent phase-space integral overlap of ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') with the Wigner function.

The Wigner transform of the [[Density matrix|von Neumann evolution equation]] of the density matrix in the [[Schrödinger picture]] is
;''Moyal's evolution equation'' for the Wigner function,
::&lt;math&gt;{\partial P(x,p,t) \over \partial t} = - \{\{ P(x,p ,t) ~,~ H(x,p)\}\}~,&lt;/math&gt;
where H(x,p) is Hamiltonian and { {•, •} } is the [[Moyal bracket]]. In the classical limit ''ħ'' → 0, the Moyal bracket reduces to the Poisson bracket, while this evolution equation reduces to the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Poisson bracket|Liouville equation]] of classical statistical mechanics.

Strictly formally, in terms of [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum characteristics]],  the solution of
this evolution equation reads, &lt;math&gt; P(x,p,t) = P(\star (x_{-t}(x,p),p_{-t}(x,p)),0)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;x_{t}(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{t}(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; are solutions of
so-called [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum Hamilton's equations]], subject to initial conditions
&lt;math&gt;x_{t=0}(x,p) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{t=0}(x,p)=p&lt;/math&gt;, and where [[Moyal product|&lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-product]]
composition is understood for all argument functions.

Since, however,  &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-composition is thoroughly nonlocal (the "quantum probability fluid" diffuses, as observed by Moyal),  vestiges of local trajectories
are normally barely discernible  in the evolution of  the Wigner distribution function.&lt;ref&gt;Quantum characteristics should not be confused with
trajectories of the Feynman path integral, or trajectories of the
[[de Broglie-Bohm theory|de Broglie – Bohm theory]].
This three-fold ambiguity  allows better understanding of  the position of [[Niels Bohr]],
who, vigorously but counterproductively, opposed the notion of trajectory in the atomic physics.
At the 1948 Pocono Conference, e.g., he said to [[Richard Feynman]]: "… one could not talk about the trajectory of an electron in the atom,
because it was something not observable."
("The Beat of a Different Drum: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman", by Jagdish Mehra (Oxford, 1994, pp. 245-248)).
Arguments of this kind were widely used in the past by [[Ernst Mach]] in his criticism of an atomic theory of physics
and later, in the 1960's, by [[Geoffrey Chew]], [[Tullio Regge]] and others to motivate replacing the local quantum field theory
by the [[S-matrix]] theory.
Today, statistical physics entirely based on atomistic concepts is included in standard courses,
the S-matrix theory went out of fashion, while the Feynman path integral method has been recognized as the most efficient method in [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the integral representation of &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-products, successive operations by them have been adapted to a phase-space path-integral, to  solve this evolution equation for the Wigner function &lt;ref&gt;

== Classical limit ==
The Wigner function allows one to study the [[classical limit]], offering a comparison of the classical and quantum dynamics in phase space.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]: Decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical – revisited, Los Alamos Science, 27, 2002, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306072 arXiv:quant-ph/0306072], pp. 15 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: C. Zachos, D. Fairlie, T. Curtright: ''Quantum mechanics in phase space: an overview with selected papers, World Scientific, 2005   {{isbn|978-981-4520-43-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been suggested that the Wigner function approach can be viewed as a quantum analogy to the operatorial formulation of classical mechanics introduced in 1932 by [[Bernard Koopman]] and [[John von Neumann]]: the time evolution of the Wigner function approaches, in the limit ''ħ'' → 0, the time evolution of the [[Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction]] of a classical particle.&lt;ref&gt;Denys I. Bondar, Renan Cabrera, Dmitry V. Zhdanov, Herschel A. Rabitz: Wigner Function's Negativity Demystified [https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3628v2 arXiv:1202.3628v2 (quant-phys)] (submitted February 2012, version of 3 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renan Cabrera, Denys I. Bondar, Herschel A. Rabitz: Relativistic Wigner function and consistent classical limit for spin 1/2 particles, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5139v2 arXiv:1107.5139v2] (submitted on 26 July 2011, version of 22 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positivity of the Wigner function==
As already noted, the Wigner function of quantum state typically takes some negative values. Indeed, for a pure state in one variable, if &lt;math&gt;P(x,p)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then the wave function must have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=e^{-ax^2+bx+c}&lt;/math&gt;
for some complex numbers &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}(a)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (Hudson's theorem&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Robin L. "When is the Wigner quasi-probability density non-negative?." ''Reports on Mathematical Physics'' '''6.2''' (1974): 249-252.&lt;/ref&gt;). Note that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to be complex, so that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily a Gaussian wave packet in the usual sense. Thus, pure states with non-negative Wigner functions are not necessarily minimum uncertainty states in the sense of the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty formula]]; rather, they give equality in the [[Uncertainty principle#Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations|Schrödinger uncertainty formula]], which includes an anticommutator term in addition to the commutator term.

In higher dimensions, the characterization of pure states with non-negative Wigner functions is similar; the wave function must have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=e^{-(x,Ax)+b\cdot x+c}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric complex matrix whose real part is positive definite, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a complex vector, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number.&lt;ref&gt;F. Soto and P. Claverie, "When is the Wigner function of multidimensional systems nonnegative?", ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'' '''24''' (1983) 97-100&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner function of any such state is a Gaussian distribution on phase space.

The cited paper of Soto and Claverie gives an elegant proof of this characterization, using the [[Segal–Bargmann space#The Segal–Bargmann transform|Segal–Bargmann transform]]. The reasoning is as follows. The [[Husimi Q representation|Husimi Q function]] of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; may be computed as the squared magnitude of the Segal–Bargmann transform of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by a Gaussian. Meanwhile, the Husimi Q function is the convolution of the Wigner function with a Gaussian. If the Wigner function of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative everywhere on phase space, then the Husimi Q function will be strictly positive everywhere on phase space. Thus, the Segal–Bargmann transform &lt;math&gt;F(x+ip)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; will be nowhere zero. Thus, by a standard result from complex analysis, we have
:&lt;math&gt;F(x+ip)=e^{g(x+ip)}&lt;/math&gt;
for some holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. But in order for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to belong to the [[Segal–Bargmann space]]—that is, for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to be square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure—&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; must have at most quadratic growth at infinity. From this, elementary complex analysis can be used to show that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; must actually be a quadratic polynomial. Thus, we obtain an explicit form of the Segal–Bargmann transform of any pure state whose Wigner function is non-negative. We can then invert the Segal–Bargmann transform to obtain the claimed form of the position wave function.

There does not appear to be any simple characterization of [[density matrix|mixed states]] with non-negative Wigner functions.

== The Wigner function in relation to other interpretations of quantum mechanics ==
It has been shown that the Wigner quasiprobability distribution function can be regarded as an {{mvar|ħ}}-[[Deformation theory|deformation]] of another phase space distribution function that describes an ensemble of [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm]] causal trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Nuno Costa Dias, Joao Nuno Prata, Bohmian trajectories and quantum phase space distributions, Physics Letters A vol.&amp;nbsp;302 (2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;261-272, {{DOI|10.1016/S0375-9601(02)01175-1}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208156v1 arXiv:quant-ph/0208156v1] (submitted 26 August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Hiley]] has shown that the quasi-probability distribution may be understood as the [[density matrix]] re-expressed in terms of a mean position and momentum of a "cell" in phase space, and the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation allows one to describe the dynamics of the centers of such "cells".&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Hiley: ''Phase space descriptions of quantum phenomena'', in: A. Khrennikov (ed.): ''Quantum Theory: Re-consideration of Foundations–2'', pp.&amp;nbsp;267-286, Växjö University Press, Sweden, 2003 ([http://www.birkbeck.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/ShadowPhaseVajxo03.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Hiley: ''Moyal's characteristic function, the density matrix and von Neumann's idempotent'' ([http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/Moyal&amp;DensityMatrix.pdf preprint])&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a close connection between the description of quantum states in terms of the Wigner function and a method of quantum states reconstruction in terms of [[mutually unbiased bases]].&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Khanna, P.A. Mello, M. Revzen, Classical and Quantum Mechanical State Reconstruction, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3164v1 arXiv:1112.3164v1] [quant-ph] (submitted December 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the Wigner function outside quantum mechanics ==
[[File:Chirpedpulse.jpg|thumb|Figure 8: A contour plot of the Wigner–Ville distribution for a chirped pulse of light. The plot makes it obvious that the frequency is a linear function of time.]]
* In the modelling of optical systems such as telescopes or fibre telecommunications devices, the Wigner function is used to bridge the gap between simple [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] and the full wave analysis of the system.  Here {{math|''p/ħ''}}    is replaced with {{math|''k'' {{=}} {{!}}''k''{{!}}sin''θ'' ≈ {{!}}''k''{{!}}''θ''}} in the small angle (paraxial) approximation.  In this context, the Wigner function is the closest one can get to describing the system in terms of rays at position {{mvar|x}} and angle {{mvar|θ}} while still including the effects of interference.&lt;ref&gt;I Bazarov, ''Phys Rev  ST Accel  Beams''  '''15''' (2012) 050703,  {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.15.050703}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  If it becomes negative at any point, then simple ray-tracing will not suffice to model the system. That is to say, negative values of this function are a symptom of the [[Uncertainty principle#Signal processing|Gabor limit]] of the classical light signal and ''not'' of quantum features of light associated with {{mvar|ħ}}.
* In [[signal analysis]], a time-varying electrical signal, mechanical vibration, or sound wave are represented by a [[Wigner distribution function|Wigner function]].  Here, {{mvar|x}} is replaced with the time and {{math|''p/ħ''}}   is replaced with the angular frequency {{math|''ω'' {{=}} 2π''f''}}, where {{mvar|f}}  is the regular frequency.
* In ultrafast optics, short laser pulses are characterized with the Wigner function using the same {{mvar|f}}  and {{mvar|t}} substitutions as above.  Pulse defects such as chirp (the change in frequency with time) can be visualized with the Wigner function. See Figure&amp;nbsp;8.
* In quantum optics, {{mvar|x}}  and {{math|''p/ħ''}}   are replaced with the {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|P}} quadratures, the real and imaginary components of the electric field (see [[coherent state]]). The plots in Figure 4 are of quantum states of light.

== Measurements of the Wigner function ==
* [[Tomography]]
* [[Homodyne detection]]
* [[Frequency-resolved optical gating]]

== Other related quasiprobability distributions ==
{{Main|Quasiprobability distribution}}

The Wigner distribution was the first quasiprobability distribution to be formulated, but many more followed, formally equivalent and transformable to and from it (viz. [[Transformation between distributions in time–frequency analysis]]). As in the case of coordinate systems, on account of varying properties, several such have with various advantages for specific applications:
* [[Glauber P representation]]
* [[Husimi Q representation]]
Nevertheless, in some sense, the Wigner distribution holds  a privileged position among all these distributions, since it is the ''only one'' whose requisite star product  drops out (integrates out by parts to effective unity) in the evaluation of expectation values, as illustrated above, and so ''can'' be visualized as a quasiprobability measure analogous to the classical ones.

== Historical note ==

As indicated, the formula for the Wigner function was independently derived several times in different contexts.  In fact, apparently, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] was unaware that even within the context of quantum theory, it had been introduced previously by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|W. Heisenberg]], "Über die inkohärente Streuung von Röntgenstrahlen", ''Physik. Zeitschr.'' '''32''', 737–740 (1931); [[Paul Dirac|P.A.M. Dirac]], "Note on exchange phenomena in the Thomas atom", ''Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.'' '''26''', 376–395 (1930). {{DOI|10.1017/S0305004100016108}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit purely formally: these two  missed its significance, and that of its negative values, as they merely considered it as an approximation to the full quantum description of a system such as the atom.  (Incidentally, Dirac would later become Wigner's brother-in-law, marrying his sister [[Eugene Wigner#Middle years|Manci]].) Symmetrically, in most of his legendary 18-month correspondence with [[José Enrique Moyal|Moyal]] in the mid-1940s, Dirac was unaware that Moyal's quantum-moment generating function was effectively the Wigner function, and it was Moyal who finally brought it to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Moyal, (2006), "Maverick Mathematician: The Life and Science of J.E. Moyal," ANU E-press, 2006, {{isbn|1-920942-59-9}},  accessed by  http://epress.anu.edu.au/maverick_citation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Whewell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FGS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|əl}} {{respell|HEW|əl}}; 24 May 1794 – 6 March 1866) was an [[English people|English]] [[polymath]], [[scientist]], [[Anglican]] [[priest]], [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], and [[History of science|historian of science]]. He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].  In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics.

What is most often remarked about Whewell is the breadth of his endeavours.  In a time of increasing specialisation, Whewell appears as a vestige of an earlier era when natural philosophers dabbled in a bit of everything. He researched ocean tides (for which he won the [[Royal Medal]]), published work in the disciplines of [[mechanics]], [[physics]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], and [[economics]], while also finding the time to compose [[poetry]], author a [[Bridgewater Treatise]], translate the works of [[Goethe]], and write [[sermon]]s and [[Theology|theological]] tracts.  In [[mathematics]], Whewell introduced what is now called the [[Whewell equation]], an equation defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.

One of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with [[neologism|new terms]] for their discoveries.  Whewell contributed the terms [[scientist]], [[physicist]], [[linguistics]], [[consilience]], [[catastrophism]], [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and [[astigmatism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=2013|title=Evolution and impact of eye and vision terms in written English|url=http://oculistmd.wordpress.com/article/evolution-and-impact-of-eye-and-vision-terms-in-written-english/|journal=[[JAMA Ophthalmol.|JAMA Ophthalmology]]|volume=131|issue=12|pages=1625–31|doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.917|pmid=24337558|via=|vauthors=Leffler CT, Schwartz SG, Stackhouse R, Davenport B, Spetzler K|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223122215/http://oculistmd.wordpress.com/article/evolution-and-impact-of-eye-and-vision-terms-in-written-english/|archivedate=2014-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others; Whewell suggested the terms [[electrode]], [[ion]], [[dielectric]], [[anode]], and [[cathode]] to [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chimie.scola.ac-paris.fr/sitedechimie/hist_chi/text_origin/faraday/Faraday-electrochem.htm |title=On Electrical Decomposition |year=1834 |accessdate=2010-01-17 |publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq8a85S3?url=http://chimie.scola.ac-paris.fr/sitedechimie/hist_chi/text_origin/faraday/Faraday-electrochem.htm |archivedate=2010-01-17 |dead-url=yes |last=Faraday |first=Michael |df= }} In this article Faraday coins the words ''electrode'', ''[[anode]]'', ''[[cathode]]'', ''[[anion]]'', ''[[cation]]'', ''[[electrolyte]]'', and ''[[electrolyze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.

==Life and career==

Whewell was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. His father, a carpenter, wished him to follow his trade, but his success in [[mathematics]] at [[Lancaster Grammar School|Lancaster]] and [[Heversham Grammar School|Heversham]] [[grammar school]]s won him an [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] (a type of scholarship) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1812). In 1814 he was awarded the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A Complete Collection of the English Poems which Have Obtained the Chancellor's Gold Medal in the University of Cambridge|publisher=W. Metcalfe|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gw6GyHofIIAC|author=University of Cambridge|format=PDF|year=1859|accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Second Wrangler]] in 1816, President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] in 1817, became fellow and tutor of his college, and, in 1841, succeeded [[Christopher Wordsworth (Trinity)|Christopher Wordsworth]] as master. He was professor of [[mineralogy]] from 1828 to 1832 and [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy]] (then called "moral theology and casuistical divinity") from 1838 to 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WHWL811W|name=Whewell, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whewell married, firstly, in 1841, Cordelia Marshall, daughter of [[John Marshall (industrialist)|John Marshall]]; she died in 1855. In 1858 he married again, to Everina Frances (née Ellis), widow of Sir Gilbert Affleck, 5th Baronet; who died in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=29200|first=Richard|last=Yeo|title=Whewell, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: MAR 1866 3b 353 CAMBRIDGE – William Whewell, aged 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Full bibliographical details are given by Isaac Todhunter, ''William Whewell: An Account of his Writings, with selection from his literary and scientific correspondence'', London: Macmillan, 1876, ([https://archive.org/stream/williamwhewelld01whewgoog#page/n6/mode/2up volume 1], [https://archive.org/stream/williamwhewelld03whewgoog#page/n6/mode/2up volume 2)].

==Endeavours==

===History and development of science===
[[File:William Whewell.jpg|thumb|right|William Whewell, c. 1860s]]
His best-known works are two voluminous books which attempt to systematize the development of the sciences, ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1837) and ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History'' (1840).  While the ''History'' traced how each branch of the sciences had evolved since antiquity, Whewell viewed the ''Philosophy'' as the "Moral" of the previous work as it sought to extract a universal theory of knowledge through history. In the latter, he attempted to follow [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s plan for discovery. He examined ideas ("explication of conceptions") and by the "colligation of facts" endeavoured to unite these ideas with the facts and so construct science.

===Whewell's three steps of induction===
Whewell analysed [[inductive reasoning]] into three steps:
* The selection of the (fundamental) idea, such as space, number, cause, or likeness (resemblance);
* The formation of the conception, or more special modification of those ideas, as a circle, a uniform force, etc.; and,
* The determination of magnitudes.

Upon these follow special methods of induction applicable to quantity: the method of curves, the method of means, the method of least squares and the method of residues, and special methods depending on resemblance (to which the transition is made through the law of continuity), such as the method of gradation and the method of natural classification. In ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' Whewell was the first to use the term "[[consilience]]" to discuss the unification of knowledge between the different branches of learning.

===Opponent of English empiricism===
Here, as in his [[ethics|ethical]] doctrine, Whewell was moved by opposition to contemporary [[Empiricism|English empiricism]]. Following [[Immanuel Kant]], he asserted against [[John Stuart Mill]] the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' nature of [[Logical truth|necessary truth]], and by his rules for the construction of conceptions he dispensed with the inductive methods of Mill.

===Whewell's neologisms===
As stated, one of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with [[neologism|new terms]] for their discoveries.  In fact, Whewell came up with the term ''[[scientist]]'' itself in 1833, and it was first published in Whewell's anonymous 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''[[On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences]]'' published in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Ross1962&gt;{{Cite journal| format = PDF | author = Ross, Sydney | year = 1962 | title = Scientist: The story of a word | journal = [[Annals of Science]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–85 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf | accessdate = 2011-03-08 | doi = 10.1080/00033796200202722| ref = harv}} To be exact, the person coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as "some ingenious gentleman." Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; (They had previously been known as "natural philosophers" or "men of science").

==Work in college administration==
[[File:Statue of William Whewell at Trinity College, Cambridge.jpg|thumb|Statue of Whewell by [[Thomas Woolner]] in [[Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge]] ]]
Whewell was prominent not only in scientific research and philosophy, but also in [[university]] and college administration. His first work, ''An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics'' (1819), cooperated with those of [[George Peacock]] and [[John Herschel]] in reforming the Cambridge method of mathematical teaching. His work and publications also helped influence the recognition of the moral and natural sciences as an integral part of the Cambridge curriculum. In general, however, especially in later years, he opposed reform: he defended the [[tutorial system]], and in a controversy with [[Connop Thirlwall]] (1834), opposed the admission of [[Dissenter]]s; he upheld the clerical fellowship system, the privileged class of "fellow-commoners," and the authority of heads of colleges in university affairs. He opposed the appointment of the University Commission (1850), and wrote two pamphlets (''Remarks'') against the reform of the university (1855). He stood against the scheme of entrusting elections to the members of the senate and instead, advocated the use of college funds and the subvention of scientific and professorial work.

He was elected Master of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1841, and retained that position until his death in 1866.

The [[Whewell Professorship of International Law]] and the Whewell Scholarships were established  through the provisions of his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |pages=49–50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSi0S7aH320C&amp;pg=PA49 |isbn=9780521137454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. William Whewell laid in his will: "an earnest an express injunction on the occupant of this chair that he should make it his aim in all parts of his treatment of the subject, to lay down such rules and suggest such measures as might tend to diminish the evils of war and finally to extinguish war among nations.

==Whewell's interests in architecture==
Aside from Science, Whewell was also interested in the [[history of architecture]] throughout his life.  He is best known for his writings on [[Gothic architecture]], specifically his book, ''Architectural Notes on German Churches'' (first published in 1830).  In this work, Whewell established a strict nomenclature for German Gothic churches and came up with a theory of stylistic development.  His work is associated with the "scientific trend" of architectural writers, along with [[Thomas Rickman]] and [[Robert Willis (architect)|Robert Willis]].

He paid from his own resources for the construction of two new courts of rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, built in a Gothic style.  The two courts were completed in 1860 and (posthumously) in 1868, and are now collectively named [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Other courts|Whewell's Court]] (in the singular).

==Whewell's works in philosophy and morals==
[[File:William Whewell portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait by [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]]]]
Between 1835 and 1861 Whewell produced various works on the philosophy of [[moral]]s and [[politics]], the chief of which, ''Elements of Morality'', including ''Polity'', was published in 1845. The peculiarity of this work—written from what is known as the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitional point of view]]—is its fivefold division of the springs of action and of their objects, of the primary and universal rights of man (personal security, property, contract, family rights and government), and of the cardinal virtues ([[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[justice]], [[truth]], [[wiktionary:Purity|purity]] and [[Social order|order]]).

Among Whewell's other works—too numerous to mention—were popular writings such as the third ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' ''Astronomy and General Physics considered with reference to Natural Theology'' (1833), and the essay, ''Of the Plurality of Worlds'' (1853), in which he argued against the [[probability]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|life on other planets]], and also the ''[[Plato]]nic Dialogues for English Readers'' (1850–1861), the ''Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy in England'' (1852), the essay, ''Of a Liberal Education in General, with particular reference to the Leading Studies of the University of Cambridge'' (1845), the important edition and abridged translation of [[Hugo Grotius]], ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (1853), and the edition of the ''Mathematical Works'' of [[Isaac Barrow]] (1860).&lt;ref&gt;''Grotius on the Right of War and Peace, An Abridged Translation by William Whewell'', Cambridge: At the University Press, 1853 [https://archive.org/stream/onrightsofwarpea00grotuoft#page/n7/mode/2up at Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mathematical Works of Isaac Barrow, D.D., edited for Triniity College by W. Whewell'', Cambridge: At University Press, 1860, [https://archive.org/stream/mathematicalwor00whewgoog#page/n4/mode/2up at Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whewell was one of the Cambridge [[University don|don]]s whom [[Charles Darwin]] met during [[Charles Darwin's education|his education there]], and when Darwin returned from [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the ''Beagle'' voyage]] he was directly influenced by Whewell, who persuaded Darwin to become secretary of the [[Geological Society of London]]. The title pages of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' open with a quotation from Whewell's ''Bridgewater Treatise'' about science founded on a [[natural theology]] of a creator establishing laws:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

"But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so
far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by
insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular
case, but by the establishment of general laws."

In mathematics, an '''[[Eta|η]] set''' is a type of [[totally ordered set]] introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Hausdorff|year1=1907|loc1=p.126|year2=1914|loc2=chapter 6 section 8}} that generalizes the order type η of the rational numbers.

==Definition==

If α is an ordinal then a η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set is a totally ordered set such that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are two subsets of cardinality less than [[Aleph number|ℵ]]&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; such that every element of ''X'' is less than every element of ''Y'' then there is some element greater than all elements of ''X'' and less than all elements of ''Y''.

==Examples==

The only non-empty countable η&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; set (up to isomorphism) is the ordered set of rational numbers.

Suppose that κ=ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a regular cardinal and let ''X'' be the set of all functions ''f'' from κ to {−1,0,1} such that if ''f''(α) = 0 then ''f''(β) = 0 for all β&gt;α, ordered lexicographically. Then ''X'' is a η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set. The union of all these sets is the class of [[surreal number]]s.

A dense totally ordered set without endpoints is a η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set if and only if it is [[saturated model|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; saturated]].

==Properties==

Any η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set ''X'' is universal for totally ordered sets of cardinality at most ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that any such set can be embedded into ''X''.

For any given ordinal α, any two η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; sets of cardinality  ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic (as ordered sets). An η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set of cardinality  ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; exists if ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is regular and ∑&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;α&lt;/sub&gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.
