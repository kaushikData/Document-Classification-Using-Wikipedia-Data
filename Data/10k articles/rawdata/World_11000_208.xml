      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">The [http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/peace/Lib%2019950819.pdf '''Abuja Agreement'''] was a peace treaty signed on 19 August 1995 in an attempt to secure peace from [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] leader, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]] in the [[First Liberian Civil War]].  The agreement was another in a list of treaties attempting to bring peace to [[Liberia]], being preceded by the [[Cotonou Accord]] on 25 July 1993, the [[Akosombo Agreement]] on 12 August 1994, and its Accra Clarification.

The agreement set up a Council of State of Liberia, which was to consist of a chair, and five members: [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], LTG. [[G. V. Kromah]] ([[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]]), Dr. [[George Boley]] Sr.  (LNC), [[Oscar Jaryee Quiah]] ([[Liberian National Conference]]), and Chief [[Tamba Tailor]]. According to the accords, the first holder of the rotating chairmanship was to be [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]], but the position was actually first held by [[David D. Kpormakor]].  The council's third and final chair, [[Ruth Perry]], handed power to Taylor following elections in July 1997.

'''B5 aktuell''' is a German, public [[radio station]] owned and operated by the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (BR).
== History ==
B5 aktuell launched on May 6, 1991 at 6:00am and took over the additional frequency of BR4, over which until then the evening ARD-Gastarbeitersendungen broadcasts, as well as some special parliamentary debates or other events were adopted. Model was the French news channel France Info of Radio France. Later, other stations in Germany took over the concept of B5 aktuell, such as MDR Info (1992), Inforadio from RBB (1995), NDR Info (1998), hr-info (2004), SWRinfo (2012) and DRS 4 News in Switzerland (2007). As one of the first ARD radio stations on the Internet B5 has been online since November 1995. On September 8, 2011 B5 was recently awarded the German Radio Prize in the "Best News Format" category.
== Contents ==
Main features of the program structure on the air are the 15-minute rolling news blocks. The information blocks on the hour and half hour are designed for a length of 8 minutes and are presented by editors. In these info-blocks there are also correspondent contributions and o-tones. At XY: 15 and XY: 45 clock come five-minute news without recordings, read by newscasters. The last minutes of the block are filled with various in-depth contributions to certain topics after a program clock, then at XY: 08 a block with news only from Bavaria and XY: 55 a block with sports news aired. A stock market update is read every 2 blocks, and local traffic and weather news is read in every block.

B5 currently also transmits selected sports events, such as International matches of the national football team, the Champions League (here the games of FC Bayern Munich) and the ARD Bundesliga conference live, sometimes in full length.

To expand the offer of live broadcasts, launched on 8 October 2007, B5 plus was launched to provide additional sporting events and live scores from the German Bundestag and the Bavarian state parliament transfers, alongside extended breaking news coverage. At all other times, B5 plus relays B5 aktuell.
== Listening figures and broadcasts ==
B5 aktuell currently broadcasts from 6am to midnight (in the remaining time the ARD-Infonacht is taken over) and is transmitted in Bavaria nationwide over ultra short wave VHF and via DAB + in the channel 11D. In Südtirol, the broadcaster is broadcast by the broadcaster Rundfunk-Anstalt Südtirol in the standard DAB +. Europe-wide B5 is currently receivable via DVB-S and DVB-C. Worldwide, the program can be heard via livestream. In addition, there are individual programs as a podcast. The shortwave broadcasting (digital on 6085 kHz in DRM mode since May 2, 2005) on the transmitter Ismaning was set on October 1, 2010.

The current RDS PTY code for B5 is 02 ("Current Affairs") because the vast majority of the broadcasting time are backgrounds, debates, analyzes, and the like. However, it will be permanently marked with RDS PTY code 01 ("News", Messages) sent; a nationwide exception. In particular, car radios often offer the possibility to emphasize messages in addition to traffic using dynamic PTY: for example, transmits the German radio basically code 03 ("Information"), only during the news 01, however, which allows radios to temporarily change channels and adjust the volume. Due to the continuous transmission of the message code at B5 aktuell, there could be an effect known as station-kidnapping, because the radio remains on the transmitter until the message function of the device is deactivated or the transmission area is left again.

B5 aktuell currently has around 590,000 listeners in Bavaria every day, which corresponds to a market share of 5.3%. In addition, there are around 40,000 in other states.

'''Belsat TV''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: {{lang|be|Белсат}}, {{lang|be-Latn|Biełsat}}, [[English language|English]]: Belsat) is a satellite television channel aimed at [[Belarus]]. It is intended to provide an alternative to the [[Censorship in Belarus|censorship]] of [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|Belarusian state-run television]]. Its [[slogan]] is "Belsat - your right to choose". The channel broadcasts in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], and is intended to provide entertainment and news of a standard comparable to the major TV channels of [[East-Central Europe]].

Belsat is run under the aegis of Polish state-run television company [[Telewizja Polska|Telewizja Polska (TVP)]], and is based primarily in [[Poland]], where there is a significant [[Belarusian minority in Poland|Belarusian minority]]. It started broadcasting on 10 December 2007. The channel is run by about 70 [[journalist]]s located in Poland, Belarus, and [[Lithuania]].

==Criticism==
The [[President of Belarus]], [[Alexander Lukashenko]], has called Belsat a "stupid, uncongenial and unfriendly project".&lt;ref&gt;{{be icon}} {{cite news |url=http://news.tut.by/86821.html |work=TUT.BY |date=26 March 2007 |title=Лукашенко: Независимый телеканал - "глупый, бестолковый и недружественный" проект }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the former political activist [[Ivan Shyla]] was fired from Belsat after having posted a photo of Poland's president [[Andrzej Duda]] and US president [[Donald Trump]] on his [[Facebook]] page. The photo was accompanied by a critical comment which the top managers of Belsat, including personally its director [[Agnieszka Romaszewska-Guzy]], who commented on the Facebook post, characterized as Shyla's disloyalty to Belsat&lt;ref name=nshyla2018nn/&gt; On the next day Ivan Shyla was removed from Belsat's editorial chats and received a message about his dismissal. The situation became a scandal and was covered by notable Belarusian and international media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=216293 Івана Шылу звольнілі з Белсата за жарт з прэзідэнта Польшчы ў фэйсбуку] [Ivan Shyla fired from Belsat for a Facebook joke about the Polish president] - [[Nasha Niva]], 20 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nshyla2018nn&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/polish-leader-resists-view-that-he-was-disrespected-by-trump/2018/09/21/d0a3e498-bd7a-11e8-8243-f3ae9c99658a_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9d2a4e012b46 Polish leader resists view that he was disrespected by Trump] - [[Washington Post]], 23 September 2018 г.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114881,23949145,pracownik-bielsatu-zwolniony-po-tym-jak-pokazal-zdjecie-dudy.html Pracownik Biełsatu zwolniony po tym, jak pokazał zdjęcie Dudy przy biurku Trumpa] [Belsat employee fired after posting photo of Duda at Trump's desk] - [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], 21 September 2018 г.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''berenklauw''' ('''Bear's claw''' in English) or '''spoetnik''' ('''[[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]]''' in English) is a deep-fried [[fast food]] snack from the [[Netherlands]]. It consists of a sliced [[meatball]] and fried [[onion|onion rings]] on a wooden [[skewer]], smothered in [[peanut sauce]] (also known as [[satay]] sauce) which originated in the [[Indonesian cuisine]]. The snack is also served with "Zigeunersaus" (literally translated: Gypsy-sauce), should one not like satay sauce. Sometimes, [[pineapple]] or [[bell pepper]] are used as well as onion rings.

The '''Budgetary treaties of the European Communities''' were two treaties in the 1970s amending the [[Treaty of Rome]] in respects to powers over the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]].

The first treaty, signed in 1970, gave the [[European Parliament]] the last word on what is known as "non-compulsory expenditure" (compulsory spending is that resulting from [[Treaties of the European Union|EC treaties]] (including [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]) and international agreements; the rest is non-compulsory). The second treaty, signed in 1975, gave Parliament the power to reject the budget as a whole and created the [[European Court of Auditors]]. However, the Council still has the last word on compulsory spending while Parliament has the last word on non-compulsory spending.&lt;ref name="budgetary power"&gt;{{cite web|title = Budgetary power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&amp;pageRank=5&amp;language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="budget decided"&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the budget decided?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/how_decided_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520130739/http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/how_decided_en.htm#|archive-date=2007-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these treaties, the budgetary authority of what is now the [[European Union]] is held jointly by the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Parliament]]. Parliament is responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets, on the basis of the annual report of the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]].&lt;ref name="budget background"&gt;{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] has the world's highest incidence rates of [[child labour]].

Although [[poverty]] is generally considered as the primary cause of child labour in Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernest Harsch|title=Child labour rooted in Africa's poverty|journal=Africa Recovery|volume=15|number=3|date=October 2001|pages=14–15|url=https://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/vol15no3/153chil4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, recent studies show that the relationship between child labour and poverty is not as simple as a downward linear relationship. For example, Oryoie, Alwang, and Tideman (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oryoie|first=Ali Reza|last2=Alwang|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Tideman|first3=Nicolaus|date=2017|title=Child Labor and Household Land Holding: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Zimbabwe|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.025|journal=World Development|volume=100|pages=45–58|doi=|issn=0305-750X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that child labour generally decreases as per capita land holding (as an indicator of a household's wealth in rural areas) increases, but there can be an upward bump in the relationship between child labour and landholding near the middle of the range of land per capita.

The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that agriculture is the largest employer of child labour in Africa. Vast majority are unpaid family workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on Child Labor - 2010|publisher=ILO, Geneva|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural history==
[[File:Kamerun children weaving cloth 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Africa has a long history of child labour. Above, colonial [[Cameroon]] children weaving in 1919.]]
Children in Africa have worked in farms and at home over a long history. This is not unique to Africa; large number of children have worked in agriculture and domestic situations in America, Europe and every other human society, throughout history, prior to 1950s. Scholars suggest that this work, specially in rural areas, was a form of schooling and vocational education, where children learned the arts and skills from their parents, and as adults continued to work in the same hereditary occupation. Bass claims this is particularly true in the African context.&lt;ref name=bass04&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labor in Sub-Saharan Africa|author=Loretta Bass|year=2004|isbn=978-1588262868|pages=30–43|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hh09&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labor|author=Beverly Grier (Ed: Hugh Hindman)|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2009|pages=173–177|isbn=978-0-7656-1707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa is a highly diverse and culturally continent. In parts of this continent, farming societies adhere to a system of patrilineal lineages and clans. The young train with the adults. The family and kinsfolk provide a cultural routine that help children learn useful practical skills and enables these societies to provide for itself in the next generation. Historically, there were no formal schools, instead, children were informally schooled by working informally with their family and kin from a very early age. Child labor in Africa, as in other parts of the world, was also viewed as a way to instill a sense of responsibility and a way of life in children particularly in rural, subsistence agricultural communities. In rural ''Pare'' people of northern Tanzania, for example, five-year-olds would assist adults in tending crops, nine-year-olds help carry fodder for animals and responsibilities scaled with age.&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction - Child Labour|author=Cindi Katz|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|volume=17|issue=1–2|pages=3–8|date=June–September 1996|doi=10.1525/awr.1996.17.1-2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThiMil FillBer.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Berber people|Berber]] shepherd girl in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].]]
In northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Islam is a major influence. Begging and child labour was considered as a service in exchange for quranic education, and in some cases continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talibes in Senegal|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=April 15, 2010|url=https://www.hrw.org/features/talib-s-senegal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children aged 7–13, for example, were called ''almudos'' in [[Gambia]], or ''talibés'' in [[Senegal]]. The parents placed their children with ''[[marabout]]'' or ''serin'', a cleric or quranic teacher. Here, they would split their time between begging and studying the Quran. This practice fit with one of the five pillars of Islam, the responsibility to engage in ''zakat'', or almsgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Boyle|title=Quranic Schools: Agents of Preservation &amp; Change|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415946353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Njàngaan: The Daily Regime of Quranic Students in Twentieth-Century Senegal|author=Rudolph T. Ware III|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=37|number=3|year=2004|pages=515–538|jstor=4129043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of colonial rule in Africa, from 1650 to 1950, by powers such as Britain, France, Belgium, Germany and Netherlands encouraged and continued the practice of child labour. Colonial administrators preferred Africa's traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries.&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;&lt;ref name=hh09/&gt; Children in these colonies between the ages of 5-14 were hired as apprentice ''without'' pay in exchange for learning a craft. Colonial British laws, for example, offered the native people ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labor of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as ''picannins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=38–46|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shoe Shine Boy, Ethiopia (8198535107).jpg|thumb|right|A boy shoeshiner in [[Gondar]], [[Ethiopia]].]]
Child labour was also encouraged by new tax laws. [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires introduced new taxes to help pay for the local colonial government expenses. One of these, called the Head Tax, imposed a tax payable by every person, in some cases as young as 8 year old. Regional populations rebelled against such taxes, hid their children, and in most part had to ensure their children were involved in economic activity to pay such taxes and pay their living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labor in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/11595/1/Jack_Lord%2C_Child_Labor_in_the_Gold_Coast.pdf|author=Jack Lord|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|year=2011|pages=88–115|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invisible Hands: Child Labor and the State in Colonial Zimbabwe by Beverly Grier (a review)|author=Karen Wells|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=1|number=3|date=Fall 2008|pages=481–483 |doi= 10.1353/hcy.0.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Head Tax, Social Structure and Rural Incomes in Cameroun, 1922-1937|author=Jane Guyer|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=20|issue=79|year=1980|pages=305–329|doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian mission schools in Africa stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not [[secular education]].&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;

In late colonial period, colonial governments attempted to run schools and educate children in parts of Africa. These effort were generally unsuccessful both in terms of enrollment and impact. Few children enrolled. Even when children enrolled, it did not necessarily mean regular attendance. Chronic absenteeism, or children dropped out of the schools to instead “go to sea with the fishermen.” Jack Lord claims in his reviews of scholarly papers of African colonial history, that late colonial era experience suggests children and families made decisions based on complex combination of economic factors such as household income, state of the family, and cultural factors that considered working with families as a form of education and a form of developing social and human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labor in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|year=2011|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|pages= 88–115|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/11595/1/Jack_Lord%2C_Child_Labor_in_the_Gold_Coast.pdf|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Burkina Faso’s United States Department of Labor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Department of Labor - Burkina Faso Reports Child Labor Findings|year=2012|url=https://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2012TDA/burkinafaso.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, 37.8% of children in Burkina Faso, between the ages of 5-14 years, were working in granite quarries and gold mines. These children have worked 6 to 7 days a week for up to 14 hours per day. Payment is in the form of food to eat and a place to sleep. Since that time, the Government has adopted a National Action Plan, and in collaboration with Interpol, have since have rescued many children from child trafficking. 

Christian Children's Fund of Canada (CCFC) has partnered with EDUCO, a fellow member of the [[ChildFund Alliance]], to implement a European Union-funded project in north Burkina to prevent children from working in mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Children Safe from Working in Gold Mines, 2017|publisher=Christian Children’s Fund of Canada|url=https://www.ccfcanada.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=823&amp;Itemid=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congo===
In 2008, Bloomberg claimed child labour in copper and cobalt mines of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] that supplied Chinese companies. The children dig the ore by hand, carry sacks of ores on their backs, and these are then purchased by these companies. Over 60 of [[Katanga Province|Katanga's]] 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region's minerals go to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Lets Child Workers Die Digging in Congo Mines for Copper|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=July 22, 2008|author1=Simon Clark |author2=Michael Smith |author3=Franz Wild |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aW8xVLQ4Xhr8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15, or about 40% of all miners, were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Strengthening the Civil society Perspective: China’s African impact| pages=9–15| author=Stephen Marks| year=2010| publisher=Fahamu| url=http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104005117/http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC, in 2012, accused [[Glencore]] of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of Africa. Glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour. Glencore claimed being aware of child miners who it claimed were part of a group of artisanal miners. They had without authorisation raided Glencore's concession since 2010, and the company claimed it has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from its concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mining giant Glencore accused in child labour and acid dumping row|author=John Sweeney|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 April 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/14/glencore-child-labour-acid-dumping-row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4.7 million children aged 5–14 work in Congo. In addition to copper mines, children with their families participate in artisanal mining of [[cobalt]], [[wolframite]], [[cassiterite]], [[columbite-tantalite]], [[gold]], diamonds. Many of these use hammers to break free the ore, pour harsh chemicals with no protective equipment, and manually transport rocks from deep pit or open pit mines. Children also work in agriculture and continue to be recruited as child soldiers for Congolese National Army and various rebel groups. Child labour is commonly visible on the streets of Kinshasa region.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association of Trauma and PTSD Symptoms With Openness to Reconciliation and Feelings of Revenge Among Former Ugandan and Congolese Child Soldiers|author1=Christophe Pierre Bayer |author2=Fionna Klasen |author3=Hubertus Adam |journal=JAMA|year=2007|volume=298|number=5|pages=555–559|doi=10.1001/jama.298.5.555 |pmid=17666676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
The 2010 [[United States Department of Labor]] estimated over 2.7 million child labourers in [[Ghana]], or about 43% of all children aged 5–14. Agriculture, fishing and artisan mining were the largest employers.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Children in Accra and Ashanti regions were common in domestic services. Child porters, locally called ''kayaye'', work in urban areas and some of them are as young as 6 years.

In southern Volta region, children work in [[Ritual servitude|religious servitude]] for a period ranging between few months to three years. They are known as ''trokosi'' (literally: wife of a god), ''fiashidi '', or ''vudusi''. This practice requires young girls to work and serve the religious order, in order to atone for family members’ alleged sins or as an offering for the family's good fortune. This practice is claimed to be also present in neighboring countries, even though it has been outlawed and imposes prison term under the laws of Ghana and neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan-African Issues in Crime and Justice (Editors: Anita Kalunta-Crumpton, Biko Agozino) - See Chapter 2|author=Robert Kwame Ameh|publisher=Ashgate|year=2004|isbn=978-0754618829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, statistics on children's work have not changed much and according to the DOL's ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'' in Ghana, the majority of working children engage in hazardous activities like pesticide spraying in the production of cocoa, fishing and gold mining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/ghana.htm Ghana, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; The Department's 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' includes fish and [[tilapia]] in particular, cocoa and gold as goods produced in such working conditions in Ghana.

===Kenya===
[[File:Young Maasai herder Kenya, 1979.jpg|thumb|250px|A child as [[Maasai people|Maasai]] herder in [[Kenya]].]]
Suda, in 2001, estimated that [[Kenya]] had 3 million children working in intolerable conditions and who were visible. The number of invisible child workers, claims Suda, were much larger. The visible child labour in Kenya were engaged in agriculture, tourism industry, quarries and mines, pastoral labour, mining, garbage collection, fishing industry, and the transport sector where they move from place to place as '' "Matatu" touts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invisible Child Worker in Kenya: The Intersection of Poverty, Legislation and Culture|author=Collette Suda|journal=Nordic Journal of African Studies|volume=10|number=2|pages=163–175|year=2001|url=http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol10num2/suda.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Kenya estimates there are 8.9 million children aged 5–13 who work, most of whom miss schooling. Agriculture is a major employer; of all labourers employed in coffee plantations, for example, 30% are children younger than age 27.

United Nations, in its country profile report for Kenya in 2009, estimated about one third of all children aged 5–14 were working. Agriculture and fishing were the largest employers, with former accounting for roughly 79% of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country profile report - Kenya|year=2009|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4d4a6806d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 32% of all Kenyan children aged 5–14 work, or over 2.9 million. Agriculture and fishing are the predominant employers. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include sugarcane plantations, pastoral ranches, tea, coffee, miraa (a stimulant plant), rice, sisal, tobacco, tilapia and sardines fishing. Other economic activities of children in Kenya include scavenging dumpsites, collecting and selling scrap materials, glass and metal, street vending, herding and begging. Forced exploitation of children in sex tourism, the report claims, is prevalent in major cities such as Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret and coastal cities of Kenya.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Poverty and lack of schooling opportunities are major causes of child labour in Kenya. The country faces shortages of teachers and schools, overcrowding in schools, and procedural complications from children’s unregistered status. Kenyan law prevents access to schools to a child if he or she is unregistered as a citizen with Kenyan authorities. Currently, 44% of Kenyan children in rural areas remain unregistered. Thus, even when schools may be available, rural children are unable to prove citizenship, and these unregistered children risk losing the opportunity for schooling.

===Madagascar===
[[File:Working Child Brickaville Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|Child labour in Brickaville, a city in [[Atsinanana]] region of Madagascar.]]
Children are common in small scale mines of [[Madagascar]]. Some children are involved in salt mining, quarry work, gem and gold ore collection. About 58% of children in these mines are younger than age 12. According to IPEC, Child labourers in these mines usually come from families who are in precarious economic situation.&lt;ref name=iloafr/&gt;

According to a United States-based 2010 report, about 22% of Madagascar children aged 5–14, or over 1.2 million work. Another French based group suggests Madagascar child labour exceeds 2.4 million, with over 540,000 children aged 5–9 working. About 87% of the child labour is in agriculture, mainly in the production of vanilla, tea, cotton, cocoa, copra (dried meat of coconut), sisal, shrimp harvest and fishing. Malagasy children engaged in domestic service work an average of 12 hours per day.&lt;ref name=dol10&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - U.S. Department of Labor|year=2011|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2010TDA.pdf|access-date=2012-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915195911/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2010TDA.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enquête nationale sur le travail des enfants à Madagascar, 2007|publisher=ILO|year=2008|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=9350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internationally funded efforts were involved in Madagascar to help reduce and prevent child labour. However these stopped, after the government change following 2009 coup, because much of the funding from international donors, including the African Union, European Union, World Bank and the United States, was suspended.

===Morocco===
A 2010 report estimates about 150,000 children aged between 5 and 14 were working in [[Morocco]]. Agriculture and domestic services are the predominant employers. Young girls, locally called as ''petites bonnes'' (little maids), are sent to work as live in domestic servants, many aged 10 or less. These ''petites bonnes'' come from very poor families, face conditions of involuntary servitude, including long hours without breaks, absence of holidays, physical, verbal and sexual abuse, withheld wages and even restrictions on their movement. They are denied education.
More visible forms of child labour includes street children in Casablanca, Marrakech, Fès and Mèknes. These children survive by selling cigarettes, begging, shining shoes, washing cars and working as porters and packers in ports.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

The Ministry of Planning in Morocco estimates that there are between 60,000 and 100,000 ''petites bonnes'' in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour in Morocco: The Socio-economic Background of  the "Little Maids"  Phenomenon|author=Mehdi Lahlou|publisher=Ministry of Planning, Morocco|url=http://www.araburban.org/childcity/Papers/English/Lahlou%20Morocco.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303123720/http://www.araburban.org/ChildCity/Papers/English/Lahlou%20Morocco.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies commissioned by the Morocco government finds poverty and lack of school, often in combination, are primary causes of the little maids phenomenon in Morocco. Additionally, rural parents do not believe that an education or a diploma of any sort can help their girls find a job.

===Nigeria===
{{Main article|Child labour in Nigeria}}
In 2006, there were about 15 million child labourers younger than age 14 in [[Nigeria]]. Many of these worked in hazardous conditions and for long hours. Poverty was the main driver of child labour, and the income of these children was a major part of their impoverished families income. Vast majority of child labour in Nigeria worked in agriculture and semi-formal or informal economy. Domestic servants were the least visible form of child labour, and often sexually harassed. Amongst informal economy and public places, street vending employed 64%. Midst informal enterprises in semipublic places, children were often observed as mechanics and bus conductors.&lt;ref name=n2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour - Nigeria, 2006|publisher=UNICEF|year=2007|url=http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/WCARO_Nigeria_Factsheets_ChildLabour.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6 million of Nigeria's children do not go to school at all. In the current conditions, these children do not have the time, energy or resources to go to school.

===Rwanda===
ILO estimates [[Rwanda]] has 400,000 child workers. Of these, 120,000 are thought to be involved in the worst forms of child labour and 60,000 are child domestic workers.&lt;ref name=iloafr/&gt;

=== Swaziland ===

===Zambia===
The government of [[Zambia]] estimates there are some 595,000 child workers in the country.  Of these, 58% are aged 14 or less. Many are employed in informal mining operations.

The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 33% of Zambian children aged 5–14 work. Agriculture is the dominant employer, and with mining employs 98% of all child labour in Zambia. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include cotton plantations, tobacco, fishing, tea, coffee and charcoal. Child labour is common in mining. However, this is witnessed in small artisanal and traditional mines, where the children extract emeralds, amethyst, aquamarines, tourmalines and garnets. Child labour is also present in mines of lead, zinc and copper ores. They do not wear any protective equipment to protect their eyes or face or body; injuries are common.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Child trafficking for purposes of hazardous labour is prevalent in Zambia. Children in agriculture and domestic service are exchanged for money, goods and gifts to family members. Zambia has strict laws against trafficking and child labour. However, implementation and enforcement of its laws has proven to be difficult.

According to ILO, child labour in Zambia is a coping strategy for the children and families when adult breadwinners die, fall ill, or when families are simply unable to make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The global crisis and rising child labour in Zambia’s mining communities: Are we facing a downward decent work spiral?|author=ILO Lusaka Office|year=2009|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/financialcrisis/featurestories/story26.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics==
[[File:Child labour in Egypt.jpg|thumb|upright|Home-based carpet weaving enterprise in [[Egypt]] deploying child labour.]]
International Labor Organization (ILO) stated that first of all, poverty is the greatest single force driving children into the workplace.&lt;ref name=ilo2008a&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labor - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major factor driving children to harmful labor is the lack of schools and poor quality of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHILD LABOR: ISSUES, CAUSES AND INTERVENTIONS|author1=Faraaz Siddiqi |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=The World Bank|year=1999|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Child_Labor_issues.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child labour laws in Africa===
[[File:Carte de ratification des conventions 138 et 182.png|thumb|Most African nations have ratified worldwide child labour-related conventions. African countries colored in green had national laws, as of 2006, equivalent to ILO Conventions 138 and 182. Additional countries, except South Sudan and Somalia, too have ratified ILO Conventions since then.]]
Most African governments have formally adopted the three [[Child labour#Child labour laws and initiatives|International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions]]. In addition, many have signed a memorandum of 
understanding with ILO to launch a programme under the International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).
 
[[Nigeria]], for example, is now an active member of IPEC. It is also implementing the West Africa Cocoa Agriculture Project. Nigeria's Child Rights Act is now part of its Labour Act, and it prohibits exploitative labour from children. Some states, like [[Anambra State|Anambra]], have also banned children from working during school hours.&lt;ref name=n2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National programme on the elimination of child labour in Nigeria|year=2005|publisher=ILO|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_mas/---eval/documents/publication/wcms_149868.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]] has made it a criminal offence to employ a child under the age of 15, except with a permit from the Department of Labour to employ children in the performing arts. Sections 43 through 47 of its Employment Act also makes it illegal to employ children aged 15 to 18 if the work is inappropriate for their age or something that places them at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Guide to Child Labour|publisher=Department of Labour, Republic of South Africa|year=2012|url=https://www.labour.gov.za/legislation/acts/basic-guides/basic-guide-to-child-labour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenya]] passed a Children's Act in 2001. Section 10 of this Act protects children and youth below age 18 from economic exploitation and any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the childspiritual, moral or social development. The law also forbids hiring anyone less than age of 18 for military or in any armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laws of Kenya - The Children Act 2001|year=2007|publisher=Kenya Police - National Council for Law Reporting|url=http://www.kenyapolice.go.ke/resources/Childrens_Act_No_8_of_2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ghana]], as another example, forbids child labour. Section 87 of its Children's Act 1998 forbids any person from employing a chiId in exploitative labour, or in any engagement that deprives the child of its health, education or development. Section 88 prohibits anyone from employing any child at night, that is between the hours of eight o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning. The Act's section 89 to 90 allow children above the age of 13 to engage in light work, and those aged over 15 non-hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACT OF THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA ENTITLED THE CHILDREN'S ACT, 1998|publisher=Yale University|year=2002|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/afw/ghana/ghana_childrens_act.pdf|access-date=2012-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917020312/http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/afw/ghana/Ghana_Childrens_Act.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While substantial legislation is now in place in almost all of Africa, legal enforcement remains a challenge.

===Non-governmental organizations===
ILO has a number of projects in Africa that seek to reduce, and ultimately eliminate child labour in Africa. One such project, launched in 2006 is focussed on west African nations of [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Togo]]. This project, started in 2009, aims at worst forms of child labour in west Africa. It has two main components: the first will support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, while the second aims at mobilizing sub-regional policy makers and improving sub-regional cooperation for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour among all fifteen member States of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating the Worst Forms of Child Labour in West Africa and Strengthening Sub-Regional Cooperation through ECOWAS–I|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/afpro/abuja/projects/nigecowas_1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KURET project, which is an acronym for Combating Exploitive Child Labor Through Education in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Ethiopia]] Together, is a regional effort to prevent exploitive child labor through education. Funded by the United States Department of Labor and implemented by World Vision, the Academy for Educational Development, and the International Rescue Committee, KURET began in September 2004. The regional office is located in Kampala, Uganda. A report in 2009 claims it made a difference in the lives of thousands of children in this region of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Final Evaluation of the Combating Exploitive Child Labor Through Education in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia Together (KURET) Project: Rwanda Country Report|author=Julian Ntezimana|year=2009|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/tcp/KURET-report3.pdf|access-date=2012-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209202550/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/tcp/KURET-report3.pdf#|archive-date=2012-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2012}}
A '''collop''' ({{lang-ga|cológ}}) is a measure of land sufficient to [[Grazing|graze]] one [[Cattle|cow]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] tradition, a collop is defined as the amount of land deemed capable of producing enough to support one family, or the number of cattle that the family could rear by pasture on it. It was the basis for the division of common land in the western parts of Ireland in the 18th and early 19th centuries. As in the [[Rundale]] system, the collop was scattered over several different fields, so that good and bad land was equally divided.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey &amp; J.E.Doherty,  Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. pp.82-83. {{ISBN|0-7171-1567-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eric Cross's ''[[The Tailor and Ansty]]'', Timothy "the Tailor" Buckley describes a collop as "an old count for the carrying power of land", noting that it was the grazing of one [[cow]], or two yearling heifers, or six [[sheep]], or twelve [[goats]], or six [[Domestic goose|geese]] and a gander, while a [[horse]] would require three collops. He describes it as a superior method of reckoning land to the acre, noting a man whose holding of 4,000 acres of barren land produces scarcely enough to feed four cattle.

The '''Halmahera blossom bat''' (''Syconycteris carolinae'') is a [[species]] of [[megabat]] in the family [[Pteropodidae]].

The bat is [[endemic]] to [[Halmahera]] and [[Bacan]] islands, of the northern [[Maluku Islands]] archipelago in [[Indonesia]].
It is an [[IUCN Red List]] [[Vulnerable species]] because: its extent of occurrence is less than 20,000&amp;nbsp;km²; it is known only from three locations; and there is ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat due to intensified [[habitat loss|habitat destruction]]. A 2017 study ranked the species as the 8th highest research priority among island endemic bats based on conservation situation and current data availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conenna|first=Irene|last2=Rocha|first2=Ricardo|last3=Russo|first3=Danilo|last4=Cabeza|first4=Mar|date=2017-04-17|title=Insular bats and research effort: a review of global patterns and priorities|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12090|journal=Mammal Review|volume=47|issue=3|pages=169–182|doi=10.1111/mam.12090|issn=0305-1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">The '''Heers Formation''' ({{lang-nl|Formatie van Heers}}; {{lang-fr|Formation de Heers}}; abbreviation: Hs) is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formation]] in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of [[Belgium]]. The formation consists of [[sand]] and [[marl]] and was deposited in the shallow sea that covered Belgium during the middle to late [[Selandian]] [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Paleocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]].

The formation is subdivided into two [[member (stratigraphy)|members]]: at the base green, [[glauconite|glauconiferous]] sand ([[Orp Member]]), on top calcareous [[clay]] and marl in which plant [[fossil]]s have been found ([[Gelinden Member]]). This sequence formed during a [[marine transgression]]. The Orp Member represents a near coastal marine environment, the Gelinden Member formed in shallow marine circumstances but further from the land.

The Heers Formation occurs in the subsurface of the northern and eastern parts of [[Flanders]]. In [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] it reaches its maximal thickness at about 60 meters. The Heers Formation is stratigraphically on top of [[Cretaceous]] and early Paleocene deposits, such as the [[Opglabbeek Formation]] or the [[Houthem Formation]]. The Heers Formation is almost everywhere overlain by the [[Hannut Formation]] (clay, sand and [[limestone]] from the late Paleocene).

The Orp and Gelinden members are also recognized in the [[Netherlands]] (north of Belgium). Dutch stratigraphers see them as part of the [[Landen Formation]].

'''Intelsat 14''' is a [[communications satellite]] owned by [[Intelsat]] located at 45°&amp;nbsp;West [[longitude]], serving the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]n markets.  Intelsat 14 replaced [[Intelsat 1R]] which was at the end of its design life.  It was built by [[Space Systems Loral]], as part of its [[LS-1300]] line.

==Communications payload==
Intelsat 14 has a C-band and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band payload, each of which is further divided to provide service to 2 each coverage areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelsat.com/flash/coverage-maps/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-band payload has an Americas beam which covers the southern part of the [[United States]], all of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and all of [[South America]]. A second C-band beam provides coverage for Western Europe and Africa.

The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band payload also has an Americas beam which covers the Alabama, Georgia and Florida, all of the [[Caribbean]], Central America and all of South America except [[Brazil]]. The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band US/Europe/Africa beam covers the southern eastern United States, Western Europe, and the northern western African countries.

Intelsat 14 also carries an experimental [[Radiation hardening|radiation-tolerant]] [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Router (computing)|router]] payload that can be connected to several of the C and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band channels. This experimental payload is known as [[IRIS (Internet Routing in Space)]] demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6551807.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net reaches out to final frontier | date=April 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Intelsat 14 was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41]] November 23, 2009 on an [[Atlas V]] rocket flying in the 431 configuration.  The satellite was released into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]] 1 hour and 58 minutes after lift-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av024/status.html |title=Atlas Mission Status Center |author=Justin Ray |publisher=Spaceflight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Graham|first= William|title=Intelsat 14 launches on Atlas V AV-024 at second attempt|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/11/live-intelsat-14-set-to-launch-on-atlas-v-av-024/|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuressaare Airport''' ({{lang-et|'''Kuressaare lennujaam'''}}, {{airport codes|URE|EEKE|p=n}}) is an [[airport]] in [[Estonia]]. The airport is situated {{Convert|1.5|NM|lk=in}} south southeast&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; of [[Kuressaare]] on [[Saaremaa]] island.

==Overview==
The first [[runway]] was built in the last half of the 1930s. The airport was opened officially on 6 March 1945. The air traffic increased during the proceeding years and between 1949 and 1953 there were between 10 and 14 flights every day between Kuressaare and [[Tallinn]]. During this period around 400 passengers flew to or from Kuressaare each day. The airport did not get electricity until 1958. The present terminal building was built in 1962. The second runway 05/23 was built in 1976 and in 1999 the main runway was lengthened. The terminal building was modernized in 2007.

The airport is owned by [[Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport|AS Tallinna Lennujaam]]. It also owns the [[Ruhnu Airfield]].

19,702 passengers travelled via Kuressaare Airport in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="563">'''''La règle de non-cumul''''' is a principle of [[French law]] which regulates whether an action should be brought under [[contract law]] (''la responsibilité civile'') or [[tort law]] (''la responsibilité delictuelle'').

It states that where there is a contract, an action can only be brought under contract law and when there is no contract an action can only be brought under tort law.

[[Image:Zealandia topography.jpg|thumb|upright|The Lord Howe Rise is part of the continent known as [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]].]]

The '''Lord Howe Rise''' is a [[deep sea]] [[plateau]] which extends from south west of [[New Caledonia]] to the [[Challenger Plateau]], west of [[New Zealand]] in the south west of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To its west is the [[Tasman Basin]] and to the east is the [[New Caledonia Basin]].&lt;ref name="ga"/&gt; Lord Howe Rise has a total area of about 1,500,000 square km,&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lord Howe Rise |work=Regional petroleum geology of Australia |publisher=[[Geoscience Australia]] |date=16 June 2003 |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ea_LHoweRis.jsp |accessdate=2007-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313111159/http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ea_LHoweRis.jsp |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally lies about 750 to 1,200 metres under water.&lt;ref name="hbdpsp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Seafloor Geomorphology As Benthic Habitat: GeoHAB Atlas of Seafloor Geomorphic Features and Benthic Habitats |last=Harris |first=Peter T. |author2=Scott L.

==Formation==
The Lord Howe Rise was formed by [[seafloor spreading]] which also resulted in the creation of the Tasman Sea.&lt;ref name="vtpi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Vegetation of the Tropical Pacific Islands |last=Mueller-Dombois |first=Dieter |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0387983139 |page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UB5d33i8WkC |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was [[rift]]ed away from [[Eastern Australia]] by a [[mid-ocean ridge]] that was active from 80 to 60 million years ago, and now lies 800&amp;nbsp;kilometres offshore from mainland [[Australia]].

The Lord Howe Rise contains a line of [[seamount]]s called the [[Lord Howe Seamount Chain]] which formed during the [[Miocene]] period when this part of Zealandia existed over the [[Lord Howe hotspot]].  Lord Howe was the last volcano to erupt on the rise.&lt;ref name="vtpi"/&gt;

==Islands, reefs and seamounts==
[[Lord Howe Island]] and [[Ball's Pyramid]] cap a seamount towards the central east of the rise in an area known as the Lord Howe platform.  The Lord Howe Seamount Chain extends northwards along the rise.  The seamounts provide habitat to a diverse range of marine species which attracts commercial fishers, but cover a very small area, less than 1% of the total area of Lord Howe Rise.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P.T., 2011. Benthic environments of the Lord Howe Rise submarine plateau: Introduction to the special volume. Deep-Sea Research Part II 58, 883–888&lt;/ref&gt;

Further north is the [[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef|Middleton]] part of the [[Coral Sea Islands]], which together with reefs around [[Lord Howe Island]] are the most southern coral reefs on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, C.D., Dickson, M.E., Brooke, B.P., Kennedy, D.M., 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Land Register Draft of 1950''' (''Matrikkelutkastet av 1950'') is a listing containing rural real estate within [[Norway]]. Matrikkelutkastet does not contain data for municipalities but rather contains listings of Norwegian main farms (''matrikkelgårder''). The farms are sorted by county and municipality or township. Because Matrikkelutkastet contains the names of owners, the archive also can be useful for the individual and family researchers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/matrikkel ''Matrikkel'' ((Thor Falkanger. Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Finance Department compiled approximately 85,000 lists of rural real estate in Norway, organized by consecutive, increasing official farm number (''gårdsnummer'') within each municipality. The database forms a part of the digital [[National Archival Services of Norway|Norwegian National Archives]].  The entire catalogue has been converted by [[the National Documentation Project of Norway]] into an electronic text with [[SGML]] mark up. The transfer from the manual to the electronic system was completed in 1993. The database is in the Norwegian language. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/g%C3%A5rdsnummer ''gårdsnummer'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The land register formed a part of the Norwegian State Name Consultancy Service effort to standardize place names throughout Norway.  Responsible for this project section rested with the Department of Scandinavian Studies and Comparative Literature [[University of Oslo]]. Matrikkelutkastet av 1950 was never completed, lacking information from the county of [[Finnmark]], which is reason it is referred to as a draft. &lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/gegn22wp55.pdf ''Consultation on the Norwegian Place-Names Act'' (Norwegian Mapping Authority)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706023353/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/gegn22wp55.pdf |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan Htwar''' ({{lang-my|ပန်ထွာ}}) also known as ''' Princess Thonbanhla''' was the Queen of [[Beikthano]], the ancient cities of the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu Kingdom]]. She was a strong spiritual lady of war and fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://myanmarlive.net/ဗိႆႏိုးဘုရင္မ-ပန္ထြာဧကရ/|title=

==Legend==
Pan Htwar was the only daughter of Sula Thamawa, a son of Maha Thado Yarzar (King Naga Naing), the legendary King of [[Tagaung Kingdom]]. Her mother Sanda Muhki was the [[Ogress]]-[[Nymph|nymph]] from [[Lanka|Lanka Dipa]]. 

Her history records the wars period between [[Sri Ksetra]] and [[Beikthano]] and of the fighting that took place. The Lord of Celestial Beings [[Thagyamin|Sakra]] gave a big magical drum named "Atula Sidaw" to the Queen. The queen was able to repel all her ememy forces with the help of this magical drum. Whatever enemies approached [[Beikthano]], according to the legend the city was created for Pan Htwar by the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]. The queen was assumed as the little sister of god Vishnu in previous life. [[Sri Ksetra]] King Duttabaung had to resort to a stratagem to take away the magical powers of the drum before he could capture the city and sent imitate monk to Beikthano, her drum was destroyed and her empire and kingdom was flamed. Her hatred upon the King and the imitate monks, still flows in the veins of [[Beikthano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gomyanmartours.com/beikthano/|title=Beikthano|publisher=Go Myanmar Tours|date=|accessdate=28 July 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

King Duttabaung was the son of Maha Thamawa, twin brother of Sula Thamawa. So, Queen Pan Htwar is the half-sister of Duttabaung, and she married to the king for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/lifestyle/21575-an-ancient-princess-still-haunts-pyay.html|title=An ancient princess still haunts Pyay|publisher=[[The Myanmar Times]]|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=Khin Wyne Phyu Phyu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yoyarlay.com/knowledge/tourism/744-2017-03-03-03-28-29|title=အချစ်ကြီးလှတဲ့ ဒွတ္တပေါင်ဘုရင် နဲ့ အငြိုးကြီးလှတဲ့ ပန်ထွာဘုရင်မ တို့ရဲ့ ပုံရိပ်များ ထင်ကျန်ခဲ့ရာ သရေခေတ္တရာမြို့ဟောင်း|publisher=Yoyarlay|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=26 July 2018|author=Chan Myae Ei|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became Queen consort of King Duttabaung.

She was assassinated by poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://myanmar24h.com/news-8-16-d21d984882a65b719c6693339dc88f74|title=မကျွတ်လွတ်သေးတဲ့ ဗိဿနိုး ပန်ထွာဘုရင်မ|publisher=Myanmar 24H|date=|accessdate=28 July 2018|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Henry''' (31 March 1953&amp;nbsp;– 3 December 2017) was a French criminal, [[cause célèbre]] and the subject of public and judicial controversy. He was convicted of the [[kidnap]]ping and [[murder]] of 8-year-old Philippe Bertrand in January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/20-ans-de-faits-divers-a-libe/0101570168-le-cas-patrick-henry|title=Le cas Patrick Henry|language=French|publisher=[[Libération]]|author=Sorj Chalandon|date=29 May 2009|access-date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trial began on 18 January 1977 and he was defended by Robert Bocquillon and [[Robert Badinter]]. A contentious issue in the trial was the validity of [[capital punishment in France]]; Badinter, a fervent supporter of its abolition, would ultimately convince the jury not to execute his client.&lt;ref&gt;Max Berley [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/09/news/france-debates-parole-after-24-years-of-prison-for-killer-of-a-child.html "France Debates Parole, After 24 Years of Prison, for Killer of a Child"], ''New York Times''; accessed 3 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This case is said to have had an influence in leading to the abolition of the death penalty in France in 1981. Henry was instead sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in France|life imprisonment]] and was [[parole]]d in 2001; however, he returned to jail two years later after having been caught trying to smuggle drugs into France.

The '''Podujevo massacre''' ({{lang-sq|Masakra e Podujevës}}, {{lang-sr|Masakr u Podujevu|script=Latn}}) is the name generally used to refer to the killing of 14 [[Kosovo Albanian]] civilians, mostly women and children, committed in March 1999 by the [[Scorpions (Serbia)|Scorpions]], a Serbian paramilitary organisation in conjunction with the [[Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (Serbia)|Special Anti-Terrorist Unit]] of Serbia, during the [[Kosovo War]]. One of the survivors of this massacre, Saranda Bogujevci, 13 years old when it occurred, received mass media attention after she successfully managed to bring to justice her case with the help of several [[NGO|organizations]] from [[Serbia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="crime"&gt;''[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/balkans/crimesandcourage.html "Massacre at Podujevo, Kosovo"]'', CBC News Indepth,  March 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Goran Stoparić, at the time of the events serving in the Anti-Terrorism Unit (SAJ), gave evidence to bring the culprits to justice. In an interview to [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], he speculated over the motives behind the actions committed by the irregular forces: 

:"In my opinion, [their] only motive was the fact that the victims were Albanians, and perhaps because of some hidden immaturity or sickness of mind on their part. They would probably have killed them had they been Bosnians or Croats. But it is certain that they were killed because they were not Serbs."&lt;ref name="crime" /&gt;

Serbian police arrested two members of a paramilitary unit called the [[Scorpions (paramilitary)|Scorpions]], Saša Cvjetan and Dejan Demirović, who freely gave incriminating statements and signed them. Demirović had moved to Canada and applied for [[political asylum]] but was deported back to his home country after a campaign orchestrated by human rights organizations.&lt;ref name="crime" /&gt;

Demirović and Cvjetan were the only two people charged with the killings. Cvetjan was sentenced in Serbia to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3520370.stm Serb jailed for Kosovo killings] ", BBC News, March 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2007, four members of the Scorpions paramilitary group were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences by Belgrade's War Crimes Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2439541.ece Serb 'Scorpions' guilty of Srebrenica massacre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210556/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2439541.ece |date=2007-09-30 }} - ''The Independent'', April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made important advances in topics as diverse as grain-scale physics controlling ice deformation, the role and nature of ice streams, and processes at the bed of the ice sheet. His work synthesised the evidence that [[abrupt climate change]]s occurred in the past, and drove hypotheses about their cause and the role of ice on [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]]. Alley is also an outstanding science communicator, whose skill and enthusiasm has influenced both policymakers and large public audiences.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2014/richard-alley/ |title = Professor Richard Alley ForMemRS |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=2014-05-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502071729/https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2014/richard-alley/ |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He won the 2014 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in Climate Change category for his “pioneering research” into the “mechanics of ice and its implications for abrupt climate change,” in the words of the jury’s citation.  He is the 2017 recipient of the [[Wollaston Medal]], which is the highest award given by the [[Geological Society of London]]. It is reserved for geologists who have made a significant impact on the field through a substantial body of impactful research.

==Television series==
In addition to his research, Alley has made several appearances on television. On Sunday, April 10, 2011, [[PBS]] debuted a special program on climate change, entitled ''EARTH: The Operators’ Manual'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/programs/earth-the-operators-manual/&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by Alley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earththeoperatorsmanual.com/host_richard_alley&lt;/ref&gt;  The program's aim was to present an objective, accessible assessment of the Earth’s problems and possible solutions, with the stated intention of leaving viewers informed, energized and optimistic.  The series continued through 2012 on PBS and affiliates.  The series is accompanied by a book of the same name, also by Richard Alley.&lt;ref&gt;http://earththeoperatorsmanual.com/products&lt;/ref&gt;  It was published on April 18, 2011. He has also appeared in episodes of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''[[Mega Disasters]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==History==
It was established in February 1958 to continue the international coordination of Antarctic scientific activities that had begun during the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957-58.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|url = http://dels.nas.edu/global/prb/scar|website = dels.nas.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAR is charged with the initiating, developing and coordinating of scientific research in the [[Antarctic]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icsu.org/what-we-do/interdisciplinary-bodies/scar|title=Antarctic Research (SCAR)|website=www.icsu.org|language=en|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by its Standing Scientific Groups. SCAR also provides scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and other organizations on issues of science and conservation affecting the management of Antarctica and the [[Southern Ocean]]. In that role, SCAR has made numerous recommendations on a variety of matters, very few of which have been incorporated into [[Antarctic Treaty]] instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gramling|first=Carolyn|date=2015-08-11|title=Report sets new goals for U.S. Antarctic Program|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/earth/2015/08/report-sets-new-goals-u-s-antarctic-program|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.aad1602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennicutt|first=Mahlon C.|last2=Chown|first2=Steven L.|last3=Cassano|first3=John J.|last4=Liggett|first4=Daniela|last5=Massom|first5=Rob|last6=Peck|first6=Lloyd S.|last7=Rintoul|first7=Steve R.|last8=Storey|first8=John W.

==Activities==
SCAR meets every two years to conduct its administrative business at the SCAR Delegates Meeting. An executive committee  elected from the delegates is responsible for the day-to-day administration of SCAR through its secretariat at the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] in [[Cambridge]], England. The executive committee comprises the president and four vice-presidents. The SCAR Secretariat is staffed by the executive director, executive officer and an administrative assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/members-and-officers/secretariat|title=SCAR Secretariat|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2017-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620021339/http://www.scar.org/members-and-officers/secretariat|archivedate=2017-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCAR also holds, prior to the delegates meeting, a major open science conference to draw attention to Antarctic issues, along with meetings of the standing scientific groups that are designed to finalize the science programmes for eventual approval by the delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/scarmeetings/conferences|title=SCAR Meetings and Conferences|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2017-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619183530/http://www.scar.org/scarmeetings/conferences|archivedate=2017-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 SCAR received the prestigious [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for International Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/laureates/2002-the-scientific-committee-on-antarctic-research.html?especifica=0&amp;idCategoria=0&amp;anio=2002&amp;especifica=0|title=The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research - Laureates|last=|first=|date=2002|website=The Princess of Asturias Foundation|publisher=The Princess of Asturias Foundation|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPOL%2FPOL38_207%2FS0032247400018192a.pdf&amp;code=065691d6f01d66255eecd461067b11c3|title=A Major International Prize for SCAR|last=|first=|date=2002|work=SCAR-COMNAP Joint Committee|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SCAR medals ==
Since 2006, SCAR has awarded three medals biennially in recognition of excellence in Antarctic and Southern Ocean research and outstanding service to the international Antarctic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/awards/medals|title=Medals|last=|first=|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is one medal for Excellence in Antarctic Research, one for International Scientific Coordination, and the SCAR President's medal for Outstanding Achievement. Presentations are made at the SCAR Open Science Conference and are intended to reward those who exemplify the best of the Antarctic community and serve as role models for the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/2015/55-awards|archive-url=https://archive.is/20161026073206/http://www.scar.org/2015/55-awards|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-10-26|title=Awards|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stogastulpis''' (plural - Stogastulpiai) or '''Roofed Pillar'''/'''Roofed Pole''' is a traditional Lithuanian wooden shrine. The name, ''stogastulpis,'' is made from two Lithuanian words - ''stogas'', which means roof, and ''stulpas'', which means pole. The roofed pillars may have anywhere between one to three layers of stylized roofs.  Roofed pillars can be simple, or richly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradicija.lt/Tyrinejimai/Stog_kopl_tipai.htm Senoji lietuvių skulptūra, kryžiai ir koplytėlės (Old Lithuanian sculpture, crosses, and shrines)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the most common ornamentation are a distinctive blend of Christian symbolism and traditional solar, celestial, and nature motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gimbutas |first1= Marija |authorlink1= Marija Gimbutas |title= Ancient symbolism in Lithuanian folk art |url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1958 |month= |origyear= |publisher= American Folklore Society |location= Bloomington, IN |isbn= |oclc= 1106451 |doi= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Grinius |first1= Jonas |last2= |first2= |date= 1956 |title= Crosses |url= http://www.lituanus.org/1956/56_3_04Grinius.html |journal= Lituanus |volume= 8 |issue= 3 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llbm.lt/parodos/AlgioSalkauskoparoda/ Algirdo Šalkausko stebuklai iš medžio]&lt;/ref&gt; Stogastulpiai, together with [[Lithuanian cross]]es, are common throughout Lithuania, and can be found in churchyards, village/town squares, cemeteries, farms, parks, in fields and woods, at cross-roads, and as wayside shrines.

It is located {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south of the [[Mainland Australia|Australian mainland]], separated by the [[Bass Strait]]. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the [[List of islands by area#Islands 20,000–100,000 km2 (7,700–38,600 sq mi)|26th-largest island in the world]], and the [[List of islands of Tasmania|surrounding 334 islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovertasmania.com/about_tasmania/our_islands |title=Discover Tasmania – Our Islands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107225939/http://www.discovertasmania.com/about_tasmania/our_islands|publisher=[[Government of Tasmania]] |archivedate=7 January 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state has a population of around 526,700&lt;ref name=ABSPop/&gt; {{as of|2018|03|lc=on}}.

Tasmania's area is {{convert|68401|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which the main island covers {{convert|64519|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/dimensions/area-of-australia-states-and-territories.html Area of Australia – States and Territories]. ga.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted as a natural state, and [[protected areas of Tasmania]] cover about 42% of its land area, which includes [[national parks]] and [[Tasmanian Wilderness|World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/manage/parksres/reserves.html|title=Complete National Parks and Reserves Listings|publisher=[[Parks and Wildlife Service]]|date=28 January 2013|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental party in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howes|first1=Michael|title=United Tasmania Group (UTG)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/245350/United-Tasmania-Group-UTG|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to an administrative quirk caused by an early mapping error, the state of Tasmania shares a tiny land border with the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. This {{convert|85|m}} line bisects [[Boundary Islet]], a nature reserve in the Bass Strait, separating the northernmost land governed by Tasmania from the southernmost land governed by Victoria. The [[Bishop and Clerk Islets]], about 37&amp;nbsp;km south of Macquarie Island, are the southernmost terrestrial point of the state of Tasmania, and the southernmost internationally recognised land in Australia. About {{convert|2500|km}} south of Tasmania island lies [[Antarctica]], which is nearer than areas in the northern Australian mainland.

The island is believed to have been occupied by [[indigenous peoples]] for 30,000 years before British colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/A/Aboriginal%20life%20pre-invasion.htm|title=Aboriginal Life Pre-Invasion|website=www.utas.edu.au|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]] were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form the Bass Strait.&lt;ref name="ryan1"&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages= 3–6|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal population was estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation, but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the "[[Black War]]", intertribal conflict, and from the late 1820s, the spread of [[infectious disease]]s to which they had no immunity. The conflict, which peaked between 1825 and 1831 and led to more than three years of martial law, cost the lives of almost 1100 Aboriginals and settlers. The near-destruction of Tasmania's Aboriginal population has been described by some historians{{who|date=November 2018}} as an act of genocide by the British.

The island was permanently settled by Europeans in 1803 as a [[penal colony|penal settlement]] of the [[British Empire]] to prevent claims to the land by the [[First French Empire]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; around 75,000 [[Convicts in Australia|convict]]s were sent to Van Diemen's Land before transportation ceased in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convicts and the British colonies in Australia|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies|website=australia.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|access-date=31 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101181100/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was initially part of the [[Colony of New South Wales]] but became a separate, self-governing colony under the name [[Van Diemen's Land]] (named after [[Anthony van Diemen]]) in 1825.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Van Diemens Land|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Van-Diemens-Land|access-date=3 September 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 the present Constitution of Tasmania was passed and the following year the colony received permission to change its name to Tasmania. In 1901 it became a [[Sovereign state|state]] through the process of the [[Federation of Australia]].

=={{anchor|Etymology}}Toponymy==
The state is named after [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[explorer]] [[Abel Tasman]], who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. Tasman named the island '''Anthony van Diemen's Land''' after his sponsor [[Anthony van Diemen]], the Governor of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The name was later shortened to '''Van Diemen's Land''' by the British. It was officially renamed '''Tasmania''' in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |title=Appendix 2: Select chronology of renaming |last1= Newman |first1=Terry |year=2005 |work=Becoming Tasmania – Companion Web Site |publisher=[[Parliament of Tasmania]] |access-date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasmania was sometimes referred to as "Dervon," as mentioned in the [[Jerilderie Letter]] written by the notorious Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is "Tassie". Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to "Tas," mainly when used in business names and website addresses. TAS is also the [[Australian postal abbreviations|Australia Post abbreviation]] for the state.

The reconstructed [[Palawa kani]] language name for Tasmania is '''''Lutriwita'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breathing new life into Indigenous language|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2012/06/15/3526278.htm|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=ABC Hobart|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Tasmania}}

===Physical history===
{{Main|Geology of Tasmania}}
[[File:Tessellated Pavement Sunrise Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tessellated pavement]], a rare rock formation on the [[Tasman Peninsula]]]]
[[File:Autumn-in-Tasmania.jpg|thumb|left|[[Autumn]] on the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] in Tasmania]]
The island was adjoined to the mainland of [[Australia]] until the end of the [[last glacial period]] about 10,000 years ago. Much of the island is composed of [[Jurassic]] [[Diabase|dolerite]] intrusions (the upwelling of [[magma]]) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The [[Central Plateau (Tasmania)|central plateau]] and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites. [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] above [[Hobart]] is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.

In the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by [[sandstone]] and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, [[Precambrian]] [[quartzite]]s were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or [[Frenchmans Cap, Tasmania|Frenchmans Cap]].

In the northeast and east, continental [[granite]]s can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at [[Mount Read (Tasmania)|Mount Read]] near [[Rosebery, Tasmania|Rosebery]], or at [[Mount Lyell, Tasmania|Mount Lyell]] near [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]]. Also present in the south and northwest is [[limestone]] with caves.

The quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of [[glaciation]], and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. [[Cradle Mountain]], another dolerite peak, for example, was a [[nunatak]]. The combination of these different rock types contributes to scenery which is distinct from any other region of the world.{{fact|date=July 2018}} In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost wholly quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.

===Indigenous people===
{{Main|Tasmanian Aborigines}}
Evidence indicates the presence of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Tasmania about 40,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. Rising sea levels cut Tasmania off from mainland Australia about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago and by the time of European contact, the Aboriginal people in Tasmania had nine major nations or ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="ryan1" /&gt; At the time of the British occupation and colonisation in 1803, the indigenous population was estimated at between 3,000 and 10,000. Historian Lyndall Ryan's analysis of population studies led her to conclude that there were about 7,000 spread throughout the island's nine nations;&lt;ref name="lyndall"&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages= 4, 43|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Clements, citing research by [[Brian Plomley|N.J.B. Plomley]] and [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]], settled on a figure of 3,000 to 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Clements|first= Nicholas|title=Frontier Conflict in Van Diemen's Land (Ph.D. thesis)|year= 2013|publisher= University of Tasmania |pages=324, 325|url= http://eprints.utas.edu.au/17070/2/Whole-Clements-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engaged in [[fire-stick farming]], hunted game including kangaroo and wallabies, caught seals, mutton-birds, shellfish and fish and lived as nine separate "nations" on the island, which they knew as "Trouwunna".

The first reported sighting of Tasmania by a [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]]an was on 24 November 1642 by Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]], who landed at today's Blackmans Bay. More than a century later, in 1772, a French expedition led by [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]] also landed at [[Blackmans Bay, Tasmania|Blackmans Bay]], and the following year [[Tobias Furneaux]] became the first Englishman to land in Tasmania when he arrived at [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania|Adventure Bay]]. Captain [[James Cook]] landed at [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania|Adventure Bay]] in 1777. Matthew Flinders and [[George Bass]] sailed through [[Bass Strait]] in 1798–99, determining for the first time that Tasmania was an island.&lt;ref name="hughes121"&gt;{{Citation | last=Hughes | first = Robert | title = The Fatal Shore  | publisher = Pan | year = 1987 | location = London | isbn = 0-330-29892-5|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sealers and whalers based themselves on Tasmania's islands from 1798,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | page=15| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 1803 [[New South Wales]] Governor [[Philip Gidley King|Philip King]] sent Lieutenant [[John Bowen (colonist)|John Bowen]] to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] in order to forestall any claims to the island by French explorers who had been exploring the southern Australian coastline. Bowen, who led a party of 49, including 21 male and three female convicts, named the camp Risdon.&lt;ref name="hughes121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | page=21| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later a second settlement was established by Captain [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]], with 308 convicts, {{convert|5|km|mi}} to the south in [[Sullivans Cove]] on the western side of the Derwent, where fresh water was more plentiful. The latter settlement became known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, later shortened to [[Hobart]], after the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Secretary]] of the time, [[Lord Hobart]]. The settlement at Risdon was later abandoned. Left on their own without further supplies, the Sullivans Cove settlement suffered severe food shortages and by 1806 its inhabitants were starving, with many resorting to scraping seaweed off rocks and scavenging washed-up whale blubber from the shore to survive.&lt;ref name="hughes121" /&gt;

A smaller colony was established at Port Dalrymple on the Tamar River in the island's north in October 1804 and several other convict-based settlements were established, including the particularly harsh [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] in the southeast and [[Macquarie Harbour]] on the West Coast. Tasmania was eventually sent 75,000 convicts—four out of every ten people transported to [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="hughes121" /&gt; By 1819 the Aboriginal and British population reached parity with about 5000 of each, although among the colonists men outnumbered women four to one.&lt;ref name="parity"&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages= 54–57, 71|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy middle-class free settlers began arriving in large numbers from 1820, lured by the promise of land grants and free convict labour. Settlement in the island's northwest corner was monopolised by the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]], which sent its first surveyors to the district in 1826. By 1830 one-third of Australia's non-Indigenous population lived in Van Diemen's Land and the island accounted for about half of all land under cultivation and exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | pages=140, 145, 202| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black War====
{{main|Black War}}
Tensions between Tasmania's black and white inhabitants rose, partly driven by increasing competition for kangaroo and other game.&lt;ref&gt;

They established farms along the River Derwent and east and west of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], occupying 10 percent of Van Diemen's Land. By 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12,600, while the island's sheep population had reached 200,000. The rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with grazing livestock as well as fences, hedges and stone walls, while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages=58, 62, 66, 74–75|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence began to spiral rapidly from the mid-1820s in what became known as the "[[Black War]]". While black inhabitants were driven to desperation by dwindling food supplies as well as anger at the prevalence of abductions of women and girls, whites carried out attacks as a means of exacting revenge and suppressing the native threat. Van Diemen's Land had an enormous gender imbalance, with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822—and 16 to one among the convict population. Historian Nicholas Clements has suggested the "voracious appetite" for native women was the most important trigger for the explosion of violence from the late 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Clements | first = Nicholas | title = The Black War  |pages=20, 49| publisher = University of Queensland Press | year = 2014 | location = Brisbane | isbn = 978-0-70225-006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Truganini and last 4 tasmanian aborigines.jpg|thumb|upright|Four elderly full-blood [[Tasmanian Aborigines]] c. 1860s. [[Truganini]], for many years claimed to be the last full-blood Aboriginal to survive, is seated at far right.]]
From 1825 to 1828 the number of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among settlers. Over the summer of 1826–7 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and made it clear that they wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826 Governor [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|George Arthur]] issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aborigines when they attacked settlers or their property and in the following eight months more than 200 Aborigines were killed in the Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists. After another eight months the death toll had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages=93–100|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 300 British troops were sent into the Settled Districts, and in November 1828 Arthur declared martial law, giving soldiers the right to shoot on sight any Aboriginal in the Settled Districts. Martial law would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages=101–105, 123|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Clements | first = Nicholas | title = The Black War  |pages=95–101| publisher = University of Queensland Press | year = 2014 | location = Brisbane | isbn = 978-0-70225-006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1830 Arthur organised the so-called "Black Line", ordering every able-bodied male colonist to assemble at one of seven designated places in the Settled Districts to join a massive drive to sweep Aboriginals out of the region and on to the [[Tasman Peninsula]]. The campaign failed and was abandoned seven weeks later, but by then Tasmania's Aboriginal population had fallen to about 300.

====Removal of Aborigines====
After hostilities between settlers and Aboriginals ceased in 1832, almost all of the remnants of the indigenous population were persuaded or forced by government agent [[George Augustus Robinson]] to move to [[Flinders Island, Tasmania|Flinders Island]]. Many quickly succumbed to infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, reducing the population further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages=1199–216|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Clements|first= Nicholas|title=Frontier Conflict in Van Diemen's Land (Ph.D. thesis)|year= 2013|publisher= University of Tasmania |pages=329–331|url= http://eprints.utas.edu.au/17070/2/Whole-Clements-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those removed from Tasmania, the last to die was [[Truganini]], in 1876. The near-destruction of Tasmania's Aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians including [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan and Tom Lawson.&lt;ref name="hughes121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | page=296| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 2012 | pages= xix, 215|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce has claimed that the April 1828 "Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants" sanctioned force against Aboriginals "for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal" and described the decision to remove all Tasmanian Aborigines after 1832—by which time they had given up their fight against white colonists—as an extreme policy position. He concluded: "The colonial government from 1832 to 1838 [[Ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] the western half of Van Diemen's Land and then callously left the exiled people to their fate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | pages=264, 296| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proclamation as a separate colony====

Van Diemen's Land—which thus far had existed as a territory within the colony of [[New South Wales]]—was proclaimed a separate colony, with its own judicial establishment and [[Tasmanian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], on 3 December 1825. Transportation to the island ceased in 1853 and the colony was renamed Tasmania in 1856, partly to differentiate the burgeoning society of free settlers from the island's convict past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | pages=1, 158| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Convict labourers in Australia in the early 20th century.jpg|thumb|A [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] ploughing team breaking up new ground at the farm at Port Arthur.]]The [[Tasmanian Legislative Council|Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land]] drafted a new constitution which it passed in 1854. The following year the [[Privy Council]] approved the colony changing its name from "Van Diemen's Land" to "Tasmania", and in 1856 the newly elected [[bicameral parliament]] sat for the first time, establishing Tasmania as a [[responsible government|self-governing]] colony of the British Empire.

The colony suffered from economic fluctuations, but for the most part was prosperous, experiencing steady growth. With few external threats and strong trade links with the Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually played a [[Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War|significant role]] in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two [[Victoria Cross]]es awarded to Australians.

In 1901 the Colony of Tasmania [[Federation of Australia|united]] with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia. Tasmanians voted in favour of federation with the largest majority of all the Australian colonies.

===Recent history===
The state was badly affected by the [[1967 Tasmanian fires]], in which there was major loss of life and property. In the 1970s the state government announced plans to flood environmentally significant [[Lake Pedder]]. As a result of the eventual flooding of Lake Pedder, the world's first greens party was established; the [[United Tasmania Group]].

In 1975 the [[Tasman Bridge disaster|Tasman Bridge collapsed]] when the bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier ''[[MV Lake Illawarra]]''. It was the only bridge in Hobart, and made crossing the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] by road at the city impossible. The nearest bridge was approximately {{convert|20|km}} to the north, at Bridgewater.

National and international attention surrounded the campaign against the [[Franklin Dam]] in the early 1980s.

On 28 April 1996, in the incident now known as the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]], lone gunman [[Martin Bryant]] shot and killed 35 people (including tourists and residents) and injured 21 others. The use of [[firearm]]s was immediately reviewed, and new gun ownership laws were adopted nationwide, with Tasmania's law one of the strictest in Australia.

In April 2006 the [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] was triggered by a small earthquake. One person was killed and two others were trapped underground for 14 days.

The Tasmanian community has for some time been divided over the issue of the proposed [[Bell Bay Pulp Mill]] to be built in the [[Tamar Valley, Tasmania|Tamar Valley]]. Proponents argue that jobs will be created, while opponents argue that pollution will damage both the Bass Strait fishing industry and local tourism. The company behind the proposal collapsed in 2012 and the pulp mill project officially ended in 2017 when the building permits lapsed.

In January 2011 philanthropist [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] opened the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) in Hobart to international acclaim. Within 12 months, MONA became Tasmania's top tourism attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120501182239/http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/12/30/288361_trips.html MONA takes top billing Trips – The Mercury – The Voice of Tasmania].

Tasmania's landmass of {{convert|68401|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is located directly in the pathway of the notorious "[[Roaring Forties]]" wind that encircles the globe. To its north, it is separated from mainland Australia by [[Bass Strait]]. Tasmania is the only Australian state that is not located on the Australian mainland. Depending on which [[borders of the oceans]] are used, the island can be said to be either surrounded by the Southern Ocean, or to have the Pacific on its east and the Indian to its west. Still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have Tasmania with the [[Great Australian Bight]] to the west, and the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east. It lies at similar latitudes to the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], and parts of [[Patagonia]] in [[South America]].

Tasmania has been volcanically inactive in recent geological times but has many jagged peaks resulting from recent [[Glacial period|glaciation]]. Tasmania is the most mountainous state in Australia. The most mountainous region is the [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Central Highlands]] area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. The [[Midlands (Tasmania)|Midlands]] located in the central east, is fairly flat, and is predominantly used for agriculture, although farming activity is scattered throughout the state. Tasmania's tallest mountain is [[Mount Ossa (Tasmania)|Mount Ossa]] at {{convert|1617|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountain lies in the heart of the world-famous [[Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park]].&lt;ref name="height"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tourtasmania.com/content.php?id=ossa |title=Mt.

The [[Tarkine]], containing [[Savage River National Park]] located in the island's far north west, is the largest [[temperate rainforest]] area in Australia covering about {{convert|3800|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarkine.com.au/ 'About the Tarkine' ''Tarkine: Australia's Largest Temperate Rain forest''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426080629/http://www.tarkine.com.au/ |date=26 April 2012 }}. Retrieved 15 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
With its rugged topography, Tasmania has a great number of rivers. Several of Tasmania's largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide [[hydroelectricity]]. Many rivers begin in the Central Highlands and flow out to the coast. Tasmania's major population centres are mainly situated around [[estuaries]] (some of which are named rivers).

The [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] flows south east and reaches the coast at Hobart; the [[Tamar River]] flows north from Launceston; the [[Mersey River (Tasmania)|Mersey River]] also flows north to the North West Coast at Devonport; the Franklin and Gordon Rivers flow west and meet the coast at [[Strahan, Tasmania|Strahan]]. The [[South Esk River]] is the longest river in Tasmania. It starts in the mountains at [[Fingal]] and flows through [[Avoca, Tasmania|Avoca]], [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]], [[Longford, Tasmania|Longford]], [[Hadspen]] and finally Launceston. The river is dammed at Launceston's [[Trevallyn Dam]] and used for the city's [[hydroelectricity]]. Although most of the water is dammed at Lake Trevallyn, some flows on into the [[Cataract Gorge]], where it becomes a tributary to the Tamar Estuary, and the outflow from the power station also joins the Tamar River downstream of Launceston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/BE97516E2870B5AFCA25710E00756153?opendocument 'Statistics – Tasmania, 2006'], ''Australian Bureau of Statistics''.

===Insularity===
Tasmania's insularity was probably detected by Captain [[Abel Tasman]] when he charted Tasmania's coast in 1642. On 5 December, Tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at [[Eddystone Point]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schilder |first1=Günter |title=Australia unveiled : the share of the Dutch navigators in the discovery of Australia |date=1976 |publisher=Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Ltd. |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9022199975 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by  the [[Roaring Forties]] howling through Banks Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valentyn |first1=Francois |title=Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien |date=1724-1726 |publisher=J. van Braam |location=Dordrecht |isbn=9789051942347 |page=vol.3, p.47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next European to enter the strait was Captain [[James Cook]] in the ''Endeavour'' in April 1770. A talented and diligent hydrographer, Cook quickly identified the strait, but knew he had to conceal it. The [[Admiralty]] had issued its usual instructions to hide strategically important discoveries that could become security risks, such as off-shore islands from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power, at a time of intense [[France–United Kingdom relations|Anglo-French rivalry]].

Consequently, in his journal Cook disguised his discovery with a riddle;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Journals vol.I |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=0851157440 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on his chart he drew a curtain across the truncated channel by sketching a false coastline down to an invented [[Point Hicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=148–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's ploy worked and Tasmania's insularity was suppressed for three more decades, as Europe's mapmakers increasingly depicted it as a [[peninsula]] joined to the mainland.

The age-old question about Tasmania's insularity - 'Is Van Diemen's Land a peninsula or an island?' - was officially resolved in 1798-99 when George Bass and Matthew Flinders circumnavigated the island. When news of their discovery of Bass Strait reached Europe, the French government despatched a reconnaissance expedition commanded by [[Nicolas Baudin]]. This prompted [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] to send two vessels from Sydney to the island to establish a garrison at Hobart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=155–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
[[File:Apple orchard in Tasmania.jpg|thumb|An apple orchard in the "Apple Isle".]]
Despite the presence of some [[Quaternary]] [[glaciation]], Tasmania's soils are not more fertile than those of mainland Australia, largely because most are severely [[leaching (agriculture)|leached]] and the areas with driest climates (least leaching) were unaffected by glaciation or alluvia derived therefrom. Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile [[spodosols]] or [[psamments]], with some even less fertile "lateritic podzolic soils" in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive forestry—which remains one of the state's major industries.

On the north coast, apart from some relatively fertile alluvial soils used for fruit-growing, there are also deep red, easily workable soils known as "krasnozems" ("red land"). These soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively, but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying, beef cattle and fodder crops.

The Midlands and the Lower Derwent present a different story from the rest of the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly [[dolerite]]) parent material, these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as "prairie soils" or "brown earths" and bear some resemblance to the [[chernozem]]s of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available [[phosphorus]] and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.

Tasmania became known as the "Apple Isle" because for many years it was one of the world's major apple producers. Apples are still grown in large numbers, particularly in southern Tasmania, and have the distinction of being the first approved by the Japanese government for import, due to their verifiable pest-free status.&lt;ref name="Why is Tasmania called the 'Apple Isle'"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|title=Centre of the apple universe|accessdate=20 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120115242/https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|archive-date=20 January 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically and genetically isolated, Tasmania is known for its unique flora and fauna. 

====Flora====
Tasmania has [[biodiversity|extremely diverse]] vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen [[eucalypt]] forest, [[alpine climate|alpine]] heathlands and large areas of cool [[temperate rain forest|temperate rainforests]] and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many flora species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of [[Gondwana]], 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

====Fauna====
The island of Tasmania was home to the [[thylacine]], a [[marsupial]] which resembled a [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the [[dingo]], introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The [[Tasmanian devil]] became the [[Largest mammals#Marsupials (Marsupialia)|largest carnivorous marsupial]] in the world following the [[extinction]] of the [[thylacine]] in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, James, 'The social and Environmental impact of the introduction of the dog to Tasmania' in ''Environmental History'' Vol. 11, No. 1 (Jan. 2006), pp. 102–129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
[[File:Hobart moonrise from Mt Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Hobart]], seen here from [[Mount Wellington, Tasmania|Mount Wellington]], is Tasmania's most populous city and comprises a large portion of the state's population.]]
[[File:ABS-3101.0-AustralianDemographicStatistics-EstimatedResidentPopulationStatesTerritories-EstimatedResidentPopulation-Persons-Tasmania-A2060848V.svg|thumb|right|Estimated resident population since 1981]]

Tasmania's population is more homogeneous than that of other states of Australia, with many of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583912/Tasmania Tasmania (island and state, Australia)]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 65% of its residents are descendants of an estimated 10,000 "founding families" from the mid-19th century. {{As of|1996}}, more than 80% of Tasmanians were born in the state and almost 90% were born in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, or Ireland.

Until 2012, Tasmania was the only state in Australia with an above-replacement [[total fertility rate]]; Tasmanian women had an average of 2.24 children each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/australia-had-baby-boom-in-2007-abs-20081028-5ag2.html|title=Australia had baby boom in 2007: ABS|work=The Age|location=Australia|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the birth rate had slipped to 2.1 children per woman, bringing the state to the replacement threshold, but it continues to have the second-highest birth rate of any state or territory (behind the Northern Territory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birth-rate slump in Tasmania linked with tough economic times for families|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/birth-rate-slump-in-tasmania-linked-with-tough-economic-times-for-families/story-fnj4f7k1-1226752410226|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=The Mercury|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Tasmania}}
[[File:CG-ParliamentHouseHobart.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament House, Hobart]]]]

The form of the government of Tasmania is prescribed in its constitution, which dates from 1856, although it has been amended many times since then. Since 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Australian Constitution]] regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government is allowed.

{{Main|List of Governors of Tasmania|l1=Governors of Tasmania|Parliament of Tasmania}}

Tasmania is a State in the Australian federation. Its relationship with the Federal Government and Parliament are regulated by the [[Australian Constitution]]. Tasmania is represented in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitution—the number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone. Tasmania's [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single Transferable Vote|Hare-Clark]].

===Elections===
At the [[Tasmanian state election, 2002|2002 state election]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] won 14 of the 25 House seats. The people decreased their vote for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]];  representation in the Parliament fell to seven seats. The [[Tasmanian Greens|Greens]] won four seats, with over 18% of the popular vote, the highest proportion of any Green party in any parliament in the world at that time.

&lt;!---kind of long and "who cares anymore". Premiers can be listed, then "hid." Smoking thing kind of interesting----&gt;
On 23 February 2004 the Premier [[Jim Bacon]] announced his retirement, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. In his last months he opened a vigorous anti-smoking campaign which included many restrictions on where individuals could smoke, such as pubs. He died four months later. Bacon was succeeded by [[Paul Lennon]], who, after leading the state for two years, went on to win the [[Tasmanian state election, 2006|2006 state election]] in his own right. Lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by [[David Bartlett]], who formed a coalition government with the Greens after the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 state election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. Bartlett resigned as Premier in January 2011 and was replaced by [[Lara Giddings]], who became Tasmania's first female Premier.  In March 2014 [[Will Hodgman]]'s Liberal Party won government, ending sixteen years of Labor governance, and ending an eight-year period for Hodgman himself as [[Leader of the Opposition (Tasmania)|Leader of the Opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-27/tasmanian-liberals-secure-15-seats-as-election-count-ends/5350000|title=Tasmanian Liberals secure 15 seats as election count ends|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 March 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgman then won a second term of government in the recent [[Tasmanian state election, 2018|2018 state election]].

===Politics===
Tasmania has a number of undeveloped regions. Proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity, or opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world's first [[green party]], the [[United Tasmania Group]].&lt;ref name="Lake Pedder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lake%20Pedder.htm|title=Lake Pedder|accessdate=6 March 2010|last=Davies|first=Lynn|year=2006|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lake Pedder" /&gt;

In the early 1980s the state debated the proposed [[Franklin Dam|Franklin River Dam]]. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to [[old growth]] logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.

===Local government===
Tasmania has 29 [[Local government areas of Tasmania|local government areas]]. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.

As with the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]], Tasmania's local government elections use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single transferable vote|Hare–Clark]]. Local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]] by full [[postal ballot]]. The next local government elections will be held during September and October 2018.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Tasmania}}
[[File:WesternTasmania1865.jpg|thumb|[[West Coast, Tasmania|Western Tasmania]] and [[South West Tasmania]] with natural resources on 1865 map]]
[[File:Tasmanian salmon on a pea and corn fritter.jpg|thumb|Smoked Tasmanian salmon. Tasmania is a large exporter of seafood, particularly [[salmon]].]]

Traditionally, Tasmania's main industries have been mining (including copper, [[zinc]], [[tin]], and iron), agriculture, forestry, and tourism. In the 1940s and 1950s, a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by [[Hydro Tasmania]]. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time. The state also has a large number of food exporting sectors, including but not limited to seafood (such as [[Atlantic salmon]], [[abalone]] and [[crayfish]]).

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |title=Industry Info page |publisher=Fruit Growers Tasmania |accessdate=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224809/http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, [[saffron]], [[pyrethrum]] and [[cherry|cherries]] have been fostered by the [[Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research]].

Favourable economic conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new ''Spirit of Tasmania'' ferries have all contributed to what is now a rising tourism industry.

About 1.7% of the Tasmanian population are employed by local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local Government and Southern Tasmanian Economy|author=Eslaka, Saul |date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major employers include [[Nyrstar]], [[Norske Skog]], Grange Resources, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major employers campaign to boost their public profile|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/major-employers-campaign-to-boost-their-public-profile/story-fnj4f7k1-1226765643507|accessdate=4 April 2015|publisher=The Mercury|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hobart]], and [[Federal Group]]. Small business is a large part of the community life, including [[Incat]], [[Moorilla Estate]] and [[Tassal]]. In the late 1990s, a number of national companies based their call centres in the state after obtaining cheap access to broad-band fibre optic connections.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

34% of Tasmanians are reliant on welfare payments as their primary source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Clean, green and leaning on the mainland |first=Matthew |last= Denholm |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/clean-green-and-leaning-on-the-mainland/story-fn59niix-1226035870147 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=Sydney, Australia |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is in part due to the large number of older residents and retirees in Tasmania receiving Age Pensions. Due to its natural environment and clean air, Tasmania is a common retirement selection for Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanrahan |first1=Danielle |title=11 best places to retire in Australia |url=https://www.oversixty.com.au/finance/retirement-income/2014/08/11-best-places-to-retire-in-australia/ |website=oversixty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Cuisine===
{{See also|Tasmanian wine}}
During colonial times the cuisines of the British Isles were the standard in most areas of Tasmania. Tasmania now has a wide range of restaurants, in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns. Scattered across Tasmania are many vineyards,&lt;ref name="goway"&gt;[http://www.goway.com/downunder/australia/tasmania/tas_wine_intro.html "Tasmania Food &amp; Wine."] [http://www.goway.com/ Goway.com]. Retrieved July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tasmanian beer brands such as [[Boags]] and [[Cascade Brewery|Cascade]] are known and sold in Mainland Australia. [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] off the northwestern coast of Tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses&lt;ref name="goway"/&gt; and dairy products. Tasmanians are also consumers of seafood,&lt;ref name="goway"/&gt; such as [[crayfish]], [[orange roughy]], [[salmon (food)|salmon]]&lt;ref name="goway"/&gt; and [[oyster]]s,&lt;ref name="goway"/&gt; both farmed and wild.

===Events===
{{Main|List of events in Tasmania}}

To foster tourism, the state government encourages or supports several annual events in and around the island. The best known of these is the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], starting on [[Boxing Day]] in Sydney and usually arriving at [[Constitution Dock]] in Hobart around three to four days later, during the [[Taste of Tasmania]], an annual food and wine festival. Other events include the [[rally racing|road rally]] [[Targa Tasmania]] which attracts rally drivers from around the world and is staged all over the state, over five days. Rural or regional events include [[Agfest]], a three-day [[agricultural show]] held at [[Carrick, Tasmania|Carrick]] (just west of Launceston) in early May and the [[Royal Hobart Show]] and [[Royal Launceston Show]], both held in October annually. Music events held in Tasmania include the [[Falls Festival]] at [[Marion Bay, Tasmania|Marion Bay]] (a [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] event now held in both Victoria and Tasmania on New Year's Eve), the [[Festival of Voices]], a national celebration of song held each year in Hobart attracting international and national teachers and choirs in the heart of Winter, [[MS Fest]] is a charity music event held in Launceston, to raise money for those with [[multiple sclerosis]]. The Cygnet Folk Festival is one Australia's most iconic folk music festivals and is held every year in January, the Tasmanian Lute Festival is an early music event held in different locations in Tasmania every two years. Recent additions to the state arts events calendar include the [[10 Days on the Island]] arts festival, [[MONA FOMA]], run by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and curated by [[Brian Ritchie]] and [[Dark MOFO]] also run by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and curated by Leigh Carmichael.

The biennial ''Tasmanian Living Artists' Week'' is a ten-day statewide festival for Tasmania's visual artists. The fourth festival in 2007 involved more than 1000 artists. Tasmania is home to two winners of the prestigious [[Archibald Prize]]—[[Jack Carington Smith]] in 1963 for a portrait of Professor [[James McAuley]], and [[Geoffrey Dyer]] in 2003 for his portrait of [[Richard Flanagan]]. Photographers [[Olegas Truchanas]] and [[Peter Dombrovskis]] are known for works that became iconic in the [[Lake Pedder]] and [[Franklin Dam]] conservation movements. English-born painter [[John Glover (artist)|John Glover]] (1767–1849) is known for his paintings of Tasmanian landscapes. The [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) opened in January 2011 at the [[Moorilla Estate]] in [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]],&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Danielle (27 March 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201426/http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/03/27/217761_tasmania-news.html MONA puts Tassie on map], ''The Mercury''.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest privately owned museum complex in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/travel/shock-of-the-old-and-new-20110110-19khn.html Shock of the old and new], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hobart International Airport]].]]

===Air===
Tasmania's main air carriers are [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Virgin Australia]]; [[Qantas]], [[QantasLink]] and [[Regional Express Airlines]] have services from Tasmania. These airlines fly direct routes to [[Brisbane]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland|the Gold Coast]], Melbourne and Sydney. Major airports include [[Hobart International Airport]] (which has not had a regular scheduled international passenger service since the 1990s) and [[Launceston Airport]]; the smaller airports, [[Burnie Airport|Burnie]] (Wynyard) and [[King Island Airport|King Island]], serviced by Regional Express; and [[Devonport Airport|Devonport]], serviced by QantasLink; have services to [[Melbourne Airport|Melbourne]]. Intra-Tasmanian air services are offered by [[Airlines of Tasmania]]. Until 2001 [[Ansett Australia]] operated majorly out of Tasmania to 12 destinations nationwide.

===Antarctica base===
Tasmania — Hobart in particular — serves as Australia's chief sea link to Antarctica, with the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] located in [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]]. Hobart is also the home port of the French ship ''l'Astrolabe'', which makes regular supply runs to the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands|French Southern Territories]] near and in Antarctica.

===Road===
[[File:Bridgewater Bridge, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|right|Bridgewater Bridge]]
Within the state, the primary form of transport is by road. Since the 1980s, many of the [[List of highways in Tasmania|state's highways]] have undergone regular upgrades. These include the Hobart [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]], Launceston Southern Outlet, [[Bass Highway (Tasmania)|Bass Highway]] reconstruction, and the [[Huon Highway]]. Public transport is provided by [[Metro Tasmania]] bus services, regular taxis and Hobart only&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drive or Ride with Uber in Hobart {{!}} Uber |url=https://www.uber.com/en-AU/cities/hobart/ |website=www.uber.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; UBER  ride-share services within urban areas, with [[Redline Coaches]], [[Tassielink Transit]] and Callows Coaches providing bus service between population centres.

===Rail===
[[Rail transport in Tasmania]] consists of narrow-gauge lines to all four major population centres and to mining and forestry operations on the west coast and in the northwest. Services are operated by [[TasRail (2009)|TasRail]]. Regular passenger train services in the state ceased in 1977; the only scheduled trains are for freight, but there are tourist trains in specific areas, for example the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] and the [[Ida Bay Railway]]. There is an [[Riverline (Hobart)|ongoing proposal]] to reinstate commuter trains to Hobart. This idea however lacks political motivation.

===Shipping===

[[File:Spirit of Tasmania Port Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[MS Spirit of Tasmania II|Spirit of Tasmania]]'' links the island with mainland Australia.]]

The port of Hobart is the second deepest natural port in the world, second to only [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} There is a substantial amount of commercial and recreational shipping within the harbour and the port regularly hosts Cruise ships and occasionally military vessels. Burnie and Devonport on the northwest coast host ports and several other coastal towns host either small fishing ports or substantial marinas. The domestic sea route between Tasmanian and the mainland is serviced by [[Bass Strait]] passenger/vehicle ferries operated by the Tasmanian government-owned [[TT-Line (Australia)|TT-Line (Tasmania)]]. The state is also home to [[Incat]], a manufacturer of very high-speed aluminium catamarans that regularly broke records when they were first launched. The state government tried using them on the Bass Strait run but eventually decided to discontinue the run because of concerns over viability and the suitability of the vessels for the extreme weather conditions sometimes experienced in the strait.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Sport==
{{Main|Sport in Tasmania}}
[[File:One-day Cricket Australia vs England, Bellerive Oval, January 2011 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bellerive Oval]] at night, during the [[one-day cricket]] Australia vs England.]]

Sport is an important pastime in Tasmania, and the state has produced several famous sportsmen and women and also hosted several major sporting events. The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team represents the state successfully (for example the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 2007, 2011 and 2013) and plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart; which is also the home ground for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. In addition, Bellerive Oval regularly hosts international cricket matches. Famous Tasmanian cricketers include [[David Boon]] and former Australian captain [[Ricky Ponting]].

[[Australian Rules Football]] is also popularly followed, with frequent discussion of a proposed [[Tasmanian AFL Bid|Tasmanian team]] in the Australian Football League ([[Australian Football League|AFL]]). Several AFL games have been played at [[York Park|Aurora Stadium]], Launceston, including the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] and {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, at the Bellerive Oval with the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] playing 3 home games there. The stadium was the site of an infamous match between [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] which was [[AFL siren controversy, 2006|controversially drawn]] after the umpires failed to hear the final siren.

[[Rugby League Football]] is also played in the area, with the highest level of football played is in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]] competition. The most successful team is the Hobart Tigers winning the title three times.

[[Rugby Union]] is also played in Tasmania and is governed by the [[Tasmanian Rugby Union]]. Ten clubs take part in the statewide Tasmanian Rugby Competition.

Association football (soccer) is played throughout the state, including a proposed [[Tasmania United FC|Tasmanian A-League Club]] and an existing statewide league called the [[National Premier Leagues Tasmania|NPL Tasmania]].

Tasmania hosts the professional [[Moorilla Hobart International|Moorilla International]] tennis tournament as part of the lead up to the Australian Open and is played at the [[Hobart International Tennis Centre]], Hobart.

The [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] is an annual event starting in Sydney, NSW, on Boxing Day and finishing in Hobart, Tasmania. It is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/sailing/1721104.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tough legacy of a Sydney classic | date=29 December 2001 | accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the other sports played and barracked for have grown in popularity, others have declined. For example, in basketball Tasmania has not been represented in the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] since the demise of the [[Hobart Devils]] in 1996.

'''''The Last Summer of Reason''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Le Dernier Été de la raison'''}}) is a novel by [[Algeria]]n writer [[Tahar Djaout]]. It was originally written and published in [[French language|French]]. The English translation was produced by [[Marjolijn de Jagar]], and published by [[Ruminator Press]] in 2001, with a foreword by [[Wole Soyinka]]. The novel was published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]].

==Plot==

Boualem Yekker is a bookseller in a country probably modelled on Algeria. His home is firmly in the grip of religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], but only recently: it was once a republic, but now it is a "Community in the Faith". Djaout presents readers with a terrifying world of religious fundamentalism comparable to [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s 1984, but substituting a religious dictatorship for a purely political one.

At first Yekker is only on the periphery of danger. He is "neither elegant nor talented", which puts him out of the spotlight: "what is persecuted above all, and more than people's opinions, is their ability to create and propagate beauty." Still, Yekker is a purveyor of these outrageous "idea- and beauty-filled objects" known as books, so he doesn't fit in too well in this new, retrograde society.

Business isn't exactly booming, of course. Touchingly Djaout describes Yekker's brief moments of hope when he sees people gazing in the shop window. But there is hardly a market for the sorts of books he has any longer. One acquaintance, Ali Elbouliga, still comes to while away time there. Otherwise, Yekker remains largely alone in his bookish world—and the books ultimately prove almost as much a burden as a solace.

Family life also gets more complicated when his daughter turns on him. "The illness of fanaticism had attacked her." She is transformed, "covered with superior certainties".

Yekker tries to continue to live his life in the manner he is accustomed to, but there is no escape from the encroaching fanaticism. It crushes all opposition. Any semblance of rationality is done away with. Even weather forecasts are banned, as if these called some all-mighty's grand plan (and his power) into question. (What a pathetic god it must be they're protecting, if he can be threatened by mortals' barely educated guesses at tomorrow's weather; doesn't the fact that the meteorologists barely ever get it right instead reinforce the idea of divine omnipotence?)

Imagination is dulled, "the world has become aphasic, opaque, and sullen; it is wearing mourning clothes." Books "constitute the safest refuge against this world of horror" all around Yekker, but the books are also a danger to him. Eventually they must make place for "the one, the irremovable Book of resigned certainty."

The threats against Yekker mount. What is, at first, almost harmless child's play intensifies to very real danger. Might conquers right:

They have understood the danger in words, all the words they cannot manage to domesticate and anesthetize. For words, put end to end, bring doubt and change. Words above all must not conceive of the utopia of another form of truth, of unsuspected paths, of another place of thought.

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

'''USNS ''Henry J. Kaiser'' (T-AO-187)''' is a [[United States Navy]] [[replenishment oiler]] and the [[lead ship]] of [[Henry J. Kaiser class oiler|her class]]. She is operated by [[Military Sealift Command]] and therefore has a "USNS" prefix for [[United States Naval Ship]]. She is named for [[Henry J. Kaiser]] (1882–1967), an [[United States|American]] [[industrialist]] and [[shipbuilder]].

==Construction and delivery==
''Henry J. Kaiser'' was laid down by [[Avondale Shipyard]], Inc., in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], on 22 August 1984 and launched on 5 October 1985. She was the lead ship of the ''Henry J. Kaiser'' class of fleet replenishment oilers. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service with the [[Military Sealift Command]] on 19 December 1986.

==Service history==
{{Expand section|history for 1986-2005|date=January 2010}}
Following delivery, the ''Henry J. Kaiser'' operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, as part of the Second Fleet. In 1995, she was forward deployed to [[Diego Garcia]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] as part of the pre-positioning fleet. In 2002, she was transferred to the Third Fleet and placed in reduced operating status in Portland, Oregon. She was activated briefly in 2003 when two other oilers were simultaneously undergoing planned maintenance. In 2005, she was re-activated to full service as part of the Third Fleet, where she remains to this day.
[[Image:oiler2394.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Henry J. Kaiser in San Francisco Dry Dock, November 2014]]{{clear left}}

==Great Green Fleet==
During [[RIMPAC]] 2012, Kaiser delivered 900,000 gallons of a 50-50 blend of advanced [[biofuel]]s and traditional petroleum-based fuel to the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier [[USS Nimitz|USS ''Nimitz'']] (CVN 68) strike group. The fuel delivery is part of the Navy's [[Great Green Fleet]] demonstration, which allows the Navy to test, evaluate and demonstrate the cross-platform utility and functionality of advanced biofuels in an operational setting. This will achieve one of the five energy goals established by Secretary of the Navy [[Ray Mabus]], to demonstrate a Great Green Fleet in local operations by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/usns-henry-j-kaiser-delivers-biofuel-for-rimpac-s-great-green-fleet-demo|title=USNS Henry J.
